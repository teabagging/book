I also have listened to the Abridged audio book and it was good also. The book is much better primarily because it has far more depth.Atlas Shrugged is the best book I have ever read. I strongly recommend you read this book. It seems overwhelming in size and substance, but once you get into it, you will not want to put it down. It will challenge your beliefs. It will frighten you when you think about how Ayn Rand knew 57 years ago what would happen to us if we followed the collectivist mentality, and then you realize where our country now is headed.

I was looking for a good book to read, and I stumbled upon the most epic story of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book and felt like it applied to me, completely. My husband and I are close to and have been, in the past, in the highest tax bracket. His sister lives in one of our rental houses for a discount... I am an attorney and would be self-employed but for the 50% tax burden. Wake up America! Punish the sucessful and fail the people who seek employment! There were so many lines I read aloud to my family members, that would listen, it was almost tragic. I bought 8 copies and gave them to any of my friends who would accept it. Please take the time to read this book and then read it again. It is ironic, my husband and I pay $50,000 to the federal government in taxes a year, yet struggle to pay college tuition for our own children! Of course we do not qualify for aid, yet I send other people's children to college, but cannot afford to send my own. Where is the equailty in that?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \\"We the living\\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought.It is only fitting that it should be available on the Kindle and mayby one day will be a movie.

Rand espouses objectivism as a philosophy and that is well and good as far as it goes. The book is long and is interesting as are its predictions of what the world could become from her period's point of view. Objectivism has much to recommend it and her thesis that business should be 'unshackled' to do as it will falls short with the realization of how industry has often polluted the areas where industry has been allowed to operate unhampered. Her ethic needs to be updated as the results of industrial processes and pollution are often all around us. The point may be that Rand's objectivism needs to meet the reality of ecology."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Dear Fellow's :I would credit Mr.Tom Friedman, with his phrase, \\"The world is FLAT\\".To think deeply about what is expressed in\\"Atlas Shrugged \\"one needs to put it in context.Our 21st century will present enormous challenges .Sincerely, J.Krupa."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think everybody of our time needs to read this.

Those of us who have read it have a responsibility to inform others and gently goad them into seeing for themselves what Ayn Rand has accomplished with this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Dear fellow readers (past, present and future), it's funny that most 5 star ratings talk about personnel positive experiences whilst the 1 stars usually blame others for being naive or stupid - now, what is this telling us? 1. My emotional reaction was very much like the one described by sheryle on Sep.14 - I felt like finally having found an intellectual home, like having my personal thoughts and feelings described in the best possible way. 2. Interestingly most reviews are from the US, the country that was built on principles very close to the principles of the heroes in Atlas Shrugged. Remember, very few constitutions grant a right to the pursuit of happiness. This is the fundamental reason why the US is where it is today. In Europe it is almost impossible to buy Ayn Rands books, whilst in the US she is a household name. Look at some recent happenings in Europe: Miners in Romania go on strike for better living conditions; France is limiting weekly work hours by law (and enforces compliance with police) to create more jobs; Germany is denying the right to open your store whenever you want and how long you want to protect 'the holy Sunday'. The list could go on and on, just open the newspaper. Could there be a connection? 3. No matter how you rate the book - for me it was, is and probably will be forever the most important book of my life - Ayn Rand achieves two wonderful things. First, it's one of the rare and probably best examples of philosophy written in plain common language. Clear ideas clearly and understandably expressed and not hidden behind an artificial scientific code. This finally takes philosophy out of the intellectual debate and makes it conceivable (and entertaining) for everyone. Second, and even more important, the book demonstrates the influence of philosophical ideas and principles on society and on personal everyday life. Therefore, no matter if you agree or disagree with the principles, if you like or dislike the plot and the characters, the book gets you thinking. The book does not request blind acceptance. Indeed, I think this would be dead against the key principles of it. Instead, it gives you one set of principles and then urges you to use your brain to come to your own conclusions. This is more than most books can claim. I would be happy to get direct responses on this subject."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"the book was written all those years ago but it is so true even today. I just wish there was some John Galt in the present era who could come to our rescue."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"No book has touched my soul like the way &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; did. As I traveled back in time, I realized that my innermost and most-kept philosophy has been put into words by Ayn Rand years before I was even born and she couldn't have put it more aptly. Moreover, this is the only book which has made me assess my own philosophy and principles and I discovered that somewhere, somehow, I was more like the character of James Taggart, emotional and sentimental. But as I plunged deeper into understanding myself I realized that I am Hank Rearden in many ways. I have actually been in many, similar situations with Mr. Rearden. Yes, this book has awakened me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It was one of the most absorbing books I have ever read (this is the only criteria I use in 'rating' fiction). It was too long, and some (not all as some people claim) of the characters were two dimensonial, but it was still a great book. It has not and will not change my life. I am not, and do not wish to be, a member of any of any Objectivest cult. I fell it necessary to make these personal statements because many of the reviews of this book seem to be philisophically based. The 1 Star ratings in particular seem to be motivated by factors having nothing to do with literary merit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Hinduism describes phases of life--gratification of the self in youth, the quest for power and productivity in middle age, and the search for truth as one gets older. Hermann Hesse, Dostoevsky, Lawrence--these are the authors of youth. Ayn Rand speaks to those of us of more seasoned years, who produce the goods and services that keep society afloat. It is a novel based in philosophy--but don't let that scare you. She makes her point, in fabulous prose, while weaving a great mystery and love story. It is a book for those who love a well turned phrase, who want to escape into a great novel, who want to understand the problems of today's entitlement laden society. Ayn Rand--who fled the reality of Bolshievik Russia,learned English as a second language, and herself learned of capitalism the hard way to rise from rags to riches and fame--has truly written a book for our times."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged has got to be the best book I have ever read. I have always held a certain set of beliefs for as far back as I can remember. There has always been certain qualities about people that I believe to be evil, and it wasn't until reading Atlas Shrugged that I was able to put a finger on it. I have lived overseas (Turkey) and started working when I was 12. Turkey is a nation where the principle of &quot;if you don't work, you don't eat&quot; is a reality. There is no entitlement mentality in Turkey and I believe that America could take a lesson from that. The business/financial structure that Turkey operates under is like ours, only with fewer regulations. It wasn't until I returned to the States that I started to see what things were really like in this country. While other boys my age were spending their after-school time playing sports, chasing girls, and getting in trouble, I was working in the real world learning about how a business operates and how to make something of myself. More kids need that experience. If we're worried about our children, we need to quit pampering them and treat them like adults. I have had to work hard for everything that I have today and I highly resent people who would dare to ask me to apologize for what I have today. Like Hank Rearden, I am proud of every penny that I have worked for, and I apologize to nobody. I can certainly identify with some of the characters in this novel. I would also recommend this novel for anyone who is concerned about the future of mankind and of our nation."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A truly incredible novel! An inspiration to all those who oppose dictatorship, slavery (service to others as the sole justification to one's existence) and all forms of collectivism.This book is excellent ammunition against contemporary intellectual &quot;mystics&quot; who preach that an individual's life, work and identity are the property of the &quot;group&quot;- whether a race, class, state, or religion etc. and that self sacrifice,( the surrender of that which you value in favour of that which you do not value), is the moral ideal.If you beleive that &quot;the political definition of a free society is the absence of physical coercion&quot; and support the concept of man as an heroic being,(with his own happiness and productive acheivement as the moral purpose of his life, neither sacrificing himself to others nor others to himself), then this book is an essential read!D S A Murray"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You'll love it. Or you'll hate it. You'll feel exhaulted or you'll wish to strangle Ayn Rand and any &amp; everyone who enjoys her writing. This is a book that will shake you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's been said that this book's sales fall into second place just behind the Bible, and it first came out in 1957... It's a long book (1,168 pages), but well worth it..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the greatest books of all time, but, like some other great books such as the Bible or the Koran, it is not for everyone. It is serious stuff for serious people.In the first place, you have to be of an intellectual bent to take it in and enjoy doing so. If you crave sit-coms to stimulate your brain, forget it!Secondly, you have to be comfortable with unbridled rationality, as well as having some things you always believed turned upside down.The concepts in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" are neither difficult to understand nor veiled in symbolism. Ms. Rand makes her message abundantly clear. However, there are people disposed by nature, upbringing, education, intellect or whatever who can fearlessly accept, or at least contemplate, tough rational thinking like hers, and others who cannot. For example, atheists see no reason to believe there is life after to death, and they fearlessly accept it. Conversely, other people, probably the great majority, draw back in horror from such rationality. They turn to faith-based truth, such as the existence of heaven. For the former group, the rationalists, this book presents a confirming, fascinating, even joyfull philosophy about the true nature of mankind, and who its heroes are. It will change how they view what happens in the world. But for the latter group, \\"Atlas\\" may be a disturbing, even hateful book that they will not want to believe because it may conflict with their faith-based truth.Ms. Rand's basic tenet is that every man and woman is born free, and no one has any claim of ownership on any part of their soul, mind, body nor the fruits of their productive effort. If you are a true believer in freedom, you will appreciate and feel at home with this idea. You will cheer for the book's heroes and feel revulsion for their enemies. In fact, this book may determine the depth of one's understanding of freedom. Many readers may squirm, surprised to recognize their own philosophy as being similar to the \\"collectivists,\\" who are the book's villains. If you believe everyone is born indebted by obligations to family or society or the government or a supernatural power, etc., then you do not believe we are born free. This book will thrust you into a foreign and frightening landscape that you will not enjoy. You will want to make your escape and forget what you saw.Many people criticize the quality of writing and the long winded speaches in \\"Atlas\\" (one lulu goes on for 100 pages), but that misses the point. Ms.Rand said she was a philosopher, not a novelist. \\"Atlas\\" is not her attempt to write a great novel, per se. Instead, her purpose was to write down her philosophy using the novel as medium, in much the same way Plato wrote \\"The Republic\\" in the form of conversations. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is not light entertainment, to be sure. It is heavy, thought provoking, life changing philosophy that Ms.Rand makes easier to digest by putting it in the form of a pretty good story. If you want simple amusement, read something else. But if you have the desire and courage to cast off your mental and moral chains and truly understand human freedom, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" will enlighten you like nothing you have ever read before nor will ever read again."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Five stars for story, plot, and character development. This is a great book that is worth your valuable reading time. I think every candidate for office this year should read it - twice! It deals communism and socialism a death blow from which they will never recover.I am not saying I agree with this \\"objectivism\\" philosophy. I was left wondering what to do with those people in society who cannot provide for themselves (invalids, elderly, special needs, etc.) I don't think that the author dealt with that, except that I got the feeling those folks would be on their own.Also, not all giants of industry got there because they were the smartest and hardest working - some go there for very different reasons.That said, I'm reviewing the book, not the author's philosophy. Despite the size, the book is riveting, will make you think and change your life (hopefully!)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The metaphor of Atlas should be used for the topics that Ayn Rand chose to write about. Her books make every woman or man think about their potential. Society is challenging and Rand paints a picture of people who face the challenges and succeed. There are a few books that I believe everyone should read within their lifetimes and Rands work (collectively) are among them. These books will challenge your views of society, politicts and potential."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a classic of the caliber of Dostoevsky and Hugo but is set in modern 20th century. I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the genius of the author which was apparent with the turning of each page, and absorbing her thought-provoking ideas in subjects ranging from sex to capitalism. Whilst the plot was complex and the themes ran deep, Ayn Rand is definitely a story-teller in the true sense of the word, as I was kept spellbound right to the end of the 1000+ pages. Atlas Shrugged is essential reading for anyone who loves genuinely unique stories that are superbly plotted and is deeply serious about philosophical questions relating to human life, morals and society."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I will be honest ~~ the entire month it took me to read this, I didn't know if I was going to be able to finish it ~~ with all the snow days, my children has been home the entire month and that severely limited my reading time (and this is not counting their sick days on top of that!). This book is definitely not what you might consider a fluffy reading or even entertaining. It's too dense of a topic just to pick up and leave down after a few pages ~~ no, you have to read it as much of it at one time in order not to get confused. I finished it much to my relief and have mixed feelings about it. But I read it.I first heard of Ayn Rand in college twenty some years ago. I read \\"The Fountainhead\\" when I was 21 and it bored me to tears. Literally. My ex-boyfriend was enthralled with her writing and her philosophy ~~ whereas I was just bored to death by it. This past fall, my book club had a discussion about her books and they challenged me to read it for our bookclub discussion. I am proud to say that I finished it AND learned something from it ... it is definitely a very challenging book in more ways than one. I wasn't ready to read her when I was 21. Now that I am older and hopefully more astute to different things in life ~~ this book was read in the \\"right time\\" of my life (in spite of sick kids ...).I won't get into a discussion about her philosophy here ~~ but it is a very compelling book, written in a way to support her arguments, however, that can be confusing especially since this book can use some serious editing (I thought it took too long to get to the point and the suspense was killing me as she really did build up to it ...) ~~ it was redundant in a lot of places, and there was at least fifty pages that I will have to read again since it was too condensed in thoughts and philosophy ~~ it literally put me to sleep. The last fifty pages were the easiest to read in the entire book and probably has the most action. I kept getting the idea that her characters were posing as if they're in the 50s movies ... from her descriptions of them.Would I read this book again? Maybe. In another forty years or so. Do I regret reading this book? No. Never. Would I recommend this book to anyone? Yes, I would. It's a keeper in my personal library because I want my sons to read it when they're older. Do I agree with everything she said? Not everything but she does make good and strong cases for her arguments. Was it well-written? It depends on what you think \\"well-written\\" means. I thought the story was compelling enough to keep me reading it, even when it was hard to read. I am not talking about her ideas being hard to take, it's her writing style as it was so repetitive in so many places. Would I consider this a classic? Yes, I would. One thing, authors don't write like her anymore. Secondly, it's a challenge to read something like this, and thirdly, she makes you think.If you see this book and want to read it but too scared of the number of pages it entails, please remember, a mom of two preschoolers in the middle of winter read this book and survived. =0) It was a personal challenge to read this book and learn from it (I cannot wait now for the discussion!) ~~ and it definitely changed my mind on a lot of things, a lot of things I haven't considered since the good old college days. This book is definitely a thinking person's book. Enjoy it!3-1-07"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You strip away the near-future context, the industrial and economic downfall, the politics, and the fifty-page speeches, and what do you get? Actually, you still get a pretty good story, of creative inspiration, intellectualism, love and success. Frankly, 'Atlas Shrugged' is not the wicked capitalist propaganda that almost all its detractors call it; and even then, so WHAT if it's pro-capitalist? Is that really such a tragic idea? America wouldn't be half of what it is today without freedom and opportunity, and for that, most of us should be thankful.Besides, Ayn Rand said so herself (I'm paraphrasing here) that she never even meant for 'Atlas Shrugged' to be 'realistic' necessarily, but rather a story of life and human beings as they 'ought to be'-- which is therefore, by definition, a 'romantic' tale, or an idealised vision of modern life. I never understand those who mock Rand's writing, characters, themes, etc. as being flat or fanciful...I think that was the point! I mean honestly, who expresses their rational thoughts on the value of money, in ordinary conversation, in gigantic, poetic speeches? NO ONE! So there.In case you haven't noticed, I am recommending this book. 'Atlas Shrugged' is a lot of things, but it's not frivolous. The very fact that it was published and continues to sell well (plus the whole 'Brangelina' movie deal) is proof positive, in Rand's view, that there are indeed men in the world like her heroes who exist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My father recommended this book long ago. He said, \\"You will never look at government the same way again after reading this book.\\" It does have flaws in Ayn Rand's total belief in her philosophy. However, look at the crumbling of the infrastructure portrayed in the book; does this look familiar today? It does to me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Reading this book changed my life. It made me understand the power of ideas, and why they burn books to prevent the dissemination of powerful ideas.This book is about power: political power, financial power, and personal power. It is an instruction manual for effectively wielding personal power and integrity in life. It is unfortunately utopian in some ideals, for example in the belief that corporate America is honest enough to sustain unregulated capitalism.I hear that corrupt executives are using this book to justify raping employees, customers and stockholders - that's kind of like twisting the Bible to say it condones slavery. Hank Reardon or Ellis Wyatt were in it for the long haul - a lifelong company bearing their name that would be known for its integrity as well as profitability. They would not have risked the reputation of their company to rape the state of California for short term profits, nor used their insider knowledge to sell out their employees for a quick buck."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged has sat on my bookshelf for eight years while I picked it up, put it down, picked it up.....etc.Finally, in January of 2004, I decided to read the book which bears the inscription 'To my son, Happy Birthday, 1996'There are so many plot-lines, so many characters, so many situations to encapsulate, but...with so many reviews available, I think I will just stick to a few main likes/dislikes of this book.Likes: First off; the ability of Ms. Rand to give her characters voices that reflected a decidedly UN-popular viewpoint, that of the individual, or the underdog, in regards to business, politics, and romance. Second; the fact that these characters remained true to their beliefs throughout the story. Even when the going got tough, the tough stuck to their guns. Though the story feels a little dated at times, due to limited technology at the time of writing compared with the modern world...the story is compelling as you witness the fortunes and disasters of most of the principal characters. By keeping them 'true', Ms. Rand also kept them interesting and consistent.Dislikes: The 'good guys' in the story are meant to represent the author's own viewpoints, and it reads a little self-centered to have them be the 'good guys' in the story, and anyone who goes against these beliefs is painted as a villain. In an attempt, perhaps, to air many, many political, social, and economic beliefs and remorses; the author goes out of her way to make the 'white hats' stark white, and the 'black hats' blacker than a starless night.The story centers on the rise and fall of certain businesses and their owners as the Government seeks to control production and output, and regulate tax breaks and special considerations for those in their favor, under the guise of 'public protection and benevolence'....its easy to see, while reading this book, where Ms. Rand's affiliation lays.The heroine of the tale, while a strong and formidable woman, loses her credibility, at least to me, in certain actions she takes. While supposed to be a 'good guy'...I found some of her actions suspect, and the author seemingly trying to cover that with justification. And though I enjoyed Dagney Taggart as a character...somehow I found myself unable to root for her very often as the victor of any conflict she was engaged in.However...this is an enjoyable story, if you don't mind the length. At 1200 pages, this was quite a time investment for me...and while it was time well spent, with an intersting and capable author, who did have a lot of valuable things to say...its not for the faint of heart to try and lug a book of this weight around for the length of time it takes to read it.Four stars for voice, content, and the ability to keep a 1200 page story interesting and well-paced."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was good because it said something. It had a purpose. We may attach good or bad attributes to that purpose, but in the end it had a point. If something doesn't have a purpose then it is pointless and of no concequence. But, this book did have a purpose and therefore it was a good book. I would recommend it to anybody who seeks a purpose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is probably the best book I have ever read, and I read a lot of good books. I agree with others who suggest that you read her other books first. Start off with We the Living,which is a pretty short book, move on to Fountainhead,and if you're ready for more continue w/ Atlas. A friend had recommended it to me at the beginning of last year, and I have read it at least 30 times since. I have also passed it on to many of my firends. (Forced it on them is a closer account of it actually) :) Luckily they all agreed with me that Rand's insight into philosophy and our culture is very startling and true to some extent. Although I don't agree with everything she wrote, her ideals got me thinking and greatly affected me. The book will keep you hooked. I know there are some pretty long monologues in there, but don't give up on the book. It's really worth it. The chracters she wrtites about are ones to look up to, and one day day I hope I'll be as strong and courageous as Dagny Taggart (the heroine of the novel.)

There were Randians in the conservative movement, and they were opposed by the Whittaker Chambers wing: Christians. Rand did not hold to the Christian ethos, but her economic views were dead on. Written in 1957, it seemed to portray an America of around 1970. Although never revealed, the feel of the book is that America avoided World War II and other nations rose to power while we waffled. Lacking great history or much to be proud of, we relied on government. This resembles the current Democrats. Unimpressive, on the sidelines, not doing the hard work of history. The result, as in ATLAS SHRUGGED, was bloated, bad government. The conservatives, led by John Galt, tired of making all the things that run the world, and getting taxed like crazy for it while being blamed for every problem, \\"go on strike,\\" so to speak. Without their entrepreneurial spirit, America and the world grind to a halt. Thus, the title. The world, the \\"atlas,\\" is being carried on the backs of conservative winners. When they \\"shrug\\" the world falls apart and the Left-wing losers are forced to scatter about. We are seeing it in America today.Generations of books, some thought to be paranoid, have for centuries described precisely what Obama is doing: The Art of War by Sun Tzu; The Prince by Nicolo Machiavelli; The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau; The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith; Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville; Animal Farm and 1984 by George Orwell; Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; these and other books are either cautionary tales prophesying the rise of Barack Obama, or manifestos, handbooks guiding his strategy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Was this author able to foresee the future?If someone personally knows Barak, can they get this book to him?

Our congress/senators who got us in this mess...are just sitting back pointing fingers. I wish they could be fired. Barak I believe wants to do what is best...can someone really give him this book? I would mail it, but I don't have connections in D.C., and he'll never get it. America we need to do something, our politicians are going to destroy America. Thanks to the likes of Chris Dodd and Barney Frank. All this spending by the government that they debated and written all kind of things into it the 700 billion plan, 350 billion had been allotted to the banks, but the banks are not lending it. Well Congress wrote the legislation on this, why didn't they write this in...the oversight of this money? Remember the late night negotiations, remember all of the things that needed to be done in order to get this passed and the president to sign it. Remember the president doesn't write legislation, president doesn't write the law. Members of Congress do.So these clowns mess up and get to act like spectators and say they were tricked? What, do they think the American people are stupid. They spend our money all the time, they don't want us to know about their earmarks; about their pork. They Chris Dodd, Barney Frank, the rest of these people, are the ones who spend money..that's all they're good at. They do it in public ways, but they do it without accountability for themselves. And here they are now running around blaming everyone else. And every time a disaster strikes, be it an economic disaster, natural disaster, guess what? They had no clue. I say fire them all...if we only could. Obama's administration can't fulfill anything unless it's in the legislation. Bottom line, nothing positive has happened with all of this money, and we loaned money to auto companies, nothing happening there. And yet the government wants to give out more money?The bottom line of this book: Politicians invariably respond to crises--that in most cases they themselves created--by spawning new government programs, laws and regulations. These, in turn, generate more havoc and poverty, which inspires the politicians to create more programs..and the downward spiral repeats itself until the productive sectors of the economy collapse under the collective weight of taxes and other burdens imposed in the name of fairness, equality and do-goodism.If only \\"Atlas\\" were required reading for every member of Congress and political appointee in the Obama administration.

Objectivism is pure reason with no compassion or love. That doesn't mean that Rand doesn't touch on some profound truths. You can't live long in American society and ignore the capitalist and socialist influences around you.

This book shows the result of liberal thinking: utter destruction. When we punish the productive for being productive, we end up with a less productive society. The heroine of this story is a tough, ultra effective railroad woman who has to fight her inept brother (struggling to weasel his way into dominance of all rail traffic--and keep his sister at bay) in order to keep the wheels of her trains running, never realizing all the productive people on the planet were leaving, waiting, watching. They would reinvent the world once the something-for-nothing liberals had run their course and run their country and world into the ground.

Maybe they read it, maybe not. Then, they notice it appears in new printings periodically in the mainstream bookstores. Whatever anyone says about Ayn Rand, and she attracts a LOT of controversy, her message and philosophy (Objectivism) resonate. The plot of this novel is a thinly-disguised exposition of Objectivism. The central focus of Objectivist philosophy is the primacy of the rational, creative human mind. As in her other fictional works (The Fountainhead, We The Living), the heroes are independent, rational, potent people who are persecuted and taken advantage of by the leech-like masses or evil power-hungry despots-in-waiting. Rand divides the human species into three camps - those who are able and good and act in accordance with their inner drive to succeed and create and generally carry the rest of humanity on their backs; those who are unable to do much of anything and just \\"go with the flow\\"; and those evil people who are unable to create, but who are aware of the worlds power structure and manipulate it to their own benefit (read: politicians, bureaucrats and monopolists). The interplay between these camps drives her plot. In Atlas, the inheritor of a nationwide rail line fights her spineless brother and the evil, socialist political structure to keep her rail line alive and in private hands. If that sounds like a sleeper, it would be except that Rand novels are about ideas, not plot or character. This book was my first exposure to Rand and Objectivism, and it was an eye-opener. \\"Atlas\\" was written at a time when the conflict of ideas regarding the role of government and individuals in society was much hotter than it is today. Rand was writing at a time when the Soviet Union was still regarded, in some circles, as a workers paradise and when England and much of mainland Europe was experimenting with Socialism, Communism or other communitarian social and political structure. Even the United States was taking its first look at socialist ideals. To suggest Rand despised Socialism would be an understatement, but rather than just grind the axe, she attacks the philosophical underpinings of communitarian social systems at a very fundamental (some say simplistic) way. This novel, especially with the added foreword and some of the notes, is a great jumping off point for ones' own consideration of social justice, without the added pseudo-ideological baggage currently sloshing around U.S. college campuses, politics and media. I would never have read \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" or any of Milton Friedman or Noam Chomskys' works had I not started on Rand, and I'd still think that the two political parties that dominate the U.S., my home, were somehow fundamentally different. Rand was my introduction to applying reason to observed human behavior, and her work gave me a place to build a worldview far more rational and ethical than any base built on what passes for public education, or worse, organized religion. That is her great strength - she preaches reason; you can figure out everything else from there. We don't hear enough about reason in public discourse, at least not in the U.S. If more people read this book, America might have a level of public debate that rises slightly above the current schoolyard-screaming, everyones-a-victim level. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Buy it, read it, think about it, then act accordingly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One thing you notice immediately when you browse through the impressive volume of reviews for this books, is that very few of the obviously very different people who review here give this book an *average grade*. Rand, as someone remarked, touches something very fixed in you; she creates a light so strong that once you see it, you can't just turn away. It is a sad and true fact that with the publication of this book, many revered socialists committed suicide.Ayn Rand annoys, she teases, she breaks down so many well-known, so comfortable pedestals, she drives away so many monsters we were made used to from birth; and as such, you cannot read her without either hating her for making you, virtually MAKING you think--or adore her for her greatness of thought, her independence, her courage to stand up to a world so opposed to her.And That's why the reviews here look so different that in any other part of amazon.com: because this book, and its author, is of the most unique you will have to pleasure--or displeasure--to have read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As a role modle for women this is the book! The central character of this book, this woman is a pure individual, instead of one of today's sterotypes of the bold woman (usually a radical femminist)who is in the middle of an epic struggle. Ayn Rand's characters are from Mt. Olympus, big people with big ideas. Not only does Ayn Rand tackle several philsophical themes, she also writes beautiuflly and breathtakingly... i.e. the train being ran by people who are incapbale of running a train, getting their jobs because &quot;they are OWED&quot; a job...no one having to &quot;earn or learn&quot; a profession, society is simply to &quot;provide.&quot; The doomed trained is one of the finest moments of taking one into a seperate reality. This book will frighten many people. Are we responsible for our lives? Should people take pride in their achievements? Does the group shape the individual, or does the individual shape the group. I beleive this book was listed as one of the top five selling books of all time. For those of who want to take the challenge this is the book. I think this should be used in all woman's studies for showing a woman written by a woman as compelte and total individual."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand set out to make this book be a testament to what the world could be like if we all just accepted what it means to be human and accept responsibility for our actions. The story is okay, but by anybody's standards, contrived. The book suffers from an overly simplistic outlook of reality. It has heroes and villains but no in betweens. Ayn rand tries to manifest her heroes' ideologies in the creation of a perfect utopia where government doesn't interfere and individuals are responsible. Unfortunately she is trying to portray reality through the vehicle of extreme contrivance. Overall it turns into a two dimensional battlefield of us versus them. The heroes are always right and the villains always wrong. I sympathize with Rand in wanting to view the world this way, Religions survive and propagate themselves on the very principle of this dichotomy (or rather dichotomies in general, they all have varying reference points), but unfortunately the real world is not nearly this simple. It isn't merely a matter of looking at the whole world, realizing that everyone else is wrong and would all be better off if they merely listened to those who are right. It is more closely approximated by saying that the world is full of diverse opinions and thoughts, nobody is perfect, sometimes they help, sometimes they hurt, but in the end we have to make choices with imperfect information, which leads to both adequate and inadequate conclusions. Rand seems to think that the conclusions are obvious, those who can't see them stupid, and misunderstands why we can't just see it. It is the fact that we all do see it, but just see it differently that makes this book a little too simple. As a story it would be fine, but knowing what Ayn Rand was trying to achieve it falls short of the mark."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I bought a copy of Atlas Shrugged recently when I was about to take a vacation and knew I would have time for something meaty and perhaps challenging to read. I did this knowing nothing about the book or Ayn Rand other than that many consider Atlas a classic of American literature. I approached this book as the work of fiction that it is, with the same expectations I have of any story: to be entertained, enlightened, and possibly even educated. Unfortunately, I was disappointed on all of these counts, so much so that Atlas Shrugged is now in that rare category of books that I simply cannot finish.Atlas Shrugged is an alternative history in which Rand visualizes the United States as the last domino falling to the forces of worldwide socialism. Her protagonists are intelligent, talented people who find their attempts to perform constructive work frustrated by a society whose citizenry has been so indoctrinated by socialist dogma that they are lethargic and unable or unwilling to perform work of any quality. American industry lies in tatters and every attempt to improve it is thwarted by those who insist that it is unfair for them to profit from their own success when others are doing so poorly.I found Rand's writing (the portion I could get through) to be overwrought and tedious, her characters one-dimensional cartoon figures, and her attempts to convey her philosophy through fiction as subtle as a hammer over the head. Rarely if ever have I read a book in which so much time is spent with the characters explaining their thoughts and actions, yet they never take on the depth of real human beings. Rand's heroes are emotionless people who care nothing for the welfare of others, including their own families, and seem to be motivated by little more than their desire to do whatever they want to do without having to answer to anyone else. Her villains are irrational people whose behavior seems to be governed only by the author's need to have a foil for her heroes, blocking them at every step. The story lacks any subtlety, with the author telegraphing what is going to happen repeatedly and so deliberately that often I found myself wishing she would just get to the point already. She belabors the fact that talented and successful people have been mysteriously disappearing. She has everyone using the phrase \\"Who is John Galt?\\" as a supposed colloquialism while simultaneously \\"hinting\\" that of three brilliant young men, one whose name seems to have been forgotten, the most talented of them all, has disappeared into obscurity. Gee, who will that turn out to be? Mr. Galt, I presume? As I said, like a hammer over the head.I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they knew they were predisposed to Ayn Rand's emotionless, black-and-white view of the world. For that group, I imagine finding a piece of fiction that espouses their personal philosophy might make Atlas Shrugged a more satisfying, if not interesting, read. For anyone else, I think you'd be better off finding something - anything - that doesn't read like a political philosophy paper wrapped in the veneer of a story."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas shrugged and I yawned. I'm Bland aka Ayn Rand was no artist. Her characters were one-dimensional caricatures that took turns reciting her beliefs. I've seen better development in Saturday morning cartoons. The outright *simplicity* is what makes this book so boring. And what makes it condescending is the fact that Bland/Rand congratulates herself for stating the obvious. Bland/Rand was not a philosopher. She was simply a lady out to make an easy buck. She was not a novelist either.

Sure, the dialog is stilted and long-winded, and the characters are either ridiculously noble or unbelievably evil. But the story is interesting, and Rand has a withering sense of sarcastic humor that made me laugh out loud in several places. Ignore her unkind philosophy and you'll probably have a good time.This would make a fascinating movie, especially if it were filmed as an authentic pastiche of '50s mega-dramas like PEYTON PLACE and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

As a work of fiction, this book falls very short. Even the 5 star readers here probably skipped a few pages or most likely didn't even finish the book. Atlas Shrugged is an anthology of essays on Objectivism plopped into a character's dialogue. Hence the reason for pretty much every character in the book speaking for pages and pages at a time.The beginning is the strongest aspect of the story, since you are intrigued by the phrase \\"Who is John Galt\\", the forays of Taggart Transcontinental, and the wonderful yet debateable stance of Objectivism. One of the best essays, I mean monologues, is the rebuttal of Money being the root of all evil.Once you find out who certain characters are and heard hundreds of pages promoting objectivism, around the beginning of part 3, prepare yourself for literary torture. Already by this time you will have been weakened from the redundancy of this verbose piece of work. The whole story aspect starts to crumble and it really does take its toll on the reading.I suspect those that finished this, like myself, finished out of duty rather than pleasure. Once you start a book you finish it type attitude, because wow I've been tempted to put it down, and I'm persistent. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2, is because I enjoyed the introduction to Ayn Rand's philosophy, Objectivism.Ayn Rand departed the Soviet Union to reside in the United States and published this book initially in 1960 (I believe). Objectivism, and this fairly one-sided book on philosophy, could be regarded as the pros of an ideal Capitalist society against the cons of a crumbling Communist regime."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged in my last years of college, & still refer to it now, though I could not endure another complete reading from cover to cover.First, the good:Rand makes good in explaining her philosophy through monologues, conversations between characters, types of characters, & character development. The philosophy is the point of the book, so that was the important thing to me. Rand is glorifying the man whose ultimate desire is to prosper & do good for himself, thus doing good for all humanity. A hero for society that is based upon the (generally accepted) universal ideals of all peoples.The bad:The plot has become very dated, & therefore is hard for the audience to relate to. There are hints of the modern world, but since this was written in the 1940's, it becomes a stretch of the imagination to realize the setting. It has been much easier for me to imagine a kind of alternate universe. Trans-continental railroads & the mass production of steel are new concepts. This is hard to realize since we all drive an automoblie, & steel is taken completely for granted.The ugly:This book is way too long. The monologues are long (especially Galt's heroic monologue in the end at a whopping 60 pages), the story is too long, & the explanations are a little too preachy. I mean that in the best way possible, only because at the time of this novel, no one had ever heard of a philosophy like this besides the works of Aristotle. It almost feels like you are the child she is talking down to.But these picks are all bearable, if what you are looking for is an intellectually stimulating book. Overall, Rand's philosophy still holds truth today, though her fiction is awkward. The story could almost be considered as science fiction to make it more approachable. But that is exactly what this book is--A philosophy book aided by fiction to illustrate her points. The lasting power of this book over the years has been attributed to the inability to label it or categorize Rand's views with any of the mainstream. It is still hotly debated (if just on this post) & it deserves recognition.For a better combination of fiction & her philosophy, try The Fountainhead first, then if you feel like you've got the minerals, go for this one.\\"I will not live under any man's will, & no man shall live under mine.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is truly an epochal work.

I'm fairly sure that task has already been accomplished many times, and at least as well as I could manage. Let me just list a few points of the many negative impressions I formed while reading this book.First of all, nearly at the end of the story, when John Galt has been rescued by his co-revolutionaries (or co-strikers), and he and the heroine and their chief partners are triumphantly flying to safety, I thought &#34;This is the point at which I should be sharing their sense of victory, their triumph in overcoming the opposition of an entire society and their daring rescue of one of their own&#34;. I didn't. The characters are so flimsy, so insubstantial, so cardboard that I simply couldn't get interested in any of them. Several hundred pages, and I still didn't give a hoot about them. Or believe in their (even fictional) substantiality,There are some events that are just laughable:John Galt's three-hour lecture to the entire nation, telling them over and over again that they have everything wrong (he does this by hijacking a national address by the Chief of State - whose minions seem powerless to shut off the broadcast. For three hours.). Ms. Rand seemed to think, in this section and elsewhere, that her point of view was so important that she needed to have it repeated as many times as possible by as many characters as possible. Just in case you didn't catch it the first few times.The wreck of the Comet: the premier train of the Taggart Railroad, which meets its end in the sole tunnel that carries traffic across the Rockies (there are apparently other routes to the South, but no one in their right mind would use them unless they absolutely had to). Due to incompetence, the train stalls in the tunnel and there is a collision with a munitions train: hundreds are killed, and the explosion closes off the tunnel forever. Really - only one path through the mountains? (Elsewhere, it appears that there is only one bridge viable for rail traffic across the Mississippi. Really?). The truly laughable part of this event is the catalog the passengers killed in the wreck. - almost like a misplaced parody of Homer's catalog of ships in the Iliad. They are all of them, every last one that is mentioned, a moocher, or a sycophant, or a fraud. They are all exemplars of the corrupt, banal, incompetent members of society (most of society, it seems, in Rand's view) who have guided America to the hell in which it finds itself. What are the odds that this train would be so full of the obviously guilty?I could go on and on. As I mentioned, I'm sure this has already been done extensively elsewhere. I recommend reading this book only if you feel you need hands-on knowledge of it - say, if you are a student of literature or philosophy, or of the history of political thought. Don't look to it for either enlightenment or literary value."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book, despite some of the long speeches (which I found quite interesting and intune with the plot, especially the earlier ones,) is, besides perhaps The Fountainhead (her other masterpiece,) the most important novel of the 20th centurty. It's probably the most important thing to be written since the days of Aristotle.It shows the position of man's mind in society, how important it is, and what happens in its absence. It's the story of the will of the creator, the businessman, and those who hold the world on their shoulders - and what happens when they realize the depth of their power, and retain their individualism despite the rhetoric of the altruists and the socialists.This is the masterpiece of Ayn Rand, the genius philosopher who showed so many the value of life and man's ego, will, and freedom.That you haven't read it yet and will still enjoy it for the first time, I envy you.

In all fields, great thinkers are vanishing. Who is making them vanish and why? All joy in life seems to be evaporating. What invisible destroyer is doing this, and how?To solve the mystery, Dagny must correctly identify her allies and her enemies; discover their motives and their goals; and bring herself to understand the root philosophy defining and motivating them.The real hero of the book is the philosophy of reason (individualistic capitalism); the real villain, the philosophy of the irrational (collectivist socialism.) Atlas Shrugged is the only book which has ever attempted to depict every implication of philosophy, rational and irrational, capitalist and collectivist, in the form of a detective investigation. Every field of human endeavor is represented in various characters: industry, banking, music, literature, journalism, science, medicine, and philosophy. The logical consequences of both philosophies are drawn out exact and unblinking detail. Metaphysics, ethics, economics, aesthetics, epistemology are all vividly presented on stage.To perform this examination with pristine clarity and scientific rigor, Ayn Rand must present what an irrational society would be like without the rational elements present: in her fictional People's State of America, all the men of ability, the men of the mind (the capitalists), go on strike. For contrast, the rational society where no taint of the irrational is presented in Galt's Gulch, the Utopia of Greed.Reviewers who complain that life is not so simple, not so \`black and white' as this, have missed the point. Our society is a gray mix of liberty and tyranny, capitalism and socialism, wealth, poverty, progress, barbarism. The liberals and progressives have always claimed credit for (and even named themselves after) the liberty and progress. Capitalism has always been blamed for the poverty and barbarism. But which actually causes which? An analysis is needed. The act of analysis, by its very nature, reduces complexities to their elements. To criticize the act of analysis for being \`simplistic' is disingenuous.If you knew two tubes of paint, when mixed together, produced gray, you would, in order to find out which tube was actually white, squeeze each tube onto the palette separately, and see each pigment in its pure state. Once you have done that, and found out the tube on the left is producing pure black (and not the white it says on its label), it would be absurd for the pro-left apologist to claim that your test was too \`black and white'; or to say, \`but the end result mix is shades of gray! Pure white and pure black do not exist in nature!' Well, obviously; but so what? The end result mix is not what we are examining; we want to see which of the two tubes is to blame for the ever-darker shades.Again, those reviewers who complain that Ayn Rand heroes are tall and handsome and her villains are cowardly sniveling wretches, forget against what position Ayn Rand is arguing. The lovers of unreason in this world do not attempt to defend their philosophy with logic; they defend it by inducing their opponents into compromise. They defend it by Ad Hominem attacks against their accusers. They defend it by being ambiguous.Hence, any author bold enough to attack the lovers of unreason, must depict characters who are uncompromising. The characters must not be ambiguous. The characters must have integrity. For an artist, this integrity means even the character's outward appearance must reflect inward virtues. For Ayn Rand to have introduced a sympathetic villain, or an impure anti-hero, or even an ugly hero, would be as much as to deny the whole premise and purpose of the book, which is to show these things a beautiful and heroic. Ayn Rand would loose the debate by her own default (which is, by the way, the only way she says a hero can be made to loose.)As for the length of the speeches, remember we are dealing with a book about ideas, and the implications of ideas. Abstract ideas must be put across in speeches.As for the vehemence and repetitiveness with which Ayn Rand expresses herself, it must be excused on the ground that she is the only author in history ever to defend and praise the mind of man, fully, without compromise, in its every aspect and implication: let her say her defense more than once. It has never been said before, nor often enough since."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book writted from Ayn Rand's view point coming from a Stalinist Russia which was the birthplace of dictatorship and communism/socialism. The book shows in glaring detail why socialism not only does not make sense, but actually does not help the lower class people who it purports to help. This book takes place in the US, however it shows how government through it's power and influence, can destroy a successful business. We are living this in today's world, and instead of the market place deciding which businesses succeed based on service,price, and good business decisions, many business are put out of business due to stupid decisions made by Congress who in turn are influenced by bribes, etc. She is basically saying how capitalism is good because in a capitalistic society, a business must be customer oriented, make savy business decisions, and the owners must devote their lives to their business to succeed. She is also showing how with one law, Congress can take out a successful business due to others being jealous of their success. I loved this book, because I think in the US we need to realize that that is why we have been #1 for so long and the country that people from other countries want to come to. Why?? Because, they can rise to success if they work hard, can own their own business, and leave this successful business to their children. The thing that threatens our country is socialist, liberal policies made from Congress."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"To start off I'm giving this book 5 stars because:1. It's pretty profound2. It's very uniqueNow Ayn Rand thought that there was no such objective thing as \\"good music\\" and I agree with her. I also think there's no such objective thing as \\"well written\\". These things are subjective and invented by human minds.Rand's style of writing, is one of the most unique styles of writing I've ever read. There is a very good chance that you'll be unable to stand this book, that you'll find it boring and flat. If you do I don't blame you, but I certainly enjoyed it. The style would have definitely been different if Rand had been born in a different era, but she's Russian and from the 50s, and that's going to give her a certain distinct style of writing.Now on to the philosophy. The core of Rand's philosophy is very logical, in particular her metaphysics. The rest of the philosophy just kind of flowers outward (/me is thinking of fractals) from that bit.Now Ayn Rand is a brilliant thinker, but what annoys me is how there's a cult around her that sees her as the be all and end all. Rand's ideas could use improvement. Her orthodoxy has already established that her homophobia was just a illogical product of the times (although they tend to gloss over this thinking that she's still 100% perfect and rational), but they seem reluctant to bring into question her other ideas.One example is her insistence of maintaining a military, for the people's self defense. She mentions this in passing in Atlas, but doesn't really provide any rationality behind it. That's because this is an irrational thing fundamentally. What constitutes self defense, would \\"preemptive strikes\\" (aka the costly massacre of little children for no reason where BOTH SIDES lose) come under this category? Also, she thinks it's immoral for the taxmen to extort money from people at the point of a gun. I agree with her on this, but how does she plan to sustain this self defensive mechanism?Her certainty is certainly a breath of fresh air, but just because she has a lot of good ideas and is certain about them people start thinking that she is ALWAYS right and following her blindly, despite her insistence that people think for themselves.So this book has some inspirational ideas, but keep a sharp eye out for its flaws. I actually think that Robert Anton Wilson understands some aspects of Rand better than every single one of the reviewers here:\\"The error of most alleged libertanians--especially the followers (!) of the egregious Ayn Rand-is to assume that all property(1) is property(2). The distinction can be made by any IQ above 70 and is absurdly simple. The test is to ask, of any title of ownership you are asked to accept or which you ask others to accept, \\"Would this be honored in a free society of rationalists, or does it require the armed might of a State to force people to honor it?\\" If it be the former, it is property(2) and represents liberty; if it be the latter, it is property(1) and represents theft.\\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy page 768Now lets talk about morality (which Rand obsesses over, for a good reason though). Rand's core ideas about this (\\"man is an end unto himself\\") are very sound, but after this things get fuzzy fast.Some idiots think that it's purely a morality of greed, and that those who make tons of cash money are more moral than others. Those who think that obviously never got to the Atlantis chapter.What Rand really thought was that the only moral thing a man could do with his life was to seek his own happiness, and what the final section of the book shows is that money != happiness.Now what I believe separates her philosophy from hedonism is what she believes makes men happy. She thinks looters can never be happy people, and that's why they're immoral. So now we get to the most glaring flaw of her philosophy, her theories about human nature. She doesn't really back up her assertions of \\"man and human beings are all like _this_\\". Her belief that man is a rational being could be backed up by evolutionary psychology, but she fails to take Zugzwang into account (woah, I'm getting way over my head here). Other than that though, what she thinks about human nature isn't really based on facts or logic much.But her lack of consideration and thought into human nature leads to the most blatantly false parts of her philosophy, her beliefs about love and sex (she makes the usual error, assuming that everyone is the same as herself).Anyway getting back to the point. What separates her from hedonism, is that she believes that to be truly happy and fulfilled you need to create something, something useful to you and beautiful. I like that belief because it holds true for me, and has shown me the way forward in life. And for doing that she deserves 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The people who are using Atlas Shrugged as justification for their inability to cope - maybe your problems exist within yourself and not Mrs. Rand's philosophy.I received a rather sugary email the other day and I felt that its main point was the perfect comparison for Atlas Shrugged. The email told of mother who asked her daughter how she felt about the ingredients that went into baking a cake. Obviously, the daughter found certain things gross(e.g., eggs, flour, etc), but she knew those elements lead to the end result - which was a delicious cake.The same can be said about Atlas Shrugged. There were many things that I didn't like about this book. For example, Ayn Rand has a knack for beating a subject/ideal/ philosophy to death from about 50 different angles; she paints the world in extreme terms; and when it comes to her style of writing, pretentious is an understatement.That said, there is a wealth of knowledge, alternative viewpoints, and great literature that one can take away from this book. People may not like a lot of the minor things, but when looking at the book in its entirety, it is definitely a literary achievement - for many reasons other than its sheer length. I'm not going into plot, synopsis, etc. because I think enough people have already done that well enough.I must say that I read the Fountainhead first and enjoyed it greatly, so much so that Atlas Shrugged was a bit of a disappointment. One doesn't need to buy into Mrs. Rand's philosophy to enjoy the Fountainhead, while her philosophy is the metaphorical vein that pumps in every character, situation, converst\\\\ation etc. in Atlas Shrugged.If you're a fan of great literature then read this book. Taken on the surface level, this book is an enjoyable, albeit lengthy, read. If you have some kind of agenda, or paint the world in equally philosophical/ extreme terms, then this book probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Okay, okay, so when you read this book you WILL be subjected to a number of mind numbing soliloquies. But it's a long book. As I read it, I gave myself full permission to skip any soliloquy / rant that wore out its welcome before the end of one page. I had never read any Ayn Rand before; I didn't approach reading it with any expectations or pretentious notions; I picked up the book practically free at the age of 24 and gave it a whirl. And I loved it!\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a great story. I couldn't put it down! Though written (relatively) long ago, it warns the reader that if people and society continue on a path of anti-intellectual, self centered, unaccountable laziness and entitlement then we will run ourselves into a ditch. If you really read this book you will see this is not a conservative viewpoint -- the emphasis in this book is both a warning about and a perfect prediction of the hypocritical supposed \\"free market\\" anti- intellectual \\"conservative\\" Red State political doldrums we find ourselves in today, in the United States. In this book, as in the Bush Administration, the reigning politicians are intense hypocrites, constantly evading accountability and refusing to admit mistakes. I loved reading this story, in which they get their comeuppance."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I must admit, it was a long time ago that I read Atlas Shrugged. I have been through the whole process since high school of calling myself an Objectivist, being entirely unhappy with the world around me, feeling like I didn't fit in, that everyone was infected with a welfare state of mind. In essence I felt like Neo in the Matrix. And then I grew out of all that.I still give it 5 stars because whether or not you agree or disagree with it, you must surely admit the controversy and force of its pages. It presents a new philosophy to the world, highlighted by its fictional story. While the writing is certainly heavy and the dialogue unrealistic and stilted, it makes you think about the world around you and wonder, are there really people such as this in the world?Many criticisms come in the form, 'they don't talk like real people talk' or 'they don't have human faults and are always right.' But hey, I don't hear people making the same comparisons about some other famous fictional stories to the effect of 'this Superman guy is completely unrealistic, normal people just can't relate to him'. Get the picture. We are given this character to contemplate, not emulate. I guess that's where young people go wrong with this book.I am still a fan of Ayn Rand, but I am not a follower in any strict sense of her philosophy. While she makes some valid points about rational self interest, she does so in an extremely judgemental way. When you look around you, you can either see many irrational people who are victimized by the Ellsworth Tooheys and altruistic causes. Or you can see many people who just don't care and do what they think is best given the circumstances. Most people enjoy the feeling of being social. They don't want to strive for the 'success or be damned' mode of behavior that the heroes of this novel embody. They enjoy having a beer with their friends and enjoying mindless fun, just because. They don't want to be worrying that they should be building a railroad or creating a new invention to save the world.The thing that this novel lacks is subtlety. With everything stated out in the open and declared in absolute terms, it leaves little for the reader to do. It's a mish mash of philosophy and novel and possibly each would be better in its own seperate book.Overall I would recommend this book. For all its flaws, it remains a compelling read decades and decades after its publication. It states a definite philosophy, one which may not be so popular now, but one which is worthy of more consideration by the academic community. We should not feel guilty for wanting things for ourselves. But when confronted with someone who is ONLY concerned with themselves, one quickly sees how self-interest can suck too. The fact is, Ms.Rand was coming from a totalitarian society and perhaps this inspired her desire for privacy and selfishness. As inspirational as Dagny or Francisco are, their isolation from everyone else doesn't seem worth it.Now, I'm glad I read it all those years ago because I understand the world a lot better. But I also have learned since that the world has a lot more colors in it than Ayn Rand paints her novel with."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book for the first time in 1959 on an army base in Germany, and it changed my thinking forever. My family was pro-union, and voted Democratic, but this book made me rethink much of what was happening in the world in 1959. Every time I read the book after that, it solidified my thinking about government, integrity, social consciousness and our role in society. Since then, I have seen the government overgrow and over-control our society, take more and more of our money in taxes to support social programs that don't work, scare us with &quot;Sky is falling&quot; legislation that further inhibits our freedoms, and ignores the needs of the middle class and the role of the upper class in this country. They create the jobs for this country...not the government.

You won't get it, and will probably join the negative reviewers in these pages.It is fascinating how many of the negative reviewers sound just like the &quot;establishment&quot; characters in the book!Yes, it is the desire to use one's own freedom and energy - to create, to build value, to build wealth, that delivers all that is worthy and good in this world. Look at your world for proof. Where does the wealth for &quot;good deeds&quot; come from? Where are jobs made? Who builds the Walkman and who feeds the slacker who rants about the evils of capitalism?It took twenty years for me to reach Atlas Shrugged and for Ayn Rand to articulate what I knew all along about the hypocrisy and cruelty of liberalism and socialism, of any collectivist philosophy.Read this book and see if you like it.

She completely doesn't understand emotions, love, compassion, or the idea that serving others can be in and of itself rewarding. As a Christian, I find some points of Objectivism repulsive; but for the most part, it was so close to Christianity that it's astounding. I don't think Rand ever gave Christianity a chance; she wouldn't have called us 'mystics' if she had. I think everyone should read this book; but forget the grain of salt, better keep a container handy. I see Rand's philosophy as getting a piece of the pie in that it is so correct in so many ways, but it misses the point of why and exactly how to serve one's self-interests. Her philosophy is a circle out of the complete sphere. So - read the book, but don't just take her word on it. Oh - and, despite what she says, not all good people have angular faces and were born perfect."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked it up this summer while in Europe. It sparked thoughts of my career, life, and most of all what I wanted out of both. I don't totally embrace Rand's philosophy but her ability to make me question my own philosophy is powerful.

I, personally, would much rather be thinking about my family, my friends, and how I had enjoyed my life thusfar. I don't know about the rest of you, but I need something more concrete in my life than Ayn Rand's theory of Objectivism that she portrays in the excessively long novel of her life, ATLAS SHRUGGED."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This review is not to defend this book; Atlas Shrugged is the best book I've ever read. Instead, this review is meant to counter some of the views expressed by some of you. Because I believe they are misconceived.First, what I will concede: 1.) Ayn Rand was not the greatest writer of fiction. She was long-winded--sometimes dry.And her characters, although beautiful, are one-dimensional and unrealistic. That, of course, is the point. Rand was presenting an IDEAL. But her character's speeches (Galt's, Rearden's, Francisco's) are breath-taking and powerfully worded.2.)Rand, herself, was not an Objectivist. She lived a contradiction, which don't exist. She allowed her &quot;students&quot; to follow her, which cannot exist in a philosophy based on individualism.3. Rand did not always do a good job of explaining things. Why is selfishness moral? She does a good job of describing the value, but why does it necessarily branch from reason? She lets the reader assume conclusions and connections, which leads to the misconception and distortion of her ideas by people who claim to be Objectivists4. Some misguided students of hers have been turned into sheep or disciples, and she did nothing to stop them. This is being perpetuated today by the Ayn Rand Institute.5. I am an Objectivist.These concessions now allow me to dispute some of your remarks. Objectivism does not say that one should not feel anything for others. Instead, the opposite is true. An Objectivist society would be one in which its members really love each other in a sort of way. Love their abilities and talents and their VALUE as humans. Rand has stated on numerous occassions that much can be gained by interactions with other people--i.e., in society (division of labor), in interpersonal relationships (worthy friendships based on value), in poltics (the foundation and advocation of individual rights). Rand's world is not one of indifference and coldness. It is one of mutual respect. Listen to the words of John Galt: &quot;I swear--by my life and my love of it--that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.&quot; That is a standard of mutual respect.Secondly, the foundatation of her philosophy is largely Aristotelian, which is actually legitimate. And parts of her ethics are derived from or similar to other creditable philosophers, namely Aristotle, John Locke. Therefore, her ideas do carry some weight, and I've never understood why Objectivism is not taken seriously.Objectivism works only if you uphold its values. Too many young Objectivists treat Rand's works like a Bible, they follow mindlessly. Or worse,they use Objectivism to justify narcissistic behavior, delusions of grandeur, anti-social behavior, and anarchism.If you wish to read Rand correctly, please approach it with objectivity and a degree of judgment filtration. Do not take anything anyone says at face value (even Rand!). Evaluate it yourself. This goes for the dissenters as well. Rand is one of the most brilliant minds of the 20 century.If you wish to discuss these issues further, please feel free to e-mail me.Thank you,and yours in reason,Johnny"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you enjoy Rand, I am delighted to direct you to another &quot;Randlike&quot; novel,THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier.

Ayn Rand and her Objectivism philosophy have helped me embrace my ambition, achievement-oriented personality, and desire to always do my best. She's helped me lose my guilt of finding deep satisfaction in pursuing my own self-interest, my own wealth, and my own empire in business. She made me see that my self-interested actions create productive value in communities, create jobs, & create wealth.

There is a major reason why this piece of work is as popular as it is today, almost 52 years after it was written. While it may have been a bit lengthy and drawn out at times, we have to understand why it was written and who it was written by. Ayn Rand (an adopted named) fled the USSR as so many all over the world have done. As Reagan put it, she like many others have immigrated to the last great hope of freedom and prosperity in the world. She saw the destructive nature of a government with compete and total power over their citizens, economy and land. In an effort to counter this natural spread of evil, she wrote among others - ATLAS SHRUGGED.My first encounter with this book actually came as an incentive in a college class. The class was micro-economics. The professor instructed that if we were to read the book and pass the quiz associated with it - he would give us a full letter grade boost (meaning a C would become a B). It was an extremely challenging course in which not even a handful would be able to obtain an A without the incentive to read. So I read it.......I call it my awakening!! For the record I received an A and wouldn't have it I didn't read it. Many thanks to the instructor!!!While it isn't a perfect read - it opened my eyes to the destructive nature of a government with complete control over our lives.Do you remember the Atomic Clock? It inched closer to 12 as tensions rose around the globe - especially during the Cuban Missle Crisis. I'd like to think that the sales of Atlas Shrugged is the Atomic Clock of the conservative / free market movement. As the power grab of the federal government continues, Atlas Shrugged continues to climb up the best-seller chart.A must read for any free-market / limited government advocate."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If more people had read or listened to this book, we might not be in the mess we are in today.

Her portrayal of early 1900 industrial growth and socialists' efforts to maintain the status quo by slowing new technologies is an accurate reflection of today's world of banking and automotive meltdown... Attempts by governmental agencies to quash the rich industrialists and their wonderful products parallel what our public educational system has done to dumb-down our children/students into a mass of average, non-motivated beggars.And I'm only half-way through the book.

But of course others may prefer Ayn Rands style of writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I downloaded this audiobook at a recommendation of a friend who said it was one of the best books he had ever read. I was further encouraged by reading the amazon reviews of the book. It was very convenient to get from i-tunes and not deal with almost 50 cds.I have several criticisms of this book, and it was not one of my favorite books. I found it excessively wordy and longwinded. Why say in one paragraph what you can say in 3 or 4. Something like a baseball game with 30 minutes of very exciting action crammed into 3 and a half hours. I also had similar problems with background talking as mentioned in some of the other critics of this audiobook.Near the end of the book our hero goes into a long diatribe justifying his position to society, and its excessive length made me imagine those listening in the story could hear crickets chirping in the background and were all falling asleep when he finally stops. No kidding, in the audio book it was pushing 3 hours of lecture and I found myself nodding off as well.Also, while this book rarely mentions religion, during the 3 hour diatribe our hero describes those who hold religious convictions as \\"mystics\\" who believe in some mythical power made up in their own minds rather than the power of their intellect to help them decide what to do. As a religious person, his rants were offensive to me and the book otherwise had almost no mention of religion. At that point I was about 45 out of over 50 hours of listening into it, and was reluctant to quit on it as I would have if written about earlier in the book.With that being said, it did have some redeeming qualities with an interesting story and I generally agree on the theme of stubborn individualism and intellect winning out over the looters and slackers in society. With the new democratic administration coming into office I can see a strong similarity in what I read and what their ideology recommends. Like the conversation our president had with Joe the plumber, he wants to take from the guy who produces and give to someone else who didn't to \\"equalize\\" the opportunity. It was a very timely book for me to read with that political ideology coming into power.A good book in general for those who have over 50 hours to spare. But not the greatest ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Fourteen years afterThe Fountainhead, objectivist pioneer Ayn Rand wrote an even bigger epic novel that would end up being her most definitive book on her polarizing philosophies. She again wraps her perspective in a powerful, often melodramatic character-driven story, this time on a more sweeping landscape and with a pervasive mystery suspense element. It's a fulsome story that dares the reader to envision an intellectual revolution where the great thinkers disappear to avoid the complete destruction of their spirits. Rand populates this fanciful world with her trademark Baroque-style characters beginning with her beautiful protagonist, Dagny Taggart, a young railroad VP driven to run Taggart Transcontinental as she fends off the looters. She is surrounded by a bevy of conflicted men - great steel industrialist Hank Rearden who creates an alloy that renders steel and aluminum obsolete and whose ruthlessness marks the way for his own self-destruction; flamboyant Francisco D'Anconia who converts himself from an innovative copper mining baron to a hedonistic playboy; failed philosopher Ragnar Danneskjold who becomes a pirate stealing for the rich; and self-sacrificing composer Richard Halley.Through the fray comes the pivotal character of John Galt, who actually does not appear until about two-thirds into the dense story. As the brilliant mind behind an automobile engine that will convert atmospheric static electricity into motor power, he witnesses his invention lie dormant under the ignorant leadership of the factory's owners. Galt masterminds the strike of the world's great minds, and gradually, the greatest thinkers and most ingenious engineers find their way to Atlantis, the hidden valley where they can escape the persecution of the bureaucrats exploiting them. Their absence means that the industrialists lose their social and economic leverage and fall prey to each others' machinations until they lose control completely. It is only at this point of desperation that the philosophers become accepted as honorable citizens worthy of respect. Told with Rand's familiar verbose writing style intact, it's an audacious, often compelling story that carries far more plot convolutions than necessary to carry through on the author's convictions.At 1,192 pages in the Centennial Edition, the book could have realistically used the hand of an equally strong-minded editor who would have seen through the repetitive nature of Rand's didacticism. Still, the story is arresting, and Rand makes it clear that the highest goal in life is one's own productive achievement, that individual rights must be upheld over any form of collectivism, whether social or political in basis. Whereas inThe Fountainhead, she focuses her philosophical application to the somewhat rarefied world of architecture, here she takes a much more grandiose look where the ideas of independence and personal liberty have even greater ramifications. At the same time, there is no denying that the world Rand paints is palpable and more relevant than ever as CEOs today are reading the book to justify their positions of self-interest from a moral as well as economic perspective. Even at its most basic level, the book is about deciding what's important in life, i.e., the choice between self-reliance and dependence, and going as far as one can to fight for it. Rand succeeds in bringing vivid life to these arguments in a most eminently entertaining way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although I do not agree entirely with EVERYTHING in this book, it was very thought-provoking and entertaining.

Atlas Shrugged is a marvelous book and her ideas, thoughts, and philosophy are noticed throughout the book, in the way she writes and through the text.This book is very influential, at times hard to read, but overall very rewarding. The different characters and the PLOT of the book all assist each other. The plot of the book is ingenious, the story and the conclusion work very well with each other.This book has been one of the most influential books in my life, and I think on the world. I would highly recommend anybody to read this book, and keep up with it.

All of those books engrossed me for days on end. But at first \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" presented a challenge to me.Rand's characters don't have the same full-bodied, 3-dimensional quality as Rowling's and Follett's. However, they demand personal liberty just the same. Rand's characters are single-minded, but not flat or lifeless. They brim with persistence, as though they devoured \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" and knew every word literally would change their lives into exactly what they demand it to be.The book became \\"cathartic\\" for me. Why? Because as Rand laid out the real workings and purpose of socialism I began to understand why America reclaiming its freedom is so important. I began to see why I've treasured my own personal freedom so jealously all my life, but now can put into words. I could see why socialism and communism are such clear threats. They are precisely the opposite of enlightenment. The whole chain of cause and effect from beginning to end made sense. She has no contradictions in terms, as do the overwhelming majority of our present so-called intellectuals and professors. I'm so proud that I did not finish college, so proud that I am not indoctrinated with pro-socialist rhetoric, so proud that I value my own mind that highly.Why America is so special - we are the first nation in the history of the world to found our own government and lay it at a level BENEATH the individual.That alone should tell you how far from our founding principles we've come.If I were God of this solar system, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the Bible I would have written for humanity. I certainly would not have left it to an ancient tribe of desert dwellers who would have thought a wheelbarrow would be a stunning achievement of technology (to borrow from Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\" another relentlessly intelligent and clear read).I've embraced Objectivism and Libertarianism as my own personal philosophies, because on a visceral level, they have always been the personal philosophy that I was trying to find words for.Florida residents will be happy to know that someone who considered Ayn Rand like a grandmother is running for governor 2010. His name is John Wayne Smith.

HC)I had read this book before, about 25 years ago. I was inspired to read it again because the time in which we are now living brought back images from the book. It is amazing how a book written nearly 60 years ago can be so on-the-mark with respect to the consequences of a society and a government that adopts and acts upon misplaced values.Occasionally, as I read, I have half an ear to TV news in the background, and find it frightening to realize the similarities between what is happening now, in real life, and what I see enfolding in the pages of the book.Fortunately, in the book, there are talented men (and women) of principle who refuse to allow their productive minds to be enslaved by the \\"looters\\" of society. I am within 100 pages of completing this 1,000-page masterpiece, and do not yet know the full result of their action -- whether it saves society, the country and the world. That is, is there a happy ending, or at least a working solution to the abysmal state that the human condition has reached?A larger question I am left with is whether a working solution is in the cards for us, today."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was ahead of her time, truly the best book I've read in a very, very long time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"....that her fictional story published in 1957 would become reality in less than 100 years.I decided to buy a copy of this book from Amazon after seeing it mentioned on several blogs I read. After having a tough time starting to read Atlas Shrugged - its initial chapters set the stage and introduce the characters, but are a bit dry - I was not able to put it down. Simply put, this book continues to be printed - and sold - because it is nothing short of brilliant.Rather than attempt to explain the themes of the book (these can be easily found by Googling \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", but I don't recommend reading all of the links as they *will* spoil the story for you) I will instead tell you that the book is one everyone living in a capitalistic society *must* read - the story in Atlas Shrugged is a powerful affirmation of the power of capitalism and its embrace of the power of the individual, as well as a powerful rejection of the theory and practice of collectivism and of the subjugation of individuality.Atlas Shrugged is also a very powerful warning of where we *will* be headed if we ever lose the power of reason and the belief that the rational trumps the irrational.This book is now selling at a faster clip than ever before because the events in it are eerily prescient of the current situation in the United States. Since reading the copy I obtained from Amazon I have bought more copies and handed them to family, colleagues and friends, as I want them all to read it so they may judge current events - and their possible outcome, as predicted in the story - for themselves.The next time you have a question you can't readily answer - for instance, why so many businesses that should be allowed to fail are instead being bailed out by our present government, or why so many enterprises are seeking government help instead of trying to solve their situation on their own - just ask yourself, \\"Who is John Galt?\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The very instant you hear someone saying \\"She thinks so-and-so because in the end it's better for humanity\\" stop the conversation, because that person has either not read the book, or did not read it closely.Ayn Rand's philosophy attempts to destroy the common trends in modern and contemporary philosophy who claim either there are no moral absolutes, or there are no absolute truths in reality. The claim is that in both instances there are absolutes, and we can know them.Yes in this novel the characters are unrealistically good at everything, (good looking, can fly airplanes, incredibly intelligent, etc. etc.) Many people have taken this to be a sign of naivety in her writing. To those people I suggest you look at your premises of what constitutes \\"naive.\\" Ayn Rand tries repeatedly to show that excellence is something to be loved, not flaws.This sort of theme is present in all Greek epics, and in fact to the Greeks the very definition of \\"Hero\\" is something absolutely indistinguishable from what we typically see in our culture today. To the Greeks, heroism was practically synonymous with today's highly successful businessman. They attained wealth, and fame/glory. Yet the very same literary minded people who attack Atlas Shrugged for this precise theme will write entire dissertations on Greek epics, usually in extremely high regard.The difference is a change of setting, and the philosophy of the person reading the book. She wanted to bring back the values which brought out the best in an individual, where all around her were novels which said that people are to be loved for their flaws, and that one should be GUILTY for loving something for how good it is.This is only one aspect of the book, but an important one.As for the economic themes, if you disagree with anything said in the book I only have to direct you to the American economy today. Banks are being seized and sold by the government, hundreds of billions of dollars (forcefully seized from its citizens) being spent to bail out banks (And should I add that in the beginning the banks were forced to take on these subprime loans, or else be sued for 'economic discrimination' and face other fines/legality issues. I know no other way to determine who to give a loan to except for 'economic discrimination' ) Smoking bans for private property, private property seizures.. the list goes on.I think it's very unfortunate that people will read this book and leave it with such a deep rooted misunderstanding of it, when I approached this book I thought that I understood Ayn Rand's philosophy (at the time I was a libertarian) but I realized that I had everything absolutely wrong, and I had to go on a personal quest to figure out right and wrong practically from the beginning. This book changed me from pragmatism, (The exact antithesis of \\"absolute\\" the most subjective philosophy to exist) and showed me a way to live my life and be supremely happy with my accomplishments. I've never been happier in my life, and I only intend to continue accomplishing and bettering myself. Why? because I want to.That's what this book has done for me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read Atlas Shrugged almost 30 years ago on the advice of a friend, who described it as the best book he had ever read. I also found it to be in that class. It had a profound effect on me. I was moved by it toward a (even more) conservative view of politics and econimics, to the extent of becoming a little too \\"mean-spirited\\" and maybe a little paranoid.I realize now that Ms. Rand is considered by some, accurately in my estimation, to have been an extremist . . . in the extreme. She was also an atheist, which viewpoint leaves one without hope outside of this world. Notwithstanding, her message regarding the liberal, anti-business, free lunch crowd rings through with refreshing clarity and plainly spoken truth. There is much wisdom in her \\"objectivist\\" philosophy and as a bonus, this story wraps it in an epic, hard-to-put-down novel.This is one of the great books of the 20th century. Recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"O.k, there are a lot of reviews here for you to look through. I'll make mine short. For me the philosophy side of the book is a bit flawed but she does make some very valid points. It's a very long book but it held my attention and kept me wanting to read more. It definitely made me think and question my beliefs, which is what a book of this type should do. Even if you don't ultimately agree with her philosophy it still gets you thinking and leads you to develop your own philosophy. If you aren't open minded or hate reading opinions contrary to your own you may not like it. I love reading well thought out arguments against my beliefs to make sure they don't need adjustment. Then again you may totally agree with her and this book will change your life.

Orwell saw the potential future in 1984 but I think Rand shows us how we get there."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Undoubtedly if you are reading this review you probably know the story: Government expands, becomes Socialist, nationalizes industry, pretty much takes over. The innovators, inventors, business leaders start to disappear and at the center of this mystery is someone named John Galt.The story and characters are actually very good and in many respects relevant today,in our nation and abroad. Socialism becomes popular in faltering economies - just look around.So is the story worth the read? That's a hard one to answer for several reasons:1. IMHO it should be edited. It is far to long and long-winded. Too bad, because it is an excellent story.2. Unlike her other books - it is spends too much time force feeding the ideological battle with long winded dialogue. The first half of the book is excellent 5 stars and the second half is 2 stars - the 50 page speech is just too long. I think she loses the significance and impact - because it drags on too long.3. This is just my personal opinion - which is why we give reviews - I am just not a fan of her writing style and I think that majority of people that agree with her philosophy have gotten over her style of writing. I think Fountainhead is a far better read, as far as writing and editing - however even though this is a fiction, one should think of it as a philosophical book in many respects. I just wish I enjoyed her writing style more.4. It is a pivotal book in our political/economic history - for that alone it should be read and hopefully objectively (no pun intended). Regardless of my opinions and criticisms - it is an important book and certainly brings to light many issues and will certainly bring much needed dialogue and debate to the table - for that alone it is worth reading (by all ideological beliefs).I really want to love the book, because I love to story and generally agree with her libertian views. Note I said generally (I am not a devote follower). However - I could only wish it was edited and the characters giving a little more meat. On one hand I appreciate it is fiction, so for me it should entertain (which just misses the mark - for me) - on the other hand, I understand that this is her magnum opus in which she wants to clearly bring home her message (which she does in spades).To break down my review:5 stars for the story.3 stars for the heavy handed message.1 star for the editing.May I suggest a book that \\"supposedly\\" influenced her and stole some of the story for Atlas Shrugged, \\"The Driver\\" by Garet GarrettThe Driver. It is sold on Amazon, but you can also find free PDF editions on the web. It was written by a journalist in the 1930s and is very similar in message and theme - but very short."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone should be rewarded for their own work. That is Ayn Rand's novel \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" reduced to one sentence. It is a doctrine of which no one can argue. At 1168 pages, Rand eloquently challenges nearly every moral concept known to man.For example, one character states that he wishes he could kill Robin Hood for all the damage he has caused, and he spends several pages explaining why he steals from the \\"poor\\" to give to the \\"rich.\\" Yes, it sounds appalling the way I write it, but Rand helps it to make sense. The character doesn't really want to kill Robin Hood (whose cause may have been just), but rather despises politicians misusing the legend to support redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor.Dagny Taggart is the Operating Manager of Taggart Transcontinental. Her brother, James, is President of the railroad. Though they work together, they do not see eye-to-eye. James always wants to do what's moral in the sight of men--help people when they're down; lobby for legislation that's for the common good; thwart greedy people. Dagny just wants to do what is necessary; find solutions that are mutually beneficial for both parties; and make lots of money.This is how Rand introduces the characters and then she turns things around. The reader quickly learns that Dagny is actually the \\"good guy,\\" and James is the \\"bad.\\"This is where I come to my first complaint. Practically every character in this book falls under one of these two molds.#1) The camp of James. These are the ones who claim to be moral--to do what is good for all mankind. However, they are all lazy, shifty-eyed, all-around scumbags. They also happen to be the politicians who are in charge.#2) The camp of Dagny. They don't pretend to be moral, but they are noble. They always stick to their word--well, most of the time. It is very difficult for them to lie. All they want is to earn an honest buck and receive the rewards they deserve.One can't help to think that the James-ites would be called Democrats today, and the Dagny-ites would be Republicans (or more correctly Tea Partyists). Because of this unfortunate binary setup, the book loses a lot of credibility and the ability to persuade. It wreaks of a gigantic straw-man argument. In reality, we have many good, noble \\"Democrats,\\" as well as many shifty-eyed, greedy \\"Republicans.\\" In my opinion, the existence of these characters (absent in her book) would have served to greatly challenge her theories, and make for more persuasive arguments.My second complaint: a full 10% of the book is philosophical monologue. It's fun to read if you happen to be a student of philosophy, but as a plot advancer, this technique fails miserably. The first such monologue happens around page 410 (in the most recent Plume paperback edition) when Francisco speaks at an informal party. He orates 5 full pages on why money is not the root of all evil. And everyone listens! A madame says shortly after the speech, \\"Well, it's certainly a funny way to talk at a party!\\"I thought that the 5 pages was bad enough, but it gets worse, especially in the second half of the book. One monologue lasts over 60 PAGES! That was one part I skimmed through. Then I realized that Rand often repeats herself. If she tried to publish this today, her editor would have helped her to trim all that fat.My third complaint: I did not find Dagny to be the ultimate role model. I believe in her views, but I question her moral makeup. She doesn't hesitate to sleep with any man that she considers to be powerful. When a more powerful man comes along, she'll dump the previous man to go after the next. With these strong Tristan und Isolde overtones, I couldn't help thinking that Dagny was a slut. Her lack of loyalty toward one particular man rubbed me the wrong way. She never expresses remorse for her decisions, but rather she praises them.I suspect this is really Rand's attempt to rationalize her own affairs. But her arguments lost me. If her ideal world necessitates these affairs, then I seriously need to rethink her philosophy.A corollary third-and-a-half complaint is that the Dagny camp failed to demonstrate any charitable acts. In fact, Rand devotes a whole chapter against the idea of being one's brother's keeper. I know what Rand was trying to express, but if you take her arguments to the extreme, it turns into a form of Nazism, where anyone who is unable to produce isn't worth anything.Regardless of my complaints, the book does have its strong moments. It contains some wonderful vignettes, such as the self-contained short story of Kip Chalmers and the Comet on pages 584-607. There are also plenty of moments where you can't help cheering with the \\"good guys.\\"This is a book everyone should read, if not for any other reason, than to at least become familiar with Rand's philosophical ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book twice and still like it a lot.

The similarities with what's happening in the economy today are just plain uncanny. But I suppose human nature never really changes. That's what makes this book written about the early 20th century very relevant for us in the early 21st century.

Rand doesn't understand what motivates artists because she isn't an artist. She has a kind of denatured creativity and the capacity to get people thinking about certain ideas, which is not easy to do, so I give her book 2 stars (instead of just one)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read Atlas Shrugged 8 times, starting in 1960 and each time I read it, I find another piece of the puzzle put in place. The plot is extremely exciting, making it difficult to put it down. How anyone can feel it is a boring plot is beyond my comprehension. I wanted to know what was going\\u0003\\u0003 to transpire with every turn of the page. No one (not even the reviewers who hated the book) can deny that our society is deteriorating at a geometric speed, as was predicted by the events in Atlas Shrugged. Crime is rampant, education is in a mess, the welfare roles are forever increasing, while the IRS extorts our first 5 months of paycheck from us every year, the social security system (fraud that it is) will eventually ruin us all, racism is worse (not better), homelessness is epidemic, the problem of government waste has not been solved and our government-run railroad (Amtrak) is in big trouble. (All government-run transportation systems are not profitable and run at a huge loss) I could go on forever with a list of the problems facing this country, as predicted in Atlas Shrugged. There is no other explanation for such chaos other than the philosophy expressed by Ayn Rand. I have found that the main technique used by people who criticize Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged is to set up a straw man and then blast away at him. The most consistent criticism I have heard about Atlas Shrugged and Ayn Rand is that she is a Nazi. However, Ayn Rand emphasizes over and over again, that she advocates above all, the following idea: &quot;no man or group has the right to initiate force (or fraud) against any other man or group&quot;. Nazism cannot exist without initiating force against others and socialism/communism cannot exist without initiating force AND fraud against others.Ayn Rand's detractors either misunderstand her philosophy or purposely criticize her for things she does not advocate. She also points out that there can be no consumption without production and therefore to punish the producers with high taxation, impossible-to-follow government regulations and general harassment can only harm everyone in the long run. The story is a grand attempt to neutralize the anti-capitalistic mentality that is being spread throughout our government school system and therefore pervades our nation. To feel disdain for the very hand that feeds you, for the goose that lays the golden egg, spells trouble with a capital T for such a society. The story also shows one of the primary laws of human action; namely that all actions have consequences (even inaction has consequences). The devastating consequences that occurs in Atlas Shrugged is not a figment of the author's imagination. She explicitly shows that contradictions do not exist in reality but they can exist in one's mind and that whenever you detect a contradiction in your thinking it means that an ERROR has been made. The very nature of the concept ERROR means that it requires correction to prevent an undesireable result. You cannot teach a child to be civilized while beating him to a pulp whenever he does something you dislike. You cannot climb that mountain by digging deeper into the earth. You cannot have prosperity without understanding the causes of prosperity. You will attain poverty by placing obstacles in the path of prosperity. Atlas Shrugged is the story of how society (via government), not only places those obstacles to prosperity, but continues to place more obstacles when the original obstacles fail. Rand is also frequently criticized by attacking her personally via the argumentum ad hominem. Although she had her failings psychologically and emotionally, so do we all. I suspect that Rand's attackers suffer from the psycho-epistemological problem of being one of the looters and coercers depicted in her stories. Atlas Shrugged is a story about the truth and the truth is that something cannot be gotten for nothing"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's magnus opus is the most amazing book you will ever read, unless you have some sort of aversion to individualism and thinking. If you are a communist, this book might irratate, inflame and outrage you-- it might also enlighten you. I recently read this book for the first time, and I doubt it will be my last. It is a good, practical introduction to and illustration of objectivism. Rand's sprawling scope, masterfully crafted plot line and intricately woven characters will grip your mind and make you answer for yourself the age-old question: Who is John Galt"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"1. Is this a novel of ideas? No. Read the reviews here. Everyone - pro and con - sums up the ideas in this 1000 page tome in three or four sentences, some quite eloquently. Compare this to, say, Hamlet or King Lear - tens of thousands of pages have been written in response to about 100 pages.2. Is it any good? It's a matter of taste. Rand is melodramatic in her approach. Some find the characters wooden; others find the heroism inspiring. She presents a heroic character fairly competently - that's the best you can say, and there's nothing wrong with enjoying a heroic fantasy.3. The great irony. This is one of the most popular books of the last fifty years. Millions have read it, and enjoyed reveling in how they stand apart from the crowd, apart from the rabble. (Sort of like in \\"Life of Brian\\" the crowd chants \\"We are all individuals.\\") Ayn Rand spent her career praising exceptional achievement, and decrying mediocrity, yet in her chosen field of writing, she is hardly stellar. Even those who love the book acknowledge its shortcomings, and argue that they stem from being a polemic novel - a justification Rand would never allow one of her own characters."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel originally published in 1957 is the a story intended to describe the \\"objectivist\\" philosophy of its author and is the story of what happens when the producers cease to allow the non-productive to drain the benefits of honest productive effort.I have recently re-read this story and again am struck by the lack of objective thinking in our culture. While reading this long novel one encounters characters that seem to be taken directly from the pages of our current news. Actually it is somewhat of a frustrating read.In the story we find an economy that facing increasing pressures that come from the disappearance of more and more leading business persons. The loss of these producers puts increasing pressure on political leaders and the remaining producers to cope with an increasingly problematic economy.The story is good and its message clear. It seems probable though that I have missed the philosophical point of its writing. The story ends with the total collapse of the economy and the return of the producers to the world and apparently to once again produce without undue burden of the non-productive. No gain as I see it. There is no prescription for dealing with the real need to integrate the needs of the producers with the needs of those unable or even unwilling to accommodate objective realities. As the story ends I can only imagine that we see just the beginning of another fruitless cycle.None-the-less I greatly enjoy the novel and recommend that each thinking person read it, as it offers a lot of food for thought and discussion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most intellectual novels ever written. But, that is not to say that it is without an extremely compelling plot, brilliantly depicted characters, and a truly profound overall theme.I've read some of the other reviews and found that too many of them fixate on the overbearing length of the book and the \\"unneccessary\\" redundancies of Rand's philosophical discourse. Yes, the book is long. But the writing flows and it passes by plenty fast. Unfortunately, she is a tad redundant and several portions of the book are taken up by lengthy character rants. They still, however, have to do with the plot and never wander outside of the story.Whether you're looking for a nice escape, or something to get you thinking about life, the universe, and everything, Atlas Shrugged is sure to be a pleasure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I didn't rate this book five stars because it is a great literary work (I probably wouldn't like it if it was), I rated it five stars, because it dares to quesition a TRUTH that every one assumes is sacrosanct and inviolate. Every one knows that big business is evil, every one knows that the rich exploit the poor for personal gain, and that they should be forced to make restitution, everyone knows that is true right? Well Atlas Shrugged says otherwise.This book takes the Idea of, \\"robbing from the rich to give to the poor\\" to the extreme. It is the story of a world where altruism is mandatory, ignorance is rewarded because why should those with money for an education have more oppertunity than those with out, Competative industry is hindered because not everybody has the resources to compete, Quality and Innovation are suppressed, because it would put an unfair strain on less inovative companies.This is the story of the Producers of society, the people who make the system run, and how social concious policies and people leach onto them and drain them of all they are worth, until they get fed up and quit. They just stop producing, and let the parasitic world collapse around it's self.I won't say that I agree with the extreme philosophy of the author, that you are either a producer or a leach, but I do believe that Ayn Rand has made an important point, beware!When I think of Atlas Shrugged I compaire it to George Orwell's 1984, not on a literary basis, but on a social basis. With modern technology 1984's, \\"Big Brother\\" has become a horrible possibility, and we know it. I'll repeat that WE KNOW IT. Because we know it is a possibility, we will watch for it, and not be decieved. Like \\"Big Brother\\" Rand's forced social equality is possible, but unlike \\"Big Brother\\" it is not seen as a bad thing, in fact politicians often argue that it's a great idea. I have no problem with giving money to those who need it, but stealing money from those who honestly earned it, just because they have it, to give to those who won't put forth even the minimum of effort to earn it, is the worst crime imaginable.Atlas Shrugged is an important read, not because all social-minded people are scum and leaches, as the story implys, but because people need to be aware that what is directly benificial to each individual in society isn't nessicarily benificial to society as a whole, after all how would you feel if your life savings was seised and used to supplament the Welfaire program.Read Atlas Shrugged, and consiter the other side, Not all corperations are evil, Some people earned their fortunes honestly, and having money doesn't mean you wronged those that don't.

You know from the backcover of the novel all that will happen up to page 650, and you can guess the end from there.Rand's voice and idea that collectivism was more brutal and inhuman than competition is interesting and valid, but I wonder why she tried to masquerade what is clearly a political manifesto behind a character story. Her characters are horrible from any artistic standpoint, they are inhuman themselves. The novel's view of humanity seems to be that you are either a useless, whining slob or a perfect independent specimen (note how all \\"bad\\" people are ugly, and usually fat). No middle. By the way I would love to hear one historical example of a genius inventor/administrator/financier/etc that Rand makes some 50 characters into. I can only assume she meant the story to be an allegory, but it is far to long for an allegory; and far to inhuman for a novel.Even thought I agree in many aspects with Rand's thought I would truly wish for the novel to be more compact and less repetitious. This could truly have been another 1984 if it were 300 pages long instead.The most excruciating moments of the novel seem to be when her superficial idealized (or demonized) characters discuss love or try to have an emotion. Other than that the ideas of truly meritocratic system of values is interesting (specially coming from the 50s), and for all its failed characterization the prose moves at a reasonable speed (although it goes nowhere at a reasonable speed most of the time). Sadly the fact that some comments on Amazon mention the \\"lack of a moral system\\" indicates how perhaps even 1000 pages of discussion wasn't enough to penetrate some pre-conceived ideas which she wished to challenge."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First off. Never take advice on books from a guy who can't even properly spell out his critique (no names mentioned). Atlas Shrugged is a wonderful book about politics, philosophy, morality, etc... And all of these aspects are tied together by a common philosophy; Objectivism. Reading this book was the most life-changing experience I've ever had and if you spend the time to actually read it you will gain a very interesting, exciting and happy prospective on how to live life. Even if you disagree with the philosophy, as you have a right to do. It's worth reading. You don't have to take my word for it, but I'm fairly certain that many of you will enjoy the book for it's story-line alone even if you're not philosophy buffs. Take care."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"That is one of the themes of one of the 20th centuries most important books. Atlas Shrugged asks a most basic question: Is a human being a free creature, entitled to interact with his fellow creatures only in voluntary relationships based on mutually agreed values. Or is he a slave, to be owned, used and allocated by others based not on his own values but on theirs. Ayn Rand explores how the concept of an entitlement, whether to material goods or love and respect, inevitably lead to force, violence, corruption and human degradationThe characters drawn could be considered somewhat cardboard; the heroes being strong of chin and clear of eye and the villains shifty, weak and absorbed by fear. However, compared to Phil Donohue or Maxine Waters, Rand's characters begin to assume unexpected depth.Rand's most subtle insight concerns the corruption of communication by authoritarian movements: words used not to enlighten but to confuse, realities denied so long as no one utters the obvious truth. Atlas Shrugged presaged the Clinton Administration by 40 years.Contrary to the impression above, this is a novel of action and plot. The story is riveting, well told and fast paced. Atlas Shrugged is the hardest to put down 1000 page novel you'll ever read.Rand was a refugee from the Soviet Union. There she saw evil in it's purest form and has written a book clearly delineating the essential characteristics. Characteristics present, not only in that society, but also in ours."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Think this is the kind of book Hitler would have liked? What about Mousselini? Or any other dicators/Meglomaniacs/Machivellian types, etc.?These ideas are perhaps worthwhile in the hands of a &quot;good&quot; person, humanitarian, etc. (I know...what then is the definition of 'good'? But indulge me for a moment, ok? This IS leading somewhere.)Did anyone ever ponder what could happen if John Gaunt were a devil in disguise? (I know to some of you readers he is) Selfishness is excusable--but not on a global scale! To think about only yourself and no other...well I am sorry, but that is wrong. Think about the kind of horrible place this would be if we were all looking out for ourselves and only ourselves. When the day final came that I or you or anyone else needed help, there would be no one available to give it. No sharing. No caring. And, no love. At least nothing genuine and lasting. Love is not selfish but selfless, is not about receiving but giving. And a selfish loveless society is really just a metaphor for hell on earth. (For those of you who believe in hell, that is. And for those of you who don't, well then whatever you can equate with the word 'hell' will do in this case.)To justify this 'philosophy'as the way things should be, could be, blah blah blah without considering the reprecussions if it were, is just wrong wrong wrong!Thank God/Godess/Whatever/Whoever you believe in that this is only fiction!Rand did make one valuable contribution with this novel--she has encouraged thinking, discussion, and debate about the world, about ourselves and our role in it, about right and wrong, good and bad, moral and immoral and eveything in between. Although a true Objectivist is also a Narcissist and therefore sees things only in 'black or white' terms, the by-product of this pig-headedness is that all the non-Objectivists in this world (who no doubtedly outnumber you) are then encouraged to talk, think, debate on these ideas offering more perspectives, more options, more choices. How can anyone consider themself a free thinker, an INDIVIDUAL if they do not at the very least allow themselves the luxury of having a variety of views to pick and choose from, to accept or reject in their quest to come up with their own opinions and views?Sometimes the questions mean more than the answers, and the journey means more than it's destination."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Do you ever listen to people discuss mystical things with reverie and wonder why they believe all that crap? Do you ever wonder what belief in all things irrational ultimately does to the world? Here is your chance to find out. Atlas Shrugged is the most important book ever written, and will provide you with all the tools necessary to understand how to live a life of reason and see the law of cause and effect in action when man tries to live with out his most important tool, his mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I would reccommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand why people believe in Capitalism. It is unpersuasive, mainly due to the fact that it is fiction, and therefore Rand can have the economy of her world act on her every whim. She also fails to present decent arguments of the other side of the &quot;utopian economy&quot; question, and therefore Rand falls into the Straw Man logical fallacy.The plot of Atlas Shrugged is very good, and it keeps the readers attention. It is long, and requires a lot of time to soak in the outlandish ideas presented. Many times Rand's heartless philosophy made me sick to my stomach. So enjoy it (if that's possible)!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This has been and will always be one of the best books I've ever read. It describes a philosophy of existence, in Rand's terms, \\"of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, and reason as his only absolute.\\"You will discover why one's productive achievement is the highest moral purpose of one's life, why it is that the men of the mind go on strike, who is the motive power behind every invention and every achievment, and what happens when the the creators of that motive power refuse to live under conditions of the \\"sanction of the victim\\".Take it or leave it, Ayn Rand makes her point very clearly. She had no choice but to express her philosophy in such terms. The complaints from the reviewers are that the characters have long dialogues, are one-dimensioned, etc. But what Ayn Rand intended to do and did was illustrate a point. She did not intend to create a soap opera, she created a work of philosophy, and it should be read as such. If you ever doubt whether to read it or not--read it, and judge for yourself. I don't want to ruin the plot for you; I don't want to go into the discussion of the characters' specific actions. But read it, and discover what is the best within you. You will then have to answer to yourself which moral code you live by."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the first novel to put forth the idea of withholding innovation and trade as a weapon of war against economic cannibalism. Goober-mentals beware---the crypto world is developing the same thing in realtime, but with an added touch: do an internet search on the most controversial article of all time--Jim Bell's Assassination Politics---and you'll see where mind+machine is headed with regard to the evils of the world.Atlas Shrugged has been documented by the Library of Congress and the New York Times as second only to the Bible in influence on the modern world of movers and shakers, and this was reported again recently in an article in USA Today, as 911 renewed interest in this epochal novel, even among the most powerful people in the world.With all it's faults, Atlas Shrugged continues to influence millions around the world. Many eastern Europeans, for example, even non-intellectual ones, have told me that \\"everyone\\" has read Atlas Shrugged.And it's quickly spreading throughout Asia. Good for them. May it haunt and undermine the sacrificialists forever.If you want proof that Rand was right, just force one person to benefit some other person for the rest of their life. The modern world of forced wealth redistribution is like Rand said: a formula for permanent universal hatred and misery.Lazy thinkers will react in typical knee-jerk fashion by stereotyping rational self-interest as necessarily non-circumspect and grasping, but then they too have a self-interest in promoting such false notions---a blunted, irrational, and desparate self-interest of course.For those who will not wade through this rough diamond of a novel, I would strongly recommend Harry Browne's How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World instead. It's a rapid-fire self-help handbook to Rand's central themes of aware, circumspect individualism without getting bogged down in the political fundamentalism of the left, right, and libertarian types who try to change the world through that futile wheelspinning called politics---or gooberment.But I must admit that a new novel is needed to replace Atlas Shrugged. It should be half the length (or less), believable, philosophically clever, streetwise, discursively complete---but without long-winded digressions and speeches.Although the dialogues are dated in Atlas Shrugged, it thoroughly exposes the formulaic nature of collectivist propaganda, as well as it's consequences for human incentive in general society.Nature abhores a vacuum, and I hope a new novelist will do the same thing using contemporary rhetorical tactics but without the problems pointed out by today's social fundamentalists of anyone-but-YOU forced altruism.Here's to you, Ayn Rand.\\"She smiled her last smile at so much that had been possible.\\"--last line of Rand's We The Living"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Author Ayn Rand was born in Russia (1905) and did not leave for the U.S. until 1925. During the Russian Revolution, her father's pharmacy and the building it was located in were confiscated, and her family nearly starved. After being reassigned to work as a chemist, he eventually took a stand for 'self-esteem' and refused to work anymore. Her parents were non-religious. Thus, it is not surprising that her 1,100+ page dystopian 'Atlas Shrugged' (published 50 years ago) casts the wealthy and powerful as oppressed, is anti-proletariat, religion, and moral altruism, while also pro laissez-faire capitalism and individual rights.More surprising is that today's conservatives have so enthusiastically encapsulated her philosophy (eg. Tea Party members, The Cato Institute, The Heritage Institute, Glenn Beck, John Boehner - Speaker of the House, Alan Greenspan - Federal Reserve Chairman, Rush Limbaugh, Ron Paul - candidate for U.S. President, Paul Ryan - U.S. Congressman, Clarence Thomas - Supreme Court Justice), despite her lack of economic credentials, pro-choice atheism, and almost total contempt for most of humanity. Sales have spiked since the Great Recession.Her stated goal was 'to show how desperately the world needs prime movers and how viciously it treats them,' and to depict a world without them if people 'of the mind' went on strike. Its timing - 'the day after tomorrow.' Early on in the novel, economic conditions worsen, and the government strengthens control over successful businesses. Rand contends that independence, individual achievement, and anti-altruism enable society to survive and thrive, and that no man should obtain value from others through physical force. She saw the U.S. as a mixture of freedom and controls, moving toward dictatorship.Protagonist John Galt eventually tires of government's burden, believing it has reached dictatorship levels (eg. mandated equalization of opportunity, and contributions to foreign and domestic 'moochers,' as well as burdensome government agencies that produce nothing of value), and decides to persuade the world's creators to withdraw into a cave he has made available. (In addition to her father's refusal to work, Rand also noticed the large numbers of leading European minds 'withdrew' (emigrated to America).Rand herself lived for her own self-interest, seducing various readers despite her own and sometimes their marriages. 'Atlas Shrugged' takes a rather amoral perspective on sex, and doesn't address family situations - probably because Ayn never had any.Originally, conservatives turned their back on her. While Rand was a defender of many conservative values, National Review's former editor William F. Buckley found the book's harsh flavor and relentless Godlessness alarming. He assigned former Communist Whittaker Chambers to review it. Chambers declared it \\"silly,\\" \\"preposterous,\\" and \\"hateful.\\" \\"From almost any page,\\" he said, \\"a voice can be heard ... commanding: 'To a gas chamber--go!'\\" Buckley wanted to maintain a border fence around respectable conservatism, and believed Rand belonged outside that fence. She was too absolutist, too outrageous, too faithless.Bottom-Line: Total sales of Ayn Rand's novel are about 8 million; twenty-six out of twenty-seven copies at my area's libraries are checked out. Obviously, it remains enormously influential. Nonetheless, it can be best described as presenting an upside-down version of reality, parallel to and even less realistic than Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" theory that an 'invisible hand' somehow almost always betters society. Further, all Rand's characters are other-worldly simplistic - either all good (white) or all bad (black). The book's real value lies in helping readers understand today's conservative politicians."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are plenty of wonderful reviews covering the essential points. I would like to add my self to the list of people that completely love this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First off, let me issue a disclaimer for those looking to read this book: this book is long. 1,000pgs+ long. This immense length is made even longer by a jerky plot, an utter lack of time progression, and the author's affinity for soap box style rants where characters preach the author's philosophy.These writing choices are best illustrated by the main character's revealing himself to the world 800 or so pages in. He talks for 55pgs (55!). Unfortunatly for him, the reader has already been subjected to several 4-6 page rants containing the same rhetoric so his big reveal is ruined, and is laughable in its sheer length. In fact, I found myself laughing quite often throughout this book, not because the content was comedic, but becuase the plot, characters, and action is bizarre.No reasoning for any of the antagonist's actions or thought processes are given, the protagonists plan to fight an unjust world is ludicrous-especially in it's implementation. Meanwhile, thousands of people in this fiction are dying. Ayn Rand kills off many, many people, i.e. an epidemic of mass transit accidents, and for some reason, the public keeps attempting to travel these routs even after there is an 100% chance that the transit will fail. I ask you, how many train crashes would it take for you to say, \\"I don't think I'm going to ride a train for a while\\"?.As for the characters themselves, Ayn Rand has a nasty habit of having them pop into existance, with major importance in the world attatched to them, but no explaination of who they are, or how they became this important person-just that they are, and all of the public accepts it. Another bad habit is to create a character in 1-3 sentances, then forget about them for 600 hundred pages. Then all of a sudden, they play a huge part in the plot development. Also, her main characters are super-people! They can all fly planes, fight bad guys, singlehandedly run multi-billion dollar businesses, hold a god like reign on their emotions, worked in industry from the age of 10, and grow the best tobacco in existance.I don't disagree entirely with her philosophy, as it does preach self sufficiency and earning rewards through hard work and ingenuity. However, her attempt to channel it through a fictional story resulted in a overdrawn lousy plot, poorly written characters, and an unexplained world where why and when are often asked but never answered. I would not recommend this book, as there is little in this book that is worth reading. If one is interested in learning of Ayn Rand's philosophy, save yourself the excruciatingly long hours and look up a lecture, companion book, or a cliff notes version-this book is not worth your time, I promise you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Is Atlas Shrugged well-written? It depends on what you're looking for.If you're looking for beautiful, gorgeous writing, you're going to be disappointed. The writing is to make a point. The point of the writing is to give a demonstration of the 50-page speech on philosophy given by John Galt near the end of the book. The point of the writing is to make you happy that the heroes won and the villains got everything they deserved.If you're looking for characters like the people in your life, you're going to be disappointed. You're going to find characters Ayn Rand wants you to love for their awesome awesomeness, like Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden and Francisco D'Anconia, and characters she wants you to hate with every fiber of your existence because they're looters, moochers, spongers and parasites, like James Taggart, Lillian Rearden and Orren Boyle.If you're looking for amusing twists and turns, you will be mostly disappointed. There is plenty of foreshadowing of upcoming events. For example, early in the book there is a meeting between railroad excutive James Taggart and steel executive Orren Boyle, where Orren Boyle agrees to use his influence to cripple one of Taggart's competitors. The competitor gets kneecapped in the next chapter. There's a romantic moment between Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart early in the book, and it turns into a romantic relationship a few chapters later. One of the Big Ideas of the book is that ideas have consequences, and Ayn Rand takes joy in letting the consequences of ideas appear in all their glorious (or hideous) glory.If you're looking for the heroes to succeed and the villains to be punished, you will be richly rewarded. Even though the heroes undergo various challenges and difficulties, they win in the end. Even though the villains seem to be in charge for most of the book, they lose in the end.So what is the message of the book? There are multiple messages in the 50-page speech by John Galt, and the shorter speech about the greatness of money by Francisco D'Anconia. Here are some of them.Humanity, for the most part, stinks because it feels instead of thinks. (and by \\"thinking\\" I mean \\"creating individual and species survival value.\\" While humanity may have some dreadful problems, this is not its worst one by a long shot.)Humanity feels instead of thinks because the contributions of the tiny minority of thinkers (and by thinkers I mean scientists, inventors, engineers, technologists, industrialists, etc.) have relieved the vast majority of humanity from the responsibility and hard work of thinking. (As I think of this, I recall the Henry Ford quote \\"Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.)All religions stink because not only do they keep people from thinking, they actively persecute them for thinking. (Ayn Rand and I part company here)Humanity uses religion to justify living off the contributions of the tiny minority of thinkers. (That's another reason why all religions stink.)Politicians like to soak the rich, loot the contributions of the tiny minority of thinkers, because the vast majority is a larger voting bloc.The vast majority likes their politicians to loot the contributions of the tiny minority of thinkers.All communist, socialist, collectivist arrangements (the \\"People's States\\") are designed to loot the contributions of the tiny minority of thinkers and distribute them to the vast majority, taking their cut along the way. (I agree with Ayn Rand here.)Therefore, the general human condition is poverty, slavery and tyranny.If you think the thinkers are evil, greedy, unfeeling, materialistic robber barons, just try surviving without them. (John Galt just sped up the process of destruction by taking them out of society.)America rocks because it is the most thinker-friendly (or least thinker-hostile) country on earth. (Ayn Rand could have said America rocks because it was religiously neutral, but she didn't. She also decided to ignore slavery and the subjugation of Native Americans.)I therefore give it four stars because I vehemently disagree with the message."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There's no way that Ayn Rand did not see the future 62 years ago. She had to know a majority of Americans would buy the BS spewed by Obama and Biden. Google her name and watch a few of her interviews with such pillars of liberalism as Mike Wallace and Phil Donahue. This lady was spot on.And best of all, Miss Rand is a great storyteller. I read all three of her novels in the order she wrote them. Atlas is the best with The Fountainhead a close second. JMO"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is actually much better than I expected. There are allot of personality types in this book that remind me allot of influential people in power today, this book is still socially relevant and is full of interesting ideas and concepts."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although it was often a slog, I *was* able to finish Ayn Rand's book, which is something I can't say about some other writers with followings: say, Robert Ludlum, or Tom Clancy, or Nephi (\\"author\\" of the \\"Book of Mormon\\"). Her writing isn't always hopeless, her English is certainly better than my Russian, and sometimes there's music in her words. Moreover, I share her disdain for certain conventional cultural values. Those points of agreement don't, however, tend to be the issues that have generated most of the recent popular enthusiasm for her books.There are a few good guys, and they're really good - I call them the Legion of Superheroes. They're mostly blond and even when they're not they usually have blue eyes. They can do everything well: perform tricks with racing boats without training or practice, fly planes, invent miracle metals and machines that draw power out of the static electricity in the air. They're strong and smart, they all move with grace and agility, they're suave and very certain of themselves. Rand talks about them like this: \\"her posture had the lightness and unself-conscious precision of an arrogantly pure self-confidence.\\" \\"...he knew, by the proud posture of the body standing in the open, by the straight line of the shoulders against the starlit sky--that the man was not a bandit. When he heard the voice, he knew the man was not a beggar.\\" (This describes a blond Norwegian *pirate* good guy named--get this--Ragnar Danneskj&ouml;ld.) More on Ragnar (who went to college in Cleveland): \\"The tall, slim figure, with the windbreaker stressing its trained muscular agility, was that of a highwayman; the stern marble face was that of a judge; the dry, clear voice was that of an efficient bookkeeper.\\" \\"Danneskj&ouml;ld's face was more than handsome...it had the startling beauty of physical perfection--the hard, proud features, the scornful mouth of a Viking's statue...But the smile was brilliantly alive.\\" \\"...the austerity of the marble face was the form of a disciplined capacity to feel too deeply.\\" Here's how one good guy speaks to another: \\"Yet you and I were the kind who determine the fate of our world.\\" They talk like this among themselves quite a bit. And John Galt, the head good guy: \\"...his skin was suntanned, his body had the hardness, the gaunt, tensile strength, the clean precision of a foundry casting...the loose strands of the hair shading from brown to gold in the sun...eyes the deep, dark green of light glinting on metal.\\" Green metal? In this book, yes. And about Galt, Francisco D'Anconia, and Ragnar together: \\"don't make the mistake of thinking that these three...are some sort of superhuman creatures. They're something much greater and more astounding...\\" \\"Francisco, the richest heir in the world--Ragnar, the European aristocrat--and John, the self-made man, self-made in every sense...\\" He built that!Then there are the bad guys: the \\"looters.\\" You'll never mistake them for good guys, not for a second, and their badness is continually, mercilessly pounded home. Here are some of the words she uses to describe the looters: \\"whining rotters,\\" \\"born to rule by the grace of incompetence,\\" \\"...the pendulous face ... with the small slits of pig's eyes, the doughy face ... with the eyes that scurried away from any speaker and any fact...the jerky motions of an ape performing a routine it had learned to copy by muscular habit...with no knowledge and no capacity to know what had taken place...\\" \\"...a small, aging man with a face that looked as if it had once been punched in and had never rebounded.\\" A writer of the looter persuasion: \\"an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicism retouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human endeavor.\\" Another: \\"...a sniveling little neurotic who wrote cheap little plays into which, as a social message, he inserted cowardly little obscenities to the effect that all businessmen were scoundrels.\\" Was she thinking of someone in particular, maybe someone who'd written her a nasty review? \\"...an ocean of mediocrity, under the pressure of men with gelatin eyes, rubber voices, spiral-shaped convictions, non-committal souls and non-committing hands...\\" \\"...pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil...\\" \\"...a fat, jellied woman, with an inadequate brassiere under a dark, perspiration-stained dress...\\" \\"...a fat, blank face and the eyes of a killer.\\" \\"All thought is theft\\" says one of the head looters.I came away feeling sorry for Rand. For all her commercial success and the adoration of her followers, the writer of this book seems like she must have been pretty miserable. I think it helps to know that the then-new Soviet regime confiscated her father's St. Petersburg pharmacy when she was a young girl: hence her hatred of totalitarianism. I share her dislike: I wouldn't have wanted to live in the Soviet Union, either. But I don't think I do. The world she portrays here bears little resemblance to mine, and I'm grateful for its many dissimilarities.I also understand that she had been a regular user of Benzedrine for the 14 years prior to this book's publication. Maybe that's why the prose is frequently so awkward, the ideas so jumbled--sometimes simply incomprehensible: speed is hell on your central nervous system. She loves setting paradoxes: \\"mirthless laughter\\" is a favorite. But far too often, over 1600+ (iBook) pages, she falls off the edge into self-contradiction or mere incoherence: \\"...the light swift steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag...\\" \\"...her voice was breaking in gentle, desperate, rebellious anger...\\" \\"She felt at peace, and she wished she could hold her mind still to let her own emotions catch up with her...\\" \\"His eyes were shrewd without intelligence, his smile good-natured without kindness.\\" \\"His was the only face that had the carefree look and the brilliant smile proper to the enjoyment of a party; but his eyes seemed intentionally expressionless, holding no trace of gaiety, showing--like a warning signal--nothing but the activity of a heightened perceptiveness.\\" \\"...a long, impotent pressure...\\" \\"...the formula of so monstrous an evil that he was able to name it, but not to believe it possible.\\" \\"He was seeing the enormity of the smallness of the enemy who was destroying the world.\\" \\"...a vicious tap against an ashtray...\\" \\"...a look of astonishment, of acceptance, of repose.\\" \\"...he felt what one feels at the loss of a dream one had not known till after it was lost.\\" (And what is that feeling, exactly?) \\"...her consciousness...surrendered to a single, wordless emotion--but she had always known that an emotion was a sum totaled by an adding machine of the mind, and what she now felt was the instantaneous total of the thoughts she did not have to name...\\" \\"Only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, is capable of a desire devoid of love.\\" (Rather pretty, that last one; I wonder what it means.) \\"He had the cunning of the unintelligent and the frantic energy of the lazy. The sole secret of his rise in life was the fact that he was a product of chance and knew it and aspired to nothing else.\\" (A bad guy, I'd guess.) \\"...she felt that she had full control of her body and that she was not aware of her body's existence.\\" \\"...an emotion of solemn, joyous excitement...\\" \\"...the naked body under the clothes...\\" \\"...the slack, muscular bodies...\\" \\"...a hard face made of soft muscles...\\" And this brainteaser: \\"The college had taught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid enough to think.\\"I sympathize with this bright but troubled woman with her childhood trauma, her addiction to amphetamines, and I'm sure her bitterness at what must have been a lot of scathing reviews. But that's not sufficient justification for me to consider her protracted revenge fantasy as a basis for an economic system or a philosophy. She praises reason in the abstract--\\"'If any part of your uncertainty,' said Galt, \`is a conflict between your heart and your mind--follow your mind.'\\"--but simultaneously admires (and writes with) an overheated, hysterical flamboyance: \\"The only man never to be redeemed is the man without passion.\\" We are rational beings! she shrieks, voice cracking with rage, spittle flying from her lips, clenched fists shaking uncontrollably.I can see why she'd appeal to rich people and to \\"young adults\\" trying to escape their pious childhoods, people who are tired of hearing about \\"faith, hope, and charity\\" (\\"...but the greatest of these is charity,\\" says 1 Corinthians 13:13). Here's what she says on the subject: \\"'And then you'll see what motive is the opposite of charity.' 'What?' she whispered. 'Justice, Cherryl.'\\" I'm relieved that we don't really have to speak in Rand's Bizarro World version of English (where was her editor?). At the same time, it's difficult for me to understand how such a world view can be rationalized by avowed Christians who admire her, people like Paul Ryan.This is the physical world she admires (from a distance): \\"Mr. Mowen looked at the skyline, at the belts, the wheels, the smoke--the smoke that settled heavily, peacefully across the evening air, stretching in a long haze all the way to the city of New York somewhere beyond the sunset...he felt reassured by the thought of New York in its ring of sacred fires, the ring of smokestacks, gas tanks, cranes and high tension lines. He felt a current of power flowing through every grimy structure...\\" Rearden (a good guy) in the country: \\"What I'd like to see...is a billboard.\\" Later, good guy Dagny, Rand's alter ego (\\"Ayn,\\" the former Alisa Rosenbaum, does have a fondness for unlikely names) says that \\"She had found reassurance...in the sight of the cities moving past her window--the factories, the bridges, the electric signs, the billboards pressing down upon the roofs of homes--the crowded, grimy, active, living conflux of the industrial East.\\" I grew up in a factory town; I've seen a blood-red sun set behind Detroit's River Rouge plant, so maybe it's my familiarity with it that makes it hard for me to resonate to Rand's sentimentalization of industrial squalor.In the promised land of the good guys, \\"Galt's Gulch, \\" we find, almost literally, the proverbial altar to Mammon: \\"...rising on a slender granite column..., blinding her by its glare, dimming the rest, stood a dollar sign three feet tall, made of solid gold.\\"\\"Blood, whips, and guns--or dollars. Take your choice--there is no other--and your time is running out.\\" This is Francisco D'Anconia, one of the good guys, talking. Carved (in granite, and all uppercase) over the doorway of the power station in Galt's Gulch: \\"I SWEAR BY MY LIFE AND MY LOVE OF IT THAT I WILL NEVER LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER MAN, NOR ASK ANOTHER MAN TO LIVE FOR MINE.\\" I read this as one more bumper sticker slogan (a large bumper sticker, befitting the author's verbosity) along with another that Rand doesn't care for as much. In fact, she calls it \\"pure evil\\": \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\\" Nave, impractical, even tragically abused at times, perhaps, but pure evil? More evil than \\"Blood, whips, and guns--or dollars\\"? Now *there's* a bumper sticker.As a final example of the implausibility of this book, there's a scene in which Rearden is called in by the half-dozen most powerful men in the government. They want him to actively support the nationalization of his iron works. Instead, he asks them (in various ways) how they're going to pull it off, and how he's going to be able to survive operating at a loss. Four times in one page they're rendered speechless by the power and cogency of his questions: \\"There was no answer,\\" Rand intones each time, and it sounds more than anything else like a ritual liturgical response from one of the churches that inspire such contempt in her. It seems unlikely that there exists a question for which a roomful of politicians and bureaucrats, of any stripe, wouldn't have an answer.Next, \\"The Fountainhead\\"? I can't miss a chance to pass that one up."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Many parts of Atlas Shrugged resonate with me profoundly and deeply. I'm that guy. The one who takes pride in his work, the one who's always on time, the one whose word you can take to the bank, the one who has to pull the weight of others and has a difficult time understanding why people think the world owes them something. Hank Rearden is a character I can relate to in many ways. But I can't wrap my heart around being indifferent to my fellow man, I can't see the world in nothing but black and white, and this is where Atlas Shrugged and Objectivism in general fails. The novel's least realistic aspect isn't the dystopian setting, the fictional technology or odd sexual behavior, it is the unrealistic absolutes of human nature it presents. Brilliant industrialists are all fair, honest people who also happen to be atheistic egotist. All other beliefs belong to people of inferior character and intellect whose behavior will rot society. The book is summed up in this one line \\"I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.\\" The Randian characters in the book can't even live by this oath, they simply rationalize why it's in their self interest to risk life and limb, finances, and their reputation on other people of a like mindset. As a whole, the philosophy being sold here doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, but that doesn't mean there isn't a compelling story or lesson to be had. Many of the feelings I have about the world have been brought into a much sharper focus, many of the feelings have been given a name. The story itself is entertaining for the vast majority of the book. There is one awfully long speech in the book which falls very flat and felt tedious to me, the previous speeches in the book felt epic so perhaps my expectations were too high, but this is also the place in the book where my differences with the beliefs of these characters became crystal clear. All in all I would recommend this book to everyone who is interested philosophy, politics, or the economy. Who is John Gault? Read the book and take that journey for yourself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book that can change your life.

It's an entertaining epic of a nation in crisis, almost as good as \\"War and Peace\\". Before 2006, I would have found the politicians' characters idiotic beyond belief, but they talk and act exactly like the people running America today, and it feels great to see them humiliated and destroyed.Although primary and secondary characters do have sex, none of them ever have children. Unlike \\"The Children of Men\\", no one in the novel seems to notice this or think it a problem. All socialist societies ultimately contracept themselves into extinction, but the Strikers must aspire to something better.

First and foremost, she is an excellent author and a very easy and flowing style. thousand page books had better have something going for them or else lose me pretty fast. Ayn Rand did this right from the start and throughout with a very smooth writing style. I am a huge fan of Nelson DeMille and Wilbur Smith, and could not put down Pillars of the Earth and can only say this is right up there with all of those works. One does not have to agree or disagree with the politics of the books when looked at from todays events, but it certainly makes things a bit more interesting and causes one to reflect and think a little more about what is going on in the world today. But above all else, it is a fun book to read, even if one does not want to delve to deep into the meaning of everything and just wants a good fun book that will hold ones interest."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A riveting novel that transcends time to explain today's malaise & the way to prevent the ongoing decline of the U.S."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What happens when the country's most intelligent people destroy their own businesses and inventions and go on strike while the rest of the world descends into collectivism and socialism?

But fiction is what it is, although her words carry a great deal of weight in this day and age.

It is wordy and is slow reading. Statists give it bad reviews because they dislike the philosophy; classical liberals love it. The book is a tough read, but well worth the effort. Reading and understanding the values presented will change your world outlook.Amazing to me is that the situations encountered in the story, are happening today. it would seem that our present administration and the opposition party seem to be taking us down the path that the government took in Atlas Shrugged.There is a reason that this book has been read by more people than any other work of literature that is based on rational thought.J."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand's classic novel of the rebirth of man's spirit, represents the pinnacle of her philosophical vision. Set in the modern world, but not dated, the novel deals with what happens when the &quot;prime movers&quot; go on strike. The prime movers are tired of being blamed for everything bad in society and given no credit for the good. They are also tired of being enslaved by the second-handers, so the prime movers give these people what they want: a world without the things, values and people the leeches detest. However, by doing so, they have led to the destruction of society as we know it.The great thing about this novel is the fact that it predicts many of todays problems. You can simply look at the California Power crisis and see many of the characters in the novel are with us today: people like Governor Gray Davis remind me of James Taggert. The environmentalists and their pseudo-intellectual ideals remind me of people like Chic Morrisson and his ilk. These people, just as the people in the novel, do not realize that many of the things they advocate are in complete opposition to logic and reason as well as the laws of economics. However, that matters not. They &quot;want&quot; things done their way and will achieve their goals at all costs. They substitute true intellectual discourse with child-like name calling and tantrum throwing until they achieve what they want, and when they do so, they demand the very people they persecuted come to their rescue.Another point of the novel which I truly enjoyed was the fact Rand took her time to fully explore the motivations of the characters and fully develop the plot. She isn't in any hurry to get to the end, and although I certainly was, I found the trip an enjoyable one. I must say at this point many of the characters are meant to be caricatures of various ideas running through the American Culture and political discourse of the times. The best example of this is Gault himself, who is the ultimate caricature and represents something different to each character in the plot.This novel is certainly one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. A complete philosophy on life is presented between its covers. Whether or not you are an Objectivist, you will find Atlas Shrugged to be a compelling and timely novel, even 40 years after it was first published."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, let me say that this is not a review of Atlas Shrugged but a short informational primer on who she was and why she wrote the way she did.It seems that many readers who have written critiques here know little or nothing about her and her life. If they did, some of the criticisms might have not been rendered and those that were would be either a) redundant or b) indicative of a lack of background.For those of you who don't know her, Ayn Rand came into the world while Czar Nicholas still ruled over Russia. She was born into an affluent Russian Jewish family that lost everything when the Bolsheviks took power in the October 1917 revolution. She received her university education in history in the early stages of the regime, when the Communists were attempting to re-educate everyone and create the next generation of collectivist thinkers. They failed with Rand.Ayn Rand emigrated to the US in 1926 via Chicago. She knew very little English. As she has said on several occasions, she had to learn the language first and then learn to think in English so that she could express her ideas. Think of her as a female version of Joseph Conrad in that sense because he developed his language skills by writing in a language that was foreign to him.Having witnessed first-hand the mind-numbing, demoralizing and dehumanizing nature of Soviet totalitarianism, Rand first offered the reading world &quot;WE THE LIVING.&quot; While it tells the story of Kira Argounova as she deals with the state (or the collective). She does that again with Howard Roark in THE FOUNTAINHEAD and with all of her heroes in ATLAS SHRUGGED.I agree with some of the writers here who think that she was a study in contradictions. She did allow her students to become disciples and in many cases, they ceased thinking and acting for themselves. She also had very little tolerance when it came to people who disagreed with her. You either buy into her view of life and the world or you'd better find someone else to hang with.Rand, was like all of us, a flawed human being. But, to say that her writing was simplistic or flawed or not philosophical is a simplification in the extreme. I think her critics need to remember from whence she came, what motivated her and what she was trying to accomplish.It's true, she wasn't a businessman and she may not have taken a college level course in economics but she actually did have the ability to convey, in writing, the dangers free men everywhere faced at the hands of the collective (be it socialist, communist or fascist). When she described her characters (especially the ones she found heroic), she imbued them with qualities that the rest of us could only aspire to.One of the characters she seemed to admire in a left-handed way was also one of the most tragic. At the end of THE FOUNTAINHEAD, after Howard Roark is found not guilty for the destruction of Cortlandt Homes, he is contacted by Gail Wynand. Wynand, who had once been a friend, admirer and supporter of Howard Roark's unbridled individualism had turned on him when his board of directors demanded a change of editorial policy for Wynand's flagship paper, &quot;The Banner.&quot; Wynand relents and denounces Roark. Despite the vilification of the press, Roark prevails when the jury exonerates him. Later, Wynand brings Roark to his office to commission him to design the Wynand building.As Wynand tells his former friend, &quot;I wish to undertake the construction of the Wynand building at once. I wish it to be the tallest structure of the city. Do not discuss with me the question of whether this is timely or economically advisable. I wish it built. It will be used--which is all that concerns you. It will house THE CLARION and all of the offices of Wynand Enterprises now located in various parts of the city. The rest of the space will be rented. I have sufficient standing left to guarantee that. You have no fear of erecting a useless structure. I shall send you a written statement on all details and requirements. The rest will be up to you. You will design the building as you wish. Your decisions will be final. They will not require my approval. You will have full charge and complete authority. This is stated in the contract. But I wish it understood thatI shall not have to see you. There will be an agent to represent me in all financial and technical matters. You will deal with him. If you find it necessary to communicate with me, you will do so through my agent. You are not to expect or attempt to see me. Should you do so, you will be refused admittance. I do not wish to speak to you. I do not wish to ever see you again. If you are prepared to comply with these conditions, please read the contract and sign it.&quot;As readers know, Roark reached over and without reading the contract, signed it. Wynand commented on this but Roark said nothing. He also assured Roark that there was enough left of the financial empire to see the Wyand Building to completion but, he also told Roark that the Wynand empire would die with him.As Wynand goes on, he bitterly condemns mankind for its race toward collectivism but, Roark remains optimistic. He tells his former friend, &quot;Mankind will never destroy itself, Mr. Wynand. Not so long as it does things such as this.&quot; &quot;As what?&quot; Wyand asked. &quot;As the Wynand Building.&quot; Wynand tells Roark that dead things, such as THE BANNER are only the financial fertilizer that make such things (as the Wynand Building) possible. As the novel races toward its hopeful ending, Wynand finishes with Roark. He says, &quot;I once told you that this building was to be a monument to my life. There is nothing to commemorate now. The Wyand Building will have nothing--except what you give it.&quot; Roark pays his last respects with a final bow. At the office door, Roark turns to look at his friend for what will be the last time. Wynand speaks a final time and says, &quot;Build it as a monument to that spirit which is yours....and could have been mine.&quot;I really believe that Rand genuinely liked Wynand but she had to introduce the fatal flaw. In this case, he could not measure up to the standards that Roark lived by. Wynand knew that for all of his success, he was nothing when measured by the standards applied to him by Rand.It has been 56 years since THE FOUNTAINHEAD was first published and 41 since ATLAS SHRUGGED. In her heyday, it was all too easy to dismiss Rand's works as amateurish and insignificant. It should be remembered that most Americans, when asked what two books have impacted them most reply, 1) The Holy Bible and 2) ATLAS SHRUGGED. Too many people miss the point of her work. If it gets the reader to think, to consider the world around them, then she has achieved her goal. Whether you like her philosophy and writing style or not,she continues to have a following long after the novels were first published. What other author of the last half of the 20th century can make that claim? What other philosophy continues to draw new generations of students?She was a complex and contradictory person. But if one reads her works with an open-mind, I think it will become readily apparent that Ayn Rand was in fact, a brilliant author. I have read her works over and over again since I first discovered her 30 years ago. Her philisophy is just as relevant today as the day she completed the books that made her famous.Don't listen to the critics. Read these works because you want to and because you want to be introduced to one of the most original thinkers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am always annoyed when people press this book on me. I've read it twice now -- I liked it even less the second time, and not just because Rand's writing is a mincemeat of ideas in a crust of stock characters. I'm annoyed because Rand gets re-printed and re-read in spades, while a philosopher with a thousand times her integrity and a far better writer, to boot, gets shucked. I'm talking about Albert Camus -- and if you think what he believes begins and ends with THE STRANGER (a good book, but by no means his only one), pick up THE REBEL and compare it to this bloated irrelevancy. Rand sincerely belived that contradictions in the human heart were soluble by logic. As much as I would like to believe that, it's just not the case. Did she really believe that all her enemies were the outspoken enemies of thinking? Or that maybe in her own camp there were plenty of people who stood against her, without mouthing the kind of nonsense she puts into the mouths of the characters she clearly designed to show them up? Ayn Rand is proof that philosophy -- and literature -- have to be more than mere wish-fulfillment and sullen foot-stamping."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand writes so beautifully and descriptively that it is difficult to put her books down. While the Fountanhead was a masterpiece, Atlas Shrugged, though long and at times tedious, is the finest written book I have ever been lucky enough to read.Her characters are masterful. The intrigue is gripping. Dagney Taggart and Hank Rearden are admirable characters who truly come to life.The book touches on subjects which apply today, over forty years later. They include: Big business and the role government; what happens when big government overtakes big business' ability to create and succeed. In many ways, it predicts the collapse of the Soviet Bloc.The book is deep, yet fun. I have never enjoyed a book more"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Objectivists seem to have a very difficult time seperating Rand's beliefs from her degree of talent. This seems to be the fundamental flaw that's threatening to undo the whole philosophy. Objectivists equate Rand's advocacy of reason with her powers of reason; as if human reasonableness could be gauged by one's enthusiasm for it; as if one were to sing odes of admiration to 50 ft. tall muscle bound giants and then turn around and say, \\"Now watch as I spin a Cadillac on the tip of my finger.\\" Just because Rand believed in reason doesn't necessarily mean that every word out of her mouth was the abolute incontestable truth. It doesn't necessarily mean that it would be wrong to have a female President, or that the government should be exclusively finaced by the rich (see \\"Government Financing in a Free Society\\", VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS pg. 136; and yes, I realize she stresses the hypothetical nature of the idea, but I don't think she fully understands the dangers that would be involved.) It doesn't mean that anyone who disagrees with one of her ideas, or maybe doesn't think that Atlas Shrugged is the greatest novel in all of western literature, is necessarily an enemy of reason or a life-hating witch doctor trying to destroy the world. Just because Rand defended and fought for what she called \\"The Men of Ability\\", just necessarily mean she was one of them. I don't think she had the mark of true genius I'm afraid; she lacked a sort of flair, a spark of improvisational cleverness, an overflowing vitality or even the neurotic tics that plague some geniuses. She was really more of an Eddie Willards, one of the smartest and loyalists that there were, but still a Willards just the same. She dreamed that she could pass in a world of Dagny Taggarts and John Galts, but she didn't really belong among them and I don't really believe she had the wit or the insight to depict them acurately. But still, she deverses credit and respect for her support."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is clearly a masterpiece of thought, from the philosophy to the characterization to the simple craft of writing. I find it hard to believe that Rand was accused of making unrealistic characters. Perhaps I find this accusation silly because I am related to one of the characters. I have an uncle who is so similar to Hank Rearden that they might as well be soul brothers. The only difference is that my uncle is not in metals and does not have blond hair. In his late 50's, my uncle is a hard and closed man with few friendships, with a net worth of at least $100 million, running the software firm he created with his own hands more than three decades ago. Let me say that just because we do not run into these people every day does not mean they do not exist.I have to suspect that many did not like the heroes and heroines of this book because they resented seeing a picture of greatness that they did not have a desire to live up to, or perhaps because of their secret knowledge that they could not live up to it if they tried. Some people have will power and inner strength and consistency, and others just don't.. Some people know deep down that if you give them the ball they will drop it, just as others know they will carry it. How can anyone accuse Rand of being inhuman because she did not believe in theft? Because she believed in glorifying achievement and giving credit where credit is due? I think a true meritocracy would be great. I welcome the day when parasites stop seeking to feed off my flesh.I do have a few problems with Rand's philosophy, however, which I feel obliged to point out.For one, she claims that altruism is the greatest sin, but in reality it is not altruism that she has so brutally characterized in the book. None of the villains in Atlas Shrugged- Taggart, Mouch, Lawson etc.- truly practiced altruism (selflessness). Rather, they hypocritically gave the mere Appearance of altruism in order to serve their own interests and desires. There is a major, major difference. Furthermore: the villains in Atlas Shrugged not only practiced phony altruism in an effort to gain status for themselves, they forced others to participate in their schemes. Again, BIG difference. If I give bread to a hungry child, that can be an act of altruism (selflessness) on my part (if I am doing it for the right motives and not to impress someone). But if I force YOU to give a piece of YOUR bread that you do not want to give, that is an act of violence on my part, NOT altruism, because I am forcing you to do something against your will. I am unfairly making you carry out my desires rather than respecting your freedom to do as you wish. Coercion and altruism are not the same thing at all. They are not even on the same plane. Rand has set up a straw man here. True selflessness does not harm society because it does not make any demands on anyone except the person acting- because if it does, it is no longer selflessness but coercion. When the weak make a claim on the strong, that is not altruism either. That is puling, self-abasing mockery and nothing more. Ironically, altruism was practiced by both of the heroes- Dagny and Hank. Dagny showed mercy to Cherryl Brooks, and Hank showed mercy to the \\"Wet Nurse\\" who changed his ways and wanted a job. There is nothing wrong with selflessness, as long as one does not try and force it on others or use the appearance of selflessness as a weapon or method for obtaining some desired thing, which is coercion and deceit.There was also a line repeated, \\"contradictions do not exist- if you have a contradiction, check your premises, one of them is wrong.\\" This is faulty philosophy. It is possible for two seemingly contradictory statements to hold truth and not be contradictory. For example, to borrow from CS Lewis, the three statements 1. Tybalt was killed by one man 2. Romeo killed Tybalt and 3. Shakespeare killed Tybalt are all true, though seemingly contradictory. Sometimes the lack of understanding is what creates the contradiction, not the factual error of one of the premises.I also find it hard to believe that man can find happiness in a handful of dust. Dagny and Hank's efforts, while noble, were in a way reminiscent of Ozymandias King of Kings- the worn down statue whose \\"greatness\\" was nothing more than dust and rubble. Rand provides the best hope for atheists- that is why I say that if I did not believe in God, then I would be one of her followers. But I do believe, and the objectivist/atheist case simply doesn't hold when it all comes down to it. If man was an accident, then all his creations were the byproduct of an accident, and if truth is not eternal, then it cannot exist in any form, and words have no more meaning than the waves crashing on a beach. The consistent atheist must accept that the babble of Simon Pritchett is true, to stand with Nietzche and say that there is no objective truth other than that which the powerful make useful for their ends. The objectivist / atheist must reject the witness of his own heart, the feeling of love for his children, as mere chemical twinges. He has to take pride in actions that will mean less than nothing two centuries hence. No thanks, Ann. I will take a reason for being that completes my circle of understanding, an understanding of why I am who I am, and an eternal purpose, over the empty final premise of my own flawed code any day."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book should be required reading for every High School student.

Would like to give more than 5 stars, but wasn't given the option. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I liked reading the book - it was fascinating in the way the characters seemed to be empty yet fulfilled I found intriguing for a book. As with any work, including ones of fiction, we ponder the world from their perspective on occasion.But, to suggest Rand was this guru of philosophical thought (while she applauded it - she also would have this smirk on her face that suggested 'the joke is on you' that I found less compelling as an endorsement of her writing as philosphy and more amused how her books came to draw attention. She was a smart person after all.However, the suggestion that Ayn Rands philosophy is NO different than those who follow the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard was a smart man who wrote great works of fiction - Rand & Hubbard sharing that in common. Rand and Hubbard developed intricate stories - of fiction - that they could talk about quite readily in the world around them. And, both Rand & Hubbard had a cult like dedication to books that when they were written knew their place(s) as works of fiction.The notion that Alan Greenspan would follow her work as a philosophy to guide his life and how he ran the federal reserve bank (something he later admitted, under oath before congress, was in error) has as much credibilty as a scientologist does in the assertions they make about theta units or ancient space races.That we are actually considering a person as a Vice Presidential candidate who has as a guiding force this 'philosophy' based on works of fiction would not be completely ridiculous until we stop to consider he wishes (as do others-as did Greenspan) precepts of these works of fiction to the lived life...to our, as the kids say RL \\"Real Life\\" is completely absurd. Those who think that's rational should never find themselves criticizing adherents of Scientology because you would be hypocrites for doing so.Again, a good book for the reasons I articulated above. But, ANY effort to take this work of fiction and apply it via some distorted sense of reality to how life should be is no different than the application of Hubbards work to Scientology. Frankly, that left me giving it three-stars as thinking the complexities of life can be housed in a singular authors work of fiction is disheartening."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like many classics, this book was well worth reading for myself just to know what's being talked about when it is referenced other places. It had its moments of brilliance and insight, and its ability to follow flawed logic to its eventual result should serve as a warning to mankind about the unintended consequences of making poor choices in the interest of short-term gain.That said, it contained long passages of undisguised preaching by the author, many of which rehashed the same topics ad nauseum. There were also several points where I simply had to put the book down in disgust because of the completely unbelievable reactions of the characters. I find it impossible to imagine that a man would contentedly turn over the woman he's passionately loved and fought for his whole life to his friend. Regardless of how good the friend is or how happy the woman would be, logic is not sufficient to explain such an action; that simply isn't the kind of decision one makes without gut-wrenching and heart- breaking inner struggle.

Sometimes this story becomes rather tedious and quite bogged down in philosophy but for the most part, is captivating.Anyway, the philosophy is valid and striking and it's spooky in its prescience. Small wonder that today, the looters are often heard to describe the book as having been very amusing when they were teenagers or in college, but now they understand the world and as mature adults dismiss it as merely silly nonsense.

I looked at this massive 1168 page book with foreboding but once I got started I was surprised to discover it was much better than I expected, exciting and suspenseful, and I flipped through the pages except when I got to the sex scenes which I well could have done without and which as someone else here has said were a torture to get through. (Incidentally, in these sudden violent unexpected outbursts of passion, in railway tunnels, and elsewhere, what sort of contraceptive measures do the protagonists use? Miss Rand never discusses such mundane details.) The heart to heart conversations between Rearden and d'Anconia I also found embarrassing. Miss Rand seems to have no conception of how men, even saintly geniuses, speak to one another in private. And as for John Galt's nation wide speech, I find it difficult to believe that more than a handful of people didn't turn off their radio after the first 5 minutes.Atlas Shrugged, of course, is a science fiction novel, maybe one of the best ever written, and should be read as such. (That is not to denigrate it in any way.) I loved all the amazing coincidences, the fantastic events, the destruction of the evil kingdom, and the triumph of the magicians (for that is what Rand's heros are) at the end.My greatest disappointment was in her description of the villains, especially the intellectuals. Rather than having them make infantile comments condemning logic and reason, if she had them speaking the nonsense that real academics and intellectuals actually do speak, it could have been a much more powerful book.I suppose the moral of the book is that ugly and stupid people hate good-looking smart people and use morality to try to destroy them, but by a certain age everyone should know that, even if they haven't read Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Poignant novel of our present times.

It will certainly hold up better than a paperback and it is a bargain for a hardcover but I can't say I'm impressed with the quality here. It will certainly wear well with me, but I'm not confident it is tough enough to last long circulating at a library."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not my review. This is from the December 28th 1957 issue of the National Review (W.F. Buckley's magazine). It's a review of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" by one of the Right's heroes, Whittaker Chambers. There is little I could possible add to it:\\"Several years ago, Miss Ayn Rand wrote The Fountainhead. Despite a generally poor press, it is said to have sold some four hundred thousand copies. Thus, it became a wonder of the book trade of a kind that publishers dream about after taxes. So Atlas Shrugged had a first printing of one hundred thousand copies. It appears to be slowly climbing the best-seller lists.The news about this book seems to me to be that any ordinarily sensible head could not possibly take it seriously, and that, apparently, a good many do. Somebody has called it: \\"Excruciatingly awful.\\" I find it a remarkably silly book. It is certainly a bumptious one. Its story is preposterous. It reports the final stages of a final conflict (locale: chiefly the United States, some indefinite years hence) between the harried ranks of free enterprise and the \\"looters.\\" These are proponents of proscriptive taxes, government ownership, labor, etc., etc. The mischief here is that the author, dodging into fiction, nevertheless counts on your reading it as political reality. This,\\" she is saying in effect, \\"is how things really are. These are the real issues, the real sides. Only your blindness keeps you from seeing it, which, happily, I have come to rescue you from.\\"Since a great many of us dislike much that Miss Rand dislikes, quite as heartily as she does, many incline to take her at her word. It is the more persuasive, in some quarters, because the author deals wholly in the blackest blacks and the whitest whites. In this fiction everything, everybody, is either all good or all bad, without any of those intermediate shades which, in life, complicate reality and perplex the eye that seeks to probe it truly. This kind of simplifying pattern, of course, gives charm to most primitive storyknown as: The War between the Children of Light and the Children of Darkness. In modern dress, it is a class war. Both sides to it are caricatures.The Children of Light are largely operatic caricatures. Insofar as any of them suggests anything known to the business community, they resemble the occasional curmudgeon millionaire, tales about whose outrageously crude and shrewd eccentricities sometimes provide the lighter moments in boardrooms. Otherwise, the Children of Light are geniuses. One of them is named (the only smile you see will be your own): Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian dAntonio. This electrifying youth is the world's biggest copper tycoon. Another, no less electrifying, is named: Ragnar Danesjold. He becomes a twentieth-century pirate. All Miss Rand's chief heroes are also breathtakingly beautiful. So is her heroine (she is rather fetchingly vice president in charge of management of a transcontinental railroad).So much radiant energy might seem to serve a eugenic purpose. For, in this story as in Mark Twain's, \\"all the knights marry the princess\\" -- though without benefit of clergy. Yet from the impromptu and surprisingly gymnastic matings of the heroine and three of the heroes, no children -- it suddenly strikes you -- ever result. The possibility is never entertained. And, indeed, the strenuously sterile world of Atlas Shrugged is scarcely a place for children. You speculate that, in life, children probably irk the author and may make her uneasy. How could it be otherwise when she admiringly names a banker character (by what seems to me a humorless master-stroke): Midas Mulligan? You may fool some adults; you can't fool little boys and girls with such stuff -- not for long. They may not know just what is out of line, but they stir uneasily. The Children of Darkness are caricatures, too; and they are really oozy. But at least they are caricatures of something identifiable. Their archetypes are Left-Liberals, New Dealers, Welfare Statists, One Worlders, or, at any rate, such ogreish semblances of these as may stalk the nightmares of those who think little about people as people, but tend to think a great deal in labels and effigies. (And neither Right nor Left, be it noted in passing, has a monopoly of such dreamers, though the horrors in their nightmares wear radically different masks and labels.)In Atlas Shrugged, all this debased inhuman riffraff is lumped as \\"looters.\\" This is a fairly inspired epithet. It enables the author to skewer on one invective word everything and everybody that she fears and hates. This spares her the playguy business of performing one service that her fiction might have performed, namely: that of examining in human depth how so feeble a lot came to exist at all, let alone be powerful enough to be worth hating and fearing. Instead, she bundles them into one undifferentiated damnation.\\"Looters\\" loot because they believe in Robin Hood, and have got a lot of other people believing in him, too. Robin Hood is the author's image of absolute evil -- robbing the strong (and hence good) to give to the weak (and hence no good). All \\"looters\\" are base, envious, twisted, malignant minds, motivated wholly by greed for power, combined with the lust of the weak to tear down the strong, out of a deepseated hatred of life and secret longing for destruction and death. There happens to be a tiny (repeat: tiny) seed of truth in this. The full clinical diagnosis can be read in the pages of Friedrich Nietzsche. (Here I must break in with an aside. Miss Rand acknowledges a grudging debt to one, and only one, earlier philosopher: Aristotle. I submit that she is indebted, and much more heavily, to Nietzsche. Just as her operatic businessmen are, in fact, Nietzschean supermen, so her ulcerous leftists are Nietzsche's \\"last men,\\" both deformed in a way to sicken the fastidious recluse of Sils Maria. And much else comes, consciously or not, from the same source.) Happily, in Atlas Shrugged (though not in life), all the Children of Darkness are utterly incompetent.So the Children of Light win handily by declaring a general strike of brains, of which they have a monopoly, letting the world go, literally, to smash. In the end, they troop out of their Rocky Mountain hideaway to repossess the ruins. It is then, in the book's last line, that a character traces in the dir, over the desolate earth,\\" the Sign of the Dollar, in lieu of the Sign of the Cross, and in token that a suitably prostrate mankind is at last ready, for its sins, to be redeemed from the related evils of religion and social reform (the \\"mysticism of mind\\" and the \\"mysticism of muscle\\").That Dollar Sign is not merely provocative, though we sense a sophomoric intent to raise the pious hair on susceptible heads. More importantly, it is meant to seal the fact that mankind is ready to submit abjectly to an elite of technocrats, and their accessories, in a New Order, enlightened and instructed by Miss Rand's ideas that the good life is one which \\"has resolved personal worth into exchange value,\\" \\"has left no other nexus between man and man than naked selfinterest, than callous \\"cash-payment.\\"' The author is explicit, in fact deafening, about these prerequisites. Lest you should be in any doubt after 1,168 pages, she assures you with a final stamp of the foot in a postscript:And I mean it.\\" But the words quoted above are those of Karl Marx. He, too, admired \\"naked self-interest\\" (in its time and place), and for much the same reasons as Miss Rand: because, he believed, it cleared away the cobwebs of religion and led to prodigies of industrial and cognate accomplishment. The overlap is not as incongruous as it looks. Atlas Shrugged can be called a novel only by devaluing the term. It is a massive tract for the times. Its story merely serves Miss Rand to get the customers inside the tent, and as a soapbox for delivering her Message. The Message is the thing. It is, in sum, a forthright philosophic materialism. Upperclassmen might incline to sniff and say that the author has, with vast effort, contrived a simple materialist system, one, intellectually, at about the stage of the oxcart, though without mastering the principle of the wheel. Like any consistent materialism, this one begins by rejecting God, religion, original sin, etc., etc. (This book's aggressive atheism and rather unbuttoned \\"higher morality,\\" which chiefly outrage some readers, are, in fact, secondary ripples, and result inevitably from its underpinning premises.) Thus, Randian Man, like Marxian Man, is made the center of a godless world.At that point, in any materialism, the main possibilities open up to Man. 1) His tragic fate becomes, without God, more tragic and much lonelier. In general, the tragedy deepens according to the degree of pessimism or stoicism with which he conducts his \\"hopeless encounter between human questioning and the silent universe.\\" Or, 2) Man's fate ceases to be tragic at all. Tragedy is bypassed by the pursuit of happiness. Tragedy is henceforth pointless. Henceforth man's fate, without God, is up to him, and to him alone. His happiness, in strict materialist terms, lies with his own workaday hands and ingenious brain. His happiness becomes, in Miss Rand's words, \\"the moral purpose of his fife.\\"Here occurs a little rub whose effects are just as observable in a free-enterprise system, which is in practice materialist (whatever else it claims or supposes itself to be), as they would be under an atheist socialism, if one were ever to deliver that material abundance that all promise. The rub is that the pursuit of happiness, as an end in itself, tends automatically, and widely, to be replaced by the pursuit of pleasure, with a consequent general softening of the fibers of will, intelligence, spirit. No doubt, Miss Rand has brooded upon that little rub. Hence in part, I presume, her insistence on man as a heroic being\\" With productive achievement as his noblest activity.\\" For, if Man's heroism\\" (some will prefer to say: human dignity\\") no longer derives from God, or is not a function of that godless integrity which was a root of Nietzsche's anguish, then Man becomes merely the most consuming of animals, with glut as the condition of his happiness and its replenishment his foremost activity. So Randian Man, at least in his ruling caste, has to be held \\"heroic\\" in order not to be beastly. And this, of course, suits the author's economics and the politics that must arise from them. For politics, of course, arise, though the author of Atlas Shrugged stares stonily past them, as if this book were not what, in fact, it is, essentially -- a political book. And here begins mischief. Systems of philosophic materialism, so long as they merely circle outside this world's atmosphere, matter little to most of us. The trouble is that they keep coming down to earth. It is when a system of materialist ideas presumes to give positive answers to real problems of our real life that mischief starts. In an age like ours, in which a highly complex technological society is everywhere in a high state of instability, such answers, however philosophic, translate quickly into political realities. And in the degree to which problems of complexity and instability are most bewildering to masses of men, a temptation sets in to let some species of Big Brother solve and supervise them.One Big Brother is, of course, a socializing elite (as we know, several cut-rate brands are on the shelves). Miss Rand, as the enemy of any socializing force, calls in a Big Brother of her own contriving to do battle with the other. In the name of free enterprise, therefore, she plumps for a technocratic elite (I find no more inclusive word than technocratic to bracket the industrial-financial-engineering caste she seems to have in mind). When she calls \\"productive achievement\\" man's noblest activity,\\" she means, almost exclusively, technological achievement, supervised by such a managerial political bureau. She might object that she means much, much more; and we can freely entertain her objections. But, in sum, that is just what she means. For that is what, in reality, it works out to. And in reality, too, by contrast with fiction, this can only head into a dictatorship, however benign, living and acting beyond good and evil, a law unto itself (as Miss Rand believes it should be), and feeling any restraint on itself as, in practice, criminal, and, in morals, vicious (as Miss Rand clearly feels it to be). Of course, Miss Rand nowhere calls for a dictatorship. I take her to be calling for an aristocracy of talents. We cannot labor here why, in the modern world, the pre-conditions for aristocracy, an organic growth, no longer exist, so that the impulse toward aristocracy always emerges now in the form of dictatorship.Nor has the author, apparently, brooded on the degree to which, in a wicked world, a materialism of the Right and a materialism of the Left first surprisingly resemble, then, in action, tend to blend each with each, because, while differing at the top in avowed purpose, and possibly in conflict there, at bottom they are much the same thing. The embarrassing similarities between Hitler's National Socialism and Stalin's brand of Communism are familiar. For the world, as seen in materialist view from the Right, scarcely differs from the same world seen in materialist view from the Left. The question becomes chiefly: who is to run that world in whose interests, or perhaps, at best, who can run it more efficiently?Something of this implication is fixed in the book's dictatorial tone, which is much its most striking feature. Out of a lifetime of reading, I can recall no other book in which a tone of overriding arrogance was so implacably sustained. Its shrillness is without reprieve. Its dogmatism is without appeal. In addition, the mind which finds this tone natural to it shares other characteristics of its type. 1) It consistently mistakes raw force for strength, and the rawer the force, the more reverent the posture of the mind before it. 2) It supposes itself to be the bringer of a final revelation. Therefore, resistance to the Message cannot be tolerated because disagreement can never be merely honest, prudent, or just humanly fallible. Dissent from revelation so final (because, the author would say, so reasonable) can only be willfully wicked. There are ways of dealing with such wickedness, and, in fact, right reason itself enjoins them. From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: \\"To a gas chamber -- go!\\" The same inflexibly self-righteous stance results, too (in the total absence of any saving humor), in odd extravagances of inflection and gesture-that Dollar Sign, for example. At first, we try to tell ourselves that these are just lapses, that this mind has, somehow, mislaid the discriminating knack that most of us pray will warn us in time of the difference between what is effective and firm, and what is wildly grotesque and excessive. Soon we suspect something worse. We suspect that this mind finds, precisely in extravagance, some exalting merit; feels a surging release of power and passion precisely in smashing up the house. A tornado might feel this way, or Carrie Nation.We struggle to be just. For we cannot help feeling at least a sympathetic pain before the sheer labor, discipline, and patient craftsmanship that went to making this mountain of words. But the words keep shouting us down. In the end that tone dominates. But it should be its own antidote, warning us that anything it shouts is best taken with the usual reservations with which we might sip a patent medicine. Some may like the flavor. In any case, the brew is probably without lasting ill effects. But it is not a cure for anything. Nor would we, ordinarily, place much confidence in the diagnosis of a doctor who supposes that the Hippocratic Oath is a kind of curse.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has some interesting ideas of politics, sociology, and economics. And while she is wrong, she is, on balance, a lot more accurate than Karl Marx. She is also a good writer, as evidenced by _The Fountainhead_. But she has neither the literary not the philosophical ability to fill the pages of this book.She uses her narrative to condemn \\"collectivism,\\" a catch-all that includes any idea with any socialist tendencies (by her standards, the New Deal is radically socialist). She does this by positing the invention of a miraculous metal, stronger, ligher, and cheaper than steel. The big, evil government steps in a regulates who can purchase this metal, meaning that the benefits never reach either inventor or society. Unfortunately, we are never told why there aren't more factories producing the metal. Under any economic system, even communism, when there is a product that is better and can be produced without retooling factories, it quickly takes over. In a book this long one could explore a more subtle scenario, but, inexplicably, Ayn Rand chooses not to.I cannot give away the ending as I gave up about halfway through. What put me over the edge was a character engaging in a long diatribe against any form of income tax.

It is because it is not literature. The characters are obviousley wooden puppets with no motivation of their own except to prove the puppeteer's ideas.

And to top it off, the author makes the beginner's mistake of having her protagonist, John Galt, pontificate for pages and pages, ad nauseum. Didn't this woman have an editor?Ayn Rand claims that her philosophy is based on logic but it is not. Not unless you define logic as a priori statements made by Ayn Rand. Productive work is the greatest good? That is just a statement. It is not a logical argument. I could just as validly state that the greatest good is to drink a lot of beer, watch a lot of football, and have a lot of sex.\\"Wait!\\" the objectivists could protest. \\"What would become of society if everyone spent their time drinking beer and watching football and having sex?\\" But I never said that's ALL we would do.

I'm a pragmatist and I just couldn't find much of interest here in Atlas Shrugged. What made it tough reading to stay interested was the railroad business thing. James never committed to anything, never making a single decision or ever taking responsibility, sidestepping responsibility in fact and trying to pin it on everybody else, anybody else, cynical and critical like my grandma from my dad's side was, and James' sister always made on the spot decisions and took charge. But I just couldn't find the interest in reading about a railroad business. It was like trudging trhough 1000 pages of gobblygook.

The novel itself has had a &quot;life altering&quot; influence on people who seem incapable of judging the literary merit seperate from the philosophy. These are not complex characters and the structure, plot, setting, atmosphere, and language are neither ideal nor original enough to make it the &quot;greatest novel of all time&quot; - no matter how much you &quot;love&quot; the plot and message. 3. Reader views seem so extreme. Why is this novel so loved and scorned? I suspect that the controversy is more political than literary. Contrast Atlas Shrugged with The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffans and you get a glimpse of polarized America. Steffans documents the real life graft, waste and corruption of America when industrial magnates did rule unfettered by laws. I do agree, however, that Atlas Shrugged is worth the read.

The plot, hackneyed as it is, groans under the weight of pseudophilosophical pretention that Rand heaps on it.In a way this book is very much like the newly-revived religious classic, &quot;What Would Jesus Do,&quot; in that both books are not meant to entertain the reader, but rather browbeat the reader into accepting the religious tenets of the author.

If you gather together these messages and decode them properly, they reveal some amazing insights of Objectivist thinking, and likewise form a much more exciting novel than &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;For all its charms, though, I still find this novel less readable than Wittgenstein's &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For years I have put off reading Atlas Shrugged by the sheer size of the work. But after just completing Ms. Rand's masterpiece, I am sorry I waited so long.Although I agree with her critics that her philosophical view can seem a little harsh (especially as to her observations about family), her commentary on the world and economics are right on.I believe what makes a classic is its continued relevance throughout any period of history. Under this standard, Ann Rynd's masterpiece is a classic. In today's world where America is being criticized for its &quot;go it alone&quot; attitude and putting its self interest above the &quot;collective good&quot;, the ghost of Ann Rynd can be heard. Her work is very relevant and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Reading Atlas Shrugged in high school 25 years ago woke me up. For the first time, I realized that there were other people in the world who actually thought about what makes the world go round. She helped me understand (through extremely long and convoluted speaches by the main characters sometimes) that there is nothing wrong with doing what's right for it's own sake, that making a profit is a good thing (remember, this was the 70's) and that a man can stand up for what he thinks is right. To one's own self be true, always act in a responsible manner, believe in yourself first and foremost. This author changed my life with this book. I read it again every 5 years or so. It's not the most well written book in the world, but it contains the most meaningful message of any I've ever read. Read this book. Form your own opinions. Think for yourself about where you fit in the world. Thank the stars for teachers like Nadine Royer who first encouraged me to pick up this 5 pound eye-opener."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a beautiful achievement of a novel. Rand draws the reader in from page one with well-crafted (if not completely realistic) dialogue, strong (if not entirely believable) characters, and a perfectly interwoven web of events, catastrophies, and suprises that are far, far above anything you'd find in most novels. Atlas Shrugged is an inspiring and gorgeous experience, a view of men as they should be, and of the possibilities that we, as humans, are presented with at birth. Perhaps its larger than life scope is unrealistic, but this book is a format for a thought-provoking and eye-opening philosophy: it is not touted by anyone as a story about average people doing average things. You may not agree with everything you find in Atlas Shrugged, but you don't have to live it to appreciate it. Take what you can and move on. A book I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Back in 1984, when I was but a 20 year old, a friend reccommended I read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. He thought I would like it so much that he loaned me his first edition copy to read. I tried to read it about three times before I just became too frustrated to go on. A few years down the road, my mom gave me the paperback edition for Christmas. I plunged through it and my life has forever been changed. I used to have a quite liberal view of life, but after reading (and oftentimes throwing) this book, I came to understand the world around me a lot better. Adam Smith was right, the &quot;invisible hand&quot; will always correct the market. When governments attempt to fool with said hand, chaos will ensue. Who is John Galt? Read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and you'll understand why Mr. Galt is so important to our free market economy. This book just may change YOUR life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a fantastic read. Once you get through the first 100 pages you wont be able to put it down. A frightening vision that is now taking place in the US"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In her ode to the mind, Ayn Rand articluates the thoughts of anyone who ever felt pride in thinking an original thought. If you ever wondered how society can possibly condescend a person who attains great weath because they made a discovery that benefits everyone, this book will be enlightening. If you have not, you need to read this book to find out why. If you are looking for passive entertainment, make another choice. This book will challege you and it requires careful reading. It is widely misunderstood: Rand does not advocate greed in any sense. The desire to receive just payment in exchange for ability is not greed. The desire for wealth at any cost is greed, and Rand speaks out ardently against undeserved wealth. Keep an open mind and enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas shrugged is so profound that it is timeless. The characters and the beliefs that drive them can be applied to the world today with our current struggle between the looters and the producers. You will find yourself laughing out loud as you see similarities between the fictional looters of the book, and their flesh and blood incarnations that run many agencies and universities today. Not only is the book thought provoking, but it is beautifully written. Ayn Rand is so precise with her word usage that the book would suffer if any were changed. If you want a great story, powerful characters, and what has become a timeless theme, then Atlas Shrugged is for you. Those that hate this book probably see themselves or their ideas in it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the book that changed the way I think about life and our world, from economics to ethics to love.After graduating from the University of California with a degree in Philosophy, I had never heard of Ayn Rand. Luckily, my mother gave me the book and I read it sparingly at first, and ravenously through the middle and end. Rand's style and insight, and her ability to put words to those facets of human nature that so often elude us, is absolutely stunning.Moreover, the philosophic tenets of this work are both easily accessible, practical and of utmost importance in today's world. Many self-important academic philosophers criticize Rand's work as &quot;unsophisticated,&quot; though it is precisely this characteristic of Rand's work that deserves praise. As the renowned physicist Richard Feynman once said, if one can't prepare a freshman (layperson) lecture on a subject, then one doesn't really understand it. Rand understands philosophy.Many other critics rail against Rand's work without ever having read it. And then there are those who, like some of the characters in Rand's novel, are so insecure and frightened by the thought of rational selfishness that they hurl inane comments about Rand's work with vigorous enthusiasm. These negatives only serve to prove the arguments made by Rand in Atlas Shrugged.If you only read one Rand book (or one book, for that matter), read Atlas Shrugged or listen to it on Audio Tape. And pay attention."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's masterpiece has helped me shape my beliefs and commitments to my life and to my work. I have read it many times and each time I discover new dimensions and learnings. In addition, it is a wonderfully romantic and exciting story and is impossible to put down. &quot;I swear--by my life and my love of it--that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine&quot;, John Galt, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The publisher is just ripping people on the Kindle edition. The paper back's 9.99 whereas the Kindle edition is 18.99??They must be crazy! So sad to review one my all time favorite books at 1 star because of this."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I notice that the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars. Anyone who would plow through this ponderous mess of a novel and still give it one star must be a masochist. But the 5 star reviwers don't surprise me. They are the type of people who desperatly want certainty in their lives. So did Ayn Rand, and she wanted it so much that she couldn't talk of anything else. I found the book interesting reading in parts but way way too long. Silly little John Galt should have been shipped off to a salt mine to sweat off his genius. Those who think it is the greatest book ever written (something many reviewers state) obviously need to broaden their reading, or perhaps get out in the world and do a bit of work. And as far as the parasites that Ayn talks about, bear in mind that Ayn Rand never produced so much as a homegrown tomato. Failed marriages due to her infidelity (trying to find her hero), debts she never paid, a standard of living she never earned. She never really worked to pay her way, unless you consider the income from some of the worst books ever written. It is probably not fair to get personal with Ayn but she really begs for it. The &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is actually a fair book and has everything &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; has with about 1/4 of the words."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have only one minor question about the works of Ayn Rand, and especially Atlas Shrugged: Has anybody ever read this book and NOT immediately identified with the heros Gault, Rearden or Taggart? I, like the majority of others who have read this book, was immediately sucked in by the prospect of comparing myself to John Gault and that desire was intentionally fed by Rand's ability to craft a world so biased and unrealistic that I had no other choice. Every person I have ever known who has read this book, and judging by the reviews here on Amazon, nearly every person who ever read it, inevtiably finds themselves so much like the heros that it is essentially a life changing experience. But that fact that EVERYBODY who reads this book comes to the same conclusion, the conclusion that they (the reader) are like John Gault or Dagny Taggart, while the rest of the world is made up of nothing but unproductived, weak-willed saps, seems to me to undermine Rand's basic theory that the world is split into such factions. Has anybody ever read this book and found themselves relating to the characters who are portrayed as incompetent louts? No. Thus, according to Rand and her followers, everybody who sees the heroism and greatness of Gault et al. is a member of that most treasured class simply by the fact that they realize it. I am willing to bet that most fans of this book would probably be despised by Rand herself who, short of creating the pseudo-philosophy of Objectivism and writing lengthy fictionalized dissertations on it, did little worthwhile in her lifetime and probably deserves to be despised herself. And so, those who love this book do so because it allows them to pretend they have original thoughts and something to offer this world, when in reality, they have simply stolen someone else's philsophy and attempted to profit from it. Thus, they are no different than those characters in Rand's books who believe themselves to be making valuable contributions to society though, in reality, they do little but coast along on the genius of John Gault, Hank Rearden or Dagny Taggart."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Five stars, one star. Five stars, one star. Over and over the same pattern. Seems as humans, we're evenly divided into two camps: those who think everything is fundamentally simple, and those who think things are complex and interrelated. If you're a member of the former camp - the &quot;right vs. wrong,&quot; &quot;good vs. evil,&quot; &quot;us vs. them&quot; set - you'll probably enjoy Atlas Shrugged; you'll think Rand tells it like it is and you'll like her powerful writing style too. Thank you for reading my review, and enjoy the book.But if you're a member of the latter camp - if you value subtlety, insight, complex characters, a believable plot, and thought-provoking dialogue - then RUN from Ayn Rand. Unless you're researching how the &quot;us vs. them&quot; crowd thinks, in which case you should stock up on Tylenol first. To read Rand is to have the sensation of someone pounding on your forehead with a hammer. Penguin Putnam ought to attach a medal to the inside back cover as a reward to anyone who made it through the book. I know I wanted one.Full review follows:Non-ideologues and those attempting to read Atlas as literature and not as a political doctrine are almost certain to be disappointed by the book. It fails for sheer lack of merit. Its characters, while colorfully imagined, are not provided with distinctive voices. One sounds much like another - strident, tendentious, and monothematic. Sentences run on to become paragraphs, paragraphs run on to become chapters, and some characters' lines - most notably Galt's - run on to become full-blown speeches of fifty pages or more. If you've ever wondered how a writer could develop diarrhea of the pen and create a book four or five times longer than it needs to be, Atlas is a must-read.Any editor could have improved this book. We can almost hear Rand, fresh from her success with The Fountainhead, telling the publisher &quot;you will print it exactly as is. Not one word changed, not one sentence deleted. Otherwise I will take it somewhere else.&quot; At 1,000-plus pages, Atlas is a monument to the writer's ego.And it reads it. There is no hint of Rand's humanity; she coldly kills off the bulk of the human race so that an ultra-talented, atheistic cabal can inherit the world. That one might not want to live in the resultant society of mass-murderers is never examined, because at the end of the book everyone is either capitalist or dead. I wonder how long it would be before the survivors started killing each other off as well - because hey, if I have what's yours as well as what's mine, that's twice as good. Without a system of ethics or morals to guide us, human society quickly degenerates to the tribal. Trust me, you don't want to go back to the jungle.Poor character development, strident tone, bad dialogue, wildly improbable plot, no examination of complex issues, no presentation of alternative or conflicting viewpoints, no sense of humanity, and an editor paid to vacation in Miami until after the book had come out. I give this book exactly one star."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book because more than one person recommended it to me. Its supposed controversy has made it popular as you can see by the number of reviews here. I was quite disappointed.Atlas shrugged starts out as an okay book, but gets worse the more you read it. I think that Ayn Rand could have been a great novelist if she could have gotten over her own philosophies. Don't get me wrong, I really don't have to big a problem with objectivism, but her relentless attempts to shove it down my throat through her story ruined what could have been a decent novel.I'm not saying that a novel should be pure entertainment and devoid of any kind of message, agenda, philosophy, or moral. But when overdone, as was the case in Atlas Shrugged, it ruins the readability of the novel. By the time I was done reading, I had lost all respect for Ayn Rand and many of her ideas.Her characters were horribly unbelievable, the plot drug on, and on, and on. Nothing is worse than John Galt&#8217;s radio monologue near the end of the book in which he restates all the ideas that have already been presented in the previous two thirds of the book. I felt like she was attempting to brainwash me or maybe just bludgeon me into submission.Have you ever actually read an entire long-form landing page on the internet? That&#8217;s kinda what this book reminds me of. Usually the landing page promotes some sort of get-rich-quick scheme or miracle product that will cure all your ills. The content goes on and on. It seems like they think if they right enough, it will convince you. I think Ayn Rand took the same philosophy. Write enough, and eventually people will buy into it.It&#8217;s too bad because some of the ideas in this book are great. Ideas related to the story as well as objectivism. I don&#8217;t buy all the objectivism mantras presented, but some of them really do have value. I might give Rand one more chance and read Fountainhead, but my expectations are now quite low."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After finishing this book, I am so disappointed that I wish there would be a way I could sue the author for my stolen time with such crap.

You, The Publisher, deserve NO STARS at all!!I am a libertarian, you are free to set your price as I am free NOT to buy your product!Note: There is a Kindle price of $11 bucks but not if you are in the US!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was bored to tears wading my way through the liquid concrete of Ayn Rand's self-praising philosophical treatise poorly disguised as a novel. I actually agree wholeheartedly with many aspects of her philosophy as presented in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Its the method of presentation in Atlas Shrugged that sabotages itself. Unlike the powerful prose of The Fountainhead, that of Atlas Shrugged is lazy and repetitive. Unlike the believable, vivid characters presented in The Fountainhead, those of Atlas Shrugged are mere merrionettes. Here are just a couple of the things about this book that made it pure misery to read:1. Where in The Fountainhead Ayn Rand's prose was a tad melodramatic, yet tolerable for its moments of powerful beauty and awe; that of Rand in Atlas Shrugged goes off the deep end into the realm of self-stroking pretentious drivel. Wading through this morass of what was often times simply poor writing, was frequently painful. She beats home the same points over...and over...and over again. It's almost as if between the time she wrote Fountainhead and Atlas, she became so in love with her own philosophy that she forgot that fiction is written to stimulate and entertain an audience. Instead of reading fiction, the reader is continuously hammered over the head with \\"Socialists bad! Capitalists GOOD!\\" Ok, Ayn, WE GET IT! You could have stopped repeating yourself about 600 pages earlier and had yourself a better novel. But instead, out of respect for The Fountainhead and the hope that it would somehow get better and redeem the first 600 or so pages, I had to force myself to keep plodding forward through the muck.2. Unlike the believable, human characters in The Fountainhead (both protagonist and antagonist), the characters Ayn created for Atlas Shrugged are cartoonishly simple caricatures of human beings. Those who live by any rules other than those of her personal philosophy, Objectivism, are portrayed as borderline-retarded, drooling, ugly, miserable, and stupid to the point of absurdity. Read, \\"Socialism BAD!\\" By contrast, those who live by her principles are portrayed in a glowing light of supernatural beauty. They are physically flawless, at least in Rand's eyes, with a repetitive, overused description of being tall, thin, having a lean face with angular lines, and graceful. Almost every protagonist in Atlas Shrugged is described in exactly this way. I started to notice this after the introduction of the first handful of protagonists.Aside from the cookie-cutter repetitive characterizations that show a genuine simple-minded, lazy approach by Rand, neither the protagonists or antagonists are truly believable as human beings. The protagonists are made up of nothing but intrinsically bad qualities(i.e. no work ethic, lazy, drooling, physically weak, oftentimes obese, eyes out of focus and moist, pale skin, etc.), while the only subjectively bad qualities displayed by the protagonists are an intense, repressed proclivity towards sexual deviance. It's one thing to have a good work ethic and sound judgment. It's entirely another to be one of the robotic superhuman supermodel heroes with perfect hair that Ayn obviously portrays as the right type of human existence. Casting these two polar opposites as your protagonists/antagonists makes for a very dull, predictable series of pseudo-conflicts whose resolution is never in doubt. I found myself, by page 600 or so, just skimming forward to see if this repetitive pattern ever changed. Even with the revelation of the secret society, which itself was given away more or less several times (including in the very first chapter of the novel, believe it or not) before it was actually revealed, there were not any really climactic moments worth reading for.In Rand's defense, I will say that she initially makes a good case against the evils of Socialistic governmental policies. I myself have questioned many of the things I was brought up to believe as a result of reading some of her written work. But reading Atlas Shrugged, apart from the philosophy and simply as a fiction novel, was painful and mostly not entertaining. There was an overabundance of bad prose, and it was too preachy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"To all those who hate this book... you just don't understand. People are not born to be servents to others. Period. Even if it does benefit in the short run, charity to all does not make the most of human beings. It isn't as if you have to hate the government totally to be an Objectivist, or hate religion, or think that businesspeople are the saviors of our world... but isn't it true that governments over the years have commited acts of insanity in the name of the \\"common good\\"? The Holocaust, the Crusades? (And those were about religion too...) Shouldn't we question them? And where would you be if you didn't have businesspeople making your medicines, your food...? And what if they weren't going to get anything out of it? Would they work? Would we have anything worth having? If people didn't do for themselves, if they didn't have a reason to innovate (self-benefit being the reason) where would humanity be? (Check out the USSR.) Atlas Shrugged (and books like the Sword of Truth series, which might satisfy the emotions of some detractors of Ms. Rand a little more) is meant to be a perfect vison. And while Ayn Rand was very militant in her beliefs, she had to be! She wanted to change the world, and knew that what was holding back this place was the fact that there WAS evil out there holding back humanity... people that are so capable it is beyond most of us to understand... we don't even think enough of ourselves! (What with government and religion telling us we cannot survive and that we are nothing without them...) When you believe in something that strongly, and that billions of people are being hurt and dying for insane reasons, wouldn't you be angry? This is why Objectivists are so defensive. I saw one review that espoused that books that don't show gritty reality aren't true to life. Have you ever thought of what causes life to be so hard for so many? Is it because we are taught to be underachievers... taught to hate the successful... even though you or I is as capable as any idiot government servent, or cult leader... evil prospers when good does nothing. This is true... but what is evil? It certainly isn't Ms. Rand, or me... or Howard Roarke... it's the people of the world that are writing here telling us that we should hate what she has taught... that we are nothing, capable of nothing extraordinany and we should remember that and live to die. Well, no matter what you cynics out there say... I am not an 18 year old person who will change. I am a 22 year old woman who is going out there to change the world. And you will never convince me that I will not be able to do it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"just wanted to post a five star vote.most important book ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Best book I have read in my life without a close 2nd..not even The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the Objectivist Bible and, like its Christian counterpart, is long, repetitive, presumptuous, allegorical, and contrived towards making its point. Also like its Christian counterpart, it strongly reaffirms the faithful and violently enrages the heretics.On one side there are the individualists, who believe that society is just another tool for survival, and that each and every human is in charge of his or her own destiny, independent from the needs and wants of any other person. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and charity always has a hidden cost. These readers will find Atlas Shrugged to contain a number of parables and morality plays designed to illustrate the logic behind those concepts, and will help them to collect their thoughts into a cohesive philosophy.On the other side are the socialists, who believe that civilization as a whole is greater than any one life. Individuals may come and go, but society is eternal. Any attempt by an individual to rise above the role established for him or her by society is a detriment to the future of that society. These readers, if they can make it through Atlas Shrugged, will (hopefully) find a logical, intelligent opposition to their views, and in the light of that discovery, may understand their own viewpoints better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just reading this book is a life changing experience!

On the second reading, I prepared an index of definitions. Today, I would suggest that you get the superb writes better definitions. (Check out her definitions of grammatical terms in INTRODUCTION TO OBJECTIVIST EPISTEMOLOGY). I got excommunicated from her group because one was expected to be independent in one's thinking -- except when it came to Rand and her beliefs (she loathed Bach, Beethoven and Mozart and liked Friml and Victor Herbert) She had the greatest mind of any woman in history, a great love of America, freedom and laissez-faire. Yet, she was also the most authoritarian person I ever met, and so are her Frederich Nietzsche, who influenced Rand WE THE LIVING and whose influence she later denied, and Aristotle, whose writing is like listening to music of the baroque. Rand is NEVER dull. Her plots are superbly crafted, and she is a terrific story-teller.As a lapsed Objectivist, I prefer THE FOUNTAINHEAD which I read 25 times -- and which did more to destroy the altruism that underpinned Communism and racist Nazism than any book ever written (or film ever made)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was an open atheist, but I won't let the irony prevent me from comparing the effect of this book to that of a religious conversion.This is the greatest novel ever written. While it's testimony was, when first released, as valid as ever, it is today even more important. Read it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes I understand Ayn Rand's ideas: he who works harder should earn more than the lazybones - and that this necessary for an efficient economy. Yes, I also believe freedom and the dignity of the individual to be more important than the repressive, suffocating collectivism that you can find in communist or in islamic societies. In so far, Ayn Rand is right.On the other hand this radical egoism Ayn Rand propagates makes me shiver sometimes. I always have to think about the &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens and the main character of this story, Ebenezer Scrooge when reading Ayn Rand's philosophical ideas.So this is my suggestion to all objectivists: Read &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens every christmas and think about what Ebenezer Scrooge was shown by the three ghosts, the ghost of the past, the ghost of the present and the ghost of the future, in order not to become too fanatical in the philosophy of objectivism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked this book up out of curiosity, after hearing that Ayn Rand provoked strong reactions - but without prior knowledge of Ayn Rand's philosophy. So I read it with an open mind, without expectations or preconceptions.Half the book later, I was forced to put it down in disgust. The characters are shallow, the plot is shallow, and the so-called philosophy is shallow. The heros and heroines of the novel - icons of her philosophy - are given godlike physical and intellectual attributes, while the chosen strawmen are bumbling, incompetent and evil.As a simple piece of fiction, this might have been semi-readable. But the consistent attempts to paint this as a profound philosophical work (complete with advertisements for her Objectivist school of philosophy lodged between the pages) make it completely repulsive.The true condition of life is much more nuanced than can be captured by her one-dimensional characters or one-dimensional philosophy; for understanding, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is 1,000 pages long, and as you read it you can't help but think that a decent editor could have trimmed 400 pages with ease. 50 pages (or more) of the book are devoted to &quot;mocking&quot; and &quot;contemptuous&quot; smiles, and no character gives another a glance without conveying paragraphs of unspoken (but unfortunately not unwritten) meaning.The entire &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; concept, the backbone of the plot, is very intriguing and I suspect this is why so many people are drawn to give the book a chance. The book begins strongly, which actually makes it harder to bear when you see the promising plot degenerate into a series of mind-numbingly redundant dialogues in a world that is so black-or-white that you are unable to continue suspending your disbelief and realize you are not reading a story of the planet Earth, but of some distant planet in the Randoverse where different rules apply.If you love to read, steer clear -- you'll be skipping pages by the tens with full confidence that you're missing nothing you haven't read a dozen times already. Having finished the book, my primary reaction is surprise -- I am surprised at how such a bad book could enjoy the sort of reputation it seems to have."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like the rest of Rand's work, this is an occasionally entertaining but sloppily reasoned diatribe promoting a surprisingly stilted and immature view of economics and society. Hers is a stridently simplistic and sophomoric philosophy, far removed from the kind of carefully reasoned discourse one expects from someone alleged to be a &quot;great philosopher&quot;.Rand's plots are unctuously contrived to buttress her obsessively monochromatic portrait of human nature, one oblivious to life's true subtleties and uninformed by a deeper wisdom. Her characters are cardboard cutouts designed for little more than advancing her childish laissez-faire rhetoric, and seem utterly incapable of even thinking of the kind of insightful questions that could mar the author's heavy handed operatic themes.Perhaps most troubling for me personally are her paeans to reason, something I consider to be the foremost of human accomplishments, but which in Rand's clumsy hands devolves disgracefully into blind, uncritical adherence to her churlish libertarian dogma of unrestrained greed and reckless individualism. With such &quot;friends&quot;, reason needs no enemies!One of the first reviewers on this site wondered why, if Rand is so thoroughly off-base, so many people so roundly criticize her work. This is a remarkably vapid observation, for one still routinely hears and reads much justifiable criticism of numerous historical figures who have helped to reverse human progress. Perhaps you can think of a few...To conclude, fans of this book, in my experience, seem to have been all-too-easily bamboozled by one-dimensional characters with no trace of nuance, profound-sounding but empty-headed sophistry, and all-out rhetorical sledgehammer blows wielded in the service of avarice.My advice to readers is to pick up some real philosophy or science or carefully reasoned economic work -- or even the latest thriller -- and to leave Ayn Rand's deluded, crackpot vision to the dustbin of history."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First of all, if you buy into Ayn Rand's philosophy you will love this book. You will be unable to put it down and it will affect your life. If you don't buy into Rand's philosophy you will hate this book. Reading it will be an act of pain and the only purpose for doing so will be akin to &quot;know thine enemy.&quot; The problem that most haters of this book might have is that the three main characters (Francisco d'Anconia, Dagny Taggert, and Hank Reardon) are actually quite admirable. (I write this on the premise that if Taggert (and Rand) can ignore the fact that Reardon's lovemaking is essentially rape, then I won't make an issue of it.) These three characters are stalwart and honest and absolutely committed to their view of the world. Galt's character, by the way, is simply absurd. Meanwhile, the villains (Jim Taggert, especially, but the list can go on and on) are depicted as such infinitely despicable characters that you can't help but to cringe at their utterings. This is part of the main problem of both this book and Rand's philosophy in general. Rand does not believe in grey, but rather sees the world in pure black and white. One might argue that this is quite admirable for philosophy, but when it comes to practice it ignores the complexities of real situations. Life is not lived within a controlled environment, and so external and conflicting parameters must be taken into consideration. How one can take Rand seriously when all of her protagonists are perfect physical specimens of masculinity and femininity (by her own rather warped standards), while her villains are all physically degenerate, is beyond me. Reality doesn't work that way. It is possible to be good and ugly, and it is possible to be evil and beautiful. Rand does not believe in the public good because she is so convinced that the individual good will trickle down (where have I heard those words before?) to the public good. Of course, in advancing this argument she forgets about sweatshops and child labour, all things that the individual good is very comfortable with unless opposed by government legislation. Access to certain benefits of our society should (and must) be available to all. The second most laughable portion of the book (Rand's arguments about aesthetics are too laughable to even be discussed) is the doctor who has withdrawn his services because health care is no longer privatized. His argument that any doctor who would work under such a system is de facto an immoral and incompetent boob ignores the fact that there are sincere people of good will in the world. There are problems, but Medicare in Canada has proved Rand's argument here to be utterly fallacious. Also, John Galt's ridiculous speech near the end must be one of the most turgid moments in literary history. I've read Numbers and Leviticus, and they've got nothing on this. Finally, the book is simply not believable, it's characters are caricatures, and the philosophy is both immoral and inhuman."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I knew absolutely nothing about Ayn Rand when I won a copy of this book in a review competition, and thought it was wonderfully ironic that the first novel I had 'chosen' to read since 1990 turned out to be a 1,168 page long philosophical treatise. Divine retribution, indeed, for having inflicted a 1,014 page novel on the public myself.However, despite having lost the patience with novels years ago, I had taken this one on with the promise to review - and review I would, and no skimming bits either!Atlas Shrugged is a simple story. For all its supposed breadth of scope and 'epic' qualities its essence can be boiled down to very little.Indeed there is something strange about the fact that although it discusses (at great length) supposedly large philosophical issues, and sets itself in a curiously dated industrial 1950's America, it feels rather like someone trying to expand a very narrow range of experience into the semblance of something more 'deep'.Ayn Rand can write, and it seems a great tragedy that she bogs down her obvious talent in a great mishmash of half-baked teenage notions repeated ad nauseam, as if in repetition they will somehow gain credibility.She writes her 'philosophy' exactly like a fourteen year-old at the debating society: Is Capitalism a Force For Good or Evil?Ayn believes it's good. It's good because capitalists build stuff, because competition encourages even better stuff, and because steel smelting plants look great at night.Ayn believes industrialists are sexy. They are muscular, lean, tanned, have aquiline profiles, look good in dinner suits and are very confident.You can tell she never met Richard Branson.In fact, Ayn hasn't really conceived of men like Richard Branson - undoubtedly hardworking, competitive, indeed everything that Ayn expects 'great creators' to be, but missing the fact that now, a mere 50 years later, these men don't really create or build anything.Ayn's 'great' philosophy didn't even make a hundred years before it went out of date. Her notions of how business works are frighteningly nave and her determination to batter you to death with crudely-handled polemics reduces her scintillating poetic descriptions into The Collected Speeches of Senator McCarthy.Atlas Shrugged may be considered a 'classic', but for me it will remain only a classic of How Not to Write a Novel, and a testament to how bad experiences in a communist regime do not necessarily make you very astute, let alone a 'philosopher'."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You can derive some value from reading Rand's novel despite its flaws and absurdities, because Rand addressed a number of fundamental issues in a wrong-headed and idiosyncratic way.For example, Atlas portrays an America undergoing a plausible Jared-Diamondian \\"collapse\\" scenario really brought about by an energy crisis, despite all the rhetoric about the men of the mind going on strike as the cause. Rand understood intuitively that energy from nonhuman sources like fossil fuels does the real work in the industrial age economy, while we just hang along for a luxurious ride despite our delusions about our material \\"productivity\\" and control over the economic process. For example, consider how long it would take to push your car 20 miles compared with how quickly and easily a gallon of gasoline does the job. Even Warren Buffett or Bill Gates would rely on the gallon of gasoline instead of their individual \\"productivity.\\"She shows Galt's Gulch as a livable place, like many a real mountain town gentrified by the rich, because Galt's free-energy invention supplies plenty of electricity without having to depend on fossil fuels. Without Galt's motor and without some energy-dense sort of fuel, the strikers would have wound up living like the Amish or the people on the reality TV series \\"Frontier House,\\" no matter how much gold they had piled up or how hard they worked. Galt explicitly says he withheld his invention from the rest of the world because he knew it would sustain the economy indefinitely despite the parasitic load of humanity he despised and wanted to eliminate. Apparently he didn't want to entertain the thought (denial works like that) that maybe his motor, more so than his \\"mind,\\" kept him and his friends in the valley alive, otherwise they could have experienced a Donner Party survival emergency over an especially harsh winter. The motor, like all the other inventions from the past, would continue to sustain life even if Galt had died at the hands of the evil government thugs, showing that the world could manage without him after all.Indeed, according to the Peak Oil Cassandras, an Atlas-like economic implosion could start any time now, without all the so-called \\"productive\\" people getting raptured, because oil has carried us as a burden for several generations. Oil will shrug us off as the supply begins its permanent decline and we discover to our horror where our \\"productivity\\" really came from. For example, the \\"productive\\" people who run the American chemical industry have reluctantly had to give up because they can't stay in business at the current prices for oil and natural gas.I also have to question Rand's view of business as the best actualization of human \\"intelligence.\\" I've worked in the hospitality industry for a number of years, and all along I've had either to hire and manage, or else sell to and service, a pretty stupid stream of humanity. Dumb and mediocre people form the overwhelming majority of our species, yet in most kinds of businesses we have to deal with them if we want to make any money. I would have strongly preferred a livelihood where I dealt with people I could intellectually respect, as in a scientific career, but life doesn't always work out that way. Even Dagny had to sell train tickets to any warm body who had the money, not to smart ones she could filter out by passing IQ tests beforehand; and Hank Rearden had no control over what bone-headed applications his steel could have been used for, including the manufacture of firearms which wound up in the hands of criminals. Given the low quality of the people the businessman has to serve, he doesn't have to be dramatically smarter than average to become successful. I just can't buy the idea that shopping malls, as useful as they are, represent our crowning intellectual achievement."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"John Galt's radio address made me want to stab myself in the eyes. This desire was so powerful that I felt the need to tell you about it in an Amazon dot com review, so I guess the book must have some artistic merit.Ultimately, it's an interesting book, whether or not you agree with the philosophy, it is just in desperate need of an editor. If you decide to read it, skip John Galt's radio address, that alone would put this book up to a 3.5/4 star level."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a teaching tool in story form. Here is what it teaches:Selfishness is virtue. Any act that is not based on selfishness is a sin. If you practice infidelity for the sake of personal pleasure, it is good. If you murder those who hold that your philosophy is wrong and you are doing it to gain your own selfish end, it is OK. Religion or any belief based on faith is illogical. If you act on a belief based on faith, you are subconsciously wanting death or &quot;non-existence.&quot; Acting charitably, however, is good if you have some selfish motive.The characters are well developed and the story line reads smoothly and holds one's interest well (with the exception of a 50 page speech by the character John Galt near the end).As I read, I couldn't escape the feeling that I was reading half-truths - that there was some flaw in the philosophy that the author set forth. On several occasions, I lost sight of the characters and could only hear the author repeating the same theme through character after character. Instead of expressing similar beliefs in different language and form as true individuals would, they all spoke the basic philosophy in the voice of the author.As a writer, Ayn Rand is very talented. However, because I disagree with the basic philosophy set forth in this book, I cannot fully recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a must read.

And if you don't agree with her philosophy, chances are you'll find this story unnecessarily long-winded and boring. That, at least, is my personal impression of this particular work.This story is a collection of plots and sub-plots, which all drive home the same point: pure capitalism is the way to go, and any attempt at governmental interference will stifle growth and hurt society as a whole. I'm afraid my attention and interest waned after experiencing blunt trauma to my head from this mantra for the hundredth and seventeenth time - particularly since I do not agree with it and believe there's ample evidence to the contrary.This is probably one of those literary works you either love or hate.

I've never read a book that I seriously considered quitting after page 900 -- until I encountered Atlas Shrugged, that is.

Having said that, it needs to be said that it is a WORK OF FICTION. It is ONLY a work of fiction. It is not a valid work of economic or philosophic theory. It is not a way of life. It is FICTION which the reader should outgrow by the time he or she reaches his or her twenties, by which time one should also have read Wealth of Nations, The Color Purple, Raisin in the Sun, The Blue Willow Plate, and A Tale of Two Cities, to find out what life is like for those who do not gave \\"advantages.\\" Rand's social and economic theories are predicated on the \\"level playing field\\" idea, and are NOT VALID.It is, however, normal for the middle to late adolescent to want to believe Rand's theories, but it would be better not to get to attached to them until one has read more and seen more of the \\"real\\" world. These theories do not hold up against the realities of poverty and discrimination. The are the basis of \\"Reagonomics\\" and look where that has got our economy.

Ms.Rand succeeds at projecting the Russian Revolution of her homeland onto America, then reacting to it. To do this she had to drastically misunderstand American history.The book does have some redeeming qualities. None of the protagonists have degrees in finance or economics. The Protagonists seem mostly to be mechanics, skilled hacks, and engineers. Rand developed the prototypes of many soundbytes used by coldwarriors and ideologues like Reagan and Greenspan.The gospel of Ayn Rand's Objectivism is best discovered by analyzing her design of the Galt's Gulch civilization. What does it take for a civilization to exist to Ayn Rand's standards of freedom and capitalism? It has to have strict control over who is allowed to enter. The citizens must refuse to trade or commit commerce with all civilizations and individuals who do not live up to their standards of freedom. A hard currency of gold is used, yet somehow banking must also be possible. There must be engines that output more energy than is put into them(the laws of physics will rearrange themselves for you if you are \\"rational\\" enough). Objectivist Privateers must have better artillery and ships than national militaries. People who design air planes have tall lean physiques. Less than a days wages can pay for lectures from the top intellectuals and professionals. You can rent your friends car for a solid gold nickel, without having to sign release forms and provide proof of insurance.Atlas Shrugged can serve as an inspiration for Iraqi Insurgents wishing to sabotage Iraqi civilization just to get rid of the people who don't live up to their standards of freedom and morality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is a philosopher in the same way that a girl with a crush on Justin Bieber is a rock star. There is nothing philosophical in this book that was not said before and in a much more coherent manner. Every saying, speech and aside is but borrowed - ahem, stolen - aphorisms from Nietzsche convoluted by a conniving ego that substitutes the cheap emotionality of melodrama all the while purporting to be a philosophy for the rational. Rationalizing is not \\"being rational\\" and everything she argues is so far removed from Rawl's Rational Choice Theory or even Nozick's Minarchism as to read more in the vein of a parody akin to Moore's Utopia, as anyone who has read any other significant political philosopher in the past 100 years will find this impossible to digest at face value. Misuse, misunderstanding and sheer ignorance in the use of philosophical and lay terms alike and this is not the even the only beguiling failure to cohere her philosophy to a framework that would be recognizable as a philosophy.Was required to read this for a class in political science, I've never heard a professor laugh so hard in my life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Quite simply, this was the best book I've ever read.

I have no idea what my actual thoughts were -- probably garbled tidbits -- but in my mind as I fell asleep, they seemed like the most clever things a human being could ever think up. It was the weirdest sensation (or reaction) to a book I've ever experienced!Atlas Shrugged is the first book that, when I was done, actually gave me a sense of accomplishment.

Thus my verdict on this book was not altered by my expectations or by what others have regarded it as. I am not going to write out the plot, because it has been done several times already in previous reviews. I found this book to be brilliant. I was not sure what to make of it after the first, rather slow hundred pages or so. However, after the basic setup of the circumstances articulated in the first section of the book, it began to pick up. The characters are charismatic, and draw you in with their brilliant insight and observations of society, and how it functions. Its philosophies are subversive of nearly all beliefs that are popularily accepted today, yet each argument against the commonly held convictions are backed up with logical arguments.

About 150 of these extra pages come from extensive monologues by the main characters. The book is much better if you read the first and last paragraphs of these, and skip the rest. I can say from experience that the monologues say exactly the same thing as those paragraphs.Rand could probably be classified as a strong libertarian and extreme capitalist (others can give more precise descriptions), and her books reflect this. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" will definitely make you think very hard about your opinions on many social, economic and political matters, no matter if absolutely agree with or absolutely abhorr Rand's views.Verdict: highly recommended"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand, presents a story about the struggle between good and evil. In doing so, an entire philosophy about business and life is developed. This philosophy teaches that the mind is the ultimate tool and power of civilization, and that reason is the world's only constant. Economics especially is highlighted by these ideas. Rational self interest and the pursuit of success are shown to be the only way people can achieve happiness. Rand uses brilliant, motivated industrialists as her protagonists in order to show the evils of charity and collectivism. Her book succeeds in getting across her points because of the way she employs logic, reason and intelligence into her characters and their actions.Who is John Galt? This strange question eventually comes to represent the central themes and events in this incredible book. Atlas Shrugged is mystery about the significance of this phrase and what it truly means. Telling the story of a railroad tycoon, a steel industrialist, an overly wealthy playboy, and several other characters, this book shows how they all play a part in the unraveling of the mystery.Many of the ideas presented by Atlas Shrugged focus on the central importance of the mind in human civilization. The protagonist of the book is Dagny Taggert, a young, brilliant railroad owner who succeeds because of the way she overcomes her problems through rational thought. Most of the other main characters are also extremely intelligent businessmen who have gained their place in life because of the way they use their minds. These characters are contrasted by the \\"looters\\", people who expect to be carried by the successful people and seek moral sympathy because of their positions in life. In one passage Rand writes, \\"Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce(806). This is shown by Rand as the only real evil of the world. Rand's ideas of the difference between right and wrong is very black and white in this book. Characters are either good or they are bad and this judgment is usually based on how they use their minds. This sharp contrast is helpful in the book because it makes the ideas presented clearer, however it also makes it seem a bit less realistic. Overall the book does well at showing that the mind is the most important aspect and also the driving force behind civilization.Rand's economic principles shine through very brightly in Atlas Shrugged. Capitalism and free trade are shown as the tools of success and happiness. Many of her ideas about how people should act towards themselves and others in dealing with money are also explained through the story. Charity is viewed as evil and degrading. In one point in the book, Rearden, an extremely successful industrialist, is asked by his mother if he will give his incompetent younger brother a job, just because he is his brother. Rearden then says, \\"Are you asking me to stage a fraud of that kind? I don't know what it is that you call morality. If I gave Philip a job, I wouldn't be able to face any competent man who needed work and deserved it(196-197).\\" In this book, personal achievement and self-interest are stressed as the right way to live while thinking of or giving to others is viewed as the root of evil. John Galt says at one point, \\"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine(622). Rand believes people have no obligation towards others, except to not impede on their rights of free will and self interest. In this way, selfish behavior is shown as a virtue, while giving to the undeserving is blamed as the source of many of society's problems. This idea is very different from what is normally taught and its uniqueness makes it interesting. Even though it may go against certain beliefs and moral values, the teachings of this book are hard not to share because of the reason and intelligence that Rand gives them.Atlas Shrugged is well worth reading, even at 1100 pages, because of its intelligence and unique outlook on life. Everything in this book makes sense and is logical, even if you don't agree with it. Views and opinions are explained and backed up using the story as a guide. The way this book is written does not allow for someone to be neutral on what is put forth. Either you agree strongly with what is being said or you disagree strongly. Either way, Rand's writing is gripping and interesting. It forces you to think about what she is saying and form your own opinion about it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that will make them use their intelligence."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I began reading &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; with some skepticism. How could it be as good as people say but yet I had not heard much about it until recently? I soon found out that it is not only as good as people had said; it was better! Rand is a terrific storyteller who creates characters that are both endearing and repulsive.

The philosophy it presents is the most satisfying one I have ever encountered. Sadly, I am not suprised that no teacher mentioned it even once during my years in college. Why at the age of 33 did I just now discover Ayn Rand?About the characters being black and white: the point is not that the heroes exist in real life but that they COULD and sometimes do exist. And that we can model our lives on the principles which they espouse.The book contains several wonderful passages that I love to read again and again: the description of Starnsville, the chain of command that leads to the train disaster, d'Anconia's speech about money, Hank Reardon's trial speech, and the tramp's description of what happens when the Starnes children take over the motor factory, where he used to work, the last of which is an apt microcosm of Communism and many other passages as well.I find this book to be joyful, an affirmation that it is okay to be happy. Most important to me personally is that we do not have to subscribe to what we consider evil in the name of misguided concern for our fellow man. Suffering in of itself is NOT a virtue. I can only surmise that the people who hate this book so adamantly do not agree.I welcome any responses to what I just wrote.

Yes, her characters are steeped in hyperbole, either completely good or completely evil, but she conveys in this book something about the NATURE of the evil in people that I had previously not been able to put a finger on.I still love this book, although now more in the way one loves a friend, flaws and all. My main objection to Objectivism is Ayn Rand's assumption that the subconscious mind is LOWER and WORSE than the conscious, rational mind. I also don't completely believe that the emotions are 100% the result of programming by the conscious mind, and that therefore emotions that cannot be rationally accounted for should be repressed 100% of the time. I think that sometimes our subconscious minds are actually a little ahead of our conscious minds, although I won't go off on endless detail here.(Also, her views of the man/woman relationship were completely WARPED.)People object to Rand's apparent belief that if you don't conform to the Objectivist outlook in its entirety, the result is unspeakable depravity. Maybe that objection is justified, but she is still so right on so much of the time about what motivates people and about underlying philosophical influences on society. She was an insightful and courageous woman.Rand's life and the lives of those close to her were proof that you cannot will yourself by rational thought to be happy. If you are caught in the tide of her philosophy and cannot allow yourself a single thought contrary to hers, recognize that you are going through a stage. (A stage that will ultimately benefit you, I think.)

Yes, yes, yes, and Jim Taggarts lines are always &quot;screamed&quot; or &quot;whined.&quot; We got the picture by page 40, Ms. Rand.She needed a very good editor, and she undermined her own philosophy by claiming to value only the best of everything and then submitting a work of &quot;art&quot; that is in every way artistically inferior.Too bad.Incidentally, I adored &quot;South Park's&quot; recent take on this book.

Reading it was like standing in a beam of bright sunlight, when I was in a dank cellar. Everything I am today is because of the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.BUTNot if you suspend your brain activity and simply read what is written in the books and take it verbatim. Having said that, before I write more, let me say that if the fountainhead was like the best thing I have ever read, Atlas Shrugged made me a man.

Fact is that you have to take from the books and think about it and enact a good theory for yourself taking the positive points.I have never read a book like Atlas Shrugged in my life. I have read it about 20 times, seeing new things in the book each time. I do not say I agree with everything which Ayn Rand says, but that is the point and the mistake most people make.Use your own judgement. Think about what you have read, do not follow it blindly. As a work of fiction, it is the best book I have ever read in my life - and believe me when I say that I have read very many books in my life so far. None of them come so far.The basic problem with americans I feel is that you guys read the book, and take it too seriously, and assume everything it says is right or wrong, or that you must follow it exactly the way you think it says.

It shows how easily a free society can drift into socialism through the good intentions of helping the weak and the poor through forced redistribution of wealth, and thereby destroying the national economy for everyone. It also reveals the hypocrisy of the ruling class: they ostensibly act to help the needy, but their ulterior motive is about advancing their own wealth and political power.The nation is ruled by fiat through a small, elite cadre of socially-conscious bureaucrats and industrialists. They have dictatorial powers to pass laws requiring private businesses to divest property and assets in order to be fair to other businesses that are not as efficient or productive. Profits are evil; social awareness is good. Working for one's own interests is evil; sacrificing for the general welfare of the public is good. The book shows the fallacy of pursuing social justice at the expense of individual liberty and corporate profits. Atlas Shrugged is especially important now, but as a work of literature it is not without its problems.It is not a masterpiece in terms of literary quality. It is way too long, and too preachy. The book could have used a good editor to throw out all the extraneous and redundant material. Rand uses her character's dialog as a platform for her to preach Libertarian sermons. In one of the later chapters she has John Galt speaking for 70 pages essentially making about four basic points. But the overall message of the book is extremely important today, and she does a good job of projecting Soviet-style totalitarianism into American society with the ensuing disastrous results. Some of her premises are a little far-fetched, some are downright preposterous, but many others are right on the money. It is uncanny how her most powerful and effective scenarios parallel the Obama Administration.Rand failed to see the future of social justice movements like environmentalism, immigration, and civil rights, and how those leftist causes have served the \\"looters,\\" her term for big-government liberals. But she understood Communism and could see how easily the seeds of Marxist despotism could be sown in the U.S. Her fans today call her the \\"Tea-Party Nostradamus.\\" She and Orwell were prophets. I'm afraid that some day we will realize that Aldous Huxley was, too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book.As a novel, I think \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" deserves three stars. The books is filled with interludes in which characters give seemingly endless diatribes, the king daddy of which came near the end and lasts nearly 70 pages. Not only do these lectures demolish the pace of the novel, they are filled with opinion stated as fact, groundless accusations, and sometimes self-contradiction. Oh well, what are you going to do? It appears Ms. Rand wrote this book as a vehicle for expressing her philosophy.Judged as a story instead a novel, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" deserves five stars plus.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the story of Dagney Taggart, the daughter and co-heir of a successful railroad tycoon. Dagney is a hardboiled capitalist with a good education, a great work ethic, and a desire to succeed. Her brother, James, on the other hand, is lazy, shiftless, and easily misled. He believes in making money the new-fashioned-way, through lobbying.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a dystopian tale of government gone wild as lazy industrialists with well-placed lobbyists plunder the work of the people who make oil, steel, railroad, and manufacturing industries succeed. In this novel, the bad guys' success brings destruction to society.The thing that kept me reading was the insidious way that Orren Boyle, Wesley Mouch, Tinkey Holloway, and rest of the profiteers spread their net across both government and industry. They rang so true, these \\"looters\\" these re-packagers who produce nothing but instead earn their livings by feeding off others. These were such wonderful bad guys, slick, smooth, and so conniving. Best of all, they played their roles with such absolute conviction.But, again, even the story cannot be judged as a whole. In some ways it is three stories in one. The first is the story of how James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Wesley Mouch, and other scoundrels manipulated the government and the people for their own self-interests while selling the idea that they really cared about the common good. As I said before, that part of the book was magnificent.--THE SPOILERS START HERE--THE SPOILERS START HERE--THE SPOILERS START HERE--The next part of the story is almost as interesting. It is the tale of Dagney Taggart and her struggle to keep society afloat as the government takes down all the great capitalists one industry at a time.Here Rand mixes interesting ideas with a few enormous Dickinsonian coincidences such as Dagney discovering the nearly completed prototype of a revolutionary engine while taking a romantic stroll through an abandoned factory--complete with schematics! There's the time Dagney bumps into an important who just happens to be working as a cook in a roadside cafe, the time the bum stowing away on her train turns out to be a failed engineer who knows the identity of missing revolutionary, and the time Dagney just happens to find an airplane that she can hire in a nearby town after the crew abandons a train. You get the idea.And then there is the romantic angle of the story--a definite two star affair. First, as an aside, there is the whole rough sex angle. Dagney's first two lovers \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" both force themselves on her and she accepts them without a fight. When you remember that Roark raped Dominique in \\"The Fountain Head,\\" questions about the what these occurrences may say about the author quickly come to mind.Then there are the questions about Dagney. First she loves Francisco, a childhood friend and a South American copper magnet. When he seems to fall apart, Dagney takes up with Henry Rearden, the inventor of a revolutionary new metal and even more ardent industrialist. Finally a new love appears, an uber capitalist whose views are so pure that even Rearden simply bows his head and says, \\"I understand your attraction.\\" Believable? I found it ludicrous.And then there is villains' hideout. Well, okay, they aren't villains, but they have created a mysteriously invisible lair in a valley in Colorado that the rest of the world can never locate. When reading this side story, my mind wandered to the evil lair Ernst Stavro Bloefeld has hidden inside a volcano in \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" I kept imagining John Galt sitting on a swivel chair holding a white cat a cackling as says, \\"This will the world to its knees! Bwahahahaha!\\"Overall, I give this book four stars but I give these stars with very little conviction. The parts with Boyle, Mauch, and the gang are so amazingly real and I consider them unique and significant additions to literature. I have many reservations about giving this book such high marks; but in the end, it probably deserves them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read Atlas several times, and plan to read it again before the new movie comes out in April 2011. It is a great Sci-Fi/Mystery/Romance/Adventure novel that also seems a bit Noir due to its often bleak imagery and concentration on the flaws of the human heart and mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged lives up to it's reputation as one of the greatest books of all time. It's long, but well worth it. The story of man overcoming immense and realistic obstacles is intriguing, the characters fascinating and the writing exceptional. Ayn Rand's famous philosophy often overshadows the literary merits of this book. It's not just for Objectivists but anyone who appreciates great writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a worthwhile novel for anybody interested in either philosophy or political science. The characters, ideas, circumstances, and events are ultimately dictated by Ayn Rand's philosophy life, which she titled Objectivism - basically summed up as conservatism (er, capitalism, I guess), epistemism and egoism. As a vessel for these philosophies (as I prefer to think of them as several philosophies rather than a singlular one), this novel is fascinating, capitivating and fully released. When you finish, there will be no question in your mind as to what Objectivism is, what its tenets are or why Ayn Rand feels these stances are important for the human race to adopt.This novel has been critisized for being too black and white in its presentation of political philosophies, which it very much is, but I feel that's rather by design. How else could she fully explore her stance but to choose the most vehement opposition as the antagonist? It may be a fault of the philosophy itself that she doesn't believe there is a middle ground (come on, Mrs. Rand . . .), but I can't fault the book as it presents her philosophy fully and without relenting (for the entire 1069 pages of my copy). But, if you don't like having somebody tell you what they want you to think, pass on this one. If you're willing to sift through what she's saying, please, enjoy.Naturally, some things bugged me, and I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who isn't open to alternate viewpoints (and I'm guessing that there aren't too many people who subscribe to Ayn Rand's philosophy on life - at least I hope not).Firstly, the connections she makes between capitalism and egoism are tenuous, at best, which plagued my mind throughout. She treats it as an implied truth that, since society functions best (in her opinion) when industries are allowed to be selfish within their economical limits, that individuals should be selfish in their every day lives. It was about the time when Mrs. Rand depicted a child being slapped in the face by a complete stranger for giving a toy to a lesser-privileged child that I realized something was wrong. The philosophy looks good in one circle, but who's going to defend people being critisized and abused for altruism? Mrs. Rand, I think you need to you check your premises. (And, of course, the problem with her philosophy in this case is that she doesn't allow for a middle ground - she assumes any altruism will lead to utilitarianism, but it doesn't. All or nothing. Not true. You can be altruistic/selfish within limits.)Secondly, I found her egoistical stance interesting because it seemed to be based entirely more on the humanistic concept of self-actualization than the typical idea about the pleasure principle, which isn't brought up at all, curiously enough. Mrs. Rand assumes the highest good one can achieve for themselves comes from achieving their own selfish ends, usually embodied by material success, e.g. wealth, notoriety, etc. She never addresses the far more pertinent moral question of where people should draw the line. Are we allowed to kill if it will serve our own selfish gain? I'm curious as to how anyone can form or present a moral stance without addressing *that* question; it's the largest problem plaguing egoism today (and I assume also in 1957, when she wrote the book).I think the philosophy buffs will particularly enjoy the radio speech towards the end of the novel. I had been warned before reading that section that it was deadly and overlong, that some readers even skipped the chapter entirely, but I found myself glued to the pages as soon as I got there. It was the first place where Ayn Rand really got to deliver her philosophy on something other than economics and the vague connection she made between than and selfishness as a moral principle. Welcome to the mind of Ayn Rand, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the most controversial, influential, scorned and celebrated works of the 20th century. Therefore, whether or not you admire it, you probably should read it, if only to see where you fall in the spectrum of debate.In terms of plot, Atlas Shrugged is a mystery; someone or something is \\"stopping the motor of the world.\\" Factories are closing, commonplace items become unavailable, the railroad can hardly run without some kind of derailment or incident and businesses are disappearing overnight (and their owners along with them.) Hmm, eerily familiar, -and this was written over 40 years ago, published in 1957. A beautiful and brilliant woman, Dagny Taggart, runs the railroad (second-in-command to her worthless brother) and strives to make sense of the decline around her. Her childhood friend and lover is Francisco D'Anconia, a brilliant heir to a copper fortune. When he attends university, all afire to become D'Anconia Copper's best CEO, he suddenly turns away from her and becomes a flamboyant and worthless playboy. What happened? And how is this related to the general malaise of the world? And who the hell is John Galt, --\\"Who is John Galt\\", the catchphrase which means \\"whatchagonnado? fageddaboutit!\\"Ms. Rand proposes an underlying cause for the world running down like an unwound watch. This is her manifesto about what drives achievement and what prevents achievement from reaching full flower. She puts this manifesto forth in form of the mystery plus digressions into philosophical essay. In the last third of the book lie the Speech; pages and pages of a radio address that is the vehicle to transmit the fundamentals of Objectivism, the philosophy founded by Rand. This \\"expository lump\\" is pretty hard to swallow even when lubricated by the surrounding action, so my advice is to skim it and read it as a stand-alone work later on. (The same advice applies to reading Goldstein's Book in Orwell's 1984. There is some fascinating stuff there, but it's better taken on an empty stomach, so to speak.)Not everyone admires this novel. The literary style is sometimes jerky and unnatural. Ms. Rand even violates some of her own fiction-writing principles and allows for subjects and words that date the work. This is a problem as the book is nominally futuristic. However, Rand, a former screenwriter, has command of group scenes and action that play like films; no one can write a better cocktail party scene and the action scenes are vivid. The character names are so apt that they mirror typical names of politician today--she had a fine ear.As to the Objectivist Philosophy, here it is simply put: there are those who Do and those who Don't. Those who don't should stay out of the way of those who do. The doing is justification in itself. If for you, Nietzsche is peachy, you will resonate to this value system. Now, supposedly, Rand had a Nietzchean period, then moved beyond \\"Man and Superman\\" to develop a new philosophy of rational individualism. However, since she is atheist (God being unable to be proven by rational or physical means), one has to ask; what is then the ultimate authority and arbiter of man's rights? Rand would say, Life itself, the life force born inside each of us, contains the seeds of rational individualism and ultimately Right and Good prevail, as it is most logical. Rational individualism may be logical, however Might can beat Right on any given day, and given a stout stick, usually does.As to no God or divine Authority; need I point out that being unable to physically prove something hardly prevents it from being real? It may be outside the scope of our five senses or the instruments we build to enhance those senses. In which case, you can argue if it is logical or not to believe in a Creator or a divine Authority and that is far different than stating categorically that there can be no God.This is my quarrel with Objectivism; while I fervently believe in individual rights, I believe they were, as our founders stated, endowed by our Creator, the ultimate authority. Man as Authority results in man abridging other's rights for expedient purposes. And finally, your rights stop when they impinge on my doorstep, and vice-versa. This is not well worked out in Objectivism, nor the method of enforcing that individual rights don't conflict based on superior strength. If rights are based on the superiority of ability or strength, eventually someone loses their rights to a stronger body or to a gang. Is weakness a reason to lose one's rights to another? This is, to me, unacceptable.Meanwhile, read Atlas Shrugged. You should read it. It is the quintessential American book and can stimulate you to get your own beliefs into focus. Argue, debate, criticize it, reject it, but read it to sharpen your own thoughts."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Its a very philosophical book, readers will enjoy it more if they really think about what she writes. Many people find her views on life pretty liberating. I'm probably not the best guy to talk about it but she advocates 'enligthened selfishness'. In fact her main characters are a little too self-absorbed in my view. Its pretty entertaining, and she does present her arguments very well. So even if I disagree with her views, I feel I've become a better person just by reading it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book no less than five times.While Rand and I differ on our ideas of a higher power,I admire her courage to put into words what most productive,self-driven people think every day as they drive to work.What would happen if all the productive,thinking people of the world were to simply...disappear,leaving the world to be governed by mediocre bureaucrats?This book does a great job of illustrating just that.The first time I read this book,it almost killed me,due to the length,and I didn't get a lot out of it.Later,an older and wiser me was able to glean much from the subtle ideas portrayed here.I won't say this book changed my life,because I was a card carrying Libertarian long before I grasped it's meaning,but it helped mold and reinforce ideas I already held.Read it with an open mind,and take what you can from this though-provoking prose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"And, who best inspires you to lead a life of purpose and conviction?Rand's epic mystery-cum-polemic is a \\"one of a kind\\" that mesmerizes, titillates and makes the blood boil and, ultimately, ends with a coterie of very gifted individuals going underground.Like Dagny Taggart, Lewis' equally appealing title character in \\"Arrowsmith\\" brushes up against mediocrity and sell-outs; and, like Hank Rearden, struggles with the issue of professional achievement in the context of family life. In the end, Arrowsmith takes a quieter path: consciously discarding the opportunities to compromise conviction for comfort, but working within the basic fabric of society. Which path - Dagny's or Martin's - is more noble? Which has more potential for helping to reform society?\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a monumental work, but, stylistically, a flawed one that careens toward the end down a path replete with sci-fi theatrics. \\"Arrowsmith\\" takes a more subtle approach, although Miss Rand's admirers would be correct to point out that she has framed the actions of her characters within a much wider political and philosophical context that demands of her heroes the actions they ultimately take.Read both novels, and reflect: Which approach - plowing ahead with your productive endeavors in unassuming fashion or taking your marbles and going home - would you choose when faced with ideological opposition?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"gAtlash means of course the giant who supports the celestial sphere in Greek myth. This story, Atlas Shrugged, in short, is the assumption what will happen if brilliant, talented and responsible people who support the business world in America forsake the society that depends on and lives on their contributions and withdraw such society to form another world. gShruggedh indicates the feeling of discouragement by the talented people for the looters who depend on them and greedily try to pillage success and money from them.The story reaches one morals; looters can never beat the people whom they depend on. Also, strong, brilliant and talented people can success at anywhere and moreover at the last part of the story, they back to the world. Now, there are still many looters in this world exactly like the novel. The society is consisted of talented people and looters who are still parasitic on the ability people and try to plunder everything from them.But actually it is a fact that there are talented looters in the real world and they can be success to achieve getting everything that they want to. In this novel, however, the elements are only Reason, morality, and integrity. And I just want to say itfs different from the real world. Of course some parts of her concepts for the world, especially for businesses are right, but if the talented and brilliant people always get success and beat looters, if the looters are always weak and fail to achieve their purpose, why the society have many troubles that are caused by the behavior of evil looters? Unfortunately there are definitely successful looters who are wicked and smart in the real world.But still, Rand gives us one concept of life that morality is guided by our own reason and principles, not by faith and other peoplefs opinion. I guess it depends on each personfs way of thinking, however, what I got from this novel was to carry out the aim according to my own moral not to other peoplefs opinion unless I hurt or violate someone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Throughout the novel of Atlas Shrugged, I personally did not want to put the book down. I was continously interested in what was going to happen throughout the novel. I wanted to know if anything was going to happen to Dagny and who was she going to end up with at the end, thus even if she would. I wanted to know what would eventually happen to Jim Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental.I believe that this book deserves four stars, yet if this book became a movie, I would probably be not as interested as watching the movie as I had been with the book. The book was not boring to me, but very interesting. I enjoyed Ayn Rand's contradiction especially on feminism yet, she did not make it a \\"chick's\\" type of book. It is quite suitable for both sexes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is pretty good. A lot of Rand's &quot;Objectivism&quot; philosophy came through in it. If you don't dig her philosophy, you probably won't like the book because it comes through very strongly. Although I would suggest reading it at least to see the various themes on government, capitalism, and love. So if you agree with objectivism or just like to read something provocative, check it out. If you don't know a thing about objectivism, read a little bit about it and then read the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I first saw this book, Atlass Shrugged, the first thing that popped into my head was, \\"Wow, this book is huge!... I don't want to read this for my First Year English Class\\" But when the time came, I began reading it and it seemed like an o.k. book. This book describes many common problems in the world although this book descibes those problems in extreme ways, it still opens eyes as well as minds. The characters in this book memorizes the reader. While reading this book, I began having a love/hate relationship with each character. the characters grow through certain obstacles. The main characters are either buisnessmen/buisnesswomen or government people. The government people try to take over the buisnessmen/women's buisnesses. The buisnessmen/women get tired of the abuse they are recieving from the government and decide to do something drastic about it, vanishing. There are many interesting and diverse group of characters who grows and declines throughout this book. I thought the ending was superb and exciting. I would recomend this book to anyone. It is truly a fascinating and book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Who is more evil? Someone who works hard to create a product that people want (be it steel, trains, cars, oil, etc), or someone who thinks that that person is wrong for making money producing said product?Ayn Rands' magnus opus answers that, and many other questions. In her bleak view of socialism, the true producers of the country such as car manufacturers, bankers, judges, doctors, oil men, and so on are disappearing without a word because they are called 'evil' and punished daily (over taxation, ridiculed in the press) for making a profit despite providing services essential to the function of the society. As the best minds are lost, society begins to crumble, and those that fight the decline of civlization question if they are doing the right thing, or should they let it collapse.Rand, who escaped communism in the 40's, considered it the greatest evil on earth and demonstrates what the true effect on people is; and how important values and morals are to society. It is a must read, prophetic and thought-provoking after over 50 years after publication."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand wrote this book as fiction, but the machinations of totalitarian states described in the book are very real today. For example, in Chavez's Venezuela, la Superintendencia Nacional de Silos y Almacenes Agr&iacute;colas is a government agency that, just like the book, sends emissaries to private enterprises to control storage and production of food. To ship food products, for example, permission from SADA is required. But if communication lines, ie internet, are down and permission is not received, trucks can not leave the food plant. Production declines, firms close, food is scarce, unemployment and inflation surge. See www.sada.gob.ve Great insight and foresight, Ayn Rand!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the most profound books I've read. It lays out for you everything you always knew, but didn't know how to put into words. It explains the basic idea that you can't have something for nothing, and when you take from the productive and give to the unproductive, everyone loses.If you ever felt the world was headed for destruction with unsustainable, high tax rates and debt, this book addresses it. Yes, it's a work of fiction, but at the same time it's so very true. We're seeing it play out right now.Just look at Venezuela. As I write this, the great leaky eyed fool Chavez was just granted, by his lame duck congress, the power to rule by decree for 18 months. Directive 10-289 is roughly the same thing. You can see the very vision Ayn Rand laid out come to fruition in Venezuela today, where the ultimate end for socialism, wealth redistribution, and the tyranny of the left, is destruction. It can only be destruction. Why? Because it's never enough for them. There will always be a bum to save, or a bunny to save, or a made up global crisis (global warming anyone).Global warming is a perfect example of the left's thinking. They have a made up, completely unprovable, yet impossible to disprove through anything but time, theory. The temperature of the Earth goes up? Global warming is the cause. The temperature of the Earth goes down? Global warming is the cause. That's literally what they are saying today. Never mind the sun. Never mind physics. Never mind that their models, which are the basis for the theory, are completely wrong. If your models don't account for cooling, then they never worked in the first place, which means their theory is completely broken.Why am I going on about this? Last month at the UN's climate change meeting, all of the poor, socialist, communist, tyrannical countries met in Cancun, where the topic of discussion was how they were going to redistribute wealth from the productive parts of the world, to the unproductive. IE, take money from the US, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and give it to the disgusting fools in Venezuela, Africa, and every other cesspool, where their socialism or other form of tyranny has left them flat broke, out of money, and with nobody left to tax. This is precisely the world Ayn Rand built with Atlas Shrugged.If you want to see nearly every social and economic problem we face laid out, the cause, the effect, and the reason why we have money and the looters at the UN's climate conference don't, read Atlas Shrugged. You'll get it then. If you want to see why America is in such a precarious spot because of Obama's insane spending and wealth redistribution programs, read this book. If you want to understand why people are fighting so hard against Obamacare, tax increases, and the evil public sector unions, read this book.When we want to discourage a behavior, we tax it. Smoking is a good example. The taxes on cigarettes are through the roof. Why? Because politicians want to discourage smoking. The left is able to grasp that taxing something is punitive and harms the subject with that issue, yet when it comes to our wealth generators, our job creators, and the very engine of our prosperity, our corporations and small businesses, they seem to think they can just reach in and grab the loot, without doing damage. We sit at 10% unemployment BECAUSE the corporate tax rate is insanely high in this country. We sit at anemic 1% average growth in America BECAUSE of high taxation and punitive social programs that have the twisted morality of saying the productive, wealth and job creators are the evil in the world, and sponging slew reaching their hand into the pockets of the wealth creators are the good. That's messed up.Nobody does more for America than the job creators. Nobody. The politicians have no power, and no money to dole out without them. No wealth to redistribute. No money to hand food out. It all comes from business. From good, quality people, who create wealth, jobs, and the American way. You would think that in the most prosperous land the world has ever seen, these would be obvious facts. Of course we're wealthy because we've honored people of great ideas who put them into motion and create great businesses. Of course we're wealthy because we've honored individual freedom. Of course we're wealthy because we've limited what our government can do. This is Atlas Shrugged.If anything I've said speaks to you, Atlas Shrug will be an eye opening, soup for the soul read. It's one of the best pieces of fiction I've ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I rarely read fictional works, but this book is a page turner.

That was a mistake. Although the book was written following FDR's administration and its impact on our country, it is as timely today as it was then. Many reviews that I have read focus on the philosophical views of Ayn Rand rather than on the the novel itself. The novel develops a scenario created by a progressive form of government. It helped me to understand, not only the difference in values between people, but also how a progressive form of government (rule?) functions. The scenario painted is to rule, not by government, but by a coalition of elected officials, bureaucrats, industry, academics, \\"scientists\\" and the press. It is a novel. It is fiction. Why does it scare its critics so much? Read it and find out! For me, it was life changing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is one of the most influential books in my life. I read it when I was 16 years old, at a time when I started trying to define my personal philosophy and ethics. I was reading several political philosophy books at the time; Rand's was morally, ethically, and politically incredibly consistent. She is truly a revolutionary genius and for too long has been placed on the sidelines of the so-called intelligentsia. But there are a host of incredibly accomplished thinkers who believe otherwise. This book successfully popularized a complex political and philosophical argument, in a romantic, passionate way. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone interested in THINKING."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you agree with Ms. Rand's philosophy or not this is without a doubt a great piece of literature on many levels: philosophically, as a great piece of written prose, as simply an entertaining story, etc. I put off reading this since my college days (1968 - 1972) because I was under the impression from what I had heard that I was strongly in disagreement with what the book espoused yet there were also other quite favaorable opinions. I finally \\"succumbed\\" to my curiosity and discovered what I had been missing. I didn't find it to be a \\"fast read\\" as there is much to contemplate here but that made it all the more enjoyable. I still can't say I agree entirely with Ayn Rand but that shouldn't stop any open minded person from enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a substantial book - both in physical size and intellectual import. It can be a daunting task to undertake. I've tried to read it twice in the past, but failed in both attempts. I was unable to really engage in the story or lose myself in the narrative on either occasion. This time was different. I think in some cases, we chose the books that we read, and in some cases the books chose us. Everything comes in its own time, and now was the right time for me to finally ask the question - Who is John Galt?First published in 1957, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is still as relevant today as it was then. It is, in many ways, eerily prescient to the political world that we are living in today. It's a book about many things - it's about politics, it's about relationships, it's about Man's quest to ascribe meaning to his life, it's about the complex role physical relationships play in our spiritual growth, it's about the true value of value, it's about the compromises we sometimes make - not realizing that to compromise is really to surrender, it's about learning that letting go is sometimes the only way to hold on to what you hold dear.It's about all of these things, but at its core, it's about a woman, Dagny Taggert, and her journey towards enlightenment and freedom. She is determined to keep her family's business, Taggert Transcontinental Railroad, alive and functioning, even as most other industries are being brought to ruin around her. While searching for ways to keep the trains running in the face incremental socialism in the form of \\"the public good\\", she also searches for physical and spiritual fulfillment from three very important men: Francisco d'Anconia - a wealthy playboy and heir to the d'Anconia copper fortune; Hank Reardon - industrial tycoon and inventor of Reardon Metal - which promises to supplant the steel establishment; and John Galt - the man who wants to stop the engine of the world. Through her relationships with these three men, Dagny strives to find that most elusive of prizes - the truth about herself.It would be impossible for me to explore all of the theories, tenets, and beliefs that Ayn Rand puts forth in the book. It is an entertaining read when taken just as a piece of fiction, but more importantly - it is the embodiment of Ayn Rand's personal philosophy. Far smarter people than I have spent far longer studying this text - gleaning new insights from its pages. What I know is that it is a masterful work that is as relevant in today's world as the day that it was published."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was prompted to write this review after reading some of the 1* reviews.Obviously, we have read different books. I will do my best to not spoil it for those who haven't yet read it. You can see how I feel about it from my 5*s.The book deals with some very serious questions that an intelligent person ought to be able to consider.* From where does human progress arise? Rand doesn't ask the question the way I will, but I think she'd appreciate my approach. Why was there no creativity to speak of in medieval Europe, yet it flourished during the Renaissance? What is it that made America the innovation center of the world for so many years, and why is America losing that edge now? What must the mainland Chinese government do if it would turn itself into such a powerhouse that no other nation could compete (where the top 10% of their students outnumber the entire population of students in America), and why am I not worried that they will do so anytime soon? Rand answers these questions - in depth. Not my exact questions, but admirers of Atlas will surely see that she does.* What does \\"consent of the governed\\" really mean? What happens in a democracy when the governed are forced to serve the State instead? What happens in a politically correct world where excuses for mediocrity are promoted as the ideal?* At one point, Rand shows that the novel's main hero also has feet of clay; that he can be bullied by the State. He is swift enough to avoid this difficulty, but Rand shows this to be true. What does this imply for all who would be strong?The book is an allegory. It is not a portrayal of America as it really was in 1957 nor at any other time, though I think that we could now be moving in the direction she warned us about. Without spoiling it, let's just say that the book ignores certain political and legal realities that existed in 1957 and still exist today, that would stop or at least slow down the events portrayed in Atlas.Rand must have known this; yet she chose to write the book as she did. Why? I think it's because she needed to paint things black and white. She needed the simplicity of characterization to paint on a canvass this large. Some of the critics' comments are true. Some of the characters do lack depth. Same could be said of many of Heinlein's characters, or those of Mark Twain and Jules Verne, etc. In some stories, characterization is not the main goal. Nor should it be. Sometimes there is a story to tell; a point to make; a lesson to be taught.Within this context, I have to say that Atlas Shrugged is my favorite novel to date. I was sad that it ended, which to me is the mark of good entertainment. I was sad to say goodbye to the characters. I would have liked to see what happened next, for there is much that is left unanswered about society as she left it. Again - I'm betting that was also intentional.Rand created a masterpiece and to those who critiqued it, I would simply suggest that you read it again. For I believe that there is something you must have missed. I know I'm being presumptuous. If that's the worst problem you have to deal with, you should count yourself fortunate."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book runs for 1080 pages, and like the greatest novels, it is the world you \\"enter\\" rather the a book you read. It is usually painted as naive, extreme and simplistic, but, the best word to describe it is that it is \\"uncompromising\\". Rand was a genuine radical who creates an ideal of humanity that is uncomfortable for most. The book may not be the most brilliant prose and there is a fair amount of repetition-but, there is a \\"spirit\\" behind the words that makes you certain your are reading something \\"important\\". Rand was a philosopher who used fiction to try to influence the masses. This book manages to get you thinking for the first time about the capitalist system and the ethical individual freedom that underpins it. The work is a treatise on the heights that human being can and should reach for. \\"Wealth creators be proud\\" is the book's cry. Fight for your freedom to innovate and produce, and never accept the guilt of the non-productive. Economic life in the 21st century is not simply a triumph of technology, but a culture of invention generated by individual imagination. The motto of the book is the dollar sign. It is a sacred symbol represented the triumph of the creative mind over the state, religion and tradition. Rand is a patron sign of the 21st century entrepreneur because her morality supports practical dreamers and visionaries. One of her disciples is Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Written in 1958, Atlas Shrugged is relevant to today's polital climate where the argument is pitting capitalism against bigger government.

I recognize Rand's philosophy as basically right wing, but as fiction, first of all with prophetic qualities. She predicted today's economy.

I've heard many complain that \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" fails as a novel, though coming away from it, I can say that I was thoroughly entertained. It proved to be a very unique reading experience.I enjoyed reading a novel told from the point of view of those in power. I enjoyed its gritty, industrial atmosphere. I've always been a sucker for dystopian/end-of-civilization novels, especially those with epic scope, and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" fit the bill there as well. Yes, the characters were often flat and the action sparse, but the story was intriguing enough to keep me flipping the pages like a madman. Much of Galt's lengthy sermon will no-doubt linger in my mind for some time, and I found the ending to be suitable and satisfying.As far as Rand's philosophy goes, well, I took it as it came. Rand's agenda is clear, I certainly won't pretend that I didn't see it, and there were parts of it that sat well with me and parts of it that didn't. But not seeing eye-to-eye with the author is no reason to reject a book, and I was never all that distracted by Rand's soapboxing. In fact, it made reading the novel all the more interesting, at least to some extent.Not much else to say, except that there is a good story tucked away in here, and that it never fails in giving you something to think about.

The ideas espoused in Ayn Rand's monumental work are important and should be examined by everyone in a free society (I was excited to hear about the film based on this book being produced soon). There are drawbacks, but no other work out there achieves the same goals as does 'Shrugged' and that alone makes it a must-read.Through the author's story of the man who stopped the engine of the world, we are exposed to the lives of high society in a near-future (from the 1950s), including a steel producer, a rail tycoon, and writers, politicians, and all significant players in the country. In Rand's Tolstoy-esque social gatherings and strictly Rand-esque business dealings, we are shown a despicable side of mankind, which we all, no doubt have witnessed, and led easily to be repulsed by it. We are then taken on a journey with the protagonist Dagne Taggart to fight the deterioration of free society and economic liberty for the sake of the public good.This book will challenge many commonly-held beliefs, the most prominent being that the public good should be a goal when considering individual production. Her Objectivist philosophy was fine-tuned by the time she wrote this and it is evident throughout.Unfortunately, for a novel, the characters are a little flat, with just a few changes in perspective, which makes the reading somewhat predictable. Also, Rand's idea of romantic love is a bizarre mix of masochism and contradiction and the reader may have a hard time relating.Despite these flaws, this book remains a timeless masterpiece and a monument to human intellect and individuality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After being forced to read many of the so-called &quot;classics&quot; throughout high school and college, I found myself somewhat turned off to reading.

The novel challengesthousands of years of altruism and collectivism in human civilization. Atlas Shrugged isAyn Rand's tribute to the men of the mind: scientists, philosophers, businessmen, artists,teachers. The novel unites metaphysics, ethics, economics and romantic love. The integration of theme, plot, characterization and style are unparalleled by any other philosophi-cal work of the century. These elements, combined with the novel's scope and depth, leadthe reader into Ayn Rand's world, where he discovers and enters the lost Atlantis, a worldof moral giants.Stated briefly, the theme of Atlas Shrugged is the role of the mind in man's existence. In the one thousand-plus pages of the novel, Ayn Rand sets forth all of values uponwhich her philosophy, Objectivism, is based. In &quot;About the Author,&quot; Rand tells thereader: &quot;My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his ownhappiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblestactivity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot; Near the beginning of his radio address to theworld, John Galt tells his audience: &quot;You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You havesacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificedwealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to self-denial. You have sacrificed hap-piness to duty.&quot; For each virtue of Rand's philosophy which the world has given up, Galtpresents a vice which the world has turned to. It is because the world has turned to theseevils that it has deteriorated into the state of emergency presented in the novel.Rand makes it very clear throughout the novel that the men of minds are central tothe existence and prosperity of mankind and without them, the world stops turning.Without the men of minds, the weight of the world becomes too much to bear, even forAtlas, the mythological man who holds the world on his shoulders:&quot;'Mr. Rearden,' said Francisco, his voice solemnly calm, &quot;if you saw Atlas,the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood,blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling butstill trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and thegreater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders--what would you tell him to do?''I... I don't know. What... could he do? What would you tell him?''To shrug.'&quot;Atlas Shrugged is a mystery novel, not about the murder of a man,but the murder of mankind's spirit and the struggle to bring it back. In Atlas Shrugged,As a result of the decaying morality of the world, these industrialists, the men of the mind, go on strike. John Galt, the leader of the strike, told the world:&quot;There is only one kind of man who have never been on strike in humanhistory. Every other kind and class have stopped, when they so wished,and have presented demands to the world, claiming to be indispensable--except the men who have carried the world on their shoulders, have kept italive, have endured torture as sole payment, but have never walked out onthe human race. Well, their turn has come. Let the world discover whothey are, what they do and what happens when they refuse to function.This is the strike of the men of the mind.&quot;The men of the mind strike, hiding away together, in a hidden valley of the Rockies, wherethey can earn the payment and respect they deserve for the work they do. Galt continuesto recruit industrialists, scientists, philosophers and artists to live in his valley until theworld is left with nothing but moochers and beggars. It is after the United States, and therest of the world, is in a state of total chaos, without any industry, transportation, or pro-duction for people to live by, that Galt makes his three hour, sixty page speech to theworld. In it, he not only outlines why the world has crumbled into nothingness and whyhe and the other men of the mind have gone on strike, but all of the morals which are theunderlying basis of Objectivism. Twelve years after John Galt begins his strike, it ends.The lights go out in New York City, a sign the John Galt has stopped the motor of theworld, and the last of the striking minds return to their valley to begin rebuilding theUnited States of America and then the world, this time under their own morals and prin-ciples.Ayn Rand's literary style is unlike that of any other modern novelist. Greco-Latinated words abound, each one conveying the perfect meaning. This use of languagealmost helps to lead the reader into Rand's philosophical, highly intellectual world. . Thenovel is filled with numerous amazingly descriptive passages, one of which describesDagny Taggart's first train ride on the John Galt Line: &quot;The green-blue rails ran to meetthem, like two jets shot out of a single point beyond the curve of the earth. The crosstiesmelted, as the approached, into a smooth stream rolling down under the wheels.&quot; AynRand wrote a novel over one thousand pages long, and each word on each page of thebook is necessary, each sentence deepening the plot, increasing the reader's awareness ofthe virtues within, and drawing him deeper into the world of Atlas Shrugged.Many authors are able to draw a reader into their books while it is being read. AynRand draws her readers into her novel not only while it is being read, but after the bookhas been set aside. Her characters never leave a reader's mind, her themes force the readerto leave the world they live in so that they can continue to ponder what they mean. Areader sees the &quot;THE END&quot; on the final page of the book and closes it, but knows thatthose words mean nothing, that the ideas Rand presents will never end, and that he willnever forget why Atlas is shrugging."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There have been nearly nine and a half hundred reviews, thoughts, diatribes, and feelings written about Atlas Shrugged, and, upon inspection, you will find that almost everyone falls into two opposing camps of opinions. Those that think the book is one of the greatest pieces of literature written, or those that think its the most shameful rubbish ever put in print. This division is due to the fact that the novel is really a philosophical one wrapped in fiction which is bound to lead to heated disputes. So in light of all that, I will not right a review or share my thoughts on the book, I will simply point out my rating (5 stars) and then make a suggestion:Read the book. IF you're worried you may hate/dislike/disagree with it and won't want to read it again, then get it from a friend or library.

Rand was given the opportunity to experience two distinctly different economic mammoths: her early life in Russia/USSR and the other in the USA. Her life experiences produced the Atlas Shrugged holding economic rules with universal values for all which she translated as \\"Objectivism\\".Her dislike for collectivism, communism, and other -isms that mold the human being into a robotic economic entity, void of his own creative mind, is found back in her 4 simple principles:1. \\"Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed\\"/Metaphysics2. \\"You can't eat your cake and have it, too\\" /Reason3. \\"Man is an end in himself\\" /Self-Interest4. \\"Give me liberty or give me death\\" Ethics CapitalismSome narratives are long and drawn out... it may itch to skip a few lines... wondering where Galt is hiding..., take your time, to read it all; the flow of one thought process produced into another, allows for the reader to discover the ever shifting economic demand and supply of human needs and wants.What was reality 100 years ago is reality today. What was reality in 1637-40 during the Tulip Bubble is reality today: The more things change...the more they remain the same....the secret is human nature itself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":".....Its a love story and a mystery all packaged to convey to you a philosophical and economic theory. There is no free lunch, peoples selfish motives are the mother of invention etc. and the path toward socialism is the path to ruin via murder, genocide, war, police states, fear....See Nazi (National Socialism), Maoist Communism, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Ethiopia (the great famine of the 1980's was social engineering - putting people on collectives), Russia and the economic stagnation & ever high unemployment rates that is Europe. It's a powerful message that gets told in a way that allows it to spread to a much larger audience. If your are a guy, give this \\"love story\\" to the gals in your life. Consider it a vaccine against the socialist mindset......If you want a more analytical approach to this theory read Friedrich Hayek The Road To Serfdom. His arguments echo Ayan Rands in that he lays out how within centrally planned systems control over all resources and goods will naturally move into the hands of a small elite group which cannot process all the info necessary to properly allocate resources and goods in an economy. Dissatisfaction with the plan and disagreement over next steps lead to coercion to achieve anything. Failure of central planning is then looked upon by the citizens of the state as a lack of power by the state to bring about a good idea in the public interest. This then leads to the people actually handing more power to the state, which inevitably leads to the rise of an all powerful leader who is ruthless and willing to get things done by any means necessary. Totalitarianism then becomes the next step with one strong man after the next struggling for power and throwing the economy into fits and starts of chaos. In the end all individual economic and personal freedom is lost. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany both fell in this trap and are the models he studies. His worry back in the early 1940's were that other democratic states were precariously following the same path."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \\"We the living\\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore, some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. The was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel. I have mellowed out some sense then. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book will make you stop and think about your values and what if anything you can do for others through doing it for yourself. This book tells us that we live by societies rules whether we like it or not because we do not want to rock the boat! And when we choose to live like that, we become immune to the world around us. This book reminds me so much of how the government of the U.S.A. is working today. This is a must read for anyone who wants to live life the way we were meant to live it. Undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read or listened to. I listened to this book on tape while driving back and forth to work, (I drive an hour each way)and I can tell you that I was at work or home before I knew it. There are 12 hours on 8 tapes. Ayn Rand had a unique quality in her storytelling and I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a good read to pass the time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged came highly recommended, and, as I had been impressed by Rand's earlier The Fountainhead, decided to try this longer book.If you don't expect any characterization or plot, and don't mind a highly repetitive hammering of a particular philosophical stance, you might find it tolerable. In fact, had the same storyline been told in 150-200 pages, it might not have been as bad-but at 1100+ pages, it was seriously stretched.ALL the \\"good guys\\" are exceptionally competent polymaths, and are uniformly handsome, striking, and healthy. ALL the \\"bad guys\\" are seriously incompetent and have substantial physical flaws. Just by the description of a character--often running more than a page--you can tell where they stand.All the \\"good guys\\" speak the same; there is no way to identify who is speaking from their speech patterns, word choice, phrasing, punctuation, or anything else: they're essentially verbal clones of each other, and all of them are promoting the same philosophy.The same applies to the \\"bad guys\\", though they espouse a couple of (minor) variations on their philosophy, and one of them--a fairly minor one--could actually be identified by his speech patterns. The rest, again, were verbal and philosophical clones.None of the major characters developed in any meaningful way. Some of them learned some facts, but none of them achieved any real growth. In fact, the only people who changed in any substantial fashion were minor characters, and many of them only did so immediately before dying.One of the characters makes a speech in the later part of the book. That speech, which we were told was highly effective to the listeners, was not well phrased, well organized, nor fashioned in such a way as to keep any audience from falling asleep. That speech alone took 60 pages, with no interruptions or commentary from any other character; I had to take a break partway through, and ended up skimming the last 20-odd pages, as it was highly repetitious, both to itself, and everything else in the novel. The author could more effectively have elided it, and had a few characters talk about it in 2-3 pages; instead, the readers were treated to yet another repetition what had been repeated many times before.From a philosophical standpoint, if Atlas Shrugged were shorter, from a novella to a very short novel, I could honestly suggest it to someone interested in the viewpoint Rand was pushing. At 1100 pages, I cannot.It may be the worst novel I've ever bothered to finish; I kept hoping there would be something worthwhile in upcoming pages--a key character flaw the author argued against, in fact: hope based on a lack of acceptance of historical facts. It had no plot, no characterization, no character development or growth, poor dialog, and the most blatant hammering of a philosophical stance I've ever seen, spread out over substantially too many pages.(For the record, I'm almost entirely in agreement with the position promoted by the protagonists. I don't disapprove of the message, merely the delivery--repeating the same thing a few hundred times doesn't make it any more convincing.)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged may be one of the best pieces of fiction/philosophy ever written.

That's something she should have done, too. In short, the first is open to interpretation, but the second is flat out disappointing.Whether what end of the political/economic spectrum you occupy, Rand's outlook deserves some consideration, if for no other reason than that it resonates with many intelligent people. Her support of capitalism via the ideal of self-interest as a stable and even laudable motivation for social interaction is fine; but has been defended better by other authors. Adams' Wealth of Nations or Hayek's Road to Serfdom are alternative expositions of the theory supporting capitalism and condemning socialism. While drier, such purely philosophical/analytical treatises will equip you to consider the meat of these arguments without all the irritating habits of Rand the novelist.The virtue of Atlas Shrugged should be a superior accessibility of such concepts by presenting them in a work of fiction. Unfortunately, the self-indulgence, transparency, and repetition of Rand's writing sap any joy from this exposition of her philosophy. Her characters are interchangable mouthpieces; either for her viewpoint (in which case they're uniformly heroic, calm, and romantic), or else as antagonists (who're cowardly, petty, and impotent). The dialogue does not even attempt to sound believable, and frequently fits a pattern that shows minimal variation over the book's sprawling length.In depicting opposing economic and philosophical ideals as a contest between glorified industrialists and sub-human misfits, Rand cheapens herself and insults the intelligence of her readership. I've read worse novels, but none that came so highly recommended. I can only think that the support base for this work stems a dearth of literature supporting her conservative economic viewpoint. That is to say, you'll probably only like it if you already agree with her philosophy; there's certainly little artistic merit to admire. And all the poorer novels I've experienced all had one redeeming quality that Atlas Shrugged lacks: brevity."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...because I'd still be in love with this book. As a 98 lb. weakling high school geek with an IQ that was not appreciated by my peers, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; vindicated my existence. After a few years, though, I grew up. I started reading stuff other than science fiction so I could find out what real prose style was. When I re-read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; 10 years later I was appalled at what a horrible writer Rand was; she couldn't even put together a decent potboiler. There is no suspense in the book, no complexity; just a brain-numbing series of micro-rants (and one macro-rant, just in case you didn't get her point during the previous 1000 pages) delivered by two-dimensional zombies. I guess you'd find this book appealing if A) you feel the world is getting in the way of expressing your genius; B) if you feel that the government is picking on you because your small business can't just dump toxic wastes into the nearest water supply; or C) if your life experience is so limited that comic-book Manichaeanism makes sense to you. For a good antidote to &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, may I suggest reading &quot;Sewer, Gas &amp; Electric: The Public Works Trilogy&quot; by Matt Ruff."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"To tell the truth, I kind of like Atlas Shrugged. It's a fun read. The writing is so utterly earnest and so often unintentionally funny. SpongeBob SquarePants and his comrades act and speak like normal people more often than anyone in Atlas Shrugged, but that only adds to the charm. The only part that always makes me cringe is the science. Rearden metal - abundant, lighter than aluminum, stronger than steel, easily formed and welded and, for good measure, blue-green so nobody can miss it - must be an alloy of titanium and pixie dust. A generator that pulls static electricity out of the air and provides unlimited free power? Did Rand ever take a high school course in chemistry or physics? Not obviously.\\"Atlas\\" enthusiasts have always seemed to me to be waitresses and tree trimmers who are certain that they are meant for better things. I always picture a congregation of fans of the book resembling a Star Trek convention without the cool paraphenalia. Hey, kid, invent a perpetual motion machine and move out of your parents' basement!In one scene, Dagny Taggart is asked what sorts of people she wants to ride on her railroad. Answer: Geniuses and non-geniuses who know their place. She hasn't the sense to say, \\"People who can afford a ticket, of course,\\" even though that's the fundamental message of the book - nobody rides for free. While this is supposed to be a philosophical novel, Ms. Taggarts core principles seem to consist of \\"keep the trains running\\" conjoined with living out the erotic fantasies of a lonely housewife.And what are we to make of \\"The World's Greatest Philosopher\\" (who unaccountably doesn't seem to have read a line of philosophy written after Aristotle) flipping hamburgers because the world isn't ready for his deep thinking? I've met a number of hamburger flipping would-be philosophers. Here's a clue; they aren't assembling Big Macs because their philosophizing is so good.One tow-headed rascal is a pirate, a profession of which the philosophical hamburger flipper does not approve. Not, mind you, because piracy is a bad thing, but because the rascal might injure himself while sinking ships - like the world would be impoverished at the loss of a pirate. Imagine him signing up for a dating service - \\"I like travel, adventure and I have my own boat.\\"Who is John Galt? Picture the head of the Spanish Inquisition minus his puckish sense of humor and self-deprecating manner. He's Michaelangelo sculpting a David beating the bejeepers out of a welfare mom. He's the patron saint of pay toilets - nothing in his world is free. \\"Can I borrow a match?\\" is heretical in his thinking. You want a match? Dig up some phosphorus. That's what manly men do. Only girly-men borrow things.Toward the end, Galt is being interrogated, the torture machine breaks down and he, without having the faintest reason for knowing how it works, tells his tormenters how to repair it. (Randian Supermen can do that sort of thing, you see, and do.) Do the interrogators smile and say, \\"What a moron!\\"? Do they ask him, \\"Say, if I put the alligator clip just there, John, do you think will it sting more\\"? No, they get scared. Why? Search me. What's he going to do? Spew spittle on them? \\"Hey, I just had that cleaned!

Maybe it's just me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is no wonder why Ayn Rand is anti-education.Her worst enemies are those who possess the ability to think for themselves and not blindly follow her every word.It is also no mystery why many of the positive reviews regarding this book were submitted by teenagers.Keep dreamin', Rand!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a must for anyone with a brain"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Poorly written, this self-aggrandizing, purposely fat, obscurantist tome reads like a bloated attempt to high-brow a pulp fiction novel, full of poorly thought rambling digressions and self-contradictions by a psychotically paranoid rabid anti-Communist who never got over her privileged family's exile from Russia (first it espouses non-violence, then it takes plumb glee in the shooting of a guard in the chest at point-blank range, and hints at justifiable genocide of those teeming \\"parasitic\\" unwashed masses). Let it be denounced clearly: Objectivism is barely-veiled fascist Ubermensch crap and everyone worth one iota of critical thinking knows it. You won't pass a philosophy course anywhere with blind adherence to this crappy book. It's not even a philosophy - it's propaganda. Rand claims to have written the most original philosophical work ever, but it's just Nietzsche For Harlequin Romance Dummies, and even Nietzsche cringes pickle-faced and rolling in his mothy grave at her puerile co-option. This is a jejune work ready-made for the narrow egoism of wounded teenage and immature minds stuck in solipsistic foxholes, ready for that singular savior and attendant cult of personality, akin to \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" just as \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" was directly intended as capitalist propaganda for children, as admitted by Dahl himself. It's all about as enlightening as a flat, lukewarm Big Gulp of Mountain Dew, refills included via her other repetitive tomes. Wave this book at your own peril - the rest of us laugh at you, with well-marked derision."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My biggest problem with this book, is the rambling, preaching style of the author. All of the characters make 20 minute speeches, every chance they get, about everything. What's worse is that all of the antagonists are horribly illogical and whiny (this was the goal of the author) to the point that I was angry during most of the 1000 page read. The stupidity of the average person in the book is also incredibly frustrating.The book delivers many intelligent and thought provoking points about economics, philosophy, charity, and producers/consumers, but the way it gets there is excruciating and not enjoyable. I found myself saying out loud, \\"Just shut up already, and get on with it\\", or \\"Seriously? You made 10 ridiculous comparisons to arrive at that point?\\" A much more enjoyable read that also makes intelligent, intellectual points is 1984 by George Orwell, that book was way better than this one.There are some enjoyable plot points, like the Dagny/Francisco back story, the building of the train line, and Dagny in the valley, but there's just a ton of absurdity you have to wade through before you get to those little gems. Speaking of absurdity, I found it ridiculous that the main character Dagny falls madly in love with all of the men in the book. All of the men are completely happy about it when they are no longer the one she is interested in, and they all become best friends. That scene with Francisco and the goblets was preposterous.In summary, I define a good book as something I enjoy reading, I feel better after reading it, and look forward to reading more of it. With this book, i didn't enjoy reading it, was typically angry after I put it down, and picking it back up was a painful chore that I just had to finish and get through."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Additionally, Rand's use of American settings is noteworthy: from the post-apocalypse society of Anthem, through the utopia of Galt's Gulch in Atlas Shrugged, with the presence of cities -notably New York -and the presence of homelessness and economic collapse as easily discernible in all of Rand's fictional texts. With all the aids to assignments ladled into teachers' editions, teachers' supplements, activities enrichment workbooks and other educational tools, even middle level students would not be overly windblown by consideration of Rand's work --despite the purient handcuffs of community standards ( ironically, a recent interview with a reality TV starlet in the April Earth Day issue of Elle magazine featured the thespian toting a copy of Atlas Shrugged).Posthumously, and privately, Rand's work is used in the institutions of education --despite being shunned by textbook conglomerates. Although not every dead writer has an organization dedicated to encouraging continued reading of the work, Rand does. Interestingly, The Ayn Rand Institute willingly sponsors educational interaction: sponsoring both essay contests and, in some cases, book donation. On the telephone, the institute personnel are friendly and seem interested in being helpful -exactly the opposite experience one routinely has with textbook publishing institutions. That the second hand looters of American literature and elitist dogmaticians of the American Literary Canon would choose the pose of hegemony should come as no surprise."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's almost truly amusing to read some of the negative reviews from people who were once \\"angst-filled objectivists\\", saying that they hated the world; that they loved to be hated; that they thought \\"the mob\\" and the commies would win: to these people, I suggest you read the book again.That mentality is the polar opposite of what the author espouses. Firstly, in answer to the many \\"I hated the world\\" comments: she addresses this attitude specifically in the book, in the character of Dr. Robert Stadler. An Objectivist does not hate the world, as the emotion is often self-destructive. Secondly, if, as a previous reviewer has stated, you \\"love to be hated\\", you were not an Objectivist: caring what others think of you is a primary tenet of the opposite philosophy. Third, if you took the plot of her novel seriously, as a prediciton of the immediate future, you do not need to be on the computer, you should be on a therapist's couch.That said, it should also be noted that not all Objectivists are angsty, rich teenagers with no world experience. That is as innacurate as to say that all altruists are Ellsworth Toohey's brain-brothers.Whew. I got that off my chest. Now, on to the actual review. Whether or not you liked this book depends largely on whether plot or characterization is more important to you. If you prefer the latter, then don't read Atlas Shrugged. The author only develops characters insofar as she has to to advance the plot. Then, consider your attention span. This book is 1168 pages long; not the longest book ever written- both Les Miserables and War&Peace; are longer- but for today's modern reader, it can seem daunting.But if you enjoy fast-paced mystery and suspense combined with sex, action, and philosophical speeches, larger than life characters and fantastic scope, read Atlast Shrugged- even if you disagree with what she says, it is an experience you will not forget."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is my favorite book of all time, followed by most of Ayn Rands other work. Using simple writing and telling a story most people can relate to, she expresses her ideas phenominally. Disregard other reviewers who claim that the books ending and theme is ludacris, which is like saying Orwell's work is propostorous. Rand takes the story and meaning to a literal, metaphoric, and extreme places sometimes, but it just further illustrates her unique philosophy.An independant survey ranked Atlas Shrugged as the #2 Book that has changed readers lives, under the Bible. Even if you don't agree with Rand's message, any intellectual will still enjoy the story and her talent."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the greatest book I have ever read.

It makes everything clear."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Look at all these reviews! - If you average them out, you're likely to get the truest possible assessment of this book:*AVERAGE*In my opinion, any knowledge-pounds you gain by reading it are burnt off by the effort required to get all the way through it.It's not a horrible story and it's an easy enough read, but with its thinly veiled &quot;lessons&quot; and its too-ideal-for-life characters, it comes off as corny.And as for those lessons; reading some of the other reviews here makes me wonder if maybe I missed something, but I certainly didn't find anything particulary profound in it. Basically - work hard, take pride in your work, and don't look for any free handouts. That's it.If you're considering reading it for these lessons, I'd recommend you watch a few episodes of either Lassie or Leave it to Beaver instead.If you're considering reading it for the story, don't bother. Life's too short. Spend the time on something more entertaining.If you're considering reading it just so you can say you've read it... well then, what are you reading this review for?

After all, isn't it innately appealing to believe that you are a rational being, unswayed by genetics or any stimulus-response conditioning. Isn't it great to think that your abilities will propell you to the top? Isn't it nice to think you are the master of your fate and captain of your soul. If you are that simple and naive, if you don't believe in God, in turning aside to help others, or in putting anything ahead of your personal gain, why, you'll just love Atlas Shrugged. But first go find someone fifty years old who still believes this stuff. You won't, unless they've led an incredibly cosseted, lucky, and sheltered life.If you are into 'objectivism' (rand's philosophy), maybe it will be the cardboard cutout villains with silly names (Cuffy Meigs or Kip Chalmers, for example)that will appeal to you, or just their sheer rottenness. On the other hand, maybe you'll just love heroes like the copper magnate inspired by a tango dancer that Ayn Rand had a fling with. Maybe you'll just adore all the good guys chain smoking and uttering philisophical treatises.Ayn's superhuman humans never waver. The only question for the good guys in Atlas Shrugged (aside from \\"Who is John Galt,\\" of course)is whether they should chuck aside their life's work on principle and teach the world a lesson by denying it the fruits of their vast intellects. And, of course, they all reach the same answer, except for poor Eddie Willers. But none of the heros is ever riven by a doubt like 'should I go to church' or 'would it be so awful if I gave my old shoes to the Salvation Army or put a dime in Santa's kettle.' They all know that they will be supporting hordes of ungrateful 'looters' if they do, and will end up on a slippery slope, on the low road to Libertarian Hell in high gear!As with all of Ayn Rand's corpus, sound economic theory is horribly disfigured by bad philosophy. Epic novels are hurt by thin, cheaply ironic dialogue. Rand also chooses to write about things she knows nothing about (steelmaking, running railroads, auto manufacture, international finance), which makes the plot all the more silly.Somehow, this massive tome has become a classic, and it probably needs to be read by most bright people, because it keeps coming up in discussions. For all it's flaws, it still flows well and is fairly readable. So, if you gotta do it, you gotta do it; go buy a copy and get it over with.By the way, the realistic character and the real hero of this novel OUGHT to be poor Eddie Willers, the loyal, hardworking, problem-solving employee."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This mammoth novel is many flashes of brilliance broken up by many flaws. There will probably be some spoilers to follow.Obviously, you're not going to agree with Ayn Rand completely. I didn't and hopefully I won't ever buy into one source of opinions completely. Bill Maher might be the smuggest p.o.s. to grace my television, but that doesn't mean he's never hit the nail on the head. Ayn Rand has plenty of things worth listening too. She recognizes that all things are pleasure motivated; an obivious fact of life that people are scared of. Rand fails to realize that some people fully happy through philanthropy, altruism or basic sacrifice, but does realize that a person should put nothing higher than their own happiness. She shows off some great libertarian ideals, such as the idea that capitalism really just needs the government to protect honesty and it will pay dividends. With \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", Rand also shows how selfishness has nothing to do with being a good person. She shows off things that should be obvious. Nothing is free. Unconditional love is rediculous; love/relationships is/are a partnership. The truth is sacred. The most fufilling high comes from getting high on life. Rand holds reason highly, advocating logical choice. She also reminds us that there is nothing wrong with a little greed, so long as it's an honest buck you're trying to make which means trading the fair value of your honest labor for the fair value of anothers. Who decides what is right? We all do. Each individual does. One of the most important things Rand does with the book is just remind us of the importance of having some standards. I'm pretty sure Anton LaVey ripped off the idea of everyone being their own God from Rand.As far as quality writing in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", Ayn Rand does create some unwavering heros in about 4 characters (Dagny and the three guys she has relations with). They are memorable heros because they are tirless, and became successful by never claiming that which they had no right to and by never once having to compromise themselves. Ayn Rand also creates tension well by showing these Gods among men go head to head against (a few) genuinely scary communist zealots who are bound to turn the USA into the People's States of America. Ayn Rand brilliantly shows the two ideals of capitalism and communism sabotaging each other and clashing with great rhetoric, but by the end the ugly truth of communism is exposed and the world where everyone lives for everyone else collapses because there is no one left to mooch off of.I read that Rand did not advocate violence as a first option for action. If \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is any indicator, she didn't believe in violent revolution as a 2nd, 3rd or probably even 10th option. No one that needs to get shot does until the last 30 pages. This is the major problem I have the book. The 2nd Amendment was designed so that any sort of illegitimate government could not come to be in the United States. Ayn Rand wholly ignores the inherent solution provided in the constitution to her world's problems. She takes selfishness too far by having otherwise infallible characters get their own heaven on earth while everyone else is doomed to rot in a communist distopia. The common man is left with only futile violence acted out of frustration. Here or there a low level lackey gets murdered or a town hall gets burned down. The main antagonists never get so much as a death threat and they are never shown having to come face to face with Joe Public.Yes, she created her own, I'll admit, interesting philosphy, but other problems also involve how Any Rand doesn't delve into hard political science or offer much in the way of solutions to the problems. Of course, maybe her solution - protect honesty and roll back the powers of the government - is that simple, but generally she sticks to the basics, and you don't need to read a 1000 page book with tiny print to know that the 16th Amendment is a joke. The book is also unpolished from my amatuer writer's standpoint. It seems like Rand could've benefitted from a good editor. There are dozens upon dozens of scenes of inflections by characters. Once in a while she gives us a good scence of inflection that engages, moves the plot and develops a character. Most of the time these inflection scenes are unnecesarily long, pointless because they beat one point into the ground repeatedly. These are passages of big words for the sake of big words; a problem stemming from the facts that English was not Ayn Rand's first language and that she was unwilling to murder her darlings.Yes, there is a lot wrong with Atlas Shrugged, and I know I gave it 3 stars, but check it out anyway because there is a lot worth at least a read here."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not just a book of fiction, or strict philosophical speculation on the nature of reality. It is a book meant to sell an ideology, unfortunately one of greed (but not of unthinking greed.) The value of the work does not lie in its conclusions. After quite a few decades of increasingly unbridled corporatism, we are in a better position than Rand to see that handing a society over to industrialists, money-changers and profiteers is no recipe for paradise.The great value of Rand's writing is in her critique of one aspect of existing human thought. Atlas Shrugged is the most compelling description i have yet seen of the ways in which the instinct-driven, brutal and thoughtless masses, led by demagogues' campaign promises, blunder their way through life at the expense of both themselves and of the few intellects of value in existence. For those who agree with this stance, it provides a delightful dream of the way in which this parasitic system might end. For those who do not, it is still a clear and insightful description of this viewpoint.The book is certainly not without its flaws. The grandiose image of America as some last bastion of freedom and individualism in the midst of an entirely communist world, combined with the complete refusal to analyze the flaws common to both communism and capitalism, is laughable. Rand's views of sexuality and family dynamics are primitive. The repetition of themes chapter after chapter causes many of the characters to blend together. The occasional encouragement of hero-worship flies in the face of an otherwise individualist message. However, its many weak points are greatly overshadowed by its few strong points.As many others have said here, you need not agree with a book's contents for it to be intellectually stimulating. I would encourage any person of reasonable intelligence to read Atlas Shrugged, regardless of ideology."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Your review is very one sided. This book is by far one of the most influential books of all times. For people to not see that she is trying to make a point,is ignorance.

We should all strive for our creative best. Productivity should be valued. We should be the best that we can be without leeching off of others. But that's about it. Don't read this book as it were a bible. Take the parts of the philosophy that you want to integrate into your life. That's what I did. And that's what I did when I finished reading the Fountainhead.

Wonderful and life-changing. Strong female character. Read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I started reading Atlas Shrugged in the 1970's and have reread it at least once every year. Ayn Rand's works have touched me very deeply and provided an expression of my inner feelings and thoughts. I see her as the greatest writer of all time. She describes the essence of humanity. Atlas Shrugged helped me to understand how popular beliefs have affected our society and caused such extreme damage. If you are a productive person, you can't help but recognize how she desribes the effects socialism has had on our society. This is a book that everyone should read sometime in their lives so that they may view the world from a different perspective. If you are not a producer in society, you will most likely reject the beliefs of Ayn Rands works, but anyone who is a producer will see the truth of what she states. I have found it necessary to read this book reguarly to refresh my commitment and to maintain perspective on my life goals. As a child growing up in communist Russia, Ayn Rand saw first hand the destruction of a people and society when they are forced to work for the collective and not permitted to work freely for themselves. I hope you will take the time to explore this great work of art. I think that you will find as I did, that everytime I read it, I gain a deeper understanding of her message. I agree with a quote from the book, &quot;There is no substitute for competence.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has a number of technical flaws (such as unneccesary repetition) but is mostly well-written. Perception of it really depends on perception of what Huxley called the \\"novel of ideas\\". Like \\"Brave New World\\" this is a novel that is almost allegorical in tone. The characters are mouthpieces for the philosophy being communicated. Some would say that this damages the artistic integrity of the work, others that it's a legitimate use of a genre. I found the characters admirable and relatable despite their saintly and demonic statuses, but I wouldn't hold this novel up as an example of great characterization. Basically, if you can find something you like in Rand's philosophy, you'll probably enjoy most of the novel, if not all of it. The prose is easy to read, but not dumbed-down. More Hemingway than Dickens. I found many quotable passages.The strength of this novel is the stand it takes for things like personal responsibility, the pursuit of excellence and the concept of respect. It made me think about how much responsibility I take for my own actions and whether external circumstances are as responsible for my successes and failures as I thought. It made me rethink my conception of capitalism as something I have no moral right to support and wealth as an intrinsic evil.Most importantly, it stresses the importance of *thinking* and that's something everyone can relate to, even if they don't necessarily want to take it to the extremes Rand did. I'm particularly fond of the composer who excoriates people who call themselves \\"artists\\" but ignore the intent and the reason and the craft that go into a work of art. Like the composer in the story, I'm disgusted by people who think that art is nothing more than vomiting up their feelings on the page or canvas.It is a very interesting book, whether you find yourself ultimately becoming an Objectivist or not. I personally find Objectivism to be an inadequate philosophy for a number of reasons, but I was nevertheless positively affected by the novel.And if you're reading anything by Ayn Rand, I recommend taking a look at \\"Why People Believe Weird Things\\" by Michael Shermer. It has a chapter about the cult-like properties of Objectivism. I haven't checked out his references yet, but he does make a convincing argument. And the irony! Just more evidence that Horace was right."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read Atlas Shrugged 42 years ago, and have read it 4 or 5 times more over the decades following. I found it to be a powerful influence on my life, probably more than any single other book I have read.I recognize as well as anyone its shortcomings and imperfections, but see through them to a powerful message that has been a rock for me. It is something like this: the world is real, and your ideas about how it functions matter, and influence the sort of life you will live. That heroes, producers and achievers are more worthy of admiration than victims; that moochers and mystics, quacks and charlatans are only to be scorned; that to believe in the salvation of a sky god is nothing but superstition; that a hard-headed, objective point of view is superior to a fuzzy sentimentality and that hard work is a virtue that eventually leads to a better life than one that concentrates on satisfying the whims and indulgences of the moment.While Ayn Rand's prose style never approaches that of another hero of mine, H. L. Mencken, it is certainly respectable enough to produce a novel of great originality and is, for many people, very difficult to put down once well started. It is well suited to her primary goal to communicate a coherent world view, an epistemology, and a derived ethic that can actually be lived. A mathematician struggling after a theorem hardly uses humor as a tool, and Rand has no room here for it either.As for Rand's analysis of Capitalism, I find it superior to Marx's. But I know that economics is complicated, and hardly a science yet, so her appreciation of the laissez faire variety is probably a bit of an oversimplification. And a naive libertarianism, much influenced by her objectivism, while hardly sweeping the world for now, has something to contribute too. Her biggest failure to me, though, is the problem of race, which she never discusses. It is no easy task to apply her approach to such a difficult problem, and I am not aware of any. The alternative basis in a hard-headed sociobiology, though, would probably have been quite comfortable for her, had it been available then.Rand's message is powerful and a positive contribution to the progress of the world. Take a look--I doubt you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The world is full of Ayn Rand haters, lovers, worshipers, apologists, and everything in between. And then there are those few that honestly respect her. I am such a man, for of all people in the history of ideas, Ayn Rand is deserving of respect and admiration.The truth is that books like Atlas Shrugged demand quite a bit from their readers, more than most people can handle or give. But Ayn Rand never wanted to reach out to the masses. Rather, she focused her work towards the smallest minority on earth - the individual.If you have a working brain and you care about ideas then you must do yourself a monumental favor and read Atlas Shrugged.It is not easy nor is it simple. Everything that you know and believe may be questioned. But you will come away from the experience as either a better person or a furious one (or both, like me). Rand will hit you where it hurts with her passionate and truly brilliant story of what happens when the motor of the world stops.I owe Ayn Rand quite a bit so let me tell you that if one can properly integrate one's life with her philosophy, one can experience a much happier existence than would otherwise be possible. Challenge yourself and buy Atlas Shrugged (oh, and watch how nervous people get when you pull her book out of your bag).Just remember one thing, you don't need anyone's advice on integrating Rand's ideas. Do it on your own and live a happy life. Trying to please the 1000's of rand-fans and haters out there in the world will make you crazy. Ignore them. For the most part, Rand did too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Six Hundred and Forty-Four reviews, and counting. And most of those reviews, whether laudatory or lampooning, whether serious or satirical, have received more negative votes than positive votes. Rand's work, regardless of its merit or lack thereof, is certainly controversial. I enter the fray with trepidation, while wondering if I even should...I have read that Atlas Shrugged is a book for 18-year old males, and I must admit that I, a male, first read it at the age of 18. It is hard to describe the emotional experience of that first reading - the wonderful realization that someone else saw that the initiation of force is always wrong, that punishment for ability is always wrong, and that government action is not the solution to all evils. Even at the time, I remember being surprised by the strong emotions evoked by so strictly rational a philosophy.It has now been about five years since that first reading. My BA is now recently completed, rather than recently begun. Five years of reading in history and English, my major and minor, have given me quite a different perspective of Rand's work and weaned me of some of its arguments, yet Atlas Shrugged retains its haunting appeal. However, I must now disagree with those reviews that claim Atlas Shrugged is either the greatest novel or the greatest work of philosophy (or both) of all time. It is neither; though it is certainly deserves five stars in either capacity.As an overall novel, Atlas Shrugged's generally flat characters (especially, but not only, Rand's villains) and occasional contrived plot elements cause it to pale before the truly great novels, even though it is certainly an above-average novel. As a work of libertarian (small \\"l\\"; I am fully aware that Objectivists and the Libertarian Party do not always see eye-to-eye) philosophy, Atlas Shrugged falls short primarily because it fails to address the strongest arguments of the opposition. I fully believe that most of these arguments it ignores are incorrect anyway, but they can best be discredited by addressing them rather than ignoring them. This is perhaps a limitation inherent in utilizing the novel form to disseminate political philosophy (many people already seem to consider this novel too long). In any case, in order to complete what Atlas Shrugged begins, the reader would be well-served by reading not only Rand's nonfiction works, but also the great writers of the libertarian philosophical tradition: Locke, Smith, Mill, Hayek, and Nozick, among others.I do find it strange that Atlas Shrugged (and Rand's other novels) have not achieved their deserved renown as part of the dystopian literary tradition of the early 20th century. When read in conjunction with Orwell's 1984, Huxley's Brave New World, Zamyatin's We and other similar works, Rand's novels form an important part of the early 20th century reaction to and fear of the spectre of socialism. In at least one way Rand expresses this fear even more clearly than the other authors mentioned: she sets Atlas Shrugged (and Fountainhead) not in a distant future, but in a time that looks eerily like the present.Finally, I refer those who claim the title of \\"greatest\\" for Atlas Shrugged, either as a pure novel or as a pure philosophical work, to the other works of Ayn Rand. As a novel, Fountainhead is a far stronger offering: with both hero and villain she achieves a degree of realism that no character in Atlas Shrugged approaches. As for her philosophy of Objectivism, Rand gives much clearer formulations in her nonfiction essays. Atlas Shrugged is certainly the greatest \\"philosophical novel\\" produced by Ayn Rand, and it may well be the greatest philosophical novel ever produced by anyone. It is not, however, either the greatest pure novel or the greatest work of pure philosophy of all time.This may seem shocking, but I think that the most accurate analogue to Rand's Atlas Shrugged is Marx's Communist Manifesto. In philosophical content, they are obviously polar opposites, but the roles they fill (and the controversies they fuel) are quite similar. Neither is the author's clearest exposition of his or her philosophy, yet each is its author's most influential work. Both were intended as introductions to political philosophies, and both appeal strongly to the emotions of their audience. Finally, and most importantly, both works raise as many questions as they answer, and hopefully this encourages their audiences to do further reading on the subject rather than to consider the subject closed. So read Atlas Shrugged, but read it as an introduction rather than as a conclusion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The reality is that most people's minds are destroyed by progressive education and they cannot think conceptually in a way that is required to understand this book. This includes the vast majority of the intelligentsia in American \\"higher institutions\\" such as Harvard and the New York Times -- and their wannabes.If you have managed to develop your cognitive faculty sufficiently, and you can think independently, you simply must read this book. I could say so much more about its virtues, its genius, etc. But I really do not need to: it will speak for itself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book when I was a freshman at St. John's College in Annapolis (yes, that's the \\"Great Books\\" college). So, while I was inhaling Homer, Plato, Aristotle and the rest, I was often to be found in the student union with this huge paperback written by Ayn Rand.I found the book to be enthralling, and in many ways it turned my view of the world completely upside-down. Just as interesting was the reaction of the other people who \\"caught me\\" reading this \\"awful book.\\"The main \\"problem\\" with this book is that it attempts a complete destruction of the philosophical foundations of modern leftist thinking (and I am using the word \\"leftist\\" quite consciously, being a \\"liberal\\" myself --- in the original sense).I can illustrate one of the main ideas in this book with a homely anecdote concerning two different people I hired to work. One was dedicated, hard-working, and persistent; the other was lazy, incompetent, and a drunkard to boot. In my own estimation, the first man was worth a thousand a day, while the second was barely worth one or two hundred.The point where all the fighting usually starts is that some people think that paying the first person a thousand and the second person a hundred or two is ALREADY \\"economic justice.\\" Some other people think that this is \\"unfair,\\" and want to reach into the pocket of the hard-working man, remove some of his money, and give it to the lazybones. This represents something other than plain old \\"justice\\" and is generally called \\"social justice\\" or some such. It may even get dressed up as \\"robbing from the rich to give to the poor,\\" because, just between you and me, \\"robbing from the workers and giving to the idle\\" would not attract many minds or many votes.This may be a political point, but \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a profoundly political book. I hear that new hires at the Cato Institute are referred to as \\"virgins\\" if they have not yet read \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"Another interesting fact is this: Ayn Rand was one of the most famous & independent women of the 20th century. She thought for herself --- and, come to think of it --- may be the most able female philosopher in history. But, to put it very mildly indeed, feminists do not like her. It's one of those strange things, like feminists not caring about the mutilation of Muslim girls in Africa.This is one of those books you really must read for yourself. It's a monument of the human intellect, and (strange?) it has reached #128 on the Amazon best-seller list as I write this review.-----Updated review------I just read another opinion that said: although Ayn Rand had a fine insight into the workings of economic systems, she basically didn't \\"get\\" how people work. I would agree to the extent that I find the dialogue between her \\"lovers\\" to be the worst things she ever wrote. (And I have NOT read it all! :-) )---- Review updated again------In the time since I posted my original review, it has become clear that the \\"anti-Rand\\" contingent basically regards her as a tool of the wealthy classes. This view is mistaken, and I can show you why with a simple example.If you look at our current economic mess, two things seem clear: tax revenues are falling because business is stagnant, whereas government spending is increasing because of current administration policy.Now, how could we get out of this mess? Imagine that a group of clever men create a new source of energy: let's call it \\"NewSteam.\\" This new source of energy does not depend on fossil fuels and is a lot cheaper than fossil fuels as well. Imagine one step further: \\"NewSteam\\" relies on manipulating the force of gravity, and provides an energy source wherever there is a \\"NewSteam Engine,\\" which costs $999.Almost overnight, a new industry starts to grow up around this original design, and it mushrooms. It is difficult to meet global demand. Revenues --- for all the companies in the \\"NewSteam\\" chain --- first quickly reach $100 billion, and then $1 trillion in the first three years. Within a decade or two, hundreds of thousands of Americans find good jobs in these industries. In the meantime, government tax revenues soar, and a huge amount of government spending becomes completely unnecessary --- for example, \\"Cap and Trade\\" is by now completely unnecessary. The government is happy because unemployment is way down, and taxes are flowing in -- not just from the corporations, but also from the employees of those corporations.And, needless to say, the original inventors become extremely wealthy men.I should point out, as an aside, that something very much like this did in fact happen in America, in the Silicon Valley, with the invention of the microprocessor and the personal computer.What Ayn Rand is pointing out is that these innovators are not evil men. They are the benefactors of mankind. Certainly the last thing Ayn Rand ever imagined herself as being was a \\"tool of the wealthy classes.\\" She was trying to show us (a) the ways in which a society can become productive and wealthy (b) the ways in which a corrupt government can actually destroy the real path to wealth and personal fulfillment.If the \\"looter mentality\\" eventually rules America, the country is doomed. The personal computer industry will leave. The \\"NewSteam\\" industries will go elsewhere. In fact, I can stop here, and recommend that you read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" for the full picture.----- review updated 2/3/11 ----------I have just had a new question about Ayn Rand pop into my mind.It occurs to me to ask, \\"Did she confuse the proper economic policy for a country with the proper way for a human being to live his life?\\"This arises from her producing such a weird essay as \\"The Virtue of Selfishness.\\"You know, and I know, that this simply does not work in any known culture. Calling someone selfish is the same as calling him evil, or wicked. I will go further, and claim that selfishness will never, ever be regarded as a personal virtue among humankind.But, paradoxically, it IS the proper course for a business to pursue in a free market. A successful business may well contribute to charity, but in its main economic activity it must be relentlessly \\"selfish\\" and relentlessly competitive. This leads automagically to a dynamic free-market economy, where miracles occur on a daily basis --- where cell phones cost a thousand bucks fifteen years ago, and were laughably large, while nowadays they can cost as little as $25, and be lost in the cracks between sofa cushions.This probably means that people have to switch modes of thought between work and home, but that's not exactly news, is it?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my first book review and I'm not sure where to start. This book is in a word - POWERFUL. For people that get really involved in their reading - it will take you away emotionally. The characters are so well formed that you really believe in them and are compelled to keep reading through the books 1000 pages and a sometimes tedious 80 page speech mid book. Rand likes to have multi page descriptions of a single person or event and for those who aren't detail oriented it can be hard to patiently read that section while wanting to get back to the action. Rand puts nothing in her books in vain, each detail is important. This book makes you question yourself, your values, everything you've been living for. While reading this book I was working as a volutneer in one of the poorest counties in the nation. Becuase of my current situation and the content of the book, I was completely conflicted, torn up inside and an emotional wreck. HOWEVER - you should read this book. I've added it to one of my favorites of all time. If you are new to Rand read Anthem first. It's a short first person narrative that will introduce you to Rand's philosophy. The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are both stories of this philosophy in action."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most of the reviewers on this forum have taken stands on opposite sides of the barricades, some claiming that Ayn Rand's way of thinking is the supreme measure of human developement, and others deciding that she is the quintessence of evil. I prefer to do neither--since I have read her works, and have found myself in agreement with many, but not all of her premises--but rather to turn the attention of the reader to a simple point that has, thus far, gone without notice--namely, the purpose of this book. This is not a novel in the precise sense of the word. This book is not meant to bring to life its situations, nor to set new limits in the art of plot and character developement. The purpose of this book, written in the fifties when the US was drowning in a sticky morass of pseudo-benevolent bromides about selflessness and brother-love, was intended as a call to the only action that was possible by the only group for which it was possible. It was intended as a call to thought, for those people who were still capable of thinking, independently, clearly and objectively. This book calls upon the reader to look around, to see society clearly, to look through the various slogans and groups to see their purpose and their premises--whatever these may be--and then to decide upon their morality. This book was a call upon the society which Ayn Rand adopted as her own to fight the tendency to stifle thought, creativity, independence and love of life which had once created this country. This book was a warning, and a call to action for the vanguard of young intellectuals who had not yet given up on the value of the mind. Ayn Rand was born in the stifling, oppressive and false atmosphere of the Russian Empire. She grew up under the passionate, poisonously beautiful and unimaginably evil slogans of the Communists. She escaped the Soviet Union while it was still possible, and brought to the United States a fierce determination not to allow the evil cancer which had destroyed her old country to destroy her new one. This was the intnt of her book. As a warning. And as such it should be read, and understood. I may be mistaken, but I consider that if the purpose (not the content) of her book could be expressed in a single sentence, it would be: &quot;Fight those who seek to rob you of your mind, the only thing which you cannot afford to lose.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a masterpiece of a form not generally familiar to modern readers. It is a \`Romantic' novel in the tradition of \`Les Miserables'. One of the hallmarks of Romantic fiction: characters who exist as expressions of \`universal' problems, ideals, themes and conflicts. For those of you who think \`Atlas' is somehow \`unrealistic' because it's characters aren't \`normal' people, you are obviously used to only naturalistic fiction, t.v. etc.. The characters in \`Atlas' are concretizations of abstract principles and character traits and should be read as such. Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean is a \`romantic' character in the sense that he is a projection of any man trying to stay true to his values and overcome his past. Hugo's villain Javert is similarly focused to just a few important traits. Far from being a failing of Rand's fiction, this is a great achievement when you understand what sort of clarity you need to sustain this type of writing over such a large book. Anyone who's ever read \`Les Miserables' unabridged will see the parallels between that work and this- Hugo will take an enormous amount of time detailing the history of the French Revolution, the history of the Convents in France, etc.. Rand's digressions, while even longer than Hugo's in some instances, are actually more pertinent to the plot of \`Atlas' than the history of the convent is pertinent to Hugo's novel. Hugo digresses to give interesting information, but Rand digresses to give related speeches and lessons- the plot of \`Atlas' depends on the philosophical speeches, as most (but admittedly not all) deal with issues that are vital to the characters at the time they hear them. As far as the \`wooden' villains, etc- remember this: Javert in \`Les Miserables' is blindly, one-sidedly, doggedly in pursuit of Jean Valjean with the singularity of purpose of the coyote after the road runner. Is this a failing of that work? Rand's characters are not mirrors held up to life- ask yourselves if great art is made of the folks next door. \`Atlas' is the last and greatest book in the writing tradition of the 19th century- even though it was written and published in the 1950's. This is NOT Tom Clancy, Grisham or any of the other authors you're used to. This is a social-minded, issues-minded, serious work of the style noone else wrote in the twentieth century, but hopefully they will again in the twenty first."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have had to say \\"yes. yes, I know\\" way too many times while reading this book. I never had to say it while I was reading 1984 or Brave New World. No, this book gets the heads shaking because this book has been adopted into contemporary movements and those who support them or oppose them have reputations and, really, honestly, have probably not actually read this book.Ignore all of that. This book is good reading, good enough to carry you through 1,000+ pages. The woman can write and the story will grip you and you will recognize some of what happens in what is happening now. Isn't that the mark of a great dystopian book? Rand shows us the outcome of certain political ideals and does it as good as it gets. Orwell did it, Huxley did it, Rand does it right there with them, no more.She does it the same way, too. She gives us characters to identify with and grow to love and places them in a world harder and harder to love as the work continues, though she does it with so much ironic humor that I understand why this book brings so much controversy. Irony is tough for the ideologue, tough on both sides.So, all, check your politics and the Daily Whatever News' interpretations and enjoy a very good story brilliantly told. What started as a dare (if you read this I will...) has become one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are a few 'classic' books you're supposed to read, and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is one of them. I readThe Fountainheadyears ago, and knew I liked Rand's writing, so that gave me the courage to tackle a book of this length and depth.The heart of the story is the fight of three industrialists to keep their business alive in the face of a hostile socio-economic climate. They're surrounded by incompetence and greed, whereas their own motives - despite on the surface looking greedy - are more noble: to build, to create, to move life forward. Add in political intrigue, romance, and a dash of mystery, and you've got a story which manages to pull you forward through content more than four times longer than the other novels I've seen lately.Despite being published in the late 50's at the height of cold war paranoia, the messages within this book are surprisingly relevant today, and other than a few social differences (such as the role of women), it could have been written 10 years ago instead of 55.On the down side, Rand bludgeons you repeatedly with her philosophy throughout. I can't tell you how many times a character says \\"It's not my fault! I couldn't help it\\" or stonily accepts responsibility for fixing some cock-up. It's not enough to spoil the story, but it did inspire a few eye rolls, especially towards the end.The audiobook (which I listened to) is good, though the melodramatic nature of some of the scenes - an artifact of the era of literature, perhaps - can make them a bit less engaging. Still, a good narrative and I had no problem following transitions between different characters thanks to the narrator's choice of voices and skill in being consistent in providing them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I get the ideology and the significance of industrialism, objectivism, self reliance, accountability etc. I also get the criticism of the bureaucracy, and the vicious cycle of the able supporting and fostering the weak which become not welfare but entitlement, and the artificial moralization of vice and virtue etc. I agree with the author on multiple points that need and deserve to be discussed. The reason why I am giving only 2 stars is that at least for me, (I am acknowledging the fact that this book has been known as one of the most life changing, influential books for alot of people) the author fails to communicate her ideas in the form of storytelling. Most of great fictions reflect and investigate politial/social phenomena---The Jungle, Sister Carrie, The invisible man, and the Native Boy, to say a few--but they do it through plots, characters, and their stories. Atlas Shrugged starts with interesting foreshadow and promising characters...but after maybe 300 pages, no new ideas appear and the book turns into the author's ranting and pontificating her ideas over and over and over...like force feeding, shoving them down my throat. There are many characters but ther are so one dimensional, in reality, there are only two characters. The stories are so unrealistic and outrageously absolute and simplistic, it feels like either a cult or comic book in the end. I have read Fountainhead and I liked it, and it was supposed to be just an overture to this book. I think the ideas are good but this is not what I consider good literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas ShruggedTo better understand what is occurring in today's politico-economic climate, especially in Europe and the USA, a friend suggested I read Atlas Shrugged. In so doing I became aware that this classic was perhaps even more relevant today than it was fifty-five years ago. It is never too late to readjust one's pattern of thinking - his paradigm of reasoning. Ayn Rand altered mine to some degree. Case in point is this ingenious dramatization of a controversial social philosophy called Objectivism. I remember well the frenzy of public reaction when this book was first released in 1957 even though I was but a child.Ayn Rand is the pseudonym for one Alisa Rosenbaum, born in Czarist Russia, witness to the Bolshevik Revolution, student of Marxist-Leninist indoctrination. At first, her intellectual power helped her gain access to the highest institutions of learning but as the artificially altruistic ideal of communism took its natural path through Soviet society, her intelligence became a liability to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, and she was ultimately denounced as one of the undesirables: a not-to-be-trusted member of the Intelligentsia. It was then that she made her escape to the United States of America and to New York City specifically. Her mind continued its relentless search for meaning as she examined firsthand the practical applications of capitalism in a free society. Her education continued under the flag of personal liberty.Drawing upon her real life experiences, she brought to her most famous of writings - \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and its predecessor, \\"The Fountainhead\\" - an authenticity unparalleled by few other novelists of her time. The appeal of her writing is not just in the philosophical realm however. Her superior skill as an author causes the characters in her stories to take on real flesh. The reader is allowed to develop an intimate kinship with each lead, fully understanding the inner workings of his or her mind and the outward manifestation of such reasoning.The Great Minds of this world constitute the motive power for civilization: inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs, industrialists, business geniuses, revolutionary artists. They possess the brain power and motivation to make life better not only for themselves but for all of humanity. Such great minds, according to the author, are synonymous to Atlas the Greek god who supports the world on his shoulders despite the fact that the majority of those living on the surface of the planet tend to hate Atlas because he is, in their words, \\"an unscrupulous capitalist, a fat cat, a greedy rich man, an exploiter of the weak, a man living as a king while the poor wallow in despair, a man who has more money than he needs or deserves.\\"Because of economic ignorance, Atlas is punished by a what is misnomer-ed a \\"just society.\\" He is brought to suffer through taxation up to, and often beyond 50 per cent of his profits. Punitive regulations and controls are placed on him by corrupt politicians acting on behalf of their most vocal, and envious constituents - those whom Ayn Rand refers to as society's \\"looters.\\"\\"Tax the rich\\" becomes a battle cry. Ultimately, Atlas the Producer reacts to the incessant attacks by throwing up his hands in despair and proclaiming in anger, \\"Why should I stay in a place where I'm not appreciated for all the prosperity and jobs I provide? Why remain in a system where I receive fewer and fewer rewards for my intellect and hard work?\\"At this point in my reading, I stopped and thought aloud: \\"So, that's why so much of our industry has been outsourcing to other countries!\\"Again... as I continued reading, another question came to the fore: \\"Can Christian doctrine hybridize with an Objectivist epistemology?\\" The religious training of my youth taught me that one of my greatest personal virtues is selflessness, not selfishness; and that a man's noblest pursuit is to fulfill the needs of the poor and disenfranchised of society. My church catechism teacher emphasized that such was the abiding philosophy of Jesus the Christ and that it was also required of me if I was to become one of his confirmed followers.Ayn Rand's moral position initially appears to be in direct opposition to such a code. The supreme hero of her novel is a genius named John Galt. In this quote from Atlas Shrugged, Rand's fundamental belief emerges in succinct and to-the-point affirmations: \\"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.... [I refuse] to be born with any original sin. I have never felt guilty of my ability. I have never felt guilty of my mind. I have never felt guilty of being a man. I accepted no unearned guilt, and thus was free to earn and to know my own value.\\"Alisa Rosenbaum was keenly aware that the so-called \\"New Progressive Ideology\\" of her time was merely what religionists had called \\"the Old Lie\\" for centuries prior; and as such, posed a clear and present danger to the future of the United States of America and to all who pursue happiness through unobstructed productivity. Rand proclaimed that such success is best fueled by, what she termed: The Virtue of Selfishness. And... I tend to agree. Furthermore, I understand that her argument is not necessarily in contradiction to lessons taught by my beloved Rabbi from Nazareth. G-D spare me the lightning bolt if I'm wrong. As I said earlier: It is never too late to readjust one's paradigm of reasoning. Perhaps Ayn Rand, at this late date, has altered mine to some degree."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"im very impressed by rands ablilty to write such a rich engaging novel. i came into reading this book as a joke but this has to be one of the best books ive ever read to date"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In the 18th century, the philosopher John Locke provided much of the philosophy upon which the Founding Fathers drew to create the United States of America.In the 20th century, Ayn Rand provided the philosophy to continue that dream and restore the United States to a place where Liberty thrives and the rights of all people are protected without regard to their race, religion, or the circumstances of their birth.The philosophy of Ayn Rand celebrates the potential for greatness in every single individual on the planet."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Amazing that the philosophy and practices of the so-called \\"progressives\\" have been wreaking havoc on free enterprise for so long.

Highly, highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Count me among the survivors who plodded their way through over 1100 pages of Atlas Slogged. And yes, I realize there are already 2,475 reviews posted, but like the marathoner who finishes hours behind the winner, to not post a review would be like not crossing the finish line.Short version: Collectivism (aka Marxism, socialism, communism) is bad; capitalism is the best hope for individuals and importantly, the rest of society.OK there's a tad more to it than that (but seriously, not 1100 pages more) and Ms. Rand does a nice job of showing exactly how this plays out in set-piece scenarios using characters specifically constructed for the job. Unfortunately, after 900 pages this literary device is bursting at the seams and the reader's willing suspension of disbelief finally becomes impossible near the end with the chapter \\"John Galt Speaks\\" which is a 60 page sermon better titled \\"Ayn Rand Speaks....And Speaks....And Speaks\\".Overall, there are worthwhile ideas and scenarios portrayed however they are buried within overly long descriptive and repetitive sections. Basically, there's a 400 page book in there desperately trying to get out. Still, even that's a long book but I doubt Isaac Babel himself could have told this story in under 100 pages. Point being, there's a lot to tell but by making it so unnecessarily long, it loses its impact and very likely a lot of potential readers.As to the controversy raging in the Readers Comments regarding what is Objectivism, is this good or bad philosophy, is Ayn Rand important/unimportant etc, my advice is definitely read the book and make up your own mind. Despite my negative comments, its worth the effort if for no other reasons than for the questions you are likely to ponder and for their contemporary relevance i.e. the current US debate over big(ger) socialist Euro-style govt vs. limited govt. Several situations in the book ring true and are being replayed today validating both the book and the reason for reading it. Big crucial issues are taken head on and they don't appear to be going away any time soon. I know plenty of non fiction works but no novel that does this so completely. A good follow up (and mercifully shorter) is the non-fiction bookThe Myth of the Robber Barons: A New Look at the Rise of Big Business in Americawhich describes real life John Galts pitted against Wesley Mouch types.Ms Rand was dead on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this in the 1970s and became a fervent admirer of Ayn Rand. I'm fortunate that I was able to see her speak (Ford Hall Forum) before she died. Even at an advanced age, she was everything I expected her to be.Although I hadn't read Rand in many years, nostalgia prompted me to buy and reread the hardcover edition of Atlas. It is still an entertaining book. Yes, you can laugh at Rand's sledgehammer characterizations (the bad guys all have loathsome names like Balph, Horace, Mouch, Cuffy, Orren Boyle). The villains are consistently evil, cowardly, sniveling, and always conspiring. The heroes make errors of judgment, but never of character. Those looking for shades of gray won't find many. The hero of Atlas is a mysterious Christ-like Messiah figure who gathers his Disciples with the object of remaking the world. There is a kind of quasi-religious tone to Atlas, complete with models of heaven, hell and a path to salvation.I think Rand understood the kind of cathartic experience her readers wanted. Atlas Shrugged is written in the Romantic style, and it succeeds as romantic fiction. I admire her for dumping every convention and presumption of her era - religion, socialism, sexual repression, crony capitalism, and enforced altruism. It takes guts to make enemies of almost everyone in your time. How abandoned she must have felt when the ghastly first reviews of Atlas poured in. The enduring popularity of Atlas demonstrates that Rand was decades ahead of her time. It's great to be an innovator, however, the more radical the innovation, the more you are hated and despised for it. I think Rand suffered at least as much as her fictional heroes.Rand was an unapologetic champion of the sanctity and worth of the individual in an age of collectivism and totalitarianism. Her work continues to have a larger than life effect on individuals and on the culture. She wrote Atlas to keep it from being prophetic, and she succeeded."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"(Please note, there is a kinda-sorta spoiler in this review.)I tried to read Atlas Shrugged several times over the years, but always had to resort to skimming. I guess I let the length intimidate me. I got the audio book some time ago and have just taken the time to listen to it--even with a 1.5 hr/day commute, it took a while to complete.All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" In Rand's descriptions of the villains, I was able to recognize the behaviors of many of our public figures of today, and it scares the dickens out of me. It seems that we are heading down the road she predicted, if at a slower pace. As frightening as it is, I want more. I want to see how the rebuilding takes place; I want to see how those titans of the human spirit approach the resettlement of a new world. I want to see what they do when they inevitably encounter the remnants of the old world.I sometimes wonder if the work couldn't have benefited from some editing, but I wouldn't want to be the one to do it.

I think the philosophy she describes and lives by is a brillant adaptation of Adam Smith. The novel is very Melville-like in it's description of the most minute detail of the mundane.

I bought it up to the point where she hooked up with Hank Rearden. Then she hooks up with John Galt and Eddie tells her he loves her (no hookup there).

Not many books can claim that reading it will leave you with a sense of inspiration and hope for humankind. I admit that myself, and many others, have or will have grown out of Objectivism some time later; but Atlas Shrugged is not great because it must be followed to the letter, but rather because it provides the reader with a guidepost to how we must aspire to live.Having said this, I question the objections of many critics of Ayn Rand, at least in this website. They attack Atlas Shrugged for its black-and-white simplicity, and for its rabid fanaticism about objectivism. Let me address each in point.It's true that one might regard this book as simple. The premise is simple, is it not? The idea of the prime mover and the seond-hander. However, consider whether you figured this out in the first hundred pages, or even in the next few hundred pages. In fact, we say the premise is simple only because we can look back after the fact of reading the book. It is not a mistake that this book is labeled as part mystery... the premise is revealed only gradually, thru the actions of numerous individuals, and only completely only when Dagny discovers the identity of John Galt. As to the simplicity of the premise itself, I ask whether there's anything wrong with that? In fact, I rather admire an entire novel, some 750 pages of it, that can stick to this one premise and present it in a myriad of different aspects. On the other hand, what's there to admire about a complex book with a complex premise? The difficulty of writing it? But what is the virtue of a complex premise? Everyone gets the premise of Ayn Rand, and everyone can discuss it, whether for it or not. The same cannot be said of a complex premise - they are often muddled, questionable, and mediocre in presentation, just like reality. Yet many question her novel for not being realistic, not realizing that such \\"realistic\\" style is that which precisely weakens many great works of literature.As for Ayn Ran'd rabid fanaticism, I rather admire it. And it is not by error that I use the words rabid and fanaticism. She does incorporate her premise, which is also her philosophy, in every paragraph and in every character of Atlas Shrugged. In fact, in her afternotes she claims that every words in Atlas Shrugged is there for a reason, and that she wrote down every word with her premise always in the front of her mind. The question than, is this: is it wrong to be rabidly fanatic about your convictions? I think not! In Fountainhead, her other great work of art, Keating asks Howard Roark - the Hero - whether he, \\"takes himself seriously all the time.\\" And Howard replies without pause, \\"always.\\" What Ayn Rand is doing is to stand by her convictions with a seriousness that seems to affront many critics who do not agree with her philosophy. Well, what's wrong with that? What is more virtuous that a person who can live by his or her convictions without compromise or exception? If you believe in soemthing, truly believe it, I have respect for someone who can stand up for it; but I cannot have respect for soemone who'd rather laugh about his own beliefs, someone who wants to avoid defending it rather than face a confrontation.As I've said before, I've grown out of Atlas Shrugged in one sense. It is not possible, or even desirable, to follow the tenets of Objectivism to the letter. Why? Well, the short answer is: because I believe this world is not all there is to life. In fact, that is the only true objection to Objectivism; Ayn Rand did not believe in God or afterlife, while I do. Nonetheless, Atlas Shrugged is great; it shows us how far humans can go, and how far humans should aspire. Atlas Shrugged is the Stoddard Temple of modern literature; many other works which we call great are but parking garages next to it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"the book is ok..but really could have been better if rand had had an editor..with a supersized pair of scissors...too long..too,needlessly redundant.further her characters border on the cartoonish side...but,the genuis in the book is the philosophy of self-determination...quite healthy...in a more pervasive bleeding heart world...rand grasped the concept earlier than most that communists were just bullies...posers..and that people really wont aspire to bigger ideals if they end up with none to keep for themselves..that there are leeches in society that can and do make arguments that we should foremost, live for others.which sounds nice..looks good on paper..but in the end is rather naive...rand,through her characters tries to make the point that a certain healthy selfishness is whats really best for society...that men need their own goals and rewards in order to advance society..there is no utopia in this life...and the socialist notions are perpetrated by those too helpless to help themselves..that mans inherent nature is not rooted in unrewarded altruism...but in advancing his own needs...ego...aspirations...and if you find the bone...you doggone ought to get to keep it...otherwise why bother looking for the bone..its that simple...read and enjoy..and your reward in this life...is the journey and the spoils...like patton said...you dont win the war by dying for your country..but by making the other... die for his."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You know, I wanted to like this book, I really did. I adore &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; it has to be one of my top ten favorite books of all time. I then tried my hand at &quot;Anthem&quot;, not as interetsing character development, but I got a much better understanding of Ayn's egoist philosophy. I then figured I was ready to tackle &quot;Atlas&quot;. Thus began my four year struggle with this book that has become my nemesis.The first 250 pages or so are reasonably intriguing, it was at about page 375 where the downward spiral began. I kept wrestling with this book, not wanting it to defeat me being the egoist it had made me, but I couldn't. It wasn't the length of the book, I made it through &quot;War and Peace&quot; as well as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (the latter begrudgingly I might add), and it wasn't really the dry non-emotional characters (after all, as I mentioned I adored &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, can't get less emotional really). There was something that was blocking me, some sort of force that did not want me to finish this. However, I pressed on, out of sheer spite almost taunting the pages as I turned them. The problem was, I was so fixated on &quot;conquering&quot; this book, I didn't absorb a damn thing so the further I got, the more frustrated I became till one day, I decided I would have to for the sake of my sanity go on in life and not know who John (bleedin') Gault is/was or if he even actually existed, it was going to be o.k!I am giving this book 4 stars for a few reasons. First, it managed somehow to suck me in, for four long and arduous years. Second, this seems to be one of those books that you &quot;should&quot; read, or at least the &quot;learned&quot; should read...and understand it I suppose would help matters.

No doubt a fair percentage of them watch the daytime soaps that run for 20+ years... Quantity doesn't mean quality. Another review stated that Rand kept going until she &quot;ran out of ideas.&quot; NOT TRUE. A book should be as long as it needs to be without meandering. Lord of the Ring was three books (4 if you count The Hobbit) but every page meant something, served a purpose, moved the story forward. AS treads water. Was Rand paid by the page? Or by the word? Where ten words could suffice, Rand uses two hundred and fifty. I have just enough interest in these characters to keep me reading the book, but I don't need page-long descriptions of everyone's hair, breeches, chin, face, skirt, expression, cleavage, skin color, sweat, shoes, etc. NO ONE CARES.

Her philosophy is not particularly original and her disciples are just as dogmatic as those they often criticize. As for the book, its a long and tedious read with a 100 page speech summarizing Rand's philosophy that can for the most part be skipped. It's almost as big as her ego. To be honest, I've read better pulp SF with essentially the same plot and philosophy but a whole heck of a lot more fun."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand studied philosophy and screenwriting in the USSR under communist influence. I wonder if the Randists have considered how the philosophy she engineered can undermine or even destroy democracy by turning people against their duly elected government?Look at what resulted when Wall Street financeers lobbied to remove the protective controls of the Glass-Steagall act and Greenspan-the-Rand-worshiper in charge of the Federal Reserve Bank sat on his hands watching the dynamite grow hotter and hotter until it cooked off.Rand Mania is like an octopus on hormones, growing and wrapping its tentacles around the throat of democracy.Go to Williams-Sonoma and buy a package of bamboo skewers. Open the package. You cannot break the entire bundle, but singly you can break any of them easily. A nation is strong only when it is unified. Randism is divisive, elitist. It glorifies greed. It's against the religious principles upon which our nation was founded--love thy neighber, do unto others... . You can almost feel our foundation eroding.The uber-partisan US Congress of recent years is Randism in action.Despite her pronounced absence of literary skill, there's no denying Rand's high intellect. Was she Lenin's long shot, a Kremlin time-release Hail Mary with the perfect cover story?Rand's Objectivist philosophy as it's being applied can destroy this country by driving a wedge of elitism between the classes that says to the economically gifted, \\"You are entitled to whatever your talents can wring from this country.\\" The weakening of America has been because of Randist principles not in spite of them.If Rand were merely a philosopher, why didn't she just publish her philosophy and let the chips fall? Why was it necessary for her to put so much into promoting her \\"philosophy\\"?Why write books of fiction to hype principles that should speak for themselves. Her public relations campaign went far beyond a book tour. It's engineered to fundamentally change this country by planting the seeds of a destructive, devisive way of thinking.And it's growing. There are nonprofits today promoting Randism to grade-schoolers like mind candy.Randism makes Scientology look like kindergarten.

It takes a philosophy called \\"Objectivism\\" and bends and contorts every aspect of the story to conform with the philosophy. It's a form of circular logic. The entire world in Atlus Shrugged is based on Objectivism, so naturally, what happens in the book proves Objectivism to be logical and true. It's like the God dilemma. If you start with the concept that \\"God created everything\\" then inevitably God exists. How can he NOT exist if he created everything?Author Ayn Rand notoriously saw everything in black and white, and it most definitely shows in this book. Selfish individuals with a drive for fulfilling their own desires are portrayed as faultless and heroic. Everything they touch is gold, and the only thing that can hold them back are the parasitic masses that can't fend for themselves, who can only continue to exist by sucking the lifeblood from the productive members of society. The book takes on faith the fact that there are individuals with perfect, true conviction, and as long as society allows them to do what they do, only good can come from it. It does not even acknowledge how reducing regulations and opening up the \\"free market\\" inevitably invites extortion, fraud, and thievery. It's because in this world, such immoral individuals do not exist. The only people who exist are those that produce, and those that do not. In other words, the capitalists, and the big bad government and all the worthless citizens it represents.The reason why I give this book such a low rating is not just because it is based on a deeply flawed philosophy, but because it is dangerous and wildly irresponsible. The book as a whole speaks with such intense authority that it can actually be believable. The book also frequently repeats itself. This is a very, very long book, so don't kid yourself that this is all unique material. The same sorts of things happen over and over again, and the same sorts of phrases are repeated over and over again. If you can't convince someone with your arrogance, just wear them down by repeating yourself until their mind is just too tired to resist. This is what cults do. They tell you something that, taken by itself, is bewilderingly bizarre or just flat-out wrong. But they speak with such confidence and they repeat it over and over again that it begins to sound true.All I have to say, is if you're interested in reading this book, not only should you take it with a grain of salt, but a whole ocean-full. The only reason why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1, is because it is intellectually interesting to read this book in the wake of the global financial crisis we find ourselves in. Atlas Shrugged is Alan Greenspan's favorite book. No wonder why we're in this mess."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of them most intriguing works I've read in years and it can provoke vigorous reaction on a variety of levels. There's easily enough meat here to justify considering this one of the most important writing in Western Civilization, but unfortunately, it's weighed down by more than enough baggage to prevent many from seeing it in that light. Even so, the ideas are so powerful, I'll give it five stars and point out flaws only to help you recognize and avoid being distracted by them.For starters, this book is a disaster if viewed purely in novelistic terms. I cannot recall having ever seen more stilted characters nor can I recall having seen worse dialogue. I understand what Rand was going for when she sought to present her objectivist philosophy in the context of a novel, but I wish she wouldn't have tried to do that. A philosophical tract is a philosophical tract, and a novel is a novel. Perhaps it is possible to join the two, but I don't think it was done effectively here.I also think Rand's philosophy itself took an unfortunate turn as she settled into life as a U.S. celebrity and became more prone toward playing to her crowd. If you take the core plot elements of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and set them against the backdrop of Rand's formative years (in Russia at the time of the Bolshevik revolution and on the wrong side, so to speak) and the subsequent history of planned economies, you'd see that Rand has much to say that is extremely relevant to us. Had she stuck to being a pure novelist, as she seemed to be with \\"We the Living,\\" the message might have gotten through quite well. Unfortunately, as she pushed the philosophy further and further, perhaps based on the need to play to her core audience, I think she took it to places where it didn't really need to go and which detracted from her core ideas. Example: John Galt, the hero of \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" is being pressed by government leaders to become Economic Dictator and fix the mess into which society has plunged. Were this to happen, one of the things Galt says he'd do is to abolish all taxes. Among readers, that clearly resonates with political extremists on the right, and objectivists do like to argue for this sort of thing. But there's a problem. In the book, it comes completely from out in left field. There is nothing in the story to suggest John Galt, Hank Reardon, Francisco D'Anconia or any other vanishing industrialist was oppressed by taxes or even the sort of government regulations we deal with today. Nothing in the book suggests they'd have a problem with the EPA, with OSHA, with the FTC, with providing health insurance for their employees, etc. A bad line like that probably did much to play to the Rand groupies but it cheapens the fiction because when we shake our heads at its absurdity, we focus away from the substantial kinds of oppression the industrialists did face in the novel.As you read the boom, it really is vital that you develop a knack for filtering out the junk that's been put in there to please the groupies many of who, by the way, seem just-plain crazy. I'm still perplexed at the absurdity of an interview with a Rand-follower in connection with the recent Atlas Shrugged movie who ranted hysterically about how taxes and regulation had destroyed our ability to innovate. Interestingly, though, the diatribe was delivered through Yahoo! Finance on-demand streaming video easily accessible via tablet or even pocket-sized smart phone. Tell me again about the lack of innovation!To appreciate \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" you really have to edit the philosophy to adjust for stupidity thrown in by Rand to please the whackos, whether or not she eventually believed in the nonsense herself.Perhaps the best way to appreciate the bona fide substance of this novel is to use one of the reading strategies taught today to kids in elementary and middle school: look for text-to-life associations. Right from the earliest chapters, I found countless situations, attitudes, etc. that were EXACTLY like those I encountered many times in the corporate world, where ideas of thinkers are routinely \\"looted\\" not by government officials seeking social re-distribution but by legions of high-salaried PowerPoint jockeys devoid of talent or ideas but highly adept at perpetuating their positions. As James Taggart spoke, I constantly heard it as the voice of a business development person at my former company. As Wesley Mouch did his thing and as the Unification Boards strutted, I constantly saw in my mind the legions of what my company referred to as \\"business owners\\" (vapid twenty- and thirty-something kids who were put in charge of things they didn't care about or understand causing many a great idea to wither). As to the strike, the withdrawal of the industrialists, I did something like that at my company when I walked away from a product I struggled to launch. I finally yielded it to the business owner (as a result of \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" I re-named her Orren Boyle since she was exactly like that character) by quitting the division. The product collapsed within a couple of months. Actually, Orren Boyle, a politically-connected by incompetent steelmaker was better than the lady with who I worked. He wanted to latch onto profits produced by dynamic innovative Reardon Steel (hence his advocacy for a unification scheme that would distributes all profits produced by all steelmakers based on the number of boilers owned regardless of whether the boilers are actually operational). But when Reardon refused to produce at a loss to feed profits to Boyle and instead proposed that the government simply seize his company and give it to Boyle, the latter had a fit; he knew he'd screw it up. The business owners at my former company had no such self-awareness. They were happy to doers exit, and if an idea subsequently collapsed, as often happened, they'd simply look to loot another one. There are countless more precious scenes like this, far too many to enumerate here.Forget the right-wing extreme propaganda. Forget the objectivist whackos. If you are able to filter that out and really make the text-to-life associations as taught to school kids, you will see, here, the penultimate novel of our modern corporate world, the battle between those who generate ideas and those who live to loot them. This is a novel that exalts individual thought, individual initiative, individual accomplishment, individual creativity, individual responsibility, etc. and exposes the legions of parasites, shirkers (\\"It's won't!\\"), whiners (\\"I don't know how it can be done; I just know you have to do it!\\"), looters, etc. for what they are. It's a novel we badly need not just in dealing with the public sector but in dealing with the private sector (perhaps more since we are, in fact, a capitalist economy) and maybe even in our personal lives (wait till you meet Hank Reardon's brothe; Does you family have one of those!)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"The highest tribute to Ayn Rand, abundantly in evidence here, is that her critics must distort everything she stood for in order to attack her.

After all, governments are generally pretty small in Africa. So as long as there is wealth there somewhere, it will trickle down to the poor. This is the law of the free market, so no one needs to worry about anyone in Africa. Everyone will be fed and happy as long as they keep trusting the free market and don't try to interfere through government regulations or public programs.You know the problem with them starving Africans? It's just that they don't want to get up and work for it. They just keep having babies and hoping that rich people will save them. If the poor just got up and decided to work as hard as the rich do, they would be rich too. Just ask the rich, they'll tell you all about how they really deserve to be rich because they are so clearly better and more hard working than those starving losers.That's why, in America, we need to make our markets as free as possible. Africans have the right idea. If we could tear down wasteful government interference, we could just let all of our lazy, unemployed losers (and their kids) starve and die, and then our country would be genetically STRONGER.In that regard, I'm all for erasing corporate taxes, and turning all publicly owned (big government) assets over to private hands. National parks, roads, beaches, dams, city parks, schools, the military, police and fire departments, city hall, the courts, the prisons, social security, and all others should all be the personal private property of superior people and be in their complete control.No more welfare! Housing, heath care, food-- these ARE NOT RIGHTS, these are tickets to life, and if you're too much of a loser to get a ticket, then you should sit outside and starve and die.Life is a CONTEST. Don't hate the winners, I always say...I should mention this is gushy over the top sarcasm-- after all, many people actually believe Ayn Rand made perfect sense! Usually, it's a solipsistic self-justification from people that do not want to recognize that they would never hack it in the real world, so they hide behind daddy's legacy, their trust funds, or their privileged head start in life that lead them right into cushy jobs before they ever had a chance to worry about covering rent in an average job. Such people cling to this book and the author and the so-called \\"philosophy\\" therein (which isn't subscribed to or argued for by any serious modern philosopher), all while patting themselves on the back and stuffing their pockets with the fruits of someone else's labor.

This book clearly demonstrates what would happen if the entitlements the left so desires were to come to pass.I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially those studing political science and journalism.

Those who criticize objectivism usually critisize either her or the people who identify with it, instead of the philosophy itself.That shows that such folks probably haven't even become acquainted with Objectivism or simply cannot understand it. If one wants to disagree with it, fine, but at least give coherent reasons!One reviewer here states (with astonishment) that Ayn Rand kicked Christians out of her organization. Of course, I doubt that this individual has thought long enough about his assertion to realize that virtually all groups do the exact same thing.A Christian church would kick out an atheist. Any religion, in fact, would kick out those who do not agree with its beliefs. Objectivism regards religion for precisely what it is...a mind-numbing, assinine, anti-intellectual philosophy that, quite frankly, dulls the mind and makes absolutely no sense and is generally adhered to by those of lesser intelligence. (No offense, but it's TRUE.)Objectivism is the exact OPPOSITE of religion and recognizes the complete foolishness of taking anything on &quot;faith.&quot;Rand was absolutely right by kicking Christians out of her circle. Again, objectivism completely rejects religion out of hand and sees it as complete and utter nonsense. Objectivism, however, is based upon the exact opposite; reality and NOT dogma!What business would a Christian have in such an organization? Frankly, I cannot even think of a single reason as to why such a person would even want to be involved with objectivism.

Instead of carrying him to the waiting car, Tony \\"explains\\" for two pages, then dies.

She tries to avoid such an objection by having Dagny Taggart refuse to cash in on her inherited privelege, choosing instead to make her own way.But inheritance isn't always privelege. What if Taggart's &quot;inheritance&quot; was a disabled mother and three younger siblings?

The greatest value that was listed in this book was to THINK! to THINK for yourself. To live. To exist. Blindly accepting someone else's arguments without giving them real, actual, rational thought is pointless and worthless. That's why reading this book turns some people into bitter, horrible human beings. They don't know how to rationalize things for themselves, so once they're presented with a compelling argument, they fall into it and grasp hold of it, because they are shapeless, formless, and worthless in and of themselves. Since when does a compelling argument ever give you the excuse to totally abandon your entire previous belief system? Even just ONE example would be God. Yes, objectivist principles are contradictory to many tenets of Christianity. On the other hand, do they in any way prove that the world cannot be the result of intelligent design? Absolutely not. Despite how it may seem, everything has room for expansion of thought. There are always questions unanswered by philosophies, even objectivism, unless you simply use it as a blank slate to fill in every question you could have without THINKING on it for yourself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have never written a book review for amazon.com before, but after sifting through a bunch of the reviews posted here for \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", I felt compelled to write my own.I am not an avid reader or student of philosophy. I knew very little about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", other than that it is both very popular and controversial. One of my best friends recommended it to me after I had admitted to her that I was going through an emotional low point. I promised her I would read it, and I promised myself that I would not do any research on the book its author until I finished it. I wanted to read it with an open mind.\\"AS\\" is not an easy read. It's an investment of time, even if you are an avid reader. Well over a thousand pages (of small type), \\"AS\\" tells a sweeping story of a nation experiencing a government-induced economic decline, and the struggles of the self-made industrial giants trying to survive while their economic and emotional burdens continuously mount. As the main characters try to fight the good fight, other industrialists are mysteriously vanishing, abandoning their livelihood after meeting with a mysterious figure referred to as \\"the destroyer\\". Rand uses the story as a vehicle for illustrating her \\"objectivism\\" philosophy.Without giving much more of the plot away, here's what I got out of the book. First, putting your happiness above that of others is not selfish, as long as you are ethical and moral in your efforts. Everyone has professional goals and personal desires, and making those the reason for your efforts will produce a happier, more fulfilled life.Second, the title of the book refers to dealing with burden. Emotional burdens are no different from physical ones - eventually they will break you unless you learn to offload them. Some people (including myself) become so mired in their burdens that they lose sight of how to deal with them. Blessed are those who have family or good friends to help them \\"let go\\" and be happier. The book takes this concept to it logical, if not extreme, conclusion.Overall, I liked the book very much. The overall story, plot twists, and character revelations kept my constant interest. Again, it is long, and at times I found myself skimming over the more \\"preachy\\" parts. At 1000+ pages, I guess there are bound to be those sections. Although I have no intention of running out and becoming a full-on \\"objectivist\\", the book did give me some things to think about and offer a different perspective on life.If you are completely unfamiliar with this book, read it without prejudice. Do not research Rand, objectivism, or seek out further book reviews. Just read it. Every book deserves an unbiased reader.One final thought: In doing research on this book, I saw a press release announcing plans to make a movie out of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". If someone had the budget and vision, this book could become an epic film on the scale of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Trying to distill it down to two hours of film would be a disaster (see \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\"). Oh, but I have faith in Hollywood. :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Why do so many praise (particullarly in politics) the virtues that make man less human, while at the same time degrade the most noble of man's traits? Why do certain people lift the those who consume the energy of society upon the rest of our shoulders, while simultaneously damning the producers that make such empty consumption possible? Why is human weakness and vice heralded as a badge of honor by some, while our real strengths are attacked as selfish and arrogant? Read this book and find out.Not only is &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; an exhilerating novel, it offers a clear answer to how a man should live on this planet, and why most don't.This book was ranked by members of Congress as the second most influential book in thier lives behind only the bible. Considering what is happening down in D.C. right now, I am afraid that our elected representatives were infuenced by &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; for all the wrong reasons, as Rand does a good job of expaining how the &quot;elite&quot; have worked for centuries to gain power over the mind of man.Should you read this book you will most likely love it or hate it . . but I doubt that you will fall somewhere in the middle. Read it and draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Well, I am one of those people who have to say... &quot;This book changed my life!&quot; I actually came across it by accident a few years after some friends had told me about it. Most of them would go on and on about how great it was and how I needed to read it. Usually, I am turned off by that kind of talk. If something is that popular, then I am 9 times out of 10 going to be bored to death with it. I listened very nicely as they went on and on and a few months later forgot all about it.So, fast forward a few years and one night I see a tattered, much read copy of Atlas Shrugged sitting on a shelf looking lonely. I pick it up and after reading the first three pages... I knew it was going to change my life. I read it practically non-stop over the next few weeks... staying up all night and neglecting all sorts of things so I could just &quot;get through the next chapter&quot;.You see, I had always believed that a person could be selfish and not hurt anyone around them. In fact, I had always thought in a secret part of my mind that it was possible to behave in a self-interested way and actually help those around you. I had carried this around with me for years always wondering what was wrong with me until I read Atlas Shrugged and learned that I was not so alone in my beliefs and perhaps I was not entirely wrong.It opened my mind to so many new ideas and helped my to see all of my old ideas and beliefs more clearly.I guess the most common criticism is that the book is not realistic. I would agree, but I don't think it was intended to be realistic. I think it was written as a model... an example of &quot;what if&quot; under many different scenarios. Ayn Rand had a very well thought out philosophy. She wanted to deliver her beliefs to the masses. So, she made a choice... Either pump out another boring college style philosophy book in the manner of Kant of Marx god forbid some long-winded economist... and sell a few dozen copies to fill the libraries and dollar book bins, or write a passionate love story and try to weave objectivism throughout it pages. It is melodramatic and sometimes downright ridiculous, but it is that way for a reason... to make a point. It is written in that extreme manner to set an example. Black versus white. She is trying to make it easy to understand by filtering everything down to a fundamental level.Does she leave out certain things...? Yes. Psychology, for one. But she never claims to have been a psychologist.She leaves out other things too, but this book was not meant to be an accurate description of the world that exists around us. It is meant to teach a lesson of what would happen if... If the motor of the world were stopped. It is meant to remind us that we take many things in our lives for granted... technology, advances in medicine and nutrition. We live lives that are free and easy compared to our relatives only a century ago, yet how many of us stop and thank Henry Ford, or Dale Carnegie, or J.P. Morgan. Few. We instead find all of the faults that they had and write books and demonize them for having too much money or too much power or whatever. I ask the reader... What if there were no cars, or no oil or no banking system...? What would our lives be like today? What if there were no Bill Gates? You would not be reading these words. The internet, computers... would not exist exactly as they do today. Love them or hate them, the &quot;prime movers&quot; of the world have done much good and we live easier lives because they keep the motor running. Always running."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is the greatest novel of all time. Its intense story will keep you on the edge of your seat, its compelling philosophical statements will keep your mind working, and your curiosity will keep the pages turning. This is the world's greatest story of romanticism, individualism and heroism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What always bothered me most about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was the ambiguous fate of the office boy Eddie Willers. The novel's structure leaves him stranded in the middle of an inhospitable wilderness alongside a train he has no ability to start. He will survive only if one of the producers and creators who have gone on strike comes along to re-start the train's engine - the \\"motor of the world.\\" But the irony of his fate is lost on the novel's author, for if he didn't live in a world dominated by trains and planes and other mechanical wonders only a chosen few are able to create and keep in working order he would not have become totally dependent on \\"his betters\\" for his survival. He wouldn't have ended up in the middle of nowhere, because without a train to carry him there he would not have been there; he would have been in a place where he could survive using his own skills, however limited these skills were, and not passing through an endless wilderness, egged on by a greater intelligence.If you level the playing field, the \\"Eddie Willers\\" may not be so dependent on the \\"John Galts\\" for their existence as the novel suggests. This is not to say, the producers and creators should be hobbled to give those less endowed a competitive edge; but rather that once the producers create a world based solely on production, those unable to produce are themselves handicapped and cannot compete or even survive except for the largesse of the producers. The producers make subsistence living of the kind found in hunter/gatherer/primitive farming cultures unsustainable, for a host of reasons, primarily property. Those that have can get; and once they have gotten property after property after property, there will remain very little if any usable land left for non-productive use, such as basic agriculture or hunting/gathering. One need only examine the history of Native American peoples to grasp the dynamic behind this dichotomy between what producers acquire and what remains for those outside the production paradigm. Of course, such a concept as leveling the playing field is anathema to the producers - and, of course, the attempt to do just that is, in large part, what prompts their strike against the rest of humanity. The John Galts cannot flourish in a world held to the level of subsistence living because in such a world the John Galts are the equal of everyone else. The world must be made grand and mighty and of such overarching design that ordinary mortals can only shake their heads in awe at those who create and maintain it in order for the John Galts to stand so far above and beyond the mass of humanity. Once humanity gives in to the Siren Song and places its fortunes in the hands of those who can fill the world with things they can only dream of, the game is up, the fix is in, the die is cast. And if, as in \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" they try and re-claim it, the producers will retreat to their Shangra-La to watch from on high as their foolish inferiors attempt to survive in the world they bought hook-line-and-sinker from their \\"betters.\\" If you want a life filled with gleaming cities and glittering machines, then you must make like good little lackeys and obey your betters or they'll leave you high and dry - because you've allowed them by default to make it their world, with you merely an interloper.If all this sounds way too polemical for the review of a novel, it's because the novel is itself way too polemical. It's a great novel; not \\"great\\" in the sense of a \\"War and Peace\\" or a \\"Jude the Obscure\\" or a \\"Moby Dick,\\" but deserving of five stars, certainly in its execution. It's exciting, dramatic, wildly entertaining, with even a fair share of subtlety and humor. But it's also heavy-handed in the extreme. The heroes are literally flawless, the villains irredeemably flawed. There are patches of gray, along with scores of well-drawn characters; but this is overwhelmingly a novel of black and white, good versus bad, moral against immoral. Every instance of collective activity is unmitigatedly wrong-headed and vile; every instance of individualistic activity is unerringly correct and above-board. Toward the end a train full of passengers is destroyed in a tunnel; the novel paints them all, to a man and woman, as collectivists, thus unworthy of sympathy for their plight. When you think about it, that's quite a feat, making the deaths of perhaps dozens of people merely an expression of philosophical correctness. So, too, is the fate of Eddie Willers little more than a philosophical footnote. Not his boss Dagny Taggart, not his unwitting fellow worker John Galt, not his rival for Dagny's affections, Hank Reardon - not one single hero/producer/creator gives Eddie Willers, who devoted his entire life to their cause, a second thought when they abandon the world their ambition and genius has wrought. His only \\"sin\\" is that he once thought there must be something higher in life than \\"business and earning a living\\"; but oh what a sin that was! Now that's philosophical purity truly gone wild."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read Atlas Shrugged when I was 21, and it shattered so many illusions for me. I felt I finally had begun to grasp the motives and subsequent actions of other people, and suddenly, a better context for work and life was made plain by Rand's words. The novel is also an excellent novel of intrigue, and while the philosophical bent of the book can put some people off, you should read it because it will leave you so much better informed about the nature of the world around you. If you are a person that values yourself, your work, and the value of the opportunities our society offers, you owe it to yourself to read this novel, recognize the characters within and then observe parallels to them in your own life. You will also find that Rand is a spot-on prophet, predicting with uncanny accuracy our current political, social and economic woes. I have read it many times, and always find that it has a peculiar ring of truth, unusual in modern fiction."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having played DA Flint in Ayn Rands courtroom drama the Night of January 16th, I was compelled to eventually read her magnum opus. Even though it took me 2 separate readings of the 3 parts of this novel. I was so glad to read this on my Kindle for iPad rather than having to hold the 1000+ page book.Rand has an extraordinary talent for describing a scene that, I swear, one could absolutely smell from her descriptions. Her depiction of this world she created so long ago is truly chilling. Am I John Gault? Yep!The only downside to Rands writing is her occasional haranguing dialogues she can have for 60 pages. But, it's the rare paragraphs that perfectly describe a rainy urban day and her full bodied characters that kept my interest to the bitter end.Read this book for it's cautionary tale nature and enjoy the cast of characters that take you along for the ride!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are plenty of existing reviews that cover the content and get into the debates about objectivism or start to bash Ayn Rand. This is a life changing book: if you've never taken a stand for anything in your life, this book will inspire you to do so.The truly frightening - and I mean to the pit of your stomach scary frightening - is that the book has COME TRUE. I'll put it this way: every time I see ANY politician from DC on the air, all I can think of is moochers and looters. Those who have read Atlas Shrugged and got it will know exactly what I'm talking about and get the same cold chills I do, those that don't know what I mean didn't get the book.I read this every couple of years."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand must have had a looking glass into the the future and have seen the politics and economy of today.

It's got some good ideas, and some bad ideas. It's got good writing, and bad writing. So has any other book.

Just read it, enjoy it, and move on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was not a remarkable philosopher but a rather a pathetic demagouge who lacked any well-formed, decent ideas. By all means, read this book if you are interested in the development of right wing ideas, but understand that this is not the work of a woman who knew much about what she attempted to describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd fascist Ubermensch philosophy, Atlas is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it has become a holy book of a cult movement for 40 years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of her followers."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's fictional story about \\"when the engine of the world stopped\\" is rather poorly written. The philosophical perspective presented in some of the speeches and some of the events in this overly long story is individualism that knows no restraint. I got the feeling while reading this book that there was no such thing as society, no such thing as kindness or compassion. In fact it seemed like compassion and kindness were moral faults to be sneered at. Anyway, the story was second rate at best and kind of horrifying at worst.Judging the literary quality of a book may be a matter of taste, however I am not alone in considering the book to be poorly written. The specific areas where it is wanting in quality are these:(1) The characters are poorly developed and seem to exist mainly to advance the philosophical agenda of the author.(2) the situations and conversations presented in the story lack credibility. What person have you ever met who launches into a 4 or 5 page philosophical presentation while courting or love making?(3) the 'bad' characters are 'bad' mostly because they think that social responsibility and compassion matter. Somehow compassion is a vice that the author distorts until it cannot be recognised. Such departures from real life experience that we all share really degrades the story line into parody - again this is done to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. The parody is not intentional it is merely the product of poor composition(4) the story is at times interminably verbose. What could be said in a few lines is stretched out into tedious pages by the author because she had an inadequate ability to write in the English language. Verbosity does not clarify and it does not improve a story line.I am sure that this book appeals mainly to people in their later teens - before they gained enough life experience and enough good sense to reject the stupidity that the author seems to think is a virtue."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My daughter read this book recently and became very interested in government and philosophy. She has 17 year-old eyes that can read the tiny print. I really would like to read this book too, but wow the font is tiny! Thought I'd get it on my iphone, where I can enlarge the text a little. Well, I'm not spending $18.99 for it! Why is the publisher setting such a high price?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"According to Ayn Rand, a work of art is a selective reproduction of reality. It abstracts the defining characteristics of what the artist wants to reproduce in order to convey her theme. While the theme of Atlas Shrugged is crystal clear, it fails its audience by pretending reality is something else than what it is.The novel tells the story of John Galt, a superman who decides he will not live for the sake of others and of Dagny Taggart, the chief operating officer of Taggart Railroad. Taggart shares Galt's sense of life; she comes across Galt when she finds more and more of the men and women she respects are disappearing and abandoning their work and their businesses. It seems John Galt is urging that the doers of the world go on strike.Dagny's chase for Galt goes on for a thousand pages of action and diatribe, including an interminable sixty page radio speech by Galt attacking the rest of world. By the end, he, Dagny and the other super men and women leave the world to rebuild a new society. A little utopian for my taste.In real life, there are no people like John Galt or Dagny Taggart. If courage is to face one's fears, then they are not courageous because they have never known fear. Real people, including idealized heroes, do experience fear and do have moments of self-doubt. We might wish fear and angst were not part of our selves, but wishing something never makes it real. If we were to try to \\"be like John Galt\\" we'd wind up denying we are ever gripped by doubt and we'd repress our feelings rather than resolve them. A perfect John Galt does not inspire us to emulate him, it makes us wish upon a star to be already like him.Compare Rand's book with Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind. (Rand mimics Mitchell's style quite a bit I think.) Dagny Taggart's can-do attitude is remarkably similar to Scarlett O'Hara's gumption but Scarlett is a real person because she has flaws along with her qualities. She faces adversity with courage, but learns and grows as a person. The only thing Dagny Taggart learns is where to find John Galt. There's no growth, no learning about oneself.Where Gone With The Wind ultimately speaks to us as people, Atlas Shrugged speaks only to our frustrations that neither the world nor we are perfect. We should accept that and try to better ourselves; we shouldn't pretend that our problems can be wished away. Rand writes A is A, i.e. things are as they are. Well people are what they are, should we pretend otherwise?Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the seminal philosophical/literary work of the 20th century.It excels chiefly as a literary work (not as much, I think, as a philosophical tome). Rand has crafted a masterpiece; the vision of the book is expansive yet driven. The plot, though vast in it's complexity, is at all times feels seamless. As I read the book I had the feeling one often gets when standing at the lip of a large canyon, or gazing up at a hopelessly tall mountain- the upwelling of emotions as you feel small and inspired and scared all at one moment. I was blown away by the magnificent beauty with which the book was written.One cannot but at least mention objectivism; it permeats the entire book, it is everything Rand believed. I must admit that I don't ascribe to this philosophy, nor do I think that it is ultimately worth much. But one can still (and should, I think) read the book merely because of its amazing literary merit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is amazing. You will not be able to put this book down. The theories behind the story and characters will keep you intrigued during the entire book. This is an absolute must for any American who reads."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read &quot;We the living&quot;, &quot;The fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and I believe that Ayn Rand is a gifted writter.Her characters are very powerful and interesting and it is truly amazing that she can maintain the suspense in novels of such length. Perhaps her only problem is that she can sometimes be repetitive.However, from a philosophical standpoint, please, hold your horses.Ayn Rand wishes to convince us about the benefits of capitalism and her view of humanity at it's best through emotive speeches, rather than with reason.John Galt and Howard Roarke, the heroes, are so courageous and intelligent that it is impossible not to admire them (and to agree with them). Their enemies, on the other hand, are depicted as the lowest king of scum, so it is equally impossible not to hate them.But, would people be as convinced of her views if they were taught to us by a dull philosophy professor with a drinking problem and a stranged family, for example? Likewise, what if Hank Rearden, the industrialist of the novel, had been shown hiring thughs to subdue disgruntled workers, rather than being the boss of Happy Inc.?It should be clear to everybody that it would have been possible to write an equally emotional and credible book, pitting hateful plutocrats against honest valiant socialists, fighting for the rights of the &quot;oppressed&quot;.This might sound nonsensical to those who have communism in fresh memory, but it probably isn't the case to those who also remember capitalism at its worst (i.e. child labor at the beginning of the industrial revolution, or today in Southeast Asia).As it turns out, there are plenty of reasons why liberal democracies paired with market economies and free trade are superior than totalitarian socialist states. However, none of these reasons are mentioned, described or explained in Ayn Rand's book (and we should be thankful for it, because they are boring).So, enjoy &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and the rest of Ayn Rand's books, because they tell great stories, but do not think of them as life changing reading(and certainly not as &quot;the second most influential book after the bible&quot;)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged has a great plot premise. In the hands of a decent author, it could be a great book. Instead, characters with no ambiguity speak in philosophical lectures about Rand's objectivism. While one can make a good case for objectivism in running a business, such as a railroad, Rand tries to apply it to art, family--and even love! She criticizes those who do not take an extremist stance, but that's exactly the problem with the book. It's an all-or-nothing theory in a world that's far more complex than her theories allow."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's excruciatingly long diatribe on how the vast majority of the world is mooching off a few talented people (called the prime movers). She creates these god like beings who, despite the books insistence on them being perfectly rational, go about doing and thinking absurd things.The climax of absurdity is when we discover the secret utopian valley of these prime movers. These men are so hard working and brilliant that they are able to do the work of hundreds of men in a six hour work day. Ayn Rand's theory of art is said to be that of \\"romantic realism\\", she tends more towards romance then realism.Second only to this in absurdity is where the heroine, Dagny, shoots a man for being indecisive. Given that Rand goes on about the need for a rational basis for morality this struck me as more then hypocritical.Other interesting aspects: Insistence on a gold standard, desire for the complete abolition of taxes , and the world wide domination of communism. The \\"proof\\" of all these things was reported, by Dagny, to be in John Galts 5000 page(at least that's how long it seemed) speech. I dare anyone to find anything resembling a proof proving Ayn Rand's philosophy.Atlas Shrugged will appeal only to those as deluded and narcissistic as Ayn Rand.."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I Cannot believe how quickly I read this book.

So very relevant to today."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book for the first time about 20 years ago, have read it twice since then, and have re-read favorite sections many times. As the child of &eacute;migr&eacute;s who escaped Stalinist Hungary in 1956, I was especially moved by the story and Rand's rallying cry against Socialist elements taking root in America. More than anything, I was swayed by Rand's philosophy and the use of the novel as a vehicle to communicate the tenets of this philosophy.Rand was born into a bourgeois family in Russia. During the Bolshevik Revolution, her father's pharmacy business was confiscated and her family was displaced. These early experiences gave her a lifelong hatred of Socialist/Communist ideals and helped form her belief in reason as the highest human ideal. She saw tremendous beauty in capitalism and the industrial marvels (skyscrapers, bridges, factories, railways) that were born of it.Atlas Shrugged, Rand's second commercially successful novel (after The Fountainhead), is a celebration of industrial achievement, entrepreneurial spirit, the individual drive to succeed, and the dogged pursuit of rational self-interest. The antagonists in her story all espouse a sympathy or passion for Socialist values and they are all set on milking successful enterprises and individuals, all the while denouncing them publicly. The story is elaborate and engaging, with protagonists that include - surprisingly - a pirate and a rich playboy.No question, selfishness is a virtue in Rand's philosophy, and the story in Atlas Shrugged makes this abundantly clear. Asked to put a political label on the philosophy, I would say libertarian comes close. If these ideas run very contrary to your thinking, at a minimum Atlas Shrugged will open your mind to a very different world view. At most, it will influence a complete change in some of your most cherished beliefs.Now that twenty years have passed, I hold family as my highest ideal, and collaborating with others to be more critical than ever to my own success. So Rand's philosophy and the story in Atlas Shrugged don't resonate as strongly as they once did for me.

One of these was Atlas Shrugged. It will truly make you think about a variety of subjects. You may not agree with all of them, but that's part of what learning is all about. Set in a novel form, it really works your mind, and there are times you'll read things over because it will just nail something that was lurking around in your subconcious mind. I would have to bet some of the negative reviews were truly written by people who didn't even read it. Some of the glowing reviews may be by someone who just read it or are still young. I personally view it as a great base for your education and literally took to heart the thinking for yourself aspect of it and kept reading similar and opposing viewpoints. Rand fans would do well to augment their knowledge on the subject with Milton Friedman's &quot;Free to Choose&quot; and F.A. Hayek's &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot;.

It is suprisingly interesting for a philosophical book, and I found that it not only made me think for a long time afterward, but also to become involved in the characters and plot as I read it as well.For all its good points however, I find two major flaws with this bookFirst of all, it can tend to get overly \\"preachy\\" at times. As an argument for a philosophy, actions can sometimes speak louder than words. The most convincing scene in the book is when an accident happens, an easily preventable disaster, merely because noone was willing to take personal responsibility for their actions. By following the natural pathway from cause to effect, she shows how misguided views that seem harmless at first can, in the long run, ruin a nation. Contrast this with \\"the speech\\", the 100 page long outburst by Galt about Rand's philosophy. The ideas are there, but they seem lifeless and unconvincing compared to the saga the reader has seen thus far. Even the shorter monologues, at a few pages each, are prone to skimming instead of understanding.Secondly, her world seems just a little bit too black and white to be realistic. Every character is either pure good or pure evil, as is shown by everything from their physical description to their sometimes amazingly dimwitted comments. Rand seems to be following a strategy of getting us to ignore opposing ideas by having them spoken by people who are mere caricatures without any good qualities, and therefore have us ignore them. The overall effect of this work on me however, was as a caution against extremism more than a radical shift in philosophy, Precisely because the characters had such extreme views that I saw the flaws in the extreme levels to which the views were taken rather than the ideas themselves, which is probably what Rand intended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand is fabulous in this anthem of living each day to the fullest with only yourself to live and die for. Even the audio version is great. The development of characters and depth of speeches and thought truly make you think of how you live each day. In these times, the true test is to know when Atlas shall really shrug.... and who will fall from the heavens."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You can either read the book to get Rand's philosophy or you can read this to get her philosophy: thinking is an act of choice, choose to think and all will be well, choose not to think, and all will not be well. Since the book was ultimately written as a conduit to express her philosophy, you can now skip reading it.Rand divides the world into the heroes that think and act for themselves (the good guys) and all the rest, who are parasites and thugs (the bad guys). The good guys have cool names (John Galt, Dagny Taggart, etc.), while the bad have names like Mooch. Rand implies (not too subtly) that the bad guys don't even deserve to live. Rand wants to negate the role of emotion in human existence and portrays an ideal human as having a Spock-like commitment to the logical.Rand's real life bore no resemblance to the characters that she idealized in her big novels (Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead). She was neurotic, vindictive and deeply dependent upon the opinion and acceptance of others. This is well chronicled in various biographies about her life. Her philosophy of Objectivism developed an almost cult-like following and she seemed to revel in the role of cult leader (quite contradictory to her philosophy of valuing autonomy and free will).I agree with a previous reviewer's statement that this book could have been much shorter w/o losing much. She is very redundant with her philosophy. It's an admirable philosophy and many people have been inspired by it (especially at the high school and college levels, myself included), but it is more of a vision than something that can ever become a reality for anyone not stranded on a desert island. The simple truth is that people are dependent on one another, that every one has his/her neuroses, blind spots, etc.Read the book, maybe it'll motivate you to become more self-sufficient. Don't be disappointed, though, when you discover that reality (defined as your interpersonal dealings) will never come anywhere close to matching the ideal that Rand presents."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone having witnessed the social experiment, and the tinkering of human tendencies will approve of the premise of this novel. Already we see the negative effects of the Great Society; namely, the rise of expectations among those unable or unwilling to improve their own existence for themselves. This attitude of deserved entitlements, irrelavant of merit, has reduced the human spirit and greatly increased the power of government. One reader questioned how incompetance might attain power. Look no farther than Washington, the Santa Claus of the Western Hemisphere. Government would love to enhance its power through the public's insecurities. Congress tells us what to eat, how to raise our children, which books are agreeable. For some, adherence to these standards frees oneselve from blame. Remember the zombies the former Soviet Union produced. Has no one understood the signifance of that government's collaspe, or the present restrictions with the People's Republic of China? No country with oppressive social and economic programming will ever become a world power. The militaristic stance displayed is more suited toward internal policies fueled by paranoia. The current concerns the US government purports to address only enhances the gross authority it already possesses. Does anyone really believe that tobacco companies should pay for the ill effects of that product which adults choose to indulge. Where does this money really go? Should auto companies be made to pay for injuries incurred by neglect drivers? Should the government deceide whom may purchase a vehicle? If the government had its way, we would all work for it, and in some ways, we do. Ms Ryan today provokes many thoughts on these subjects: the growth of government, the diminution of human capability, the extinction of individualism. If the government was so concerned for the masses, if Congress wished to redress the wrongs of big companies, they should begin with oil prices. Read the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book perhaps ten times. I believe that after the current administration's attempts to take over all successful industries in this country, this book is more relevant than ever. Ayn Rand would have a stroke were she here today. I believe that she would probably be on &quot;Crossfire&quot; or &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot; every other night.Anyone who believes that going after &quot;BIG&quot; tobacco, oil, software, (insert a &quot;BIG&quot; successful industry here) is in the public's interest or even ethical must read this book. Whether they agree with all of Rand's philosophy (I don't), it will depict the absolutely corrupt, unethical, and totalitarian agendas in ways nobody else can. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand sets out in novel form what she sees as the problems underlying various forms of modern philosophy. Whether or not her solutions would create a moral utopia, she sucessfully conveys the how and the why of her ideal &quot;social system&quot;, laissez faire capitalism.I would recommend this novel to someone intensly interested in the meaning of being human, man's relationship to society, and philosophy in general. The novel would seem too long-winded to someone without an intense and focused interest. &quot;This is the reasoning...ad naseum&quot; is a pattern prevalent in the text making it go over a thousand pages. One of the author's goals is to make the novel's ideas closed-ended, not open to any misintepretation or misguided criticism. While she often does a masterful job in detailing her thoughts, at the same time I think the book is sometimes too defensive (a criticism not often levelled against Ms. Rand) in that she often addresses the most miniscule and petty possible counterarguments to her ideas.A legitimate question to be asked is whether to read Atlas Shrugged or Rand's non fiction works? Does Atlas Shrugged acomplish what a novel should? She has certainly structured a plot that provides an illumination of her ideas. However, it is reasonable for a reader to expect in a novel more depth of character development than Rand achieves. She uses her characters as archetypes of philosophy. I think it would have been a tremendous creative feet had Rand made her characters more down-to-earth while acomplishing the same strong rendering of her ideology. For one thing, all of the novel's antogonists are irrational straw-men. Rather then developing non- Objectivist viewpoints as non-Objectivists would and then showing why they are wrong, she makes them into, for lack of a better description, blithering idiots. In the real world, wrong ideas are less apparently wrong and, even more so, immoral and irrational people are not always so blatantly irrational, shallow, and stupid.By not giving proper development to her antogonists, she can easily anger readers without predisposition to her ideology to the point where they will not want to read further. To make this truly a masterpiece, she needed to add more depth to what she deems irrational.Having said this, it might be more worthwhile to read Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand by Leonard Peikoff, which is a non fiction work that outlines her ideas and the logic behind them. However, if an intense novel-style philosophic treatise interests you, and you would not mind her peremptory tone, this is certainly well worth your time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Those familiar with Rand's teaching method come to understand that her main triliogy of books are mere interpretations of her theories. Her belief in &quot;Objectivism&quot; and the notion that all people working to their fullest potential derives the greatest gains for all is so spectacularly reitterated in this novel that by the books end, you are screaming at the characters that try to foil the plans of the well intended. Most of us were assigned this book in high school and read the cliff's notes. What a tragedy. Had I read this book as a younger man, I do fully believe it would have altered the direction of my life. Maybe not in purpose but certainly in quality. I'd have enjoyed the ride better. Rand's books bring that out in you. As she said at the beginning of the FountainHead - &quot;Howard Rourke laughed.&quot; We could learn a lot here folks - take the time to read this treasure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand sees the value of masculine drive, creativity and pride. She is the most influential author of the 20th Century, showing that many, many people agree. And yet, movies, films and recent books reflect a consensus - that masculinity is bad, and that to praise male qualities EVER must be anti-woman in some way. Rand's heroic characters - male and female - show that these virtues have been responsible for the magnificent achievements of civilization. Only a Randian hero can revive our sterile culture."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The most intense book I've ever read. A friend recommended it and I was hooked instantly.

None of her books are easy. the price was right. Thanks"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I would recommend this product for anyone to buy, great service and no issues at all. no problems at all"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged when I was seventeen, and I loved it. Like Scarlet O'Hara of Gone With the Wind, Dagny Taggart was a strong woman, impulsive, willing to flaunt convention in order to get what she wanted. She was passionate, beautiful, and a match for any man in whatever she chose to do. It was Dagny who ran the Transcontinental Railroad, not her brother James who was the titular head of the company. She was competent and decisive where her brother was weak. I loved it for the romance between Dagny and Hank Reardon, never mind that Hank was a married man. His wife Lillian didn't love him, felt nothing but disdain for him. Dagny Taggart was a woman I could admire. \\"Do not let your fire go out,\\" she said. \\"... the world you desire can be won. It exists... it is real.. it is possible.\\" I was inspired by her words, and I applauded.From the beginning of the book, there's the sense that this is a dystopian world, reminiscent of both the thirties but also of a future time where America is in a precipitous downward spiral. Businesses are failing; men are out of work. When the moochers, bums, and worthless brutes who roam city streets ask the question - Who is John Galt - they have no understanding of what they're asking or who this man might be. They are like zombies. Businessmen who run the most important companies are disappearing,leaving their companies rudderless. The great hordes see the world falling apart, but they offer no solution. They simply accept what is happening.Years later, I still remember that 60-page speech John Galt gave to the world. At the time I didn't question exactly how these very talented men could hook up a loudspeaker system that would carry Galt's voice to the far corners of the earth. These men, these movers of society, these great men who had given so much to the world, they were surely capable of creating such a system. But the speech wore me out. I understood that it was Ayn Rand's philosophy, but I was more interested in Dagny Taggart and whether she would live happily ever after in the arms of a man as talented as she.Thinking about the book now, I'm sickened by the elitism, the division of society into producers and looters, creators and moochers, prime movers and parasites, the view of the lower classes as unthinking brutes. I'm appalled by Rand's characterization of government as obstructionist, of society as composed almost completely of worthless individuals, incompetent, lethargic, and impotent. I hate her portrayal of the poor as being either stupid or lazy, and I profoundly disagree with Rand's view that society is intent on robbing the entrepreneurs of their riches.Ayn Rand called it a love story, and it is certainly that. Critics add that it's a mystery - what is happening to all these important businessmen? Where are they going, and why? It's also science fiction in that Galt's Gulch exists in a parallel world, a mysterious valley where the world's most successful businessmen and entrepreneurs have gone, presumably to bask in the light of all the gold they've accumulated. They're a vengeful lot; by withdrawing their unique talents from the world they will prove their worth. They'll finally get the credit they so richly deserve. The world will see that without them, there is chaos.To have nothing but contempt for those who struggle, to believe these unthinking creatures deserve to perish from the earth, is to be less than human. I think I won't reread this book. Instead, I might just pick up Gone with the Wind. It's a great romance, full of history, well-rounded characters, conflict, and above all, a protagonist who is deeply flawed, but one who is also human."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Book should be a must read for high school students and especially any knuckleheads who are considering voting for the Socialist liar in chief Obama. Seller delivered on time and as expected."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was given this book as a special gift from someone I vaguely knew. The reason he gave it to me was because he saw in me a certain characteristic that reminded him of this novel, Atlas Shrugged.When I began reading this novel, I was lost in exile, isolated from the world and my life. I read this book with eager eyes, devouring page after page. I identified so much with this story, mostly because I was lost within society and my life because I felt as if I was denied of what I truly wanted. But everything we do should have a personal motive, and we should do it for our best interest. The characters in this novel sacrifice everything for society and the government, and they do it not for the money, but because it is their job. So what happens if everyone suddenly stops doing their job? The people who hold true power and true control are gone and the leeches of society are left flooding the city in chaos.This is real life. We may not see it every day, but it is real.What purpose do you have in your life? Are you living for others or for yourself?Though I am still young, Atlas Shrugged has been the most influential novel I have ever read. It is timeless and represents a philosophy that most may not agree with or understand, but to those who can identify themselves with this novel and philosophy, Atlas Shrugged will inspire you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Finally finished this book (only took me four months) and oh my! Rand could have said the same thing using 500 pages or less, particularly \\"Rand's Rant!\\" which took up most of the chapter \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\". I don't know how many times she thought she needed to repeat the same thing over and over again. \\"Producers are good.\\" \\"Moochers are bad.\\" While there is some merit in much of what she says, she presents her views in a very extremist, all-or-nothing way. It's as if there are only two kinds of people in the world, the do-ers and the people who sponge off of them. It's as if there are no good reasons to give to others and if someone is starving, let them starve.Sex is an interesting value in this book. The heroine Dagny sleeps with three men, each progressively more successful, in a material sense, than the last, with John Galt being the ultimate representation of those values Dagny holds most dear. I feel sorry for Francisco and particularly Hank Rearden (1st and 2nd lovers), who thought they loved Dagny, but who discovered she was practicing her own version of social Darwinism, sleeping with the most successful male in the tribe. When the better male came along, she couldn't dump the other guy fast enough.It's a classic book to be sure and the final mirror image of Rand's own mind and philosophy. There is a certain amount of truth in what she says too, especially if you look at the economic and political climate of the world as it is today. The government throws tons of taxpayer money at its pet projects while threatening to tax the living daylights out of those people and companies that really produce. Yes, the top 1% are probably paid disproportionately high, even compared to what they generate in goods and services, but that's the fault of the other 99% for letting it happen. The vast majority of the people who complain about corporate greed engage in creating runaway debt to satisfy their their own runaway greed for the latest iPad, Lexus, or designer clothing product on the market. If you want to hurt the \\"evil\\" corporations, just don't buy their junk. How many Starbucks lattes do you really \\"need\\" a week, anyway? Try a little self-discipline and stop being a slave to marketing.At the end of the book, Rand writes an afterward stating that she stands by the philosophy (this isn't a novel, it's a 1168 page philosophical stream of Rand's consciousness about her values, morals, and principles) presented in this book (and in all her books). She says it's worked very well for her characters (who are fictional and thus, anything can work for them if she writes it that way) and for her (which I can't argue with, since it's her life and she should know).I think heading in the direction that Rand is pointing, relative to where the U.S. is now is a good idea, but I don't think the ultimate destination Rand suggests is where we want to end up. But then again, from Rand's point of view, I'd be considered a moderate (although from the far left position, I'm probably seen as quite conservative). Working hard and producing value should be rewarded and deciding to allow others to support you (as opposed to real, circumstantial need) should not be rewarded. The trick is to determine a system that can extend itself to those who really do need temporary help to get back on their feet without creating generations of people who exist just to live off of the system.End rant."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my second reading of Atlas Shrugged, decades apart from the first. I can still appreciate Ms Rand's arguments for her political and economic philosophy even if I do not agree with all of them. However, the rationale for her philosophy of human relationships escapes me. She appears to be applying the competitive, egoistic moral code used in her business model to human relations. After reading of Dagny and Hank's escapades and conversations in the bedroom, I closed my Kindle thinking that these are two very troubled human beings."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Good story, but like a directors cut of a movie, needs to be shortened.

OK, I get it that Rand is a materialist, but she's sucked all the life out of this novel by making it such a relentless polemic. Quite ironically it occurred to me while reading \\"Atlas\\" that it has all the esthetic appeal of socialist realist art from the Soviet era.There's NO nuance or subtlety here. The characters lack the complex motivations and emotions of real life. The individualist heroes are flat prototypes and all other characters are weak, conformists totally lacking character and virtue.I just can't take this tome seriously as philosophy or literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Reads like a work of *ideology* written by someone who didn't quite grasp any of the great European *philosophers* that she apparently read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Since when have electronic books become more expensive than hard copies?

Rand articulates the immorality of the Right more effectively than anyone else. If you are looking for a justification to ignore your fellow man, to kick him down the metaphorical stairs, this is it.

Thank you, Ayn Rand, for laying out for all the World to see the pathetic self-absorption of human beings who find self-absorption attractive.

They produce efficiently, market effectively, and profit accordingly. Another group of main characters believes the U.S. should become a socialistic nation, whereby the poor and lazy (called moochers) and a select few of the wealth re-distributors (called \\"looters\\") benefit at the expense of the wealthy producers. While the plot is much, much more complex than I can describe in a few paragraphs here, the producers (and brilliant musicians, and artists, and inventors, and pillars of society) decide to go on strike, and let the world spiral downward into complete entropy, whereupon they will create a new, better society.Rather than focus on the politics contained within Rand's book, as some others have done before me, I will simply convey how I felt about reading \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Rand's prose was agonizing to read at times. She repeats ideas literally scores of times, often using phrases that are nearly identical to the ones she used 400 pages earlier. I had difficulty reading more than five or six pages during a single sitting -- some of which ended with my chucking the book across the room in disgust.At the same time, the premise of producers striking and eventually dropping out of society to form their own version of utopia was fascinating to me. Throughout the first half of the book, I wanted to know who John Galt was. Throughout the second half, I wanted to learn more about that man. Much more often than not, I found myself picking up my battered and torn copy of the book only minutes after I had rudely (violently) abandoned it in some random corner of the house, to quench my curiosity.Ultimately, Rand kept me coming back for more, so I give \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" four stars out of a possible five. Still, I recommend listening to this book on tape (I know, I know, that's blasphemy to some of you) to avoid some of the frustrations of reading, re-reading and re-re-reading sentences that Rand had mangled.

I thought it made a compelling case for free market economics, but for the life of me I can't understand why Rand confused the book by tossing in epistemology. Especially when some of the assertions she makes about philosopy are demonstrably untrue: For instance, linking the \\"looters\\" to Christian doctrines such as original sin, when most socialist economies have been founded on atheism or agnosticism. Besides, if one were going to debate the doctrine of original sin, at least employ arguments that aren't elementary and aren't routinely refuted in entry-level Theology classes.John Galt as a messiah figure, when \\"objectivism\\" requires that there are no messiahs?

And I'm not gonna defend the book by taking on every negative critical review. My opinion of the book is I feel Ayn Rand is a great author, but I also feel she's not in the literary league of of say Truman Capote or Anne Rice - two masters of the English language.I'd say that her works really act as a vehicle for her philosophy. The book is massive in scope and to say it's profound is an understatement. All I could say was \\"WOW\\" when I finished reading it. Ayn Rand certainly stirs up a lot of people but I think this is mainly due to misunderstanding, laziness, and some of the reasons she expounds on in this book, i.e. people often do want a free ride or they do want their cake and eat it too. Don't read if you just want entertainment because it's meant to be a profound book, not entertainment, and it will open your eyes. You may not agree with her philosophy or you may not like what you read, or maybe you just don't want to accept her message, but I highly recommend it. It's enlightening and will remain one of the most influential books in my life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand considered Atlas Shrugged to be her magnum opus. Atlas Shrugged is about a railroad heiress, Dagny Taggart, as she watches society collapse around her as the government increasingly asserts control over industry. All while society's most productive citizens, led by the mysterious John Galt, continue to disappear. Galt strives to stop the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds that drive social growth and productivity. With their minds on strike Galt's group hopes to demonstrate that the economy will collapse without the profit motive and efforts of the rational and productive.Atlas Shrugged is one of the best books I've read. The book has an amazing story and plot line. I got into the characters as they developed. Ayn Rand's writing and philosophical background culminate into a truly amazing book. Rand's views on individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism shine through as she portrays society collapsing around the growing government control in Atlas Shrugged. I portion of my enjoyment of the book centers around Rand's and my shared views on government and business controls. Overall Atlas Shrugged is great book; Rand's focus is on story development with a heavy undertone of her options on limited government control. Even if you don't care about politics or business you will still enjoy Atlas Shrugged.

Ayn writes extremely well, very artistic, great choices in phrasing, the words she uses are timely and impact the reader more now than probably any other time from its release in 1957. I was so wrapped up in the story at times I forgot I was here and not there. She desired a world in which her characters actually existed, but I'm afraid there aren't many men or women who I have come across that exhibit those character traits today.The story basically shows the detriment that is placed upon a country, namely the USA when the government gets involved with its economic planning. The Producers of wealth don't take well to the government tyranny in this novel, it's not pretty to say the least and of course we (people of the USA) are deeply in the middle of this right now so it is a good time to read it if you haven't. Don't be scared by the 1168 pages it is page turning artistry.When I was finished I felt like my friends had all left me and now I wanted to start it over again to stay in touch through a repetitive journey of creative genius.

The parallels you can draw between the various storylines in the book what's happening in Washington today are staggering! If Barney Frank had read this novel (and paid attention) he might watch what he's saying so as not to sound so much like a dead ringer for government character Wesley Mouch.Atlas Shrugged is a little long at over 1100 pages, and some chapters could certainly be shorter and still get the point across, but despite that minor shortcoming I found this book to be a real page-turner. To think it was written 50 years ago is really something. I suggest you pick up and read the book before some sloppy Hollywood movie based on the book is released and ruins it! Shrugged would also make a great gift for anyone thinking what the US government is doing today, particularly to the business community, is somehow in our common interest."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Brillant is the only word for this book. I read if two years ago for the first time when I was thirteen. Some of Ayn Rand's philosophy was too complicated for me at the time, so I spent the last two years reading everything she has ever written. Now at the age of fifteen, I finished reading Atlas Shrugged for the second time and I walked away breathless.With larger than live characters, Ayn Rand is able to warn her readers what will happen if we give in to socialism and communism. Even if you don't agree with her, it's impossible to deny that her points are valid and close to flawless. Ayn Rand grew up under the power of Soviot Russia; she knows what she is talking about.Atlas Shrugged is the second most influencial book in America. If you are serious about philosophy, you can't go without reading this book. Ayn Rand's knowladge on economics and government is unparallel to anything I have ever seen.WARNING: Atlas Shrugged is the type of book that is so good you don't want to read anything else for a long time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"So much has been said about the implications and philosophy of this book that reading the reviews already posted leads to the type of overexposure that can ruin something before its time. Some people hate it, some people love, but everyone seems to have something to say about it.For me this was just an interesting read with some genreal insights about man. It gave me some things to think about (which is always a plus in a book) but it wasn't life changing in any way likes it appears to be some other reviewers. Saying this should be required reading is agianst my beliefs that anyone should be REQUIRED to read anything. I definitely don't beilieve this book should inserted into the regular high school curriculum and that is pretty much the only forum for \\"required\\" books.The story is fascinating when it moves but some of Rand's rantings can be a bit winded (although the excellent one on money still stands out im my mind). The characters are interesting for the most part but their actions become predictable at times as they clearly tools used to bring Rand's philosphy across.I think readers who liked The Fountainhead should try reading this. Some readers liked this better but I would disagree. It's a lot longer (and Fountainhead was long enough) and it's characters and ideas are a little too similar as well. Readers who don't like The Fountainhead probably won't like this but vice versa might be true due to the length of Atlas Shrugged.Bottom Line: Overall an excellent novel with a lot to say about mankind. It's too long but still worth it if you can get through it. People unfamiliar with Rand might want to start with The Fountainhead first."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is not necessarily scripture for the totally selfish, nor does it condemn the selfless. Ayn Rand's philosophy was not one of self-absorption and callous disregard for others (although aspects of her life might support such claims); it was simply an affirmation of freedom - freedom from restrictions imposed by any entity other than the individual. Of course her novels reflect the extreme examples - yet even within the struggles of her protagonists she indicates the nobility of the struggle, of creating value for the joy of the creation (and this does not preclude the joy of benefitting others).On the other hand, her villians ultimately derive their power and satisfaction, such as it may be, by seeking power - not power as a result of their own creations and abilities, but by denying others the freedom of opportunity.Yes, the characters are mostly two-dimensional. Yes, the book is absorbing and thought-provoking. Although it was written more than half a century ago, one need only reflect on much of what is happening in America and Europe today to recognize that (while it is overly extreme and flawed by the hubris of one of those who are too insecure to consider the possibility of one greater than themselves), a great deal of this book is very nearly prophetic.It should be a part of any thinking person's library, and should be recommended widely for thought and discussion - even as acrimonious as that coming from many reviewers on this site."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was going to submit a longer review, but many others havealready written (sometimes hilariously)about what I thought werethe pluses and minuses of Atlas Shrugged here, so I'll just get intowhat I found most curious.Let's assume John Galt is the voice of Ayn Rand.You can agree with 99.9% of what John Galt proposes, but thereare no non-absolutes in his world. John Galt has humanity allfigured out. All 'good' people WILL behave as if they were castfrom Rearden Metal. Read his climactic \\"three hour\\" (took me three days)radio speech. You absolutely cannot argue for anymiddle ground or compromise. If you attempt to do so, if youremotely deviate from \\"A is A\\", you are the Enemy. This is acritical point that Rand stresses with venom. There are no allowancesfor 'gray areas'. Case closed.John Galt is perfectly logical. He out-Spocks Spock.John Galt certainly will not tolerate irrational human behavior.John Galt SMOKES? Whoa!Now, before we post any arguments, we must adhere to \\"John Galt\\"rules. Do not argue \\"Well...\\" or \\"But...\\". If you say mine is atrivial point in a book of grander points, I'd say no dice. Re-readthe book - \\"A is A\\". 'Um, the folks from \\"Atlantis\\" deviseda healthy cigarette?' Don't cop out. Galt and crew are always truthful.To claim that the era Rand penned the novel was stillone of 'smoking naivete' is a moot point. Don't wimp out and sayRand didn't know better. My guess is she probably chain smoked.My point? Simply that Ayn Rand, being human, couldn't help butbuild some very human behavior into lock-stepped protagonists(\\"Atlantis\\" was a smoker's paradise) that after time proves to beamong the ultimate of irrational behaviors. Yet even 'good' peoplestill do it. Isn't any excuse a 'gray area'?Aside from John Galt coming off as pretty creepy himself, themost unintentionally funny thing in the book? Here we have a groupof the most uber-rational 'men of minds' on the planet making, of allthings, cigarettes with gold $ symbols stamped on them.Rand entreaties us to think. I heartily agree. Think about that!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED is a bewilderingly dull, painfully long book that is full of poor philosophy and even worse writing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless of course I wanted to drive him to suicide. The problem is not only Rand's philosophy, which is bad enough, but the sheer stupidity and astonishing childishness of the book itself.To begin with, the characters are laughably two-dimensional. From the flawless industrialist-heroes who possess the \\"virtues\\" of greed and egocentrism, to the straw men villains who lurk about the marble halls of Washington, to the simple every-day people who defer to their superiors, every character is so cartoonish that the book quickly becomes unbearable. Rand subjects her readers to page after page (after page) of mind-numbing redundancy and monotony. I found myself wondering who edited it, because anyone with a high school diploma could see that it repeated itself far too much. The characters are stiff, the dialogue artificial, and the plot devices as sophisticated as those used in the Hardy Boys series. Moreover, Rand has such a heavy-handed style, such a lack of artistic sensitivity and subtlety, that I felt brow-beaten and numb after the first couple hours reading. Reading the book to its conclusion is a heroic act of self-sacrifice, and I can only wonder about the sanity of those masochistic souls who have read it more than once. As a novel, it is probably the worst thing I've ever read. A thoroughly unpleasant experience.As for Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, it too is surprisingly childish and overly simplistic. It is a preposterous hodge-podge of Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Adam Smith, with a little American pragmatism to boot. Rand rips a few lines of these philosphers out of context in order to fashion a philosophy that permits one to be utterly self-serving, for no other reason than it feels right. Objectivism is also elitist, and Rand insinuates throughout the book that the masses of humankind, hats in their dirty hands, should bow to her \\"uberpeople.\\" She disregards the concept of the human soul altogether, apparently preferring instead the inherent dignity of washing macines. Indeed, Rand seems to suggest that people are only good insofar as they can produce, admirable only in proportion to the size of their bank accounts. Come on, lady. There is more to life than money, and while I'm no liberal, I'm neither so cold-hearted as to suggest that greed is a great virtue.It might have made for a tolerable 150-or-so page novella, but as it stands--arrogant, juvenile, and oppressively long-winded--it is absolutely awful. I will admit that Rand does have a point: relativism is causing problems in our society. But the solution is not contained in a one thousand page book that claims that our salvation lies \\"in the sign of the dollar.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You will hear a lot about this book from those on both sides who have never read it.

I made it through four CDs and gave up on it getting any better. At least in those CDs, Mr. Brick's \\"breathy\\" reading sounded as though he was reading it while he was having \\"intimate relations,\\" if you know what I mean.I've read the book, and I also own the other audio version. I liked the other audio version the first time I listened to it, but I didn't feel it did justice to the book. I bought this one because I love this book and wanted a choice of which to listen to, because I listen to it frequently.I will never get through this one, because I won't try again. It really is THAT bad.If you want an audio version, check out this one http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-two-parts-Rand/dp/0786161787/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1237854934&sr;=1-7 even though it's more expensive. It is well worth the difference in cost, and the minor annoyances I had with that version have completely left my mind now that I've tried to listen to Mr. Brick's version.Of course, actually reading the book rather than listening to it is preferable. It allows you to go at your own pace and form your own opinions more easily than the audio version. However, I understand the problems with reading it. Even if you love to read, and the size of the book doesn't intimidate you, the font is so small in the paperback editions that it's hard to get through more than a couple of chapters without getting eye strain.I first read the book in advanced placement, i.e., accelerated college, courses in high school. I didn't dislike it, but we read a lot of books I enjoyed more. I was simply too young to really understand it. It all seemed very far-fetched, not enough to be sci-fi, but too much to be reality at any point.A few months ago, I started having this feeling of deja vu. I kept hearing things on the news and thinking, \\"Where have I heard this before?\\"I'm a news junkie, so I started searching back through news, my \\"reality,\\" for parallels, and I couldn't find the things that were bothering me. I remembered it only because of a post on the Internet that I incidentally ran across, someone saying, \\"If you haven't read 'Atlas Shrugged,' you should.\\"It was a simple post, no detail, but it was the light bulb. \\"That's it! That's where I've heard it before! It wasn't even in the news; it was in that book!\\"I had the book, but couldn't read it. I tried, and then tried skipping around. The print was simply too small, so I ordered the audio version I linked you to. I've listened to it several times since then (43.5 hours), and it's still not sci-fi, but it's also not far from my \\"reality.\\" It's almost prophecy that's coming true.I very strongly encourage everyone to either read or listen to this book. If you take the time for it, it will make at least a small change in your life.

A few weeks ago my partner and I rode the Amtrak from NYC to Chicago (24 hrs we were delayed) it was an eerie decadent and beautiful ride, we saw lot's of steel mill factories that once thrived in there little towns but are now shut down it looked like there was life around these towns in upstate NY but we barely saw pople outside from our train seat. I was thinking about my Atlas Shurugged Book it was to heavy to bring (my friend purchased me the large paperback edition from Amazon) and thought about Dagny the Vice President of Taggart Transcontinental (Amtrak of the future) she's so smart, strong, brainy and fragile at the same time, Dagny really inspired me. The reason I started getting into Ayn Rand was because I read her Biography by Barbara Braden and after reading that Awesome book I was hooked on Ayn. I always wanted to read The Fountainhead I loved it, I had to read more of Ayn's Book. I found Francisco D'Anconia money speech online and that's when I decided I had to read Atlas Shrugged. \\"Frisco\\" along with \\"Slug\\" (Dagny) are my favorite characters in the Book. A. S. had so much to say and I only read it once so I'm sure I missed important meanings plus the book is so deep, the sex scenes are nice and being from NYC you know I had cocktails while I read the Book so it made it even more fun! My oh my will I miss not having to read this book any longer, I'll even miss those villians Taggart, Mouch, Ferris & Lillian Reardon they were awful. John Galt was great of course but the 50 page speech was endless, (like this review) but very meaningful I thought he was a little boring, but he does get the prize of being with Dagny and they lived happily ever after at Mulligan's Gulch.

Like anything else you take what is good from it. I was never an Objectionist, I just love the individulaistic ideals presented in the story and I loved the heroic characters who did what they felt was right in spite of the world being against them. To me that has always been the theme of the book. But what is amazing is how over the years I have seen the very frightening government policies which were parodies in the book come to life. In a way it has been quite prophetic. Ayn Rand herself was a very flawed character so I would never want to emulate her life. But the idea of individuals standing against a world which wants to destroy the sanctity of freedom of thought and ideas is very attractive in an age of political correctness and government intrusion into private property, businesses and lives."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am both very happy to have this book in my library and fortunate to have made it through.Ayn Rand's second major opus, \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" is not as impressive as the first, \\"The Fountainhead.\\" Don't get me wrong, the philosophy of the book is as striking and powerful as the first, with a very different focus than the first book; which is, of course, essential if it wants to hold your attention. Whereas the Fountainhead deals primarily with the integrity of man, Atlas Shrugged deals with capitalism vs communism. Both books have a common thread in that both talk about the importance and function of the reasoning mind, and of rationality as the core of an objective interpretation of the world around us. But the Fountainhead is written far more crisply ... it is a page turner, and you cannot put it down. Atlas Shrugged is NOT. I just finished reading it today after a LONG time. I started reading it a year ago, and gave up on page 170, unable to go on. I picked it up again, two weeks ago, and finished today. Even then, I skipped a big portion (about 50 pages) of a giant speech that takes 75 pages of the book ... it was too much (I do plan to read it later, gritting my teeth :-)). Part of the problem is that Rand repeats herself a lot in this book. One of the advantages of the Fountainhead is that she expresses her philosophy through her dialogues and lets you read between the lines. Here, she hammers you over the head again and again with her philosophy, often in a very unsubtle manner, so that it gets painful after a while...I mean, we DO have the power to reason, so let us! The book could have used some editing and probably been shortened by at least about 200 pages.Having said all that, though, the book is an essential read, because of the ideas in it. Rand's philosophy is severe and ruthless, and is very hard to argue with. The central idea is that of an objective measure of reality: Rand argues that laissez-faire capitalism is the only system that is fair to all parties involved. Every action among rational people is a trade, made for mutual benefit ... there is no altruism or sacrifice involved. This is the only healthy, just, and life-affirming way for rational people to deal with each other. As in the Fountainhead, once you adopt a principle, you cannot make any exceptions...this is why I said that the philosophy is severe; but you will see when you examine it that there is no choice in the matter.All said, you may like Rand, or you might hate her, but you can DEFINITELY NOT IGNORE HER. If you are new to Ayn Rand, though, I would strongly suggest reading the Fountainhead first ... it is a better book. But don't skip this one, if you have the patience to read a long book (1168 pages)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"On September 11, I needed heroes. As I watched the horrifying collapse of the Twin Towers, it became sickeningly clear to me that the barbarians were at our gates. This day, I thought, may well portend the collapse of civilization itself. What I needed was a vision of heroes standing tall and proud--as these skyscrapers once did--beckoning me into a sunlit future.I found these heroes in the first novel I read after 9/11--Ayn Rand's brilliant masterpiece, Atlas Shrugged. A perennial bestseller with over 5 million copies sold, it is the story of the mysterious disappearance of the \\"men of the mind\\"--the nation's top businessmen, scientists, innovators and philosophers--and of the economic collapse that follows. In words that shine with luminous clarity, confidence and passion, this page-turner describes the fall of Western civilization--and its rebirth in the Colorado Rockies. John Galt, Rand's hero of epic stature, is the leader of this \\"Second Renaissance.\\"The novel's theme is that man's reasoning mind is responsible for his survival and greatness. And without the GREATEST minds--the Atlases who carry the world on their shoulders--the civilized world will crumble and fall, just as the Twin Towers did on 9/11.A self-made woman who fled her Communist homeland, Rand encapsulates her philosophy as \\"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\"If you hunger for heroes like John Galt--and Ayn Rand herself--then you owe it to yourself to read Atlas Shrugged.Now when I recall the events of 9/11, it is Galt's words that come to mind: \\"Do not let the hero in your soul perish,\\" he says. \\"The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It would have been much shorter and less ponderous, could have presented the same arguments just as effectively, and would have done a better job targeting the intended audience. Instead I had to suffer through over a thousand pages of having the same ideas rammed into my head over and over and over...The characters are either capitalist superheroes who are mentally and physically perfect, or the physically and morally bankrupt liberals/marxists. Once Rand had begun to describe a character as anything less than godlike, you knew they were doomed. It was hard to buy in to the story when the characters were as polarized as they were. It also made their actions so predictable, that I was easily forseeing the plot twists by page 200 or so.The only good thing I can say about this book is that teenagers and anyone else who hasn't been exposed to the real world seem to enjoy it. I don't know if it's the simplistic characters and story, or the &quot;I'm right, and everyone else is wrong&quot; point of view.For the record, I'm not a mealy-mouthed liberal, I just think that Rand could have made a stronger (and more entertaining) case for her philosophy with some better character development and some judicious editing.Personally, I would have have Dagny and some other characters start out as liberals who slowly come to see the light (&quot;I could be making HOW MUCH working 14-hour days!?&quot;) and join the Happy Capitalists. I think it would be much more convincing for the middle-of-the-road types, who, in spite of what Rand seems to think, do exist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I will start by making a single concession: the suspense is engaging. Now, on to my diatribe. First, propagandizing may be conducted much more effectively without the redundancy that is inevitable in a thousand-page volume. Secondly, the philosophy of objectivism is simply a justification of the American tendency to throw away that UNICEF envelope. The weakness of the philosophy is glaringly obvious in her failings as a writer. Only two characters exist, the egoist and the fool. The sign of a truly great author is the ability to present compelling antagonists. Any characters exhibiting the semblance of social conscience are portrayed as weak, aimless, idle conspirators toward the demise of civilization. They are stock, unimaginative and unconvincing. Ayn Rand does not seem to appreciate that there is existence beyond the extremes of utterly selfish industrial capitalism and anarchy or a socialism in which the individual must submit to the oppressive and chaotic whim of a slave-driving totalitarian state. Thank you Ayn Rand for inadvertently revealing the diseased state of American ethics. I feel enlightened and disgusted as I bear witness to the horrible consequences (to which objectivists remain ignorant) of radical material individualism. Reactionary is a euphemism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I&#65533;d like to respond to those who suggest that a first-year course in philosophy should be sufficient to rebut the theses in Ayn Rand&#65533;s books. To the contrary, it is the philosophy contained within first-year collegiate courses that insures her continuing and future popularity. I&#65533;ve taken first-year philosophy courses, and second year and third-year. I&#65533;ve hob-nobbed with our black-clad caf&eacute; philosophers, and I await a single intelligent reason to abandon the straightforward yet romantic world-view of Ms. Rand. The alternative to Rand seems to be the postulation of the existence of a reality unprovable by our senses followed by thousands of years of debate as to what the nature of that postulated reality might be.Plato postulates that an alternative world of Forms exists, that reality might be akin to shadows in a cave, with the &#65533;real&#65533; world existing in the unseen sunlight without. I see. St. Augustine would have us subordinate ourselves to a moral code that most people couldn&#65533;t fully describe without justifying their efforts by reference to the historical significance of this man. Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas take philosophy to new, abysmally boring depths, from which few have ever emerged. William Blake wonders how we can know that a world is not contained within a grain of sand, without explaining how he can know that one does or how we should address our inability to prove the truth either way. Kierkegaard uses reason to prove that we must eventually abandon reason. Sartre insists that we feel anxiety about our choices after having firmly established that no wrong choices are possible. Hegel has yet to be read by more than a handful of exceptionally dull and uninspiring people. Marx, one of the few known exceptions to the prior sentence, has fallen flat on his face.A few long days with Richard Rorty, Jean Lyotard and their ilk and one can confidently engage in friendships and relationships without any interference from meta-narratives. Eventually, those of us who must sooner or later put down our books and go to work realize that philosophy has nothing to offer other than a challenging way to spend an afternoon. If a man has ever read &#65533;A Critique of Pure Reason&#65533; and changed his life for the better, I have not met him. Nonetheless, the academy ridicules a writer like Rand who refuses to waste either her time or ours on speculations that she can&#65533;t prove, however interesting they may be. To the contrary, she concerns herself only with life on this earth, a self-imposed limitation that would have served many in the Western Canon well. As an example, we have the following passage from &#65533;Atlas Shrugged&#65533; in which Dagny reacts to John Galt&#65533;s refusal to let her out of her employment contract to live with Francisco, another friend of theirs, despite his pleas. This is Rand&#65533;s description of the altruistic code and its effects:&#65533;Part of the sincerity of her relief &#65533; she thought, as she walked silently by his side &#65533; was the shock of a contrast: she had seen, with the sudden, immediate vividness of sensory perception, an exact picture of what the code of self-sacrifice would have meant, if enacted by the three of them. Galt, giving up the woman he wanted, for the sake of his friend, faking his greatest feeling out of existence and himself out of her life, no matter what the cost to him and to her, then dragging the rest of his years through the waste of the unreached and the unfulfilled &#65533; she, turning for consolation to a second choice, faking a love she did not feel, being willing to fake, since her will to self-deceit was the essential required for Galt&#65533;s self-sacrifice, then living out her years in hopeless longing, accepting, as relief for an unhealing wound, some moments of weary affection, plus the tenet that love is futile and happiness is not to be found on earth &#65533; Francisco, struggling in the elusive fog of a counterfeit reality, his life a fraud staged by the two who were dearest to him and most trusted, struggling to grasp what was missing from his happiness, struggling down the brittle scaffold of a lie over the abyss of the discovery that he was not the man she loved, but only a resented substitute, half charity-patient, half-crutch, his perceptiveness becoming his danger and only his surrender to lethargic stupidity protecting the shoddy structure of his joy, struggling and giving up and settling into the dreary routine of the conviction that fulfillment is impossible to man &#65533; the three of them, who had all the gifts of existence spread out before them, ending up as embittered hulks, who cry in despair that life is frustration &#65533; the frustration of not being able to make unreality real.&#65533;Whatever pejorative terms our scholarly brethren may wish to attach to such observations, it actually addresses something that the reader might be better for knowing. I&#65533;m quite glad that Ms. Rand rescued me from the generally held conclusion that the more one mocks the rational, the more profound one is. Ayn Rand will always be my Gwenda the Good Witch, showing up later than preferred to remind me that I always had the capacity to escape the murky, useless blathering of those who would debate the details of life on a particular star before they even knew whether life existed there at all. If there is a reality out there unknowable by our senses, can we at least establish its existence in some form before we subject our students to long treatises containing the author&#65533;s best guesses as to what that reality might be?As the philosophy sections in our bookstores shrink and shrink and the philosophy majors in our colleges become fewer and fewer, we can at least hope that the stultifying crap that has passed for profound thought for too long is on its way out. Consciously or not, most people seem to realize that, as far as the academic alternative to Rand is concerned, the emperor has been nude for quite some time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The only thing I regret is that I read this book when I was 16.Every other work of literature and philosophy I have read has been a disappointment by comparison.

This...after having read Kant, Sartre, and all the rest...they all pale by comparison...such a waste of time.I know...those with a Socialist (people must be forced to be good) mentality will disagree, but who cares? Ayn Rand did more to advance the cause of human liberty than any other writer of the 20th century; this will be her legacy.Some of you are students and probably wonder why your college professors ignore Ayn Rand (or even attack her). But do not let that deter you from reading her works.Most of the intellectuals of the 20th century are simply embarrassed by Ayn Rand. While Ayn Rand was making the case for liberty and individualism, many of them were supporting societies that committed some of the worst atrocities in recorded history. One has only to look at the crimes of Stalin and Hitler (NAZI stands for National Socialism) to see the obscenity of the causes they have indirectly supported by their endorsement of a collectivist mentality (with themselves as the overseers).But I digress.

Forget the philosophy and politics for a moment, and ask yourself whether the people you think have gotten really screwed by life resemble Warren Buffet.Considering this as a novel, it's blessed awful. Droning prose (that goes on for FAR too long in MANY passages), and a plot that reads like a self-indulgent persecution fantasy. Not only do Rand's protagonists get to whine about how unfair they've been treated, they get to take over the world, form their own private club that owns everything, and crow - among other absurdities - about how much better they are in the sack than the idiots who disagree with them. Please.From a political standpoiunt, if you want a novel that tears a new one for communism, read Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. It's much better written, and is much more in tune with the real world, even though it features talking animals... which says a lot about how out there Rand is."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you have nothing better to do, then by all means, read this book.

I remember her saying though, something along these lines - \\"Ayn Rand tries to make not thinking about anything a virtue.\\" I think I have an idea of what Dr. Lawhon now meant.First, I thought this book was fun and beautifully written. But about halfway in, I found myself getting progessively more and more bored. The long monologues seemed to blend together and her protagonists all seem to be little more than cardboard cut-outs of one another. For such free-thinking individuals possessed of such grand intellectual and artistic gifts, they were shockingly plastic, like Barbie dolls three months after they have been opened from beneath the tree and then cast aside when the \\"new\\" has worn off. And I found Rand's seeming equation of pleasant physical appearance to her version of \\"virtuous selfishness\\" shallow, hopelessly cliched, and off-putting. In a way, I felt like I was reading \\"Brave New World\\" again (although the books are quite demonstrably different). Further, Rand's philosophy seems to be to be ultimately self-negating. If all of these liberated folks are so horribly similar, how on earth can they ever truly be unfettered in their thinking? This is not self-actualization or liberation, but cant. It DID remind me of a discussion scene from Huxley's book about whether or not a group composed of only \\"Alphas\\" could ever form a coherent and independent society. The answer was no. And I did catch myself thinking - \\"If these people manage to achieve their objectives, they are going to be terribly bored without anything to whine and complain about.\\" I don't think that Rand was setting up a paradox, but in a sense, that's exactly what she ended up doing.So, in short, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is worth a read just to pass the time. It is nicely paced, nicely written, and well-plotted, hampered by dreadful character development. But I really think the book belongs in the same catalogue as \\"dystopian\\" fiction, not philosophy and certainly not as anything to take all that seriously. And the level of implicit narcissism is, frankly, a little juvenile. I think I understand why this book is so popular with some teens and college students. You can indulge selfish fantasies and dream about everything from power to wealth to \\"the world does not deserve such as enlightened creature as I\\" within your own imagined sphere of \\"specialness.\\" And there is nothing wrong with a little \\"enlightened self interest\\" from time to time, but all the time? Dull to the point of being bloodless and all too predictable. And indeed, I think that one word sums up my view of \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Predictable.So, I would recommend it with severe reservations. I am not an Objectivist and not familiar with the Rand canon or the attitudes of her devotees, so please be aware that my comments are those of first impression. Great writing in an unimpressive shell."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's rare to find a book that has such a gripping plot, such interesting multi-faceted characters and at the same time such deep and contemporary relevance.

The government tried to take him down, and people cheer for his failure...I'm just saying...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm reviewing this book as a novel, as something to read, not as a collection of ideas.And as a read, it's awful. The &quot;characters&quot; don't achieve even two dimensions, and their dialogue is - literally - unbelievable. That is, time after time I'd come to the end of a speech, words that the writer put into the mouth of one of her cyphers, and ask myself, &quot;Is there any way to speak those words and sound natural? Could you for a second imagine an actual live person saying something like that?&quot;And I couldn't. This is a science fiction novel in more senses than the author intends. That is, it isn't about people but about robots, hence their lack of internal life, and robots constructed by aliens, hence their lack of convincing resemblance to human beings. But does Rand intend something as subtle as that? Is the constant, jarring incongruity of her characters' words and actions some kind of intentional distancing effect? I think not, because the writing is just as bad in the non-dialogue sections. Sentence after sentence reads as if Rand dictated them while she had her mind on something else, an effect I also get when reading Geoffrey Archer. In fact of all writers, Archer's thumpingly limp prose comes closest to Rand's.So why is this incompetently-written pot-boiler still in print, and why have 600-odd people ardently raved about its unapparent genius?To get the answer let's compare Rand not with Archer but Asimov, the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. There too, the writing is thin stuff, with characters that don't acquire the depth and texture of cardboard, and dialogue that clunks like a mouthful of rocks. (Though Asimov's trilogy is significantly better written - though still bad - than &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.) But what has carried the book is not really the &quot;characters&quot;, still less the author's style, but the &quot;ideas&quot;.But Asimov's idea, &quot;psychohistory&quot;, never gets beyond a shadow of an idea. In Asimov's defence, &quot;psychohistory&quot; is more of a McGuffin, a plot device, than a seriously intended science. Rand, on the other hand, takes her ideas seriously, and expects you to do the same, even though &quot;Objectivism&quot; is essentially a mix of Max Stirner's right-wing anarchism (no Kropotkinian collectivism for our Max) with Nietzschean stuff about how the herd hold back the really free human beings like the author and also the truly superior being who has been good enough to buy the author's book.But it is this aspect of the book that keeps it in print. Neither Rand's nor Nietzsche's readers consider themselves part of the &quot;herd&quot; - you and me, I'm afraid - that each writer treats with such contempt. It's the ultimate authorial suck-up; where a lot of writers leave their readers feeling challenged, perhaps even a little appalled by their own relative lack of powers (Shakespeare, for example, or even an Amis), Rand assures her readers that they're special, they're a breed apart, and that it's everyone else -- the herd, democracy, collectivism, morality, etc -- who is stopping them from doing the brilliant, great things that they dream of.Hence the book's great appeal to adolescents (see the nearly 600 reviews, below), also to people with, um, issues.Criticism of Rand is often said by the more passionate Rand cultists to be simply a matter of leftists attacking a right-wing writer, but that seems to be based on a misunderstanding, or more likely a bowlderisation, of Rand's ideas. Rand was an atheist and in principle though not in practice a libertarian, just like them secular humanist liberals that so many Rand cultists hate. In many respects she is closer to the non-Marxist left than to the god-fearing, pro-censorship, abortion-banning American Right that has adopted her. My problem with Rand's ideas is not Whose Side They're On, but that her ideas were second-hand and second-rate, top-of-the-head stuff that was neither researched nor well written.Anyway it's ideological fervour, rather than any merit of plotting, characterisation of writing, that has kept this bnook in print. So if you're approaching it at a level of, &quot;Is _Atlas Shrugged_ a good read, for a plane trip or winter evening?&quot; I'd say no. Try Geoffrey Archer if you're in the mood for brainless crap (and that's a reasonable mood to be in); Archer certainly didn't have Rand's overweening pretention. And if you want Big Ideas that turn out not to be very taxing at all, try Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Asimov isn't much of a writer either, but as you read him you can't help liking him for being a big engaging peach of a man, where Rand is a prune.Cheers!Laon"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged has very distinct views and beliefs. Beliefs that stem around the idea that in order to be happy you must be completely selfish. It tells an unrealistic, almost fantastical story of one man and his efforts to stop the motor of the world. Though many of the beliefs in Atlas Shrugged do not match my own, the beliefs were not presented abrasively and I found it enjoyable to read anyway.Though I did find many parts to be too long and unnecessary, as well did I find the book itself to be too long, over 1000 pages. I also found some of the content to be cluttered with big words that made it hard to follow what was happening. There was also a lot of political aspects to the novel which were often complicated and uninteresting. Would I recommend this book to others? Well this book is not for everyone. It is not for the slow, the close-minded or the humanitarian. It is for those who are open to other perspectives on life and who have an active imagination. Bottome line: If you believe brains should and do always win over braun then you will enjoy this book. If you have no particular view on the matter you will enjoy this book. If you are a man of the hands you will not like the way you are portrayed and therefore will most likely not enjoy this book. It is very long, very detailed, and often lost me in its words, but I enjoyed being opened up to a whole new perspective that I had never thought of. Though I do not completely agree with ever aspect of the perspective I did find some very practical.

Rand portrays a world gone to wrack and ruin as a result of socialism-- although the word is never used. The plot involves a handful of incredibly handsome, intelligent, passionate, blond and thin industrialists holding out against a bunch of incredibly corrupt, unattractive, not very smart government types with odd names who have somehow taken over the U.S. Having said that, the plot grabs the reader at the outset and doesn't let up for 1100 pages, although I found the ending a bit over the top--picture Jack Welch of GE personally storming a military base. The author was prescient in forseeing 50 years ago the cult of victimhood which seems so prevalent today. At the same time, I find it hard to take her philosophy seriously--Rand is a big fan of cold-blooded capitalism, but in her perfect world there aren't any children, elderly, or ill people. Her view of how industrial society would evolve--her focus on trains, mines, steel mills--seems quaint--especially as the book was written at the beginning of the atomic age. The personal relationships between the sexes are positively Victorian. Most weird to me was the veneration shown to the guy who is the embodiment of Rand's philosophy--almost religious in tone. Modern Library did a survey of readers on the best 100 fiction books of the 20th century and this was #1--it was a good read but I must respectfully disagree with the voters."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Once you start reading Atlas Shrugged, you won't be able to put it down; it will become an addiction because the plot is very intriguing and it stimulates your mind. The characters are well developed, similar to her other ficitonal works, the heroes and heroines are strong, anti-social, and intelligent. Also, the theme is reason versus ignorance or good versus evil. Even though the themes and the characters are similar, Rand has a talent of generating new and engrossing plots in her books. I recommend that you read her other fictional novels such as Anthem, We the Living, and The Fountainhead, in that sequence, before reading Atlas Shrugged; then read The Early Ayn Rand last. After reading Atlas Shrugged, I now have a better understanding of the world.Rand is an artist; the proof is in her writings. I have realized that people either HATE her or they LOVE her. I am one of the ones that love her philosophy and her writings."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book read my mind.I can't believe that such an incredible book has been written. I've read that this book has been compared to the Bible in its influence on the world. I've even read some people refer to this book off-hand as their Bible. I can see why. Never have I read such a lucent social and political critique mixed with a good ol' fashioned common sense philosophy.The darts that it throws at the Left, and liberalism in particular, as stunning. James Taggart is a character especially to watch, as he is the running subject of an attack on limosine liberalism I haven't seen since the likes of Native Son. (I find that kind of ironic because Native Son critiques limosine liberalism in the defense of communism, a philosophy that Ayn Rand despised.) She also attacks social conversatism as well, though for whatever her reasons, she doesn't seem to have the same edge on it.The book is also hugely critical of Keynesian economics. The book's bad guys are mostly government bureaucrats heavily influenced by Keynes. In one part of the book, it goes as far as to put Keynes' famous quote &quot;in the long run, we're all dead&quot; in one of the character's mouth.Its treatment of relationships is also stunning. While I don't particularly like the fact that the sex scenes border on ..., it gives very lucent dating advice.Lastly, I wish to make a comment about the unreality and flatness of the book. Apparently, people seem to miss the point that the main reason this book was written was to promote and explicate a philosophy, not tell a story (though it does a good job of that too). If this concept is hard for you to grasp, read 1984, which does much the same thing, only more explicitly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm one of those who, with the best of intentions, sets out to read a great book like Atlas Shrugged and stops about 200 pages into it and moves on. A bad habit to be sure. This tape set was great for someone like me - with a 30 minute commute to work each day, I was able to finish a tape a day.The overall impression I got from the work, as I heard it, was that, while Objectivism, the philosophy of Dagny Taggart, Francisco D'anconia, and others (including Ayn Rand) is so focused on self that it can be a dead-end and spiritually empty, perhaps a little more of it is needed in today's world. As examined in the book, the Best should rise as far as their talents and abilities can take them.Edward Herrmann's authoritative, crisp reading style was perfect for the work.

Actually, you already know them by other names, but Atlas Shrugged will bring into sharp focus who they are and the devastating damage they can do, and are doing today to our real world. Sadly, we do not have our own John Galt. The men who make our world go lack the \\"stones\\" to pull off a Galtian strike. Too bad. It would certainly be a novel cure for the malaise that Rand predicted."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every few years I pull out Atlas Shrugged and read it again. Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is an ambitious book and Ayn Rand was a thoughtful, articulate author. Though illuminated through fictional characters, readers cannot help but understand Ms. Rand's positions about capitalism, socialism, the essential value of the people who contribute to our world and the drag on society created by those who contribute little while demanding much. The book (published in 1957) offers thought-provoking insight into what might happen to our culture and in our society if the most capable people among us were to strike and withhold their skills and contributions. The message must have been powerful in 1957 and it certainly has application today. Atlas Shrugged is a timeless work about human nature which has, and probably always will, stand the test of time.My criticism is simple: The messages and character development could have been richly delivered in a book half this size. Laboriously LENGTHY monologues are sprinkled liberally throughout the book. Almost invariably, these chapter-length, one-sided pontifications repeat the same themes over and over again. I came away feeling that Ms. Rand was persuasive and eloquent, but very redundant in her delivery. The final radio-delivered speech occupies about four percent (that's how it is measured by a Kindle) of this 1000 page book. I believe the message could have been comfortably condensed to a quarter of that space. I found myself wondering just how many ways a person can say the same thing. I lost count, but the answer is: Quite a few. More insightful readers will probably disagree and find this review offensive, but I found a number of the monologues to be a little tedious.If you are patient, you'll probably enjoy and learn from this book. The message is important."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas ShruggedWith the number of reviews already written it seems an exercise in futility to write another one but I will forge ahead nonetheless.

Granted, Dagny's somewhat unsavory relational exploits were not my normal reading fare, but that did not sour me on the book.Rand's character development was excellent. By the time you finish this book you feel as if you know these people. It probably goes without saying that I would not be in agreement with every element of Rand's philosophy, however, there is much to be admired in it. While I would concur with her in the importance of Capitalism and rationality, she takes it to the logical extreme. I did feel that the \\"sermon\\" that Rand preaches through the mouth of John Galt is far longer than it needs to be.

I used to believe that money was the root of all evil and other such nonsense.Atlas Shrugged is an excellent book for those who like me, were willing to be corrected and realize that money is not the root of all evil.

It is a subtle introduction of a decidedly humanistic, secular philosophy to a puritanical, non-secular society . As many have said before, you will love it or hate it. If you subscribe to strict religious dogma and dismiss your mind as impotent and unable to &quot;know&quot; anything, then you will hate it.

Despite being written in 1957, Rand is masterful in not dating her work. I strongly recommend this to all Americans, as it clearly defines the road that awaits us if we allow socialist policies (championed by modern liberals) to hold sway. The book accelerates the process, and shows the absurdity of the logical extension of liberalism. I think anyone who considers themselves a liberal (or is a registered Democrat) should read this book to truly understand the deeper roots of their beliefs. I would strongly suggest this should be required reading for all students before graduating high school, however its length makes that untenable. This book was recommended to me by an extremely liberal professor (also a lawyer) who claimed she could not reconcile her beliefs with the persuasive arguments put forth by Rand. It truly shows that capitalism and the profit motive have been and continue to be the greatest forces for positive social change in the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of those books that I know I should read but it's sheer size is intimidating, especially when I've got two young children and a full time job.So, what a pleasant surprise to find this monumental novel unabridged on CD! It comes in two boxes and takes about 40 disks to contain this masterpiece, but the narration is well done and I am slowly working my way through this book using the CD player in my computer at work.So, now you can finally get through Atlas Shrugged (and impress your friends when you tell them you've \\"read\\" it) while you're sitting in traffic, doing your day job if you've use a computer, or anywhere you've got downtime with a CD player handy. I shrugged too when I saw how much I got for my money!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged presents characters that, in our current world of welfare and social security, seem contrary to our understandings of protagonists and antagonists. So, even if you think that greed is evil, and therefore that this book is completely messed up, you still have something to gain from reading it. It will help you understand why intellectual property rights are so important to innovation and progress. Or, it will make you hate the greed of some people, and thus you will embrace the social awareness that makes this country great. Either way, it will change the way you think about the world.The book is the proper extention of liberalism, as another reviewer states. However, democrats need not worry, because the traditional idea of liberalism is quite different from what the USA terms &quot;liberal.&quot; Liberalism is the idea that free trade, without governmental interference and without lobbies, creates and sustains progress. Basically, without free trade, the world as we know it wouldn't exist. While I myself am a Democrat who disagrees with this idea in certain instances, I still recognize that there is some relevence to this idea, which comes forth in Atlas Shrugged. Rand tells the reader (many times) that free trade, without prohibitions, allows for the greatest result. But even more important, she calls for the protection of intellectual property rights, and says that when workers strike, new workers can be hired, but when innovators strike, the entire world is in trouble.So, why read Atlas Shrugged? Sure, the characters might be a little stiff, and the entire story is definitely biased toward one way of thinking...But the book will definitely make you reconsider your perspective on business and on the functioning of this country, all through a story that is actually quite interesting. And while you read and learn, you will finally grasp Ayn Rand's enormous question, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading both The Fountainhead and Anthem, Atlas Shrugged was by far the best book Rand has written and by far one of the best novels I have ever read. Her philosophy of what man should be, and should aspire to achieve in his (or her) life as portrayed through the character John Galt is absolutely profound. An exciting story, told with splendid detail beautiful prose, this book is an absolute must read for people of all ages.

I'm probably one of the imbeciles Ms Rand writes about."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't have anything to add that hasn't been said dozens of times, but this book changed everything for me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Sorry folks. I see a lot of interpretations and rants. Everybody wants to fit Atlas into their way of seeing/doing things. Yelling at the government when/if it suits them; blaming the government for taking over large companies - which they instead saved from going under...and on and on making Atlas almost a new form of their religion.Try this instead:She was describing Communism and how it works.That simple!The book was written in '57 still in the Communism Hot period. McCarthyism - employee loyalty pledges - blacklisting - seeing Communists under every rock - all that was going on during the early-mid 50's. So the book was topical - and a great success. She just placed it in the US as a warning at a level most would understand. So not necessarily a big biz booster, but an anti state takeover warning. Dig further and you'll see Rand was from Russia, knew Communism, and her own fathers business was confiscated. How clever to tie the examples of what would happen (actually happened under Communism) to all the industries and show how they're affected by means of a declining nationalized railroad system - being brought under government/Communist control. Think Putin's reversal of capitalism in Russia. He/successor are nationalizing big business again - too much power against the State. They're persecuting/prosecuting the too powerful and rich. I think it was the comedian Yakov Smirnoff that said \\"in America you watch television, in Russia television watches you.\\" It's happening in front of your very eyes.And it's now history 2011 that a trusted government appointed economist - major expert - subscribed to the Ayn Rand philosophy and used it in his advice to the US Congress. This ultimately led to the worst recession in US history - and affected world-wide finances.He admitted this in front of Congress\\"I was wrong.\\"Conclusion: He and Atlas dropped the ball.As far as the book: Good example of Communism. Words put together in so many unused and unique ways that still stand. Feelings upon feelings, upon feelings described. May want to learn to read every other word in places. Still, a great book though disturbingly outdated in these times in the US."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not a not a review of objectivism, philosophy, or economics. Just my opinion of Ms. Rand's book.I bought this book last year, amid all the hype, because I had somehow missed it during my lifetime. How I wish those guys at the CERN supercollider would invent the time travel machine so I could go back to my blissful, ignorant state, not to mention get an entire week of my life back!The book could easily have been contained in fewer than half the pages. The details of railroads and steel production, out of date now, are unutterably dull. I find I not only loathe the \\"bad guys\\", but cannot admire the \\"good guys\\", who seem good only in comparison with their horror inspiring counterparts.I'm not saying I didn't learn anything, nor do I completely disagree with the philosophies espoused by pure capitalists, at least as I understand them.This book IS a soapbox (author's privilege), not written to be read for pleasure but to convince the reader of the \\"truth\\" of Ms. Rand's ideas. It's tedious, and morally abject. (I get it...morals are outr&eacute;.)What does amaze me is the (religious) fervor of those who feel in opposition to me. I get that, too, because the ideas put forth here are basically religious, as defined by the OED as 'a particular system of faith'. Please feel free to pelt this review with your comments, as I am clearly asking for it. :-)I did appreciate being introduced to the author's viewpoints, and agree that the USA is not going in the right direction, nor has it been for over 100 years. I'm really anti-progressivism. I love our Constitution. I just disliked the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I started reading this book several years ago. It's not a page turner, or a book that you read a few pages of before going to sleep every night. Because of the very long chapters I only wanted to read it when I really had the time to sit down and read without interruption. Now, a few years later, I've finished it, with mixed feelings.I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I'm glad to have read it. I'm not going to discuss Rand's philosophy other than to say that it has its merits and its flaws. It provides lots of food for thought. But let's not forget that this is a novel, and as a novel, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" doesn't work. It is way too long and contrived. Rand has so much she wants to say she introduces a whole arsenal of minor characters and subplots to get her message across, often the same message time and time again, and it gets very tiresome. There's character development in the heroes, especially Dagny Taggard and Hank Rearden, but the \\"bad guys\\" are for the most part caricatures (Jim taggart seems a bit less one dimensional than the rest), sometimes making it hard to remember who's who.As I said, I'm glad to have read it. I wouldn't advice against reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" but I'm also not quite sure I'd recommend it. I really had to force myself to finish it. Much of the philosophy of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is presented in the smaller non-fiction volume \\"The Virtue of Selfishness\\", a much quicker read for sure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Nice to have the larger centennial edition. Print much easier to read than the mass market publication, but can be tiresome to hold open for long periods of time. Absolutely vital literature to read in these times, regardless of your political views. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Despite my general libertarian readings, I had never actually read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" in its entirety. I certainly have problems with Objectivism as a philosophy and Rand's theory of sex is pretty laughable. And yes, the writing is not subtle and the characterizations are overly broad.But I believe that the people who focus on these factors are missing the point. Atlas Shrugged is essentially, an adult fairy tale. As such, it paints an overly broad picture to illustrate a moral point. Which is does extremely well. And, as in any fairy tale, the wicked queen is ugly and spiteful and the fairy princess is beautiful and can do nothing wrong. But Rand is not trying to portray a specific reality, or even write an engaging mystery story. Let's face it, for all intents and purposes, we all know who is John Galt - 500 pages before we meet him. Agatha Christie, Rand is not.But story of the \\"mystery\\" behind John Galt is engaging, because it highlights some disturbing facts about human society, that, like the villains in Rand's book - we often prefer to leave unsaid. If anything, the book is valuable because it portrays, with devastating accuracy, the slow decay of a civilization when it decides to privilege \\"need\\" over \\"ability\\" and \\"feelings\\" over \\"reason.\\" Rand was able to create this engaging visualization because she lived it in Soviet Russia before and after the Revolution. I've personally seen the destruction wrought by those who put \\"the public welfare\\" ahead of individual liberty, both in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, and I can say without a doubt, Rand has nailed why these societies fail.The book slows down once our heroine reaches the Emerald City and discovers the secret behind the mystery. But Rand's portrayal of the society's final death throes are interesting enough to keep you turning the pages till the end. There are not many fairy tales like this, and as such it is an important book - as well as a decent read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is fictional, however you learn many important lessons in this book. It is easy to imagine that the plot could happen here in USA. It is based on a philosophical idea of the author known as objectivism. A summary of the plot is that the society becomes more desirous of socialistic values, which eventually leads the smart, hardworking, ingenious people of the society to be de-valued. Consequently the community falls apart. I don't want to spoil but the above-mentioned hardworking, entrepreneurs start their own community and it is awesome!!!!In this book, you learn that there is value in \\"a hard days work\\" and that there is a reason to always seek to be a better person, and that competition is sometimes a good thing, rather than just being a society full of mediocre, warm-fuzzy, let's not be better than others, it might hurt their feelings, people.This book is very complex and it is impossible to detail every idea and moral the reader is exposed to in the book. The above is a very brief summary of the plot and basic premise of the book.I think this is one of the more difficult fiction books that I have read. It is not for someone that wants a quick, easy read. The descriptions and dialogues get very lengthy and if you have a short attention span, you will probably lose interest. This, to me is more classic literature and so if you want a trendy, simple, page-turner, do not get this book. It is full of substance and it is not \\"fluff\\" like most of the books written nowdays. If you read this, you will be both inspired, perplexed, angered, and awed all at the same time.One reason why I love this book is that Ayn Rand (author) immigrated here, learned the language, and writes better than most U.S. born citizens."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book made me think almost more than any other book I have ever read. I'm really not sure what I can say about this thing that hasn't been said in the over 2000 reviews of it. I won't waste your time with a synopsis as there are many. I will only say this, I feel that anyone running for a political office where they are in a position to expand government should be required to read this book.[...]"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are concerned about the direction in which this country is headed,I suggest that you read this book. This book was written in 1957, but you will see relevance as it compares to today's political climate. Ayn Rand was a prophet!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I won't go into much depth. Others have covered this novel more completely than I could ever hope to.ATLAS SHRUGGED is perhaps the most controversial novel ever written. No other novel has ever inspired such spirited defense and admiration nor such scorching and nigh hysterical criticism and hatred. Its central question about the nature of economy and politics is central to the survival of the American Republic in these alarming times. It is not A message book, but THE message book. Ayn Rand is supremely confident in her viewpoint and she presents it with such hardy gusto that it is next to impossible to not get swept up by this startling and often beautiful novel if you are at all sympathetic to her viewpoint. If you aren't, well, it probably won't be long before you feed its pages to the nearest paper-shredder. It is that kind of book.While I can't sympathize entirely with her viewpoint, the depictions of human greatness and passion in this book are so inspiring that I have read it at least three times in the past five years, and plan on re-reading it again soon.Nevertheless, I have to stress that it is easy for weaker-willed individuals to be swept up entirely by Rand's almighty persona. This can be dangerous. It is doubtful whether the Objectivist cult would have become anywhere near as enormous as it presently is if this novel hadn't been written. All I can say is this: the novel stresses independent judgment and rationality. Heed these virtues and don't treat this book like some kind of secular Gospel.Now, onto the criticism!The characters are stick figures with little complexity to them. Gone is the complex psychologies of the characters in The Fountainhead. This is largely due to the novel's scope: The Fountainhead followed a small group of people around, while ATLAS SHRUGGED is about the fall and rebirth of Western civilization. So don't expect to be especially moved by the plights of the characters. These people exist only to embody individual aspects of Rand's philosophy.The dialogue is so stylized as to be completely unbelievable. But, again, this must be expected given the type of novel this is.Several small speeches dot the book's pages, but one especially famous speech near the end of the book, which comes in around a whopping 60 pages, brings the flow of the novel to a screeching halt. This is the novel's largest flaw dramatically: interrupting the flow of the narrative to deliver an essay. Even the most ardent fan of ATLAS SHRUGGED will usually skip this speech on a first reading. I didn't, as I can't bring myself to leave parts of a book unread on any reading, but there is no harm in it, as it only explicates what has already been demonstrated throughout the rest of the novel.Rand's ideology drowns the humanity in many of the characters throughout the novel, and human life is devalued in a couple of extremely controversial scenes as a result.The novel is far inferior on a literary level to The Fountainhead, my favorite Ayn Rand novel, but this is still a great, ponderous, controversial, compelling behemoth of a classic that should be read at least once by everyone.*Just a note: Shell out the extra money and get this either as a trade paperback or a hardcover. The girth of this novel just destroys the puny binding on mass market paperback editions. I went through three MMP editions before just caving in and purchasing the hardcover edition. Best choice I ever made.*"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Fantastic book. It is hard to think that it was written over 50 years ago. There are passages that appear to be written around today's evening news."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a 'good' book. I call it such because its concerns are chiefly achieved, and its points are poignant. That is not to say, however, that there are some serious detractors contained in the 1200-page monstrosity.To those who criticize her economic/political structure: it's a tad irrelevant. Ayn Rand was not proposing capitalism v socialism v communism, etc... instead, she used some fundamental aspects of economical/political structure to highlight things which were 'good' and those which were 'bad'. Please do not be distracted by the political/economic structure, they serve only as vehicles to a different point. I will agree, however, that her stance on 'objective values' is difficult to wholly swallow, as the world she constructs is a hyper-focused hypothetical one. Little is done to discuss the nature of these values; unfortunate, considering she had 1200 pages to do so.To those who believe her ideas are 'pernicious' or 'destructive'... unfortunately she makes this misinterpretation far too easy to realize. She is not proposing that if you are good at your job, you should quit and work in obscurity. Her message is two-fold: to those who find themselves king of the 'able' hill, be wary of the cost you incur on yourself and the evil which you may inadvertently assist; to those who are everything else, understand that there is a purpose to your life - live it fully, productively, and use reason as your absolute. It is the latter of these ideas I think is a tad out of reach for society, but on the shelf of philosophy it sure looks pretty.To those who say her writing sucks: I can't wholly disagree. She says 'as if', 'some', and 'as if some' far too frequently. \\"Dagny shuddered, as if some evil countenance were before her\\". It got frustrating for me, as Rand had clearly intended for the reader to bypass these words of ambiguity. Regardless, it's on nearly every page. She uses the same literary structure and devices in an almost frighteningly unaltering manner. Start the chapter with a metaphor of the weather and surrounding sights, introduce a character by deifying or uglifying their manner and physicality, write as if she's barely containing a veiled secret just out of reach for the reader (which it is not), then ground and pound with Objectivism. For a methodical person such as myself, I both enjoyed and disliked this method. Were the novel only shorter, I would have simply enjoyed the strict methodology. You'll notice even her descriptions of people make them a walking algorithm. The story, containing 1200 pages, is longer than the Mahabharata, which is considered one of - if not the longest - epic ever written. Considering all the things that happen in the Mahabharata, the story of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is an extended ramble in comparison. The story is insufficient to enrapture the reader, and the Objectivist content is repeated ad nauseum; for this reason, I find the length unjustified.The end of the book, I believe, leaves the reader with a feeling of impetus, and of hope. The parting blow of Rand's ending set the stage for us to begin. Francisco, Dagny, Midas, Galt... they all represented a part of us. As they set out to begin anew in the world, so too are we to move forth in our own way. We're not supposed to quit our jobs in angst of incompetence; we simply are meant to pick the battles worth fighting, realizing at last that happiness is the moral purpose of our lives, with productive achievement as our noblest pursuit, and reason as our only absolute.If you manage to escape the frustrating elements of this book, you will find a gem of an idea that just might alter your passage through life - for the better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged has been an annual read of mine since I was introduced to the novel as college senior twenty-seven years ago. Like many of my peers, Rand's promotion of Objectivism and capitalism had a profound effect on my young mind and thought process at the time, taking the view that I and others who embraced Objectivism were superior thinkers and those who did not were misguided, socialistic parasites.Over the years real world experiences shown me that the philosophy on politics, economics, and selfishness espoused in Atlas Shrugged is no more a realistic philosophy to live by just than a socialist philosophy; they are extreme and narrow in focus, which is why neither really works since both theories disregard the most important element, human nature.Atlas Shrugged is basically about the struggle between the producers (the inventors, scientists, philosophers, businessmen, etc.) and the consumers (the conformists, altruistics, socialists). The author clearly extols the superior person. Rand asserts that if the producers, those who make things work, decided to go on strike they could stop the world from turning.Of note is the story's heroine, Dagney Taggart. She is one of the most well-written women characters in literary fiction.Atlas Shrugged overlaying theme is controversial, which makes for a challenging, enthralling and entertaining read. If it weren't so overly long and often lecturing, I would give it five stars. Nevertheless, this is a book that inspires passion from both those who embrace the author's philosophy and those who strongly disagree with it. I do recommend reading it because there are relevant principles to think on but keep in mind that this is a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged written in 1957 depicts life today to a T. We, may not agree with everything in this book but, would be hard pressed to play the, \\" Devil's Advocate \\" in disputing the facts. Of all the books I have read, Atlas Shrugged is rated #2. The bible being #1. Would recommend this book to all students studying Political Science."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged comes to us from a different time. Back then,+ cigarette smoking was glamorous, and \\"nobody\\" suffered from cancers, decreased stamina, or bad breath as a result+ the United States was the uncontested world leader in the production of oil, steel, automobiles, and other industrial products+ industrial imagery (factories, locomotives, buildings, etc.) were seen as positive symbols of the triumph of the human mind and of the labor required to construct them, not as generators of pollution or as wasters of natural resources+ the existence of the Soviet Union and its satellite states struck terror into the hearts of millions of AmericansThe last item on that list is the most important, and I believe that many people have forgotten--and some are probably too young to understand--that until the very end of the Cold War, people really DID experience the anxiety and fear of Communism that is expressed in this book. I would recommend reading Atlas Shrugged and 1984, as well as reading about Sen. Joe McCarthy to understand how much fear there was, and how some unscrupulous individuals exploited that fear during that interesting but dangerous time in history.I believe that Rand's involvement with a small group of fans who called themselves \\"The Collective\\" likely impacted the end product that is this book. \\"The Collective\\" would meet at Rand's home on Saturday nights to talk philosophy and to read the latest parts of the manuscript of the book. I think that this interaction definitely led Rand to keep adding more and more to the book, to the point that it is much longer than it needs to be. Some of the ideas seem to get hashed and re-hashed, but the repetition doesn't necessarily make them clearer. As if that weren't enough, the ideas are spelled out again in a three-hour-long radio address. The idea that the American public, even in the 1950s, could have had the attention span to focus on a philosophical speech for three hours makes me say (apologies to John Stossel) \\"Give me a break!\\" Another problem that I encountered is that Rand seems to want to coin her own philosophical jargon, and this unconventional use of terminology leads to arguments amongst both readers of the book and critics of the philosophy over what Rand was really trying to say.I am giving the book a four-star rating because I think that it could have had better editing and because I believe that since this is a novel, Rand should have not gone out of her way to introduce terminology or to spoon-feed her philosophy to the reader. Overall, I did have fun with the book, and I think that astute readers will be tickled by various little clues that Rand sprinkles into the story regarding the \\"mysterious\\" disappearances that the book's protagonist is trying to understand.I do not believe that Atlas Shrugged predicts current political events, as this book was written in protest specifically of the Communist Party-controlled countries of the 1950s. Rand, in my opinion, could not have predicted how the world would be fifty years later, just as we cannot predict the world of 2060. I am glad that the Soviet Union collapsed so that the nightmarish vision that runs through most of this book could not become a reality. I think that one can and should learn some general lessons from this book, but one also must accept that the world of today is different from that of fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although this was a birthday purchase for my son, he reports the quality of this item far exceeded his expectations.

She was a compelling writer, with interesting thought processes,and she was dead-on about many things. However, she was also an atheist with no acknowledgment whatever of the possibility of the existence of God, or any entity of spiritual power. As a Rationalist (when this was written - she would later call herself an Objectivist), she believed that nothing that could not (to her satisfaction) be physically proven to exist, could exist. That saddens, and rather diminishes the value of her conclusions, at least for me. In my world, the Lord is the source of all real wisdom, so even though she did not acknowledge Him, I believe her talents and any truth she shared were His gifts to her, albeit her denial thereof :-)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't want to write a review, but I keep getting emails asking me to.

Rarely does one find a book that seems to outline the very values he lives by, but was never able to articulate.Don't buy this edition however. It's god awful. There's a glaring typo almost every 10-20 pages. It looks almost like a rough draft of the novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If any book has taught me anything valuable, this would be the very first book that comes to mind. This book brings to light the dangers of excessive regulation and the virtues of hard work and doing well for oneself.I would say that while Ms. Rand's lessons about life are timeless and ingenious, she tends to not let the story speak for itself. Her constant use of metaphors and tiny details really show this. Like, for instance, Ms. Dagny Taggart (the heroine of the book) will walk \\"with confidence\\" while her villain brother James' walk would be like walking off a cliff without a parachute. The skies are bright around Dagny; James' are anything but. I thought such tidbits took away from the essence of what Ms. Rand was conveying.While this book goes on for 1069 pages, taken as a whole, ATLAS SHRUGGED is a thought-provoking book that challenges established conventions about greed, welfare, rationality, and mysticism. It is an uninhibited novel and one may not agree with it all or even some. But my advice is to take the challenge and open one's mind in a way he/she may never have done before. I am glad I did."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When you read this, you will want to check the original publication date. The book is a spot-on commentary about what is happening in our current socio-economic environment. As a work of fiction it uses hyperbole and exaggeration to demonstrate sources of problems and their solutions. However, anyone who reads this will be able to substitute names from today's headlines for many of the characters in the story. The author paints with brutal clarity the natural consequences of a socialist policy. The protagonists embark on a journey to understand a world turned upside down, and where the last best hope for survival is when the heroes refuse to be victims."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is great, but I am disappointed at the recording. It seems that the reader is in a hurry all the time. Perhaps this is aimed at reducing the number of CDs (still, you have two boxes with 42 CDs: this is a complete, unabridged edition). I have listened to another (older) version from Blackstone Audio, and it sounded better. Besides, it included an introduction, which now as been omitted. Anyway, though sometimes one dislikes the fast pace, the reader is always clear.In spite of my objetions, I am very glad that I bought both the audiobook and the paper book. Even if the reader had stammered all the time (which he does not) I would have listened to the audiobook, and considered it a treasure. So my rating refers only to the recording.Though the book is long, it is the best introduction to the thought of Ayn Rand (she refers to it in most of her articles). This is because you see the ideas in their application to events and people. Certainly, this is fiction, but you will find many times that it relates to your own experiences.Having both versions (sound and print) makes it easier to read again or listen again: with this book, you would like to do it, not because the plot or the ideas are difficult (they are very clear), but because you would like to remember them in detail. That isn't the case with most books.Two stars for the recording, not enough stars for the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is probably one of the finest authors I have ever read. She has amazing character development and explores issues that are incredibly hard to describe.I love one of the many themes of this book -- how people who do their jobs well can get penalized by others who don't understand them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand is not just a novel; it is an intellectual illustration of the author's philosophy. It is also a suspense thriller, a mystery, a love story, and a self help book all rolled into one. It has been in continuous publication for over fifty years and people are still reading it. Why? Because though the philosophy is not perfect, it is not nearly as flawed as the other philosophies dished up and accepted for the last couple of thousand years. Ordinary man is not a worm; he is an individual and the values he adopts as an individual matter, they are the things that keep civilization moving, or freeze it into a static corpse. In reading Confucius one learns everyone and everything has a place and in this there is harmony, but there is no place for change. This is a major fault found in most philosophies and religious doctrines. The acceptable strategies for achieving happiness are all based on yesterday and today, none of them work when pitted against the only true constant of the universe, Change. Tomorrow always brings change, whether embraced or rejected, it comes and must be dealt with.The characters in this story at the time of their creation were considered to be much larger than life, but life has gotten bigger since then and in today's world they feel only a little above real people we see in the news all the time. The story exposes the dark side of communism and the dangers of government meddling with the market, while inventors and entrepreneurs struggle to move the world into tomorrow. It begins with the sensing of change, the world is sliding into decay and stagnation. People have adopted cultural philosophies that are not logical and their civilization is not just slowing down, it's starting to fall backward. Instead of admiring achievement, people vilify it, feeling they should support those who can't achieve because this is a more noble way of behaving. Their philosophies are a lot like the recent acceptance of PC (politically correctness), where the truth and validity of an argument was not as important how it was stated and some things could not be discussed at all because such discussions were deemed not PC.This is a book that will entertain and enlighten you and it could change the way you feel about those who criticize your achievements. At the time it was published the book had a message, but times have changed and interestingly enough the message has grown larger."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I thought the beginning started out a little slow, but then I was able to really get into the story.

It is mammoth is scope, and reads very well. Anyone who is serious about giving Ayn Rand's ideas a fair reading should consider buying this edition, as it is a well made hardcover with clear text, and will endure a great deal of physical handling.Anyone who remembers the childhood tale of the little red hen can relate to Ayn Rand's ideas. The little red hen was the only animal in the barnyard who worked and provided for others, until she decided to go on strike to protest the laziness of the other animals. This novel is somewhat more sophisticated in the development of a similar theme."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In our world of self-serving media sound bytes Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand should be required reading for college students. Especially in an election year all book clubs and libraries should put it on their lists for discussion. Our country is spinning out of control by promising everything to everyone but always taking for granted those that provide the wealth from which we all benefit through our jobs, our lifestyles, and our self worth. Ayn Rand was an immigrant to America from Russia in the early part of the 20th century. She saw her country collapse. Her philosophy that was written in 1956 seems like it was written yesterday afternoon. Do you have the courage to read it?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, I absolutely love it, I have told everyone about it. It is truely a good read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have nothing to say for or against Rand's philosophy, but I have a lot to say against this book. There's unsubtle, there's undisguised propaganda, and then there's Atlas Shrugged.I didn't think this before I picked up the book. Yes, from the beginning, the worldview is completley one-dimensional and Rand admits no possibilty of any other ideas having merit, but I had expected that from having reading The Fountainhead. There came a passage in the middle of the book, though, which just made me _stop_ and reread it a couple times. It describes a train wreck, caused, of course, by shoddy workmanship and laziness, in which all of the passengers on the train are killed. Rand as narrator says something like: &quot;You may believe that victims of accidents have no responsibilty for their deaths. However, the passengers on this train...&quot; and she goes on the list why some of the passengers on that train _deserved to die_, namely because they weren't proper objectivists.Am I the only one who thinks that's just slightly objectionable?I almost never get offended, and I'm not one to snap at authors for being insensitive or un-p.c.But _holding accident victims responsible for their own deaths because of philosophical shortcomings_ seems to cross a line.I found The Fountainhead readable (and I'm giving this book two stars instead of one) because of the sheer energy and conviction which Rand communicates through her work. It's obvious that she cares very deeply about her mission. It's difficult for the reader to work up the same enthusiasm, though."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In a \\"scant\\" 1,074 pages (five or six hundred of which could be excised without sacrificing anything), the almost shocking banality of Ayn Rand's threadbare philosophical cupboard is laid bare, again, and again, and yet again.After leaving Russia for America, Rand developed a philosophy that countered the excesses of the Bolshevik revolution by going straight backwards: the emotions of the Russian feudalist system. The heroes of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" are gods in all but name: two dimensional, golden haired industrialist icons, heroes to whom the unwashed, illiterate masses are to hold in nothing but the highest regard. The villians, quite typically, are the photo negative, stereotypes in the literal sense. There is not a single inch of middle ground to be found anywhere. This is something Ayn Rand had a problem with as a novelist, and as a pseudo-philosopher: it's either black, or white, good or evil.What begins as a promising plot device (what if all of the nation's leading capitalists disappeared?) quickly turns into painful, non-stop parade of Rand using these interchangably impersonal characters as mouthpieces to espouse her \\"objectivist\\" philosophy. You will quickly discover what provides the bulk of the 1,074 pages, namely: the mindless repetition of the same ideas, over, and over, and over ... Before the reader knows what's happened, the dead horse begins to flog itself. The sheer volume of heavy handed didacticism in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" will wear the reader down, and leave you to wonder if Rand had any respect whatsoever for the intelligence of her readers. Ironically, the sheer repetition of her message, combined with the escalation of her heroes to an absurdly magnificent measure of virtue bring Rand around full circle to the techniques of the Soviet propagandists she ostensibly suggested. That irony alone is more amusing and entertaining than anything to be found in this grim, joyless book.By the time the book concludes in a credibility stretching 56 page (!) speech from the hero, you've heard Rand the first two dozen times. Speaking strictly personally, I should have loved \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"; Rand and I are both conservative, free market capitalists. However, Rand's inability to separate moral attributes from ideological ones is practically enough to put me on a picket line singing Pete Seeger songs. This is something of a bible for pseudo-intellectual, bargain basement college campus conservatives who would be better suited reading Adam Smith's 1776 masterpiece \\"Wealth of Nations\\", the first truly capitalist treatise. Smith's capitalist Atlas will certainly be remembered after Ayn Rand's is forgotten."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As Ayn Rand's immortal opus, Atlas Shrugged, stands as a tome to a philosophy that is relevant today as it was in her time. Basically, the major moral theme is that there are two types of people in the world: the Creators and the Leeches.The Creators are the innovators who use the power of their will and intelligence to better humanity. The first person to create fire is often referenced as the paradigm for these people. In the book, each of the major protagonists also represent Creators improving the human condition with their force of will.The Leeches (my word) are the people who create nothing, but thrive off feeding on the Creators. In Rand's view, they are the bureaucrats, politicos, regulators, etc. Throughout human history she tells us, these people have benefited through no ingenuity of their own, but merely from piggybacking on - and often fettering - the success of the Creators.Where the conflict in this book arises is when the Creators decide they have had enough and revolt. I won't spoil the book by describing specifics, but let's just say it causes quite the societal drama. For Leeches can't feed where there's no blood.All that is fairly significant and involved and worth the read to begin with, but where this book really stimulates me is in the fact that it is still relevant. Today we have Creators and we have Leeches. Some titans of industry and technology move our culture forward and others hold it back to their own benefit. I work in Silicon Valley and I see this all the time. That's why in many ways I consider this voluminous novel to be as important to a business education as Art of War.To cite other readers' posts, you don't have to agree with what Rand is extolling, but I think you'd be foolish to try and deny the existence of this struggle since it is ingrained in humanity. Yes, Ayn does get long winded and arrogant in parts as she draws the battle lines, but I don't think an author could have crafted such a powerful conflict without copious quantities of ego to accentuate the differences."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, it is a long book. 50 disks. But, even so, you don't want it to end. I just finished and I want more! The imagery and language entertains you throughout. Rand's descriptions vividly describe the action and scenes; it is as if I were there. The book has actually paralleled some of my life experiences and truths that I have discovered; Rand has given words to my experiences and understanding. Truly a brilliant work and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand originally thought to call this book \\"The Strike\\", and set out to describe the values and motives of the strikers, and who they were striking against. Donald Trump calls them \\"burons\\": a cross between a bureaucrat and a moron. Rand calls them looters. Whatever you want to call them, Atlas Shrugged reveals an eerily familiar scenario wherein They are finally left to their own devices by the producers of the world who tire of bureaucratic pillaging of everything they produce. \\"I quit,\\" said Ellis Wyatt, \\"because I didn't wish to serve as the cannibals' meal and to do the cooking, besides.\\" Read it if only to find an answer to the annoying question: \\"Who is John Galt?\\" Hopefully the film with the same title set to debut April 15 will do this majestic work of art justice and draw more people to read Ayn Rand's books."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was constantly amazed reading this book that it was written over 50 years ago. So many of the polices the government came up with seemed liked the same issues we are tackling today, and if we arent careful will be in place tomorrow.Excellent read. Unlike others, I did enjoy reading this on my kindle. Yes I paid more to have it on there, but I already had the paperback version on my book shelf that I never would crack open because of how thick the book was and the small print used.Again, great read, highly recomended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This came up as a recommendation, and I thought now there's a blast from the past. I was interested in seeing what today's people had to say about it, so I had a look and somehow here I am with my own very first Amazon.com review. I must confess that it has been many years since I read this, so forgive me if memory and the years betray me in places.I see from other reviews that more people cite this as the most influential book in their lives than any other work of fiction. I am one of those people. This book hit me like an unexpected brick on the head shortly after I got out of college. I had no idea whatsoever of what the book was about, although I had certainly heard of Rand, always pejoratively. And I was completely unprepared for what I found. The clear, comic-book like simplicity of the premise brought out into the open for inspection ideas that I had up until then simply accepted without question.But ironically, the book did not draw me to her Objectivist philosophy. Quite the contrary. It felt cold and lonely and mean and I wanted nothing of it. But she shook me up, destroyed chains, cleared out cobwebs, got my brain moving and put me on the path to discovering my own philosophy. Which ultimately makes for a greater accomplishment than a merely persuasive treatise would have been. This is one of those rare books that actually frees your mind, rather than simply moving it from one master to another. I am forever grateful to Rand for this gift.It is difficult to discuss this book's literary merit. In many ways it is a really bad novel. As others have noted, the characters are one dimensional, everything is totally unbelievable, it is way too long, the dialog stinks, and so on. But it is also mesmerizing and a real page turner. In the week or so that it took me to read it, I did little else, beside eat and go to work. And my days were filled with images from the book as I imagined directing a movie version. I got angry at her cheap literary devices such as giving gratuitous moral flaws to the representatives of opposing philosophies. And I literally couldn't sit through John Galt's interminably repetitive speech.But this is the paradox. Aspects of the book were so good that I was angry that it wasn't better as a whole. And I was disappointed when she finally unveiled her uninviting philosophy, because I wanted her to give me a vision to replace the simplistic clarity that she had taken from me.So what's so good about it? It's the way that she demolishes the moral and philosophical underpinnings of Leftist/Collectivist (now paradoxically called \\"Liberal\\") thought. Conservatives have traditionally attacked Socialism on utilitarian grounds. Stuff like it's a really nice idea, but too bad it just doesn't work in practice. But Rand shows how it is morally repugnant as well, feeding on mankind's basest tendencies. It's easy to recognize yourself in her negative characters, and it's hard to just keep going on after looking into her mirror. If you are a Liberal, you simply can't read this and keep both your philosophy and an open mind. At least I couldn't. I went in a bit shaky but still pretty Hard Left, and came out something else, a seeker perhaps, on a meandering rightward journey, although it would still be many years before I could comfortably call myself a Conservative.I got many great things from this book. Make sure you carry your own water. Be your own man. Stick up for yourself. This sounds simple, but she put it in a way that I really got the spiritual underpinnings, in a way that I didn't reading Emerson and Thoreau, who covered similar territory. She lays bare the greed of those who demand the property of others, who claim virtue in their supposed weakness and need, who condemn as evil those who create what they desire. The spiritual bankruptcy of claiming moral superiority for stealing the fruits of others' labor. I really understood the spiritual necessity of not being a parasite.It's fascinating that such an influential book is so invisible. Like her heroes, she is shunned by the entitled. She may not be taught in universities, but she is studied in living rooms everywhere.And she will always be a lonely prophet. The Left of course will always despise her, but she doesn't really speak to the Right either. For all of her purported individualism, her worldview is essentially that there are a few virtuous producers who are exploited by the parasitic masses. And I sense a demand that the masses bow down and acknowledge this debt, which feels suspiciously similar to the Liberal demand that all bow down to the elites who run the all-giving mother government. Rand makes her claim to power based on productive ability while the Leftists make it based on moral superiority. Completely different (she wants to be free of the masses, they want to rule them), and yet somehow fundamentally the same in their condescending dismissal of the bulk of humanity as \\"the problem.\\" Both offer the trap of specialness, so appealing to our narcissism but a dead end as social policy. And all of this is totally out of step with modern Conservative thought, which is in essence a celebration of the potential greatness in all people, who need only be allowed freedom to develop. And conservatives tend to not see masses, but individuals. I get the feeling that Rand doesn't really like people all that much.And I was particularly offput by the revenge fantasy of the strike that is the book's centerpiece. Although enticing, it has all the wrong energy. Destroying the world so that it can be rebuilt by and for the virtuous. A delusion that has plagued mankind since the dawn of time, and which is particularly topical now, as the Obamatons put torch to the country and its institutions. And Rand clearly takes pleasure in watching the sinners pay for their crimes, betraying a meanness that ultimately disqualifies her as a guide. There is no heart in her philosophy.But these complaints are beside the point. I recommend this book to everyone. It's not about agreeing with her. It's allowing her insights to illuminate the space around you so that you can see the world more clearly. What you do after that is up to you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is probably one of the most difficult books anyone can take on. Reason one is its length. Incredibly long, it is nevertheless groundbreaking. It was considered to be the first novel of \\"ideas,\\" that is to say, a novel that was supposed to really make one think about the world and the way it works---or doesn't.The basic premise is this (and I'm not giving away anthing or adding any spoilers here): The world if run by a handful of people who really know what they're doing, perform their job well, have a sense of ethics, and are responsible. Problem is, there's another group---the ones who take credit for everything the others have done and then proceed to screw everything up.At one point, all those who really make things work (think the middle managers in a company who actually know what's going on but are not given credit and sometimes actually blamed for what goes wrong, even though they had nothing to do with creating the problem), decide to \\"withdraw\\" from society and let it fall apart. And it does--fall apart.My only complaint with the book was with the speech that Galt gives about three fourths of the way through the novel, essentially recapping everything that we've just been shown. It seemed unnecessary and, well, a recap. Other than that, this was an extremely thought-provoking novel.Recommendation: for those who are not Rand readers or want a first time experience I would highly recommend \\"The Fountainhead,\\" which is shorter, easier to read, and filled with just as many \\"ideas\\" as \\"Atlas.\\"Also, if you're already a Rand fan, you must read the bio written on her---it sheds a great deal of light on not only her philosophy, but some of her faults as well."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Writing a review for Atlas Shrugged is personally difficult because while I grudgingly find Rand inspiring and was obsessed with the Fountainhead when I read it, I must concede that Ayn Rand is not an exceptional stylist or wordsmith. To the question: is she a writer or a philosopher, the answer is a firm 'philosopher.' Her works are much too idea-driven and one can't help but feel like he's reading a biblical comic book.In this epic she presents a near-futurisitic world populated by industrial/scientific tycoons and populist parasites, the latter ruling the former, blinding them from perceiving their own greatness. Dagny Taggart, the engine behind a powerful railroad, and Hank Reardon, the inventor of a revolutionary steel alloy, are resolved to hold out when the industry giants begin to quit and disappear in response to American socialization.Rand basically used this book to espouse (sometimes tediously so) the fundamental tenets of objectivism. It is wrong to criticize this book as anything other than what Rand intends it to be: a romantic vision of man as she sees him (as, indeed, she wants to see man). Yes, Atlas Shrugged, to a large extent, is a response to the time and place that produced Ayn Rand. Still, it is tough not to admire her steadfast, resolute, uncompromising vision of man as man ought to be - of freedom of ideas, speech, and ambition, the fulfillment of out greatest capacities for reason, progress, and happiness.The tough part of reviewing Rand is looking at her as a writer. Yes, her character are cut out of cardboard. Yes, her ideas are single-minded and her morals fixed and diametrically opposed to her concept of evil. Atlas Shrugged is also frequently surprisingly flat, considering Rand's story-building skills. The Fountainhead had a hero and a worthy villain, but Atlas Shrugged has a number of heroes but not a single worthy adversary. For every John Galt, there are ten unbearably stupid, puerile, unconsciously evil enemies. This allows Rand to market her philosophy virtually without any competitition, making it that much more attractive. The story never really becomes compelling (even if the ideas sometimes do), and that is the measure of a great epic novel. We know where Rand is going and how she will get there; the issue that remains is how many words will she use?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the review I wrote about the original edition:\\"I have read this book over 10 times, and it is simply the best, most important book ever published!

I was given the book as a gift and I DREADED reading it, but felt I had to read it out of politeness. Before I read this book, I was a person who hated capitalism and money (not having it of course, but the idea of it). I am still not a big fan of capitalism, but I've learned that it's not money one should hate, but what people who do with it.As a novel, it succeeds on 2 levels:1. There is enough mystery, character development, romance, and plot twists to make this a hard book to put down.2. There is a universal and useful moral: Think for yourself.While Rand's philosophy on capitalism is too idealistic to ever work (imagine: a world full of business owners who have excellent moral standards), she was born in communist Russia. I feel that this book is more a comment against communism, than it is a book for a new capitalism.Upon receiving this book, I though \\"Why would I want to read something by the Queen of the Republican Party?\\" Now I realize that she embodies a traditional and healthy Republican view on business, and she would very much loath what the party has become in both its actions and what it represents.That being said, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read that promotes thinking for yourself, regardless of your political standing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It has been many, many years since I first read Atlas Shrugged, and I have been looking forward to purchasing the audiobook to listen to on my long commute to and from work each day.

Don't listen to the drivel out there, read the book. Then read her philosophy if you feel that mankind is more than a sacrificial animal as Ayn says so succinctly. This is a true examination into the social diseases out there and how they are fostered through personal relationships and their philosophical underpinnings. There are few books I think everyone SHOULD read. This is one. But PLEASE don't take away the idea that she is a hedonist, or Machievellian, those are the complete opposite of her philosophy.

For that reason alone I think you have to read it just to consider yourself literate.

I tried to take the most objective approach that I could here, assuming that I had never read The Fountainhead. However, at the end of this review, I feel I must make some comments in relation and comparison between the two novels.A brief overview of the main characters:Dagny Taggart: Main character of the story. She is Vice President of the nation's largest railroad industry. She is extremely driven and ambitious, yet at the same time very cold and uncaring. She is one of the \\"hero's\\" of the story.James Taggart: President of the nation's largest railroad industry. Dagny is his sister. They are opposites in every way. He is basically a leach, a mooch, and a hypocrite in every sense of the word. He depends on others to make him feel better. He is one of the whiny villains in the story.Francisco D'Aconda: The most interesting character in the story. Gives away almost all of his fortune for a hidden purpose I won't reveal. Interesting things always seem to come from his mouth. He is not what he seems at first.Henry Reardon: Exactly like Dagny Taggart in every way, except he is male and owns the nation's largest steel industry.John Galt: For the purpose of not giving too much away, I will only say Ayn Rand's vision of the perfect man in every way.There are a slew of other characters, but these are the main ones. Despite almost 1,100 pages, there is not a whole lot to the story, except in Part III, and it wouldn't be fair to give that away. The story boils down to Dagny Taggart's quest to find a person who she believes is destroying the world. All over the country, many of the nation's leading businessman and industrialists are disappearing, and no one knows what to make of it. The reason for their disappearance is that there is an ever increasing rise in socialism through the country which is driving may of nation's top producers out of business. Dagny is baffled by these startling turn of events, and it eventually leads her to an abandoned factory where she discovers a valuable motor that could have furthered the good of mankind. Yet, it is just lying there in the rubble, abandoned. With the help of tycoon Henry Reardon, she races to discover the inventor of this motor, and with it, a hope to discover the man she believes is destroying the good in the world. Eventually, in a startling turn of events, she finds out that everything is not all its cracked up to be. The real destroyer is her brother, James Taggart, and his powerful friends which are driving the country toward a socialistic empire. At the same time, crushing all profit making and individuality of anyone who gets in their way.Of course there is a lot more to the story, but I dare not reveal the plot twist that takes place in Part III, when we will finally know the answer to the immortal question of \\"Who is John Galt.\\"I recently glanced at a list of the top 100 books of the Modern Library, and number one on the reader's list was this book. Ever since that time, I have been trying to figure out why. No one can doubt that this book is extremely well written, and that many of the characters are deep, complex, and interesting. At times, Atlas Shrugged does show signs of being brilliant, and there are a number of sequences which I was mesmerized. However, there are a number of problems that block the book's potential at greatness. One is that it takes F-o-r-e-v-e-r to get rolling. If you can survive the opening 500 pages, and the 75 page speech near the end of the book, you are in for a treat. Another flaw is that the story seems to take a backseat for Rand's philosophy, which she rams down our throats for far too long, far too often. The focus should have been more on the story. Does it really take 75 pages to tell us that men should think for themselves? One more problem with this novel is that it can be, at times, silly, overly dramatic, and a bit over the top.Despite those flaws, I am recommending Atlas Shrugged. If you can endure its intimidating length, you will discover some brilliancy in some of the passages where Rand gets you to think, and opens your eyes. Finally, I will say that Atlas Shrugged is dwarfed in comparison to The Fountainhead in every single aspect. The Fountainhead is more interesting, deeper, more controversial, more complex, has better characters, gives us more opportunity to think, and the story, not the philosophy, is the main focus. The Fountainhead is one of the best books ever written, while Atlas Shrugged is slightly above average, with occasional radiance that makes it better than it should be.Grade: B"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Take a solid base of Adam Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, stir in a gallon of Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, mix in some of Ambrose's &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot;, and finally add a pinch of Orczy's &quot;The Scarlett Pimpernel&quot; and what you end up with is the basic recipe for &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. An interesting story with solid ideas, sound plot progression, and a whole army of windbags.If you're into plots then here's the story. While no year is ever mentioned in the book one gets the feel that it's taking place in the 40's or 50's America. The world has fallen into a collective of &quot;People's States&quot; all vying to get the most goods out of the world's last capitalist nation, the USA. However within the US is a growing sentiment towards Socialism and so the beleagured guardians of free trade fight a running battle with their antagonists, the &quot;looters&quot; who wish to place as much bureaucratic restriction and taxation on the money-makers as possible so that &quot;it's fair for everyone&quot;. The main protaganists are Dagny Taggart, heiress and prime mover of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad, and Henry Rearden, a from the ground up multimillionaire who has marketed a new miracle metal. As public sentiment begins to turn against big business, leading industrialists and entrepeneurs begin disappearing across the nation one by one, with no clue as to their whereabouts. And as each one vanishes the country sinks deeper into the miasma of &quot;fairness&quot;.Continuing their fight against the &quot;looters&quot;, which Dagny and Hank refer to those who wish to get their money, not by earning it but rather by taking it from the rich, the protaganists fight a losing battle against bureaucracy. The theme strikes a harmonic chord within me today when I see politicians on tv demanding heavier taxes on the &quot;wealthiest 1%&quot;, and after reading this book I have a much deeper understanding and appreciation for those at the top, many of whom worked their way there after starting with nothing but talent and drive.The ideal of the book is sound. Place little to no restrictions on those who have that ambition and drive. Let them make the money and as a whole the country will experience an economic boom the likes of which the world has never known. Overburden them, attack them, or otherwise take them down and you end up in an economic, non-productive quagmire. To be sure, I certainly agree with the premise Ms. Rand has to say. I do not much care for the characters though, and that is the truth. Dagny and Rearden, while I have sympathy for their troubles, sometimes irked me a bit with their almost extremist positions. Likewise the government officials and social juggernaughts on the other end of the spectrum were rather cartoonish, designed to be disliked. To be honest I cannot say that any character ever really &quot;developed&quot; per se, more than they just moved from place to place like philosophical locusts, forcing me to flee by quickly skimming over pages at a time until I could get to the next plot twist. And John Galt's speech exemplifies the word &quot;repetitive&quot; to the extreme, lasting some 20+ pages and essentially droning out the same thing each paragraph, letting the question &quot;Who is John Galt&quot; make you wish you'd never asked.The melodramatic addition of the disappearing industrialists was what really kept me going, and the unfolding sequence of events on the country kept me glued to the book. The essence of this tome will make a liberal squeamish, a capitalist beam with pride, and will bore the living snot out of the average reader. This is heavy stuff, not to be digested in a lighthearted fashion. It will have the effect of making you opinionated on the subject and perhaps even a bit appreciative that all our top businessmen and women are all firmly in place and aren't disappearing off someplace to evade the next Congressional tax hike.Definitely recommended reading for businesspeople and aspiring politicians, or general purpose economic news junkies."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I could go on and on in my review about the merits of Ayn Rand's philosophical beliefs and whether or not I subscribe to her theory of how the world works. I do not think that would be very helpful, however. Instead I will say that reading Atlas Shrugged is no small feat. It is over a thousand pages and it can waver on the side of overly preachy at times. On the other hand, I actually found it to be a fairly gripping little mystery story at the same time. All of America's leading brains seem to be disappearing while the structure of society seems to be collapsing. Thus we watch two industrialists, Dagny Taggert, who runs a railroad, and Hank Rearden, who runs a steel mill, attempt to keep their businesses afloat amidst this turbulent time in America. With dozens of side plots and quite a good deal of imagination, parts of this book simply fly by. Other parts lend more towards the philosophical, which, if that's your bag, will also fly by. Basically, this is a 1000 page book by one of the most revered thinkers of our century, just keep that in mind if you pick up this novel expecting to find some light reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you follow politics at all in modern America, then you will be surprised at the prescience of Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged. What incredible foresight she had, considering that this novel was published in the 1950s.This book will challenge your values and force you to question your assumptions as to how society functions, and what citizens should expect from their government.The book also a good mystery and it contains some nice science fictional elements as well. Who is John Galt? :)Overall: a very interesting and enlightening read. Some of the monologues are way too long, however, and can't be read without taking a break."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book uses fairly extreme characters to put the author's philosophical ideas about society in context and in practice. The book mainly shows the fall of Capitalism in a society that turns to a Socialist point of view and how this socialist society ends up being a very dark place.Ayn Rand lived in Russia until she was 20, and witnessed communism first hand before moving to the US in 1926. The 'nationalization' of industries, which happens in the book, actually happened to her father's chemist shop back in Russia. This act reduced them to poverty almost overnight.When Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957, Ayn Rand had lived half her life in Russia's communist society and the other half in the USA's capitalist society. I believe it is this fact that accounts for her amazing ability to track her Capitalism verses Communism theme in meticulous detail.I know a lot of people will be turned off by Ayn Rand's detail but I find that the content holds a lot more weight this way. Instead of just saying things like \\"there was a riot because the people were hungry,\\" she really makes sure you know everything that lead to these people being hungry. How people were hungry, therefore the government nationalized (read \\"took control of\\") the copper mines so they could use the profits to feed the poor, but in doing so, they ran the copper industry into the ground due to sheer ignorance of how to run a copper industry, then how a small detail like a copper wire breaking in an oil refinery at a time where there is a copper shortage cascades down to no fuel for the tractors to reap their crop and no fuel for trains to carry any other crop to people who have no other means of finding or creating food since they are so dependent on government aid. All this creating a viscous cycle that ends with starving people and the government nationalization of another industry as a means to \\"aid\\" the people.This book was fantastic and got me thinking about many issues in US society today, like the current shortsightedness of Social Security and Welfare and how we are always talking about reforming them in a way that puts more financial burden on the shoulders of our children.You may not agree with Atlas Shrugged and you may think it's content is near impossible, but I doubt Ayn Rand agreed with the nationalization of her fathers shop, and I'm sure there was a time when they all thought it was impossible to even think about, but it happened. This book should serve as a bleak reminder of how good intensions aren't enough to run a country.I will make sure my children each own a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Many of the reasons given by reviewers for liking this book, or not liking it, hinge around how reviewers feel about the philosophy that supposedly underpins it (Objectivism); thus it seems that a lot of negative assertions about the book are actually negative assertions about Rand as a person.I have to tell you that I started reading Rand before I ever heard of the philosophy, and the first story I read (as a kid) was Anthem- which I loved. There is very little &quot;philsophy&quot; qua philosophy in Anthem. So I moved then onto Atlas Shrugged. This book is not good- and not because of the views that it espouses, nor because Rand is a bad, wicked, or tasteless person. Baldly put, it is not good because it is poorly written.People do not speak in a realistic way, nor do they act, think or feel in a way that is believable. All of the caracthers are, in fact, carachitures. Is this allegory? If so, then it clings to much to modernist conventions; and if it is modernist, then it is too flatly sketched out.If I want to read objectivist philosophy, then I will pick up a non-fiction collection fo essays on that philosophy. When I read literature, I expect literature. Very badly done."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is certainly one of the greatest novels ever written, and one of the most influential ones at that.The plot is stunningly original, the characters are larger than life heroes and villains, and the dialogue is simply beautiful."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes yes -- Communism and Socialism bad -- Capitalism good. In general I agree with this philosophy. I certainly don't agree with how this book tries to prove it.In Atlas shrugged every capitalist is a heroic hard-worker who want only what he has fairly earned and is too noble to stoop into the politics to protect his interests. Every politician and social worker is a self-important yet sniveling leech who actually despises the poor but helps them because doing so fulfills his/her feelings of superiority.Now re-read that last paragraph and realize I am not exaggerating. Everyone... every single character... EVERYONE in the whole book fits this mold no matter how stupid it makes there actions. This is so far from reality that you learn nothing about real life. We ALL know of Capitalists that are greedy and would readily twist political policy and hurt the overall economy to make more money. We all know there are social workers out there who actually care about people and really are trying to selflessly help them.After 200 pages or so of seeing people act stupidly to fulfill their respective roll you get a little sick. After 300 you can hardly take it. This is not a book worthy of being recognized as a classic. The only thing this book does well is teach the reader to hate Communism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved but have never been able to reach. ...The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours.&quot; - Ayn Rand, Atlas ShruggedIf you have not yet read Atlas Shrugged, I'm a bit jealous, because I would love to be able to experience again the exhillaration of reading this novel for the first time.This is a timeless book which adresses the fundamental questions of mankind, and which will be read as long as there are people who care to ask such questions. At the same time, it is a fast-paced mystery-adventure, with a heck of a lot of humor (which is hidden between the lines until one reads the book a second time). The protagonists are not people one would meet everyday, which is one of Atlas' virtues, rather, the characters are the sort of people one would wish to meet at least once in one's life. Rand's heroes were unabashedly heroic.Atlas, despite being an exciting read on the level of an adventure, is more fundamentally a book about ideas. These ideas are introduced not as floating, imaginary abstractions, but in terms of real concrete dillemas similar to those all people must eventually confront if they are to live a productive, fulfilling life.I feel a profound sense of reverence for this novel. Perhaps you will too, or already do"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As a fairly strong supporter of objectivism, I thought the philosophy was well outlined in _Atlas Shrugged_. It is not, however, a &quot;great work of literature.&quot; It is very readable, I believe, was quick reading, her characters were either very likeable, or very hateable (which is a good thing for some types of fiction), but it is lacking in depth. I will say, her descriptions of the enemies in the novel were well done, as it is one of the few times I've gotten truly angry at a fictional character.Those who complain about the verbosity of the novel and herald Dostoevsky as great, should think about their statement. As an author, Dostoevsky is my favorite. However, have any of you people read _The Brothers Karamazov_? Talk about needing an editor. I don't see verbosity as a good claim against _Atlas Shrugged_, (albeit, Galt's speech is a bit overdone) because sometimes it takes a lot of words to get it across.I did enjoy this book, I do like Ayn Rand's ideas. She was, from what I have read in interviews, not the best person out there. She could have followed her philosophy a bit better.It is important, though, to read this book, it is immensely readable, and was influential on me. It got me into philosophy (and not just objectivist).But, if _Atlas Shrugged_ does interest you, read some of her non-fiction..it's also very readable."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a beautiful book, marking an evolution from the stark moral poles of Toohey and Roark into the beauty of Dagny Taggart and John Galt. Rand manages to rise above her sermonizing, using her tight prose to simultaneously teach and entertain, finally rising above the stereotypes of The Fountainhead to fully convey her message. Yet the effect that her books seem to have on people--the cultishness, the inability to develop the structure of the ideas she left behind into a coherent philosophy unique to each &quot;Objectivist&quot;, the transformation of Rand from revolutionary writer to demigod of Objectivism--makes me wonder if her motive all along was to draw the weak-minded to herself, exploiting indecisiveness and insecurity through words of individualism in order to reap more personal power and glory.Sounds kind of like Ellsworth Toohey, doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I like this book. I read the harcopy twice, and I've listened to the taped version many times. I find it to be fun and inspirational, and I have recommended it to many friends.The problem I have is that the characters are flat and predictable. They don't portray the depth and complexity of real people. They wear their philosophy on their sleeves, and they fall into two distinct camps: Those with high self esteem who are productive and confident, and those with low self esteem who scheme to live a parasitic life off of the first group.The productive geniuses live in peace and harmony in Galts Gulch while the leeches inhabit Washington and executive boardrooms across the country.I can't imagine Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, or Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla ever living in harmony hidden in the Rockies together. Just because you're a productive genius doesn't mean your philosphy and values are the same as that of your peers. This is what Ayn Rand implies, and this is why I claim that the characters lacked depth and complexity.Read it and enjoy it as a fairy tale, but don't expect Pulitzer Prize winning story telling."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is Rand's masterpiece achievement. It features brisk pace (despite its large size), well-crafted plot, piercing insights into modern political and philosophical problems, plus (as a bonus) slightly dubious character motivation. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and agreed with most of the things it had to say, but frankly, John Galt put me off. (John Galt is almost the sole reason I use four rather than five stars). He is a totally one-sided character, and he has become such a myth by the end that the mere mention of his name as an actual character seems bald and brazen. (My favorite character, admittedly, was Ragnar Danneskjold). The villains were portrayed well, especially as character prototypes (I am sure Ms.Rand had a lot of experience with them). But nevermind that, its well worth the read and the thorough round of contemplation that it invariably brings with it. A fine work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed these reviews. For me to say how good the book is would just be more of the same. I particularly enjoyed some of the squirming done by some of the detractors. Ive read it and saw no connection to nazi-ism, social darwinism or republican politics (republicans for goodness sake!). I think the heroes are all tall and elegant because that's the sort of person Ayn Rand was attracted too, rather than an argument for eugenics.The &quot;its childish&quot; argument is fun too, always a good stance when one cannot argue the points in the book is to pretend to be older and wiser, shaking your head with the heaviness of pseudo wisdom. Her books weren't aimed at any particular group when she wrote them. what a peculiar notion.I even found it an enjoyable read, the points were hammered home again and again, but that didn't mean it wasn't good to read. I would recommend people read &quot;the fountainhead&quot; before this though, as it is a pretty heavy book! and should be read closely and thoroughly if you're going to get anything out of it. I would like more business people to understand it, too many of them are the type of dishonest rip off merchants who give the rest a bad name!If you found the apparently uncaring stance a little disturbing, its not because Ayn Rand loved to bomb orphanages! That some people seem to think that's what the book is like seems bizarre. The whole issue of benevolence and the philosophy of reason is handled well in &quot;unrugged individualism&quot; by David Kelley.I don't think it should be compulsory reading, that would be a collectivist idea! Read it with an open mind, and only read it when you've decided your ready for it, its no light entertainment."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"it is basically a sequel to fountainhead with the characters the same but renamed. Howard Roark as John Galt, Gail Wynand as Hank Rearden, Floyd Ferris as Ellsworth Toohey, and Dominique Francon/Keating/Wynand as Dagny Taggart. With that said, it is a much better read than Fountainhead, obviously, since it was a later work. The first half particularly the beginning is tough to get through, but the end is worth it. Reads like a good action thriller after about half way through. My complaints: Very annoying use of the words &quot;Austere&quot;, &quot;Depravity&quot;, one of these words have to be on every other page, it one form or another, and it gets annoying. Why does Rand feel compelled to add some love triangle like some cheesy grocery store novel. I agree with most of the free-market type philosophy, but I don't like the fact the main characters don't believe in God, but then proceed to create a &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; like Galt's Gulch. Anyway, I don't want to get preachy, but we can't acheive a heaven-on-earth like Galt's Gulch, but I agree with the power of the individual philosophy, and I realize the characters are meant to be ideals, but they are incomplete as human beings and sometimes seem like robots. How about other virtues like compassion? I think most people read it just to say they read a 1000+ page book, but it is pretty good!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The best aspect of reading this book today is the amusing corollaries to our very own Clinton government. I could rate it a 7 on humor alone for its embarrassing, yet hilarious, characterization of what's going on in America. From the attempt to choke us with a bossy health care system to its limited success in promoting racial set-asides, the Clinton government is the government of Atlas Shrugged. Fortunately for us, however, the book is an extreme exaggeration of reality -- the establishment is far too incompetent to control us as well as it does in the novel, and for that matter we don't have any John Gaults. The book presents an ideological archetype, a form. A reader can get a lot out of a form by recognizing where and how it applies in his own life. Don't cheat yourself of a good read (and some good humor) by dwelling on the writer's personal inconsistencies, the atheism or the stark imagery. Read it like the Bible. Read it for its ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Was a bit unsure of the narrator's credentials to be the reader of this book, being so closely tied to FDR.

Did not even care if traffic was terrible, since I was listening to such a wonderful audio."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not a review of the book, as I have justread all the other reviews and I think both sides are presented quite well. Instead, I would like tosuggest an order to read Rand's fiction work, as Iread them in the wrong order, and want to prevent this happening to anyone else.A good order is:_Anthem_, a short and sweet primer of the power of the individual._The Fountainhead_, excellent book--if you like it, then you'll want to read the next book._Atlas Shrugged_, her best work (Galt's redundant sermon aside).If you liked _Atlas Shrugged_, then you'll feelcompelled to read _We The Living_ (which will be disappointing, just as _The Fountainhead_ was to me because I had already read _Atlas Shrugged_).I find Rand's non-fiction work to be entirely unpalatable, although parts of _Atlas Shrugged_ are certainly not too far from straight philisophical theory"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Why is it superhuman to strive for perfection in yourself, to push your own limits? Why is failure an acceptable outcome? Why are those who seek the betterment of mankind through the betterment of themselves shunned?The man who performs his job with pride and confidence, the particulaly competant secretary, the ambitious grocery clerk, the female executive who will not cave in to the world around her, all are given an equal nod by Rand. She strips the gray layers of fog off of humanity and offers the essence for us to examine. There are those who move the world, and those who work to maintain an acceptable level of mediocrity 'for the common good'. Isn't it selfish to try for perfection, when there are those around you who won't, or can't? After all, if one doesn't try, one can't be faulted for failure, right? No one should be allowed to achieve while there are still those who can't. Ayn's world doesn't reflect ours in the slightest, does it?Let go of your convictions, let go of your frustrations, let go of the idea that settling for the path of least resistance is a way of life, and let Ms. Rand show you her world - as it is, as it could be, as it was through her eyes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a novel that asks, &quot;What happens if the shakers and movers of the world go on strike?&quot; It's set in a world where the main industrialists of the world are under seige by looters in government, who use &quot;pull&quot; and &quot;executive guidance&quot; to tear down their companies in the name of &quot;fair play&quot; and &quot;common good&quot;. The book defends individual excellence and reason as the drivers of progress in society, and demonstrates what happens when society's leaders refuse to be beasts of burden.Atlas Shrugged can be of assistance in understanding the world that we live in:1 - The Dot Com boom - Many dot commers are believers in Ayn Rand, and hold her up as the model for which they strive. This is ok, but let's remember that she is against anti-trust laws, and would tell the government to leave Microsoft alone.2 - Alan Greenspan was a follower of Ayn Rand. Although she is considered pro-greed, it's interesting to hear him speak out against it.3 - Japan is a country that is run by administrative guidance from above, and although it's not a communist &quot;People's state&quot; it is suffering from much in the book.4 - Enron and Worldcom are considered sources of greed inspired by Ayn Rand. I'll contend that they were build not by reason, but by governmental influence, and should not be held up as examples of the result of her thinking.The book slows dramatically when the main character, John Galt (who leads the strike of the thinkers), gives his speech to the world. Conventional wisdom is that you don't need to read the whole speech - it's just a rerun of the book. Nobody told me that wisdom, and that stumbling block added a few weeks to the read.In general, the book celebrates the individual who strives for excellence by using reason to create progress. This holds true, but has limits in the real world. Despite great intentions, people need to make compromises and make sacrifices in the name of the system. (Systems thinkers would say that overemphasis on local performance kills the system as a whole) There are detractions to the book, but it posits a profound thought that everyone should understand. Feel free to agree or disagree with her conclusions, but learn what she is saying. Just skip the John Galt speech when the going gets slow."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What a thought-provoking and eye-opening book. This is one of those books that makes you forever look at the world in a whole new way. At the completion of this novel, I felt like someone handed me the answer key to the great SAT test of human life. The way in which this book reveals the nature of man, both good and bad, is so subtle that it caught me by surprise. In reading this novel, you are slowly led into a clear and illuminating revelation about cosmic forces that never seemed apparent before.It is to Rand's credit that she wrote such a compelling pitch of her philosophy in narrative form. Clearly her championing the spirit and rights of the individual would have been met with undue criticism in a quantitative, fact-based study.Although the length of the book, 1100 pages of small print, was a bit daunting, the story is so driven and full of suspense, I found myself going through it quicker than I expected.Quite a life changing read and highly recommended for anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"People who claim that Atlas Shrugged is promoting narcissism are missing the point of the novel. It isn't narcissistic to want happiness and personal well-being. It isn't narcissistic to develop a positive sense of self-worth and self-efficacy. It isn't narcissistic to have creative and productive pursuits in life. It isn't narcissistic to have personal integrity and principles to live by.The moral code of Atlas Shrugged is similar in some ways to the ~eudaimonia~ of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Ayn Rand's accomplishment is that she presented a modern variant of eudaimonia."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Dagny Taggart is the granddaughter of the great Nat Taggart, the man who built the nation's largest railroad, Taggart Transcontinental. She is a woman who only respects men of vision and ability and despises weakness in any form. She is surrounded my government bureaucrats and weak-willed men like her brother, the President of Taggart Transcontinental, James Taggart. Dagny has always loved accomplishment and we get a flashback to her adolescence where she loves a very promising young man named Francisco D'Aconnia. But after attending college, Francisco becomes a very different man. He is a slacker and a playboy living on the inheritance he is given as the sole heir of an international copper mining operation. Dagny ends up leaving him and burying herself in her work. She decides that just walking into the top of the railroad organization would not be honorable, so she starts as a station operator and works her way up to Vice President of Operations.In that position, Dagny realizes that all the spineless men around her, especially her brother, have let the great railroad fall into disrepair. She works desperately to have the railroad return to its previous glory. In the process she meets great industrialists who share her disdain for any hint of moderation or reflection. These businessmen have set up shop in Colorado because they are burdened with the least amount of regulations and taxes there. Dagny knows these are men who deserve her effort and her railroad, and she risks her reputation and company to bring it to them. In the process she meets Hank Rearden, a steel and metal alloy magnate who provides her with new rails when all the other incompetent suppliers will not. Soon she falls for him and eagerly becomes his mistress. The two of them overcome great mediocrity in their suppliers and incompetence in their government regulators to build a great shining monument to freedom and capitalism. The John Galt Rail Line that ships oil, cars, and metal out of Colorado to the rest of the nation.That's basically the story of the first 250 or so pages. Although it sounds rather dry the story is strangely compelling. The prose is full of memorable descriptions and phrases and is a pretty quick read. If the book stopped here, it would be a pretty good book.But it doesn't. The book drags on for another 800 or so pages and those pages are just awful. The problem is that the book switches from telling a story to expounding a philosophy that is downright bizarre. The arc of the story follows Dagny, Rearden, Francisco and others as the government sets out actively to destroy them. There is a long slow decay as one by one the brave capitalists are crushed under the wheels of a thinly veiled communist government. Accelerating the decay is a man named John Galt who convinces all the men of vision and ability, i.e. great industrialists, to quit working and retire to a hidden valley called Galt's Gulch.Underneath that arc is page after page of dialogue where people are not speaking to each other -- they are making speeches at each other. Even the dialogues of the lovers -- Dagny and Hank, later Dagny and John -- are just opportunities for extended soliloquies on the nature of freedom and capitalism. The crisp dialogue of the first part of the book is long gone, drowned in a pedantic attempt to convince the reader that Dagny and her gang are heroes by repetition and wordiness.Although I read the first part of the book in a couple of days, it took several weeks to finish this book. I found myself alternatively shocked by the philosophy being expounded or bored and disgusted at the mangling of the plot in an attempt to make an ethical point. I haven't struggled this much to complete a book since getting bogged down in Battlefield Earth back in my early teens.I might have liked the book better if I agreed with Objectivism. Atlas Shrugged is supposed to be a description of the ultimate application of that philosophy. After reading this book, many people find it appealing. I, on the other hand, found the application of that philosophy and the results of that application to be disgusting. Here are some examples:- There is a child-like confusion of a pinprick with a death blow: After a railroad trade group made a decision Dagny didn't like, she compares the action to compelling self-immolation and that if it were to continue, \\"then we better start slaughtering one another, because there isn't any right at all in the world!\\"- There is no recognition of the love and support that was provided to the great industrialist by his family when he was a child, rather there is a bare assertion that he owes no love and support to his family at all: After Hank Rearden is asked by his mother to give his brother a job in one of his steel mills, his response is \\"Mother, I'm running a steel plant -- not a whorehouse.\\"- Sex between Dagny and Rearden is described in the vilest terms of dominance, obedience, possession, and violence. Then their adulterous relationship us held up as the example of virtue.- An industrialist is praised for doing what he pleases, the environment be damned. When the oil baron of Colorado decides that he will retire, he sets fire to all his fields and refineries and walks away. No mention is ever made of the devastation left behind, nor who will clean up after him- When Rearden is caught in his adultery, he is praised on two different occasions for having the restraint to not kill his wife then for having the restraint to not beat her up. In that way Rand suggests that this woman who kept her vows when Rearden didn't deserves physical abuse and ultimately murder.- In a stunning passage, Rand states that the following people are not just wrong, or misguided, but deserve to die painfully by poisonous gas: (1) a professor of sociology who didn't teach Objectivism; (2) a journalist who wrote that good intentions and good causes were sufficient reasons for social policy; (3) a public school teacher; (4) a newspaper publisher who believed man is basically evil, i.e. in the doctrine of Original Sin; (5) a businessman who had the audacity to accept a government loan; (6) a businessman who made a fortune by using political connections; (7) a union worker; (8) a pushy consumer who had the temerity to demand service; (9) a mother and her two children who was married to a government worker; (10) a \\"sniveling little neurotic\\" writer who did not portray industrialists as the modern equivalent of Greco-Roman Gods; (11) a person who, in Rand's eyes, did not do sufficient research into a candidate before voting; (12) a lawyer; and on and on and on . . .- Murder is a valid means to any end: Dagny, with no concern for a life that she considers worthless, executes a guard who refuses to make a decision without input from a superior.Then there are the contortions Rand makes to force these disgusting people into the role of heroes. There are too many to list. Suffice it to say that the \\"America\\" in Atlas Shrugged seems to not have a Constitution, military, nothing remotely resembling a real court system or regulatory agency. And this is the final problem with the proponents of Objectivism. It only seems to work in a completely fictional world. Any attempt to apply that philosophy in the real world would end in a rude awakening and ultimate failure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ahhh !Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged - the sunlight of freedomA book with an immensely transcendent atmosphere, plus great aspirational potential.If you feel you have brilliant and creative constructive thought, with a wonderful idea for the world that will lift everyone and everything higher, that will bring peace and light, especially to the poor, then this is the book for you.Those with no creativity, inventiveness, originality or desire to give out to other people in a generous way will find this a frightening book, because it describes and supports those people (crushed in such places as the defunct soviet union) who decide not to be ripped off any longer by socialists, and simply withdraw.Without giving too much away of this story, they depart to a deliciously special place away from the reach of those who know all about redistributing wealth, but nothing about creating it. They escape from those who believe that the cake is only so big, that there is only so much to go around etc etc and all their other terrifying limitations that revolve around their fear that the world is a hard unforgiving place. (It is not. It is a beautiful place.)In Rand's book they withdraw silently and secretly.Very quickly, without their imagination, kindness, generosity and originality, the world begins to fall apart, and the socialists immediately call them criminals.The genuinely entreprenurial will find this book uplifting. The non-entrepreneurial and embittered WIFMs of a world which refuses to bend to their hate filled demands will find it objectionable, and attempt to compare its heroes with the likes of those nut cases who ran Enron and Worldcom. The reality is that those evil individuals were exactly the opposite type of people whom Ayn Rand champions.By contrast, she delivers a bouquet to the type of wunderkind who bring benefit to us all - the genuinely creative, inventive and hard working, such as Picasso, the brilliant lateral thinker Einstein, the freedom fighter Ghandi, the inventor Edison, the wonderful \\"make it free to all \\" ethos of Linus Torvalds, the entertaining cleverness of Steve Jobs, and the Novatium group who will bring a $50 computer to the poor of the world.I doubt she would have found Bill Gates particularly appealing.Watch for the whinging and comparison with evil 'big business' in some of these reviews. It is bitter envy at people succeeding through their natural abilities who plan to help all mankind but have their efforts hijacked by the socialists, peace corps activists and Enron style executives alike.Read the book, be enlightened and supported, but keep away from the non creative, for they will hate your natural rise to the place you know is yours that you plan to share with all.This is the truth, and we all know it to be true. The real people are those who 'let go', and surrender to the universe who trust the human race, look on the bright side, and do good in the world with all their imagination and energy. Ayn Rand is their leader... and mine too.Do read this book if you have something genuine to contribute that is clever or brilliant.If you are a whinger who dislikes the clever and innocent, and who feels bereft of talent, then avoid this book like the plague.It might shed some light into your dark life. And vampires don't like light I seem to recall :-)Eversley Rhodes"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is both the most entertaining and philosophically compelling book I have ever read. I would rate reading it for the first time as the event that has most positively influenced my life. Rereading Atlas Shrugged is like getting a refill of emotional fuel, it inspires me to work harder in pursuing my own happiness and achieving my lofty personal goals.If you have not read Atlas Shrugged, you should not go another minute without reading it. It will likely change your life, provided you go into it wanting to be correct in your view of the world, and not to simply validate your current notions (like a belief in God, the de facto moral good of altruism, the noble ideals of socialism, etc). Any person who has ever aspired to greatness will love Ayn Rand's epic novel. Those who hate the world (whether explicitly, or through a feigned affection for all humanity), will simply hate greatness more after reading it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, this is a classic work and valuable primarily as a presentation of Ayn Rand's Philosphophy of Objectivism. It's a pretty good presentation of how life might look and feel if you were to eliminate all subjective and emotional human responses to life and more importantly create a government that only minimally intrudes upon those thinkers, inventors and producers who utilize capitalism to its most efficient ends.In fact, I think that's why it does a good job of what's it \\"objectively\\" sets out to do. As evidenced by the myriad of reviews all over the map, it achieves its goal by spurring thought and evaluation of the philosophy of objectivism and more importantly what the balance must be between individualism and the corporate needs of society and the role of government in balancing them.As a novel, it is long, it rambles and it could use some editing. But then again, that's a \\"subjective evaluation\\" and who is to say that the philosophy itself does not render it to be as it is.I know many come to this work as required reading and as the audience is young there tends to be a pretty strong reaction to the content of the philosophy, either setting aside all idealism or embracing the cold, hard automaton thinking of the protagonist Rand creates.In fact, I think reality lies between those two extremes. There is much to be said in favor of Rand's conclusions coming from a totalitarian idealistic Soviet Union that causes her to react so strongly against it and advocate an austere personal capitalism. In fact, she does such a good job, that I think she creates a whiplash at the end of the book that drives people back toward the center, seeking desperately for something, anything, that offeres solace and relief from the stark world she paints with little of the milk of human kindness and care for one's fellow man beyond that which is necessary for one's own self-interest to be preserved.This is a very important book and a very influential one. I read it later in life to see what all the fuss was about. I walked away from it changed and better able to use my mind to evaluate the value of well intentioned social engineering and what it does to the opposite end of the spectrum. In the end, I tend to hear the warning against tipping too far in this direction, but I also appreciate the perhaps unintentional opposite warning of neglecting this area. The question that must be answered is how much is enough and by what means, especially by means of a coersive government, must this be accomplished.Regardless of what perspective you come to this book already holding, chances are you'll be brought face to face with the harsh reality that Rand and her objectivism paints and you'll walk away with some modified views and possibly even some new values and a foundation to build further your own views.I think we can agree that that experience is a worthwhile one, even if the panoply of differing opinions attached to the book gives evidence of the controversial nature of the core message."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...it's shorter and reads better.I managed to get through about three quarters of this very long book, but it finally defeated me. Rand's ideas are worth understanding, but the speechifying finally wore me past patience and stamina. The \\"tragic\\" heroism of the main characters ceased being interesting pretty early in the book.If only Rand had cut this monster down by a third... the writing might have been tighter; the characters, limited in depth though they are, might have had more sharply drawn and entertaining trajectories; and the terribly dated \\"bogey and bacall\\" posing might have held me if only for historic and nostalgic reasons.I reached a point where I no longer cared how it all turned out.With no small sense of release I quit this volume for good and will not be back."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is without a doubt one of the most important books of the 20th century, and is still entirely relevant today. It addresses a subject (individualism vs. collectivism, in economics, philosophy and culture) that wars have been fought over, and which millions perished and suffered because of (the communist, socialist and fascist regimes of the 20th century). Even today, while most of these collectivist states have collapsed, the debate over the proper role of the government and the degree to which wealth should be taken from some to be given to others continues unabated. All of the arguments that politicians use today to justify their positions on tax policy, or regulation of businesses, or new health and welfare programs, or the evils of big businesses and powerful industrialists (e.g. the U.S. government&#65533;s attempt to punish Microsoft and Bill Gates), appear in Rand&#65533;s masterpiece. You could study these subjects by reading dry economics textbooks, but Rand has taken both sides of each argument, illustrated the conflict with dramatic images and events, and drawn the logical conclusions.Atlas Shrugged is a 1000+ page refutation of Karl Marx&#65533;s dangerously alluring statement: &#65533;from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs&#65533;. Why doesn&#65533;t this work, and why does it actually destroy societies? Why would a cradle-to-grave welfare system (government guaranteed housing, medical care and food) fail? Atlas Shrugged shows why, in incredible detail. If only more people in the 20th century (and today) had been able to read and understand Ayn Rand, who knows how many lives could have been saved.Atlas Shrugged is also an inspirational guide for how to conduct one&#65533;s own life. The top people I&#65533;ve met in U.S. businesses more closely resemble Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart than they do Jim Taggart and Wesley Mouch. So, if you want some ideal role models on how to succeed in business, Atlas Shrugged provides them. It is one of the few works of art to present engineers and applied scientists as true heroes. Also, the book teaches the most important lesson about personal responsibility: each individual, not others, is responsible for his/her own happiness.Finally, there are other more trivial reasons to read Atlas Shrugged. The plot is a page-turner; you&#65533;ll want to keep reading to find out what happens. You&#65533;ll feel a major sense of accomplishment when you finish. You will find many interesting, amusing tidbits (I was surprised to learn that American academia was a collectivist, relativist hotbed in the 1950s &#65533; I had thought that was a phenomenon induced by the Sixties).It&#65533;s amazing to realize that Ayn Rand had this all figured out in 1957. It&#65533;s also heartening to see that Atlas Shrugged continues to be a top-seller (ranked in the top 1000 on Amazon right now) nearly 50 years after it was first published. Why is this so? Read the book!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"'\\"Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact that you choose to live--that productive work is the process by which man's consciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one's purpose, of translating an idea into physical form, of remaking the earth in the image of one's values...\\"Sorry Rand.

Of course you immigrated to America AFTER the Ludlow Massacre, Pullman Railroad strike of 1877, and death of Joe Hill; kidnapped and murdered as a righteous martyr for workers.

It is a lie.

Nevertheless, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; has a richer feel for people and more solidity to the &quot;world&quot; created within it, even though all its characters tend to speak to one another as if in a 1940's movie or a modern prime-time soap opera. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; lacks even these endearments -- the book is mainly filled with cartoon characters. They might as well be talking to one another with speech balloons. I can't say for sure which is worse, the heroes which chatter back and forth repeating the *exact same philosophy without a single variation* (this, in spite of the author's theoretical! exaltation of &quot;individualism&quot;), or the uniformly mealy-mouthed villains who have nothing whatsoever to do with their lives but attempt to destroy the heroes. You get two of these for the price of one in those scenes which pit a hero against a villain -- Rand devastates her opponents with clever turns of phrases that are the verbal equivalent of &quot;Kapow!&quot;. The problem is simply that Rand has ceased to understand either human beings or real life -- everything is (either good or bad) ideology to her, and the poor robots in the novel must spout it incessantly. Sex, love, money, marriage, religion, cigarettes, a good-tasting hamburger, a train wreck -- all life is connected in a total system in her mind, all is reduced to &quot;bare essentials&quot;, premises, syllogisms, and conclusions. This excludes all other factors and is root cause of the black-and-white drabness of the novel. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; culminates in Rand's typical piece de resistance! , a speech which turns the plot on its ear by dumfounding a! ll the foes with its unassailable logic. If witty put-downs are the fists (&quot;punch lines&quot;) of the novel, The Speech is an atom bomb which, by its simple proclamation, obliterates all opposing thoughts in its blast zone (in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, this zone is a courtroom; in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, by a plot trick, it is the whole world via radio). This is the &quot;revenge&quot; part of the fantasy -- Rand is smashing her ideological foes. Naturally, the stick-figure bad guys in the novel haven't got a chance after that, and they know instantly that they've been beaten by a master. The funny thing about a Rand novel is how everyone seems to agree in the end with her *entire* philosophy. First, there are the good guys; of these there are a) child prodigies who always knew it from age 9 and never lost sight of it and b) ninety-nine percenters who aren't too sure if they agree with *all* of it at the novel's start and whose complete conversion to the Trut! h is the novel's only character development. Then there are the bad guys; these are either a) those who already know the Truth and are fighting it with all their might because they want to crush the heroes and make mankind their slave, or b) those who stupidly oppose the Truth while being secretly afraid of it because they know, deep down, that its really True after all. Finally, there is the Common Man who, after The Speech has been delivered, has found voice for his inarticulate assent to the Truth at last, and who expresses a simple gratitude for his enlightenment to the one(s) who delivered it to him. He cannot hope the match the achievements of the heroes, but his spirit is one with theirs -- they have provided him with a firm foundation for life to come. In this last group we find Rand's fans. These are the ones who give copies of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; to their teenage children in the feckless hope that it can serve as a substitute religion, i.e., a guide to hi! gher understanding and moral fortitude. Such is the fate o! f all-encompassing thought systems with ideals that lead, basically, nowhere. The parallel to Marxist-Leninism is most compelling -- Rand's overtly atheistic philosophy has become its own false god."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged.

The other, of course, involves orcs."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has to be one of the most verbose yet immature philosophers I've come upon. She seems to fit the classic definition of a psychopath, as her \\"philosophy\\", objectivism, amounts to little more than a \\"do what you feel if it benefits you\\" and \\"greed is good\\" mantra.There is nothing of value in her works if you are one of those people who consider themselves to have morals, even if you're not a religious person."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has very little to say, yet she says it over and over again in this 1000-plus page book. Rand's standing as many women's favorite author is in itself a good reason for going through the ordeal. Notgiving up halfway will pre-empt sterile assertions that you don't know what you're talking about. Rand's appeal is based on the false perception that she is extremely subtle and intelligent. A prolific womanwriter making pound-and-a-half novels loaded with polysyllabic words is wont to endear herself to a female readership with intellectual aspirations. The reader with a live brain will understand Atlas withinthirty pages. The underpinnings of Rand's philosophy there established, no surprise will come out of the other 97 percent of the work. Throughout the novel, the conclusion of each episode is as inevitable astaxes in April. This machine-like progression of a brute writer taking you through the motions of laying out the same trivial arguments, which end each glares you in the face thirty pages ahead of completion(perhaps in one of the speeches Rand is fond of peppering her novels with), will cost you more neurons than a bachelor party in Nevada. Rand is basically a fascist. Her universe is peopled with blue-eyedmuscled men (and one women) of iron will (the minority) and fat losers with shifty eyes (the majority). Although she doesn't explicitly speak in terms of different races to describe the struggle of her Aryanheroes against the Jews and the other degenerates, she is not so correct as to avoid a passage in which she refers to American Indians, in a parallel between two trades meant to be jestful, as &quot;these othersavages who sold the island of Manhattan for a handful of beads&quot;. Atlas is a sterile anti-communist manifesto, where the industrial geniuses of the world choose to go on strike to protest against socialgovernment. It is also a venomous diatribe against the weak. No handicapped signs with Rand - let her turn her bile into action and all those who can't help themselves will be gassed. The novel will appealto those who, raised in rural settings through the popular mass media truths of Time Magazine, have gone to college and therefore consider themselves educated. For many, Atlas is the pinnacle of their adultintellectual life. They worship the book because while it looks complex, they can actually understand it. Animal Farm is probably their second-favorite book. Propaganda, as usual, appeals to those who areunable or unwilling to think for themselves. Rand's is very bad propaganda at that, as it doesn't even contain the trace of a counter-argument without which the purportedly objective mind will withhold itsjudgment. If you're a smart capitalist, you will hate Rand for doing such a poor work of expressing your views. Incidentally, nazi-Rand is also fascinated by rape - her women, both in Atlas and in theFountainhead, routinely get violented, and they like it. To her credit, Rand does a better job in the Fountainhead, which is less of a political manifesto and presents an endearing hero in the character of thestubborn Roarke. Rand also writes a nice line when Wynand relates his life and one can tell he doesn't speak about it much by his words which &quot;seemed seldom used, as coins which hadn't passed throughmany hands&quot; (from memory).

An attempt to foist her inane and illogical philosophies on anyone stupid enough to believe anything she says without seeing all the millions of logical holes in every argument she makes. Ayn Rand is a sorry excuse for a philosopher who thinks she is better than every other philosopher out there even though her philosophies are based on things that were disproven by science before she was even born. Worse still, she thinks she knows anything about economy, which she doesn't.People believe this garbage not because it is true, which is laughable, but because they want to believe it, they want to feel justified in thinking they are better than everyone else. In thinking they do everything on their own so they deserve everything in the world as their reward. Newsflash, no one does anything on their own, these people just take what they can from those who really earned it. They think society is a bunch of leeches trying to steal their money when the leeches of society are usually those at the top, not those at the bottom. They think they deserve more and contribute more to society, when all they do is take without giving anything of value, while scientists who further the cause of technology more than anyone else barely make enough to get by. They seem to think the grotesque disparity of wages in modern society is an indication of the worth of an individual rather than the disproportionate distortions of a carnival mirror.Obviously Ayn Rand was dead before she could realize how stupid she was. If she had only seen the current recession she would have realized that letting businesses do whatever they want without government regulation is exactly what got everyone into this mess.Now read this book and laugh at how stupid it is, or better yet, skip it and laugh anyways."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Hello everybody,Iam a Nigerian need to get this Atlas Shrugged written by Ayn Rand but i have go to all the bookshop but I didn't find it. so with atmost good faith i plead to get this book.Even a used one or not.

But I think that the most important aspect of the book--and this is coming from a reviewer who subscribes to nearly ALL of Rand's ideas--had little, if anything, to do with the political aspects of it.Instead, I found the most helpful areas of this book to be the ones concerning personal struggles, where Rand is able to shed a perceptive and refreshing light on issues such as personal struggles and love. Her portrayal of Hank Rearden, and his struggles with the feeling of obligation toward unconditional love for his family in the face of their rabid exploitation of him, is one that provides strength for a reader who may have gone through something similar. The same goes for her portrayal of love, which is quite frankly far and away the most important aspect of this book, in my mind. The author shows love to be a celebration of one's own life and principles, and not the sort of sacrificial and emotionally destructive charity that is so often peddled in literature and film. And don't shy away if you're a romantic, because Rand's ideas on love celebrate it more fully than almost any others out there. Her lovers love each other as rewards for themselves, thus enhancing themselves in the process, and creating positive feedback in the relationship. This is an important idea for anyone who has ever struggled with unrequited or asymmetrical emotions, and I think can go a long way toward helping a reader to forge more meaningful relationships in his or her own life.Frankly, the best part of the novel is summed up in the words of John Galt, in the latter half of the third portion: \\"It's not that I don't suffer, it's that I know the unimportance of suffering. I know that pain is to be fought and thrown aside, not to be accepted as part of one's soul and as a permanent scar across one's view of existence.\\"In many ways, Atlas Shrugged is a reminder to the reader that he or she is important, and that should they earn it then they deserve only the best. Rand has the gall to come out and say it in a way that makes you feel as though she is right, and that you are right as well for agreeing.Even if you know that you do not buy into the political ideas of the book, I would recommend reading it solely for this aspect. I already held the same political beliefs as Rand before I read her work, so I can safely say that my attachment to it has little to do with that stuff.Just don't believe the rabid hype or poisonous criticism. Read for yourself, leave what you don't like behind, and take with you what you do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is fine, but is over 1,000 pages and the print is microscopic...my eyesight is killing me! I have never needed glasses, but probably will after this! I would recommend a different version with at least normal sized print!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every few years I pull out Atlas Shrugged and read it again. Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", I can't stop thinking about the impact thatAyn Rand had toward political thinking in America over the past half-century.A few years ago I also read \\"Age of Turbulence\\" by Alan Greenspan. He wroteit after retiring as the 20-year long Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Inthis book, he mentioned his close friendship with Ayn Rand many times. Ididn't think much about that relationship until after reading Atlas Shruggedand then I realized the importance that Ayn Rand had on economic policy inAmerica, and the rhetoric we hear so often in politics.In this book, the heroes are the captains of industry and the villians arethose in the government. Ayn Rand makes the case, using great verbosity (1200pages of it), that collectivism is the greatest evil of all and that it drainsthe life's blood out of the spirit of individuals who strive to live infreedom. Basically, she tries to prove that decisions made for the good of acommunity (the collective) always step on the rights of individuals and thatthose individuals serve a high moral purpose while the collectivists are onlyrobbers who provide no value to anyone and steal everything.The whole idea of \\"trickle down economic theory\\" seems to have been inventedin the pages of this book because the author believes that unfetteredcapitalism will provide all the great things needed by a just society. Shemakes this argument based on the assumption that industrial competence is thehighest virtue and the very definition of morality. Alan Greenspan tried tomake the same argument in his book but in another way. He said thatintelligent people will never act in a way that is against their own interestsand therefore the world banking community would never create a situation thatwould cause economic collapse. He had to rescind his own argument in front ofa senate panel a few years after making that statement. Ayn Rand did not livelong enough to see the folly of her thinking. She seemed to believe thatAmerica was headed toward Communist Socialism, even though those words werenever used in the book, and that she must save us from this terrible destiny.\\"It is only by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of hislife, or enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals,or compel him to act against his own rational judgment.\\" - Ayn RandThere is an oath taken by those who would achieve the highest place in thislaissez faire world of hers - \\"I swear by my life and my love of it that Iwill never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live formine.\\" In other words, she believes in the pursuit of individual happiness asa means to creating a great economic society. As I read this book, I gotcaught up in this kind of thinking and started believing it myself, because herarguments were compelling. But as I got deeper into the book, I realized whatmade them compelling was not logic of the arguments in themselves, but that Iwas relating to the characters who she had made into bastions of virtue andwas rooting for them more than I was rooting for her great vision. This iswhat we tend to do and this is what Ayn Rand did in her book. She created aset of protaganists who were intelligent, hard-working and willing to takegreat risks. Then she described how these great people were being underminedby a government run by people who could not see their greatness but only theirgreed. And so she created an image of the persecuted and the persecutors andgave this as a gift to the Republicans (the persecuted) to use as fodderagainst the Democrats (the persecutors).It is no coincidence that sales of Atlas Shrugged go through the roof when aDemocratic president is elected. Ayn Rand supported Wendell Wilkie, theRepublican candidate who was running against Franklin Roosevelt. She believedthat she was the only voice in the wilderness who could take up this fightagainst the socialists (the Democrats). She also gave creedence to the ideathat intellectuals were the great enemy of common sense and hard workingpeople, even though she was one of the great intellectuals of our age.Conservative demagogues such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck promote \\"AtlasShrugged\\" as a kind of \\"Conservative Manifesto\\" yet it seems to me thatneither of them probably read the book or know anything about Ayn Rand.Limbaugh and Beck are the darlings of the Christian Right, yet Ayn Rand was afamous aetheist. In the John Galt rant that went on for pages and pages,there were numerous jabs at Christian thinking, especially the idea of\\"original sin\\". This concept is the basis of all Christian thought, so whywould Limbaugh and Beck support this person and her book? Go figure.There is a great division between the Republicans and the Democrats and itseems to be getting worse every year. I believe that this divide becamemuch wider when Ayn Rand wrote \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Funny though, that she wasalso the same person who wrote \\"Anthem\\". This sci-fi short story reminds meof \\"Harrison Bergeron\\", by Kurt Vonnegut. Republicans wouldn't have everheard of him. I think that Ayn Rand was a brilliant person, and if she hadlived to see the folly of her thinking, as did her friend Alan Greenspan, shemay have corrected it in another novel - possibly titled \\"Delusions\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The people who read this book fall into three basic categories:1.People who agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy and are therefore willing to let it's literary flaws slide,2. People who don't agree and are therefore annoyed by its literary failings as well as it's perceived simplicity,3.and people who agree but are sad that Ayn doesn't love religion like they do. You can probably classify yourself into one of these categories right now and while the degrees to which you may feel these reactions is varied they are fairly predictable:1. This book is a revelation, an expansion, or a practical application of your ideals. You will finally see an accurate and beautiful depiction of reality and will be amazed that such a beautiful and insightful book had evaded you for so long. In which case you should probably buy it because it will be a staple of your literary A-team for years to come.2. You will be annoyed by the length of this novel and often wonder if it couldn't have been cut down by 200-300 pages and will feel the need to yell at the book for way oversimplifying complex (apposing) ideas while it allows it's own very unrealistic utopian ideas to run amuck and will often wonder why exactly all socialists/liberals (new age not classical) are idiots and so morally bankrupt. On the flip side you will also find yourself refining your arguments against this ideology and will now have the satisfaction of having a ready made defense against the book ready whenever extreme libertarianism comes up in conversation in which case the library has a copy that is free and you will probably not feel the need to slog through exercise in capitalistic idealism again.3. This is more difficult to classify, but you will probably come away annoyed by the depiction of sex and family in the novel in which case I encourage you to buy it because while much of this book will probably gel with your ideology it will offer enough resistance to your beliefs to constitute rereading and refinement.I (pretty clearly) fall into the second category and can say that while I only really enjoyed the story for the first third, the romance for the second, and the philosophy for none of it that I still think this book has a lot to recommend it; I would not say it was a masterpiece of writing, but as a political tract via fiction it has a lot to offer and the writing is good enough to keep you engaged. You probably know more about your ideology than any own else and are therefore best placed to predict your reaction and so act accordingly, but if you real are making your first foray into the political realm I would recommend starting with something else and working your way towards this book because it's not really a good (or even vaguely unbiased) starting point. Instead start with Aristotle (Ayn's classical BFF) and then maybe get round to rand after some other stops with the greats. All in all, an interesting novel no matter what your affiliations."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I will start by saying I like a lot of what Ayn Rand has to say philosophically. I am not a die-hard objectivist but I do believe most of her arguments against socialism are sound (even if they are made in this novel via absurd parody). That said this novel is quite long, the \\"bad guys\\" look a bit too much like homunculi made of straw, and some of the speeches are as long as they redundant. Based on that it may sound like I hated the book though that is not the case at all. Rand does a good job in taking collectivism/socialism to its logical extreme and showing what a ridiculous, immoral system it ends up being. Her philosophy is extreme and rather unforgiving, but then again so are most. Her basic argument is that the socialist idea of redistribution of wealth is basically the disregarding of some peoples rights (the 'rich') in favor of others (the 'non-rich'). Or the favoring of one group at the expense of another. Since there is no such thing as a right to deprive others of their rights there can be no morally sound \\"redistribution\\". She argues the generally high standard of living enjoyed in post-industrial countries is the result of the businessmen and visionaries of the past and present. She further argues that the only moral position is one of self interest as all other positions turn you into a slave for others and others into a slave for you. As I said, one need not agree with everything Rand has to say, and her history and personality certainly leave much to be desired in terms of a role model, but one need not like the philosopher in order to recognize value in the philosophy. In the end Atlas Shrugged is a look at what would happen if the most productive of our society voluntarily stopped working and we all had to rely on the rest of society for maintenance and advancement. It is an interesting thought experiment and one well worth undertaking."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of those books that will change your life. You will from this point forward divide your life into segments of \\"before\\" [Atlas Shrugged] and \\"after\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As an assignment for my contemporary literature class, I chose to read Atlas Shrugged. And even if this review was not required of me, I believe that the book is still worth the time and effort of a review.The philosophy and ideology behind Atlas Shrugged is very well thought out, if poorly executed. I personally found it to be a bit too long and the content wordy. The passages could drag on for quite a large number of pages while saying quite a small number of subjects. It was sometimes helpful in understanding the meaning of the characters, or the topic's importance to them, but other times it just proved to disrupt the flow of the plot and make one rather distracted.The characters were relatively easy to understand, aspire with and sympathize with, aside from the fact that their development was a bit mysterious. Even if you did not quite understand their plight (as a young girl I could not quite relate to Hank Rearden as well as I could Dagny Taggart), they were nonetheless clear in their standings on situations and their reasoning for being so set in their ways. The ambition shown, mostly by the John Galt Line, is truly astounding in addition to inspiring.Although the book is difficult to 'get into', I would really recommend it for teenagers. At that age, objectivism is considerably appealing and as I stated before, the character's drive to accomplish their goals is very motivating in a time in people's lives that is notorious for its procrastination."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged may be a bit off-putting to many because of its size, but it is an excellent work of literature that not only tells a story but also communicates economic and social truth.Ms. Rand's view includes a belief in a sort of \\"objectivist elect,\\" people that somehow rise above the collectivism that encircles them and live on another plane of existence. Observable reality is that pretty much all business people will accept some government intervention if it suits their bottom line. I'm not saying that's right -- surely it isn't -- but that is my observation.Rand's entire philosophy does not stand or fall with this book, and I recommend it as an enjoyable work of fiction and as a solid communicator of fundamental economics and individual rights."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is possibly the best and longest book I've read. This book inspired me to reach deep down into myself and pull out the best of my ability I've kept down for years. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; inspired me to stop with excuses, stop blaming people, politics, and corporations for my problems and start thinking. I went from a mediocre HS student to an over-average HS student.Though there are some points of her philosophy I disagree, I do agree with her foundations. There three camps of Objectivism. ARI, TOC, Or ARH. ARH for An Rand Haters. After reading this book I can't but help but to look into the TOC. Doesn't matter if you don't agree with An Rand's philosophy, at least did what I did. Let some of the characters inspire you to be the best person you could ever be and to love yourself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this book many times despite its obvious and serious flaws. That's because its good points outweigh the bad. I feel the same way about most of the Jacqueline Susan novels, particualarly Valley of the Dolls.Good points: A woman in charge, good at what she does. And still with time for three lovers! The BEST critique of socialism I have ever read (Jeff Allen's account of the factory). A compelling love affair. No, not the one between Dagny and any of her lovers but that between Francisco D'Anconia and Hank Rearden. An uncanny portrait of a country's infrastructure going to pieces - Eastern seaboard blackout anyone?Weak points: No kids, sick, old or disabled people to worry about. Long, long, LONG speeches from various characters that sound all alike. Character development not too important to author, obviously. No victims of capitalistic system - even guys put out of business by competition win out. No religious beliefs on either side - didn't she have the guts to rebut any such? Religion would have played an even greater part in national affairs when the book was written than now.Some day, just for fun, I might write an updated version of this book with Silicon Valley, Chinese imports and offshoring included. You can bet it will be a lot shorter but no sweeter."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I would say that this book was good. Its writing style in my opinion was fluid. If you read any other book you would definitely notice a difference in wording and general flow of the story. The chapters were all aptly titled and I enjoyed finding out exactly why Rand chose each name of the chapter by reading the chapter itself. The reference to Aristotle in the three books that compose the novel are also a nice touch. The only low points of the book are the seemingly incongrous setting characters. The main character Dagny Taggart will enter a normal setting like a diner and some homeless person will begin talking about how seciety is insane or evil. Typically homeless people are concerned with obtaining food or a place to sleep and not philosophical issues. All in all I will give this book five stars instead of four because the style was truly unique and Ayn Rand's philosophy was woven into the story and characters quite nicely."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Many people find this book disturbing, shocking, and evil. Others declare it the Bible of capitalism. I found it to be very entertaining. Ayn Rand has made a very creative attempt at justifying what so many people today call \\"greedy capitalists\\".There is no doubt she has an incredible mind and there is much truth in what she outlines in this book. However, she has failed to convince me that her philosophy of \\"Mine, mine, mine\\" is a moral one. Rand's view of human beings is objective indeed: they are either moochers or gods. To her, there is nothing in between (a perfectionist fallacy).I recommend this book to anyone, whether they take Rand's words to heart or not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As my title indicates, this has been one of the most meaningful books in my life. It depicts the triumph of human individualism and intelligence over any obstacles. However, as I have been reading these reviews, I have noticed something somewhat disturbing in a few of the positive reviews. A good number seem so enamored with the premise of the book (ie a few individuals left in a world of parasitic sheep) that they seem to want to project this plot onto their own lives.I have seen nuberous reviews lament the sad state of affairs that the world has degenerated to. The book, despite its many truths, does have a tendency to superimpose this point of view onto otherwise sensible people. I think that its pretty safe to say that Ayn Rand, were she living today would approve of our society far more than her own. Think about it: when she lived Franklin D. Roosevelt was president, probably one of the furthest left presidents we've ever had. In addition, just about the entire intellectual elite in those days regarded communism as the eventual goal for the human race, and considered capitalism a barbaric and unfortunate intermediate step. These days, however, the influence of the left has been largely diminished in part due to the increase in knowledge and technology. In her day, many thought that the USSR was the greatest thing since Jesus of Nazareth. Today there fewer creationists and communists both. For these reasons among others, I think that this age we live in is clearly better than the 1930's and 40's when her main works were written. Atlas Shrugged should be taken as a warning of what the dangers of socialism could bring, not proof that we actually live in such a system now as the characters in the book did. We live in the greatest time and place yet in terms of economic and political freedom. If John Galt were here, I think he would be more than happy to live among us."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;I swear -by my life and by my love of it- that Iwill never live for the sake of another man, not ask another man tolive for mine&quot;.This eye openning, thought provoking novel has been absolutely the best book I've read, comparasible only to The Fountainhead. It is an insult to Ms. Rand to declare that she is the founder of a cult or that her books are like bibles to her followers, however I must say that I do admire her, her mind, her brilliance. Her love of man -not mankind- is the most noble, most moral value humans must seek. This book has helped me realize that by negating his/herself a person only achieves to negate life. This is a book for those among us who love the fact that we are alive and want nothing more from other men that to be left alone to act, to think, to live. She shows love between individuals as it must be, if its to be worth anything, as selfish; as a tribute to the other person's values in exchange for one's values. 1168 pages worth every letter.

Atlas Shrugged is a testament as to why. Rand's view on man's nature is compact, well-written, and logical, and the extension to economics is flawless.Her philosophy's only problem, which was not brought up in this book and therefore doesn't affect the rating, is the allowance in honest errors in reason, as opposed to a conscious effort to make mistakes.But, all in all, probably the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A literary expression of communism and socialism taken to their logical conclusions. Ms. Rand answers through her story the question, &quot;What would happen in a truly socialist world?&quot; The answers along the way are scary, and have made me realize vicariously the values of reason, independence, and competition in human society. This is probably the most motivating, and yet the most polarizing book I've ever read. Motivating because it may just give true thinkers the best analogy to the real world as it should never be. Polarizing because it shows the fallacies and frailties that make us human - true heroes know themselves and how to lead others. Marx and Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto, Rand has written the definitive Capitalist Constitution. This is a fantastic story, with many implications for modern life. I only wish I'd read it sooner."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I throughly enjoyed reading Atlas Shrugged. Ayn Rand's clearly and convincingly argued philosophy of rational self-interest has had a major affect on the way I view the world and myself.

As a whole, the uplifting and inspiring plot of Atlas serves as an excellent background for the explication of Ms. Rand's ideas. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in thought provoking philosophy and enjoys fine writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Ayn Rand when her books were published (I'm 81)Didn't think much of her books. A second rate (third?) John dos Passos and I almost fully forgot her.For the last two years or so, I've noticed that Ayn Rand, and particularly \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" has become a bit of a cult icon as so many special effects films do, particularly with younger people. This has become almost fashionable mainly in the economic fora where I am active.So, I decided to reread Ayn Rand again. Maybe I was too young and unprepared when I first read her.I went for her cult book in the Kindle version (with my poor eyesight, paper dazzles me now).I was terribly disappointed. It's even worse than I remembered. She is to dos Passos what the Beach Boys are to Beethoven to confine to popular musical tastes.Nothing to do with ideology; I'm not far from what she advocates although she's a bit too radical for my moderate opinions.But Good Heavens! Good literature is good literature whether you support the ideas therein or not. I hate the cynicism and perversion of Marquis de Sade, but no one writes more elegant French; I'm strongly opposed to just deceased Hobsbawm ideas, but nobody beats him in social analysis.So I'm afraid I'm not an enthusiast of poor Ayn Rand: business was never conducted the way she describes it, technology even less; politics dominated by economic ideals are too shallow, and psychological portraits are too sketchy, too stereotyped.If she's becoming an icon of modern business thinkers, poor world.Please go back to dos Passos and Sinclair Lewis; I agreed far less with their ideas but, heavens above!, they could write."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I won't repeat all the good stuff others have said about this book.

For about my entire life I've felt something is terribly wrong with the Hollywood template of rich evil business guy vs. poor good community organizer guy.

Sorry... you're going to have to read the book to find out. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" became one of my favorites in the 70's when I read it for the first time. It definitely contributed to my view of life, especially as it related to how I thought about my country and where I wanted to help in its continued formation. I read it again recently and it immediately brought me to my past and made me realize how much closer to the author's ideal we used to be. Both times I read the book, it transformed me. I believe this book should be read by every High School student and then later in life as a philosophical refresher. If any novel were ever considered to be a modern American classic, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" would be my first choice. After reading this timeless celebration of individual freedom you'll understand why it is banned in many countries worldwide; and you'll be reinforced with the message of why we should all strive to make sure that it will never be banned in the USA.Ayn Rand is first a brilliant philosopher and secondarily an equally accomplished writer who was able to transport the reader to the logical steps of her beliefs along with the practical ramifications of those guiding principles. While at almost 1200 pages, it is a daunting investment in time; it is also a journey well worth the effort.There are few books I would ever give 4 stars to as a recommendation. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is one of a handful and I believe that most who read it will also share my assessment.

Join the throngs of people who are yearning to find out who John Galt is and why it's important for us to know now more than ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, written by Ayn Rand in 1957, attempts to do two things. One, it seeks outline the tenets of Objectivism, a philosophy based on the principles of capitalism, egoism, and reason. Two, it wraps this philosophy about a 1000+ page mystery novel.The book certainly gets marks for being thought-provoking and, at times, a page turner. The plot itself is complex and multifacted and is filled with political intrigue. The premise -- the mysterious disappearances of major industrialists -- is novel and compelling. The characters themselves, at least early on, are interesting case studies in the notion of the undaunted hero.As the book progresses, however, some of its liabilities become more evident. For one, the pacing of the book is pretty slow at times, especially in the middle third of the book. Particularly long are the didactic rants that some characters engage in, sometimes stretching over several pages nonstop. This is amplified by the fact that all these rants fall into one of two categories -- either the \\"protagonist rant\\" (men earn what they work hard for and those that take it away are looters) or the \\"antagonist rant\\" (rich people are selfish and they need to give up their money for the public welfare). The protagonist rants are typically well-reasoned, while the antagonist rants are straw men of socialist arguments rather than the real thing.This highlights a second problem with the book: the one-dimensional character types. Virtually all the characters fall into either Ayn Rand's version of good (the industrialist and his/her ilk) or bad (the socialist). What's more, nearly every \\"good\\" charater is brilliant and collected and nearly every \\"bad\\" character is incompetent and bumbling. It gets to a point where it becomes obvious quite quickly which new characters fall into each category; protagonists are introduced as calm and collected characters, while antagonists are always screaming or panicking. This serves to make the book's ensemble cast seem more like permutations on a single archetype rather than a diversity of characters.When it's all said and done, Atlas Shrugged ends up feeling less like a novel and more like a political tract, beating readers over the head with the virtues of capitalism and the vices of communism. The repetition gets old after awhile, especially when different characters keep repeating the same tired arguments over and over again throughout the book.I happen to agree with some of Rand's underlying principles, but this book winds up being a bit much. I give it 3 stars because it certainly is ambitious in scope and it certainly is clear on the subject of Objectivism; as literature, though, it seems a bit on the long side."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Incredible Novel - should be required reading for anybody before they are allowed to vote. It was written 50 years ago and yet much of it is still happening today, in more and more severity."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I started reading this based on a co-workers philosophy/infatuation. I found it very engaging at first, and tugging at the emotion of those who feel the system is taking advantage of them. After awhile I became largely bored, but driven on by the hope of some very important message. Overall I liked the expression of thoughts, but I don't share the same ambition to have the pendulum of society swing in this direction. I have a hard time correlating this with all the positives of the society I have been blessed to be apart, and I don't feel that the extremisms of this philosophy have a long term benefit to the human condition.In the end the message was based on a search for a Utopian society that so many before have espoused.

Yes the characters are wooden, the speeches too long, and her world a bit too sterile even for those of us who sympathise with Rand's politics and her critique of egalitarianism. But this is one of the few books that places the creators at the center of human history."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not an easy book for me to review. Despite its verbosity, repetitiveness, and simplification, Atlas Shrugged made me think about the nature of humanity - and the struggle for happiness - in a new and unique way, and for that it should be applauded. It argues for a standard of personal morality based on hard work and ones word, and it's one that I fully agree with. Furthermore, the book provides a window into the thinking of a lot of the \\"James Taggart's\\" that I see where I live (in Los Angeles), which is invaluable. Not many books make me sit down and think and for that I am giving it a high rating.On to the objections:1. Everything is projected in abject black and white - either you're on the side of laissez-faire capitalism, or you're a degenerate looter and moocher. There isn't anything portrayed that's in between - Ayn Rand thinks that you \\"can't have your cake and eat it too,\\" but this is a fundamental straw man argument and doesn't reflect objective reality. There are plenty of honest, hardworking businessmen and women who understand the nature of the society in which they live, and use the much-despised \\"pull\\" to secure their accomplishments - without betraying themselves or their values.2. Ignoring the dangers of monopoly. If a company performs its actions and achieves its objectives better than everyone else, driving them out of business, I have no problem with it. But what inevitably happens without some governmental restrictions on monopoly is stagnation and price increases, suppressing of new competition through local price cutting below cost, contracts with competitors in restraint of trade, and the like. See Standard Oil as a historical example.3. Unrealistic character dialogue. Dagny, Rearden, Anconia, and Galt seem incapable of having a regular, everyday conversation - everything revolves around finding out the truth of objectivism and, once finding it, exorting the wonders of it. This can be straining; there's a lot of dialogue in this 1000+ page book and you'll sit there wishing they talked about other things from time to time.4. Repetitiveness: I will admit that when Dagny left Galt's Gulch, around page 800, I skimmed the rest of the book. At this point Rand had demonstrated what she wanted to accomplish and most of the stuff past here was highly repetitive. Galt's 50 page speech was a prime example of this. Interestingly the buddy who let me borrow this book also had starting skimming where I had.5. Sex bordering on rape. This is a theme in The Fountainhead as well and such fetishtic acts - occuring over and over - seem a little disturbing.Ultimately, people need to be free to accomplish and succeed - and there is no doubt that a capitalistic society is more productive than any other kind, and that the more socialist it gets, the worse off it is -- but I remain unconvinced that complete laissez-faire capitalism is the answer. There needs to be taxes to pay for public roads, for the military, for police and the fire department, and for enforcing limited governmental regulations. I'm also in favor of a very limited social safety net - i.e. unemployment benefits - tied strongly toward the unemployed finding new jobs in a short time frame. However, we've gone far, far beyond these things - Europe today is in a terrible state, slowly collapsing under itself, and unfortunately, the U.S. is slowly following in its footsteps."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Words cannot explain how I feel about this book. This isn't just a book you read, it's a journey to solidify your thoughts and beleifs or to shatter them, depending on who's side your on. It should be required reading for every high school student in America. Do yourself a favor and just read it, you can thank me later. I would like to warn you though, after reading this everything else just isn't the same, and you will drive all your friends and family crazy badgering them to read it until they do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book combines two things: Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy and a story meant to display it.The story was just plain awful. The characters, flat. The plot was predictable. The dialogue was largely replaced with sermons by the various single-faceted characters. If not for the real purpose of the book, I would give it 1 star.As to the philosophy, it has one undeniable trait: it is thought provoking and controversial. Although I found many aspects of Objectivism unrealistic and unworkable, it did change my views on the world. I believe that anything that causes us to reassess our beliefs is inherently good. Unfortunately, I don't think she did a good job of portraying the opposing philosophy in the book. It seemed as if she truly did not understand her detractors.If you do choose to read this book, keep an open mind both of the pros and cons of Objectivism. Otherwise, you'll just be spewing dogma like the people you disagree with."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Over and over in online forums and reviews I have read venomous posts about the book \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" by Ayn Rand. Apparently it's not possible to be indifferent about \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Either you love it, or hate it. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and have reread it multiple times, despite whatever faults it may have.The story line is what keeps me coming back for more (anytime that I have a huge chunk of free time.) This book is much more than just a politically charged lecture, and it has depth that goes far beyond your typical mystery romance novel. Like its predecessor \\"The Fountain Head,\\" the story is engaging throughout its thousand-some pages. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" focuses on Dagny Taggart, who is vice president of the country's largest transcontinental railroad company. It takes place in a world where people have lost all respect for those with skill and ambition, and for this reason, all of the most talented people in America go on strike. All of the most intelligent people start disappearing from industries, and Dagny, as well as the rest of the world, have to figure out how to deal with it. This book has something for everyone, from romance and mystery, to piracy, gun fights, and a bit of science fiction. despite the 60 page soliloquy near the end of the book, summarizing Ayn Rand's philosophy, I could recommend this book for the great story alone.The characters in the story, both the good and the bad, add even more depth to the book. I admit that in the sense that the characters are very clearly either good or bad, they are made somewhat one-dimensional. There are no middle of the road folks in Atlas Shrugged. By this I mean that there are either those who can take provide for themselves, or there are the \\"looters,\\" who rely on others to serve them. This is necessary because it illustrates Ayn Rand's view of the world, and her general philosophy of objectivism. The main character in the story is Dagny Taggart who is converted to the good side throughout the course of the story. She is a unique and compelling character, and she constantly surprised me by stepping outside of traditional cultural norms. Atlas Shrugged also has some of the best \\"bad guys\\" that I've seen in a long time. Each and every one of them had their own way of disgusting or saddening me, through either their foolishness, shortsightedness, or flat out cruelty. These bad guys fulfill their purpose in the story perfectly, by helping us to understand the author's contempt for the \\"looters\\" in our world. The other interesting thing about the characters was the way that they spoke, using deliberate sentences that made most of the heroes seem uber-human. There were times while reading the book that I just wanted them to break down and talk like normal people, and stop being perfect.In addition to the fact that Atlas Shrugged has a brilliant story line and winning characters, it is still a very deliberate defense of Ayn Rand's philosophy. Many people criticize this book for that very reason. It comes across as a not very subtle way of telling us what is right and wrong, and it makes the world seem a bit black and white. This book goes against many traditional Christian morals, for example, the male-female relationships in it are often atypical and maybe even amoral. On the other hand, the book is an ideal defense of American values such as individualism, and capitalism, and hard work. If you want to know more about the Ayn Rand's beliefs before diving into a 1200 page book, (...) However, Atlas Shrugged must be taken with a grain of salt because it was written during a time in which communism and socialism in America were feared more than anything else.This book is different from anything else out there, and I highly recommend it for people of all ages, and all interests. Not only does it have an awesome story, and unforgettable characters, but the worldview that Ayn Rand presents is very alluring. Don't be intimidated by the size of this novel - It's worth it - whether or not you agree with the philosophy it presents."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is Ayn Rand's very interesting novel that supports her belief in Objectivism. You can learn all about Objectivism on the web. She promotes Objectivism in a pure idealistic way in this novel as a faith. In the real world things are not so simple. Objectivism is in part a philosopy about the merits of being selfish so that each person can reach his/her full potential without interference from outside forces. The philosophy teaches that selfish interest provides the motivation to not only enrich oneself but to also enrich the community in which one lives because the interests are so very much entwined."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

Just turn on any mainstream media outlet and you can hear them reiterating the same liberal dogma and demagoguery that characters such as Wesley Mouch, Jim Taggart and Orren Boyle spout throughout the book.

It drew me in right away with its philosophy of individualism and ethical selfishness. Overall it's a super interesting book, unfortunately Rand is much more of a philosopher than a novelist and the book gets boring at parts. There's a lot of telling instead of showing and there are monologues that go on for 50 pages or more making it a very thick and difficult read.

Atlas Shrugged has made me weep several times, long after I've read it. An absolute must-read for any American at this hour of decision, that our country faces."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged imbibes a heroic ethos similar to that of certain other classics (for example Beowulf) in which the protagonist, as the embodiment of an aristocratic ideal, struggles against the forces of darkness--forces that those less valiant than the hero dare not confront. In formulating and writing a compelling drama that does not run out of steam as its plot develops, the author succeeds admirably.The somewhat unusual aspect of Ayn Rand's novel is in her definition of the aristocratic ideal to which the hero aspires. In the Anglo-Saxon epic poemBeowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, that ideal might be defined as duty. In the novelArrowsmithby Sinclair Lewis that ideal is the intellectual integrity practiced by the best of scientists. In Atlas Shrugged, that ideal is explicitly defined as \\"selfishness.\\" In fact, Ayn Rand saw fit to pen a guide to her philosophy entitledThe Virtue of Selfishness (Signet). Perhaps a better name for that to which Rand's heroes aspire would be enlightened self interest.Given that it is the virtue of nominal selfishness that this novel is meant to enshrine and to which its heroes are intended to aspire, its villains are then left with standing for the opposite of selfishness, which is altruism. The type of altruism practiced by these villains, however, would hardly be considered genuine by adherents to an altruist worldview such as that of Christianity. To Christians active in the practice of charity, the villains in this novel would seem like mere straw men conveniently drawn by the author for the purpose of easily illustrating the points that she wishes to make. Indeed these villains are actually con men who trick people in believing in their good intentions using a sort of bait and switch strategy. Rand's heroes, on the other hand, while acting as the embodiment of the virtue of selfishness, actually seem more altruistic than the nominal altruists. Rand's heroes are not seen to immerse themselves in luxury--rather they are consumed with personal achievements that serve the greater good. Nor do they achieve their status by contributing to the war chests of influential politicians or by pawning off shoddy products on an ignorant public.To me, one of the weakest aspects of this novel is in its description of the scientific career of its chief protagonist John Galt. Such a man, who developed both the theory and the implementation of an efficient and inexhaustible source of energy, would be--by far--the greatest scientist and engineer who ever lived. As a professional scientist I recognize that a person such as John Galt belongs in a comic book or comedic parody (or perhaps a truly old-fashioned science fiction novel). As such, he is no more believable than Batman or Tom Swift--or the denizens of the amusing sitcomThe Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season. Similarly the villains have much in common with those in comic books--some even more buffoonish than those who challenge Batman for control of Gotham City.Despite this novel's somewhat simplistic world, where its incadescently beautiful heroes represent absolute snowy white, and its wimpy, slimy, slumping, backstabbing villains represent the disgusting black of the gaping maw of a sewer-like Hell, it does tell a story which has merit. I believe that there is a genuine problem with the formulation of Christianity (and perhaps other religions as well) and its call for self-sacrifice. History and current news both pay witness to examples of the gross hypocrisy of religious adherents--though, in balance, it must be said that the Jesus of the New Testament voices one of the most powerful critiques of religious hypocrisy. It also seems to me that scripture and theology do not adequately explain how the Christian should modulate his altruistic gestures in such a way as to insure his own viability and integrity. Jesus' observation, as to the ability of the lilies of the field to clothe themselves, is not a particularly useful guide regarding how to make one's way in the world.In the end, Atlas Shrugged suffers from the limitations that afflict all ambitious novels, philosophical treaties, religious scriptures, and economic plans: our world is too complex for verbally-formulated solutions, let alone the sophisticated mathematical models that contemporary theory and electronic computing power afford. It is clear that our enhanced ability to predict the weather via computer models, for example, far outstrips our ability to perfect human society. Rand's novel offers a valuable critique of society--but penning such a critique is infinitely easier than formulating, perfecting, and implementing a solution."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a classic book that will make you stop and stare off into space contemplating some of the ideas in it.

Read it and LEARN, America!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this novel three times. I'll read it again.Each time it seems to live in my mind on a grander, higher scale.In interviews and in some of her nonfiction books, Rand has said that the purpose of a novel is to entertain, to tell a good story. In ATLAS SHRUGGED she has accomplished this purpose, possibly better than any other novel. I haven't read every other novel; I don't want to read every other novel, so I won't attempt to say or prove this with certainty. I will say with certainty that ATLAS SHRUGGED is not a good story; it's a great story.Reportedly, Rand's intellectual friends were continually asking her to write her ideals into nonfiction (maybe so they could digest them better); yet her soul lived in stories painting the heroic in life. She believed we live in a beneficent universe and that human beings were meant to achieve great joy, and to feel that joy in every moment.In ATLAS SHRUGGED, Rand proceeded to dramatize (not to intellectualize) her concept of why we have thoughtlessly allowed ourselves to pervert this beneficence, and how to get back on track.Many would say that a 50 page speech, given to the world by John Galt over secured radio waves, is more intellectualization than dramatization. I read that clear radio voice as drama perfectly staged within a well executed plot; I saw it as well earned, actually necessitated, by the complex weaving of multiple mysteries building unequivocally to the dramatic enlightenment presented in that speech.The first time I read Atlas, in 1986, it took me a few months to get through it. It had taken me years prior to that to get past the first scenes of Eddie's \\"causeless uneasiness.\\" I would read carefully to the point of him recalling the magnificent oak tree which was rotten inside, and I'd put down the book. Eddie's gestalt was so depressing and confusing, I couldn't push forward, couldn't go beyond this budding and painful awareness in Eddie, a seeding of consciousness which felt as if it had nowhere, no way to blossom.Maybe I sensed the plot would move slowly, complexly, mysteriously, dramatically ... backward ... into the darkest night of the soul of the human race, before it would be ready to lift into any type of healing light.It took me a while, a bit of growing, to be ready for that backwards, downward soul drop.Yet, when Atlas lifted the reader into Galt's Gulch, I soared.I soared higher than I've been taken by any work of fiction.Is it a great story when an author takes a reader into the bowels of human culture, into the primal, absolute absence of true thought, paints that dank sewer-of-a-world brilliantly with the deepest, richest, most frightening and heart-wrenching color and clarity, then surges the reader suddenly upward on the strongest wings available to an embodied human form? Is that a great story, or what??I'm speaking beyond the airplane ride Dagney piloted to break through to a small setting where a tiny, almost toy-like railroad was a more true-to-life example of that industry than the ugly, gritty, dark world beyond Galt's location.When I say, simply, that there are true CHARACTERS in this book, I might have to set that statement against a contrast which would have to consider that there may be no true characters in any other novel. But, I don't want to say that, exactly. I merely want to exalt as it deserves, Rand's executed skill as a novelist.I love stories. I love characters. I consistently read books I'm able to unfailingly and honestly give 5 Star reviews.But to read ATLAS SHRUGGED is to be temporarily diminished in ability to fully enjoy other novels. This is why I hesitate to read it again right away. The contrast in the depth of characters, the complexity of plot and subplot machinations, the beauty of the mystery which unfolds in pacing so perfect it cannot be called pacing, it must be described as a natural, living sequence of cause and effect, all this honoring of the true form of the story, of a saga, is almost too rich to exist in the same time frame of other examples of human art.Even as I exalt Atlas, however, this time I will be able to return immediately to my culinary cozies and love the heck out of them. Why? That's for me to know and you to find out, if you're interested.For a placement of my customer review of ATLAS SHRUGGED on Amazon.com, I chose the cover of this novel which was taken from a painting by Ayn Rand's husband, Frank O'Conner. He was an artist; he gave a worthy image for his wife's novel.I admire and appreciate every artistic version of this book, every exquisite cover presentation; the book's gestalt has the capacity to draw greatness from anyone who attempts to capture any nuance of it. But, I wanted to honor Rand's husband's contribution to her career as a novelist, a contribution which went beyond what most of her readers would be able to imagine. And I love O'Conner's red sun setting, his glowing, straight steel rails heading toward that day's end. I love the deep greens and iron-rust-red of the sun ball, and more.I will stand, spine straight as possible with arthritis, and salute Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. They lived. They suffered. As all of us, possibly they suffered unnecessarily, as a matter of maturing as a race, as a matter of growing in consciousness about cause and effect. In their art, Ayn and Frank transcended the pain and left us gifted.Live enthralled within this book as a story, as a novel, first. Then begin thinking your own thoughts, making your own living, one you're able to enjoy as who you are, not as Ayn Rand, not as Frank O'conner. As you. A simple person rich in capacity to enjoy the most basic of moments, to feel the grandness of human life in every breath.Remember the perfect flavor of that cheeseburger Dagney relished in the small diner which almost magically appeared on her hardrock route to nirvana. (And you wonder why I love culinaries?)Maybe that's what Rand wanted to accomplish all along. She wanted to give each of us that unique individual inside, terrified of shining, filled with shame (afraid to eat, even). Maybe she wanted to tell us, no, to show us that we have made no Original Sin. We were born free.Now we must each live free, in our own way. And, to be a hero might not mean to conquer impossible dreams which we honestly don't want to reach. Maybe it means to enjoy each day and do what we can to live as who we are, to know who we are. Inside and out. As unique individuals, each unlike any other, yet coexisting with other individuals who are interesting to know in their variety of faces, not masks.Who is John Galt?Who are YOU?I know who I am. Sort of. I'm gaining on the concept daily.Rest assured that life was meant to be abundantly benefic, not a pain in the patootie.For attempting to paint this awareness in words and oils, I thank you Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. Wherever you are (somewhat against your precepts, I believe your consciousness still exists), \\"live long and prosper,\\"Linda G.

A lot of people are turning to it now because of its prescience, but its description of political control and economic collapse are not what's most important (Rand herself, far from aiming at being a prophetess, regarded as one of the novel's strengths the fact that it wasn't even particularly realistic but rather her most fully Romantic work). In an interview with the author of one of the recent biographies of Ayn Rand, Jon Stewart winkingly referred to her novels being filled with lots of \\"dirty, dirty sex.\\" Those are, in fact, the best scenes.

Yet despite thinking that, I figured it had to be a classic for a reason and decided I would get around to it one day. And I will even admit I found must of the first section rather boring. BUT when this novel finally hits its stride, it makes up for any errors.The novel follows the lives of people involved in various industries in a civilization on the brink of collapse. As society moves closer to a socialistic-ish style, the great minds of the country vanish one by one. Dagny Taggart, a railroad vice-president, is desperate to hold onto all she can, but becomes entangled in the conspiracies stemming from an anti-government strike.Heck, if that sounds dry, I must promise it's all so much better than it sounds. There is action, explosions, intrigue--and yes, all that political philosophy you've heard attached to it. In my opinion, the philosophy is tied in well, riding at ease with the rest of this explosive story. The characters are interesting (though extreme), the writing solid, and I must say Ms. Rand knows how to tell a story.Frankly, even if you don't agree with everything (according to various political quizzes I'm quite the Randian and even I disagreed with certain ideas) this is the sort of book that makes you think. And, if nothing else, it's a heck of a story."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I accidentally was connected to the Ayn Rand Center website. My curiosity of who was this Any Rand became obsessive. I also needed to know 'Who is John Galt' and to what extent his role was in this novel. I wasn't disappointed and I found 'Atlas Shrugged' to be a fascinating novel difficult if not hard to put down.The reader who maintains an open mind will be drawn into a world and become part of that sphere of influence only a few have experienced. This book may be fiction but it is closer to the truth then most will wish to admit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have heard about this book for a long time.I finally decided to read this book and was so shocked and amazed!This is an amazing book that truly makes you think!Words can't explain how good this book is!!!This book is so well written and deep! A must read for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my number one all time favorite book. I have read the hard back twice, and have listened to the audio and equal number of times.Getting ready to embrace for a third listen this summer. It encompasses all of the good and bad of what we are experiencing in today's society, politics, and social agendas.It should be required reading for all high school students.... it is in my house.I would argue it is the great novel ever written."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":".....Ayn Rand would have wanted it that way. It is hard to give a review of this book. What can I say that hasn't beens said before? Can I give a review without giving a review of the entire belief system backing up the novel?The novel itself is about a world gone wrong. A world that has gone wrong for a very simple reason: All the people of vision and intelligence are disappearing and without these people society is collapsing. This book attempts, and I think succeeds, in laying to rest the lie of communism that says all people are equal and that the highest level a society can attain is a level where people work for the good of the group and their is no individualism. Ayn Rand shows us that there is no such thing as a group, since a group is nothing without its individual members and that within every group there are people that are responsible for keeping the group going and that those people must be given a higher value and that if left to its own devices society has natural ways of rewarding those individuals.I don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's beliefs. I don't have a problem with religion in general, just unthinking religion. I don't totally agree with her ideas on taxes and wars. I don't even know if I believe in people like John Gault existing outside the pages of her novels.Despite this I do believe myself an objectivist. Why? Because ultimately objectivism is about freedom. Ayn Rand may not like religion or people who put their lives into a religious organization's hands but in a world dominated by objectivist beliefs those organizations and the people who choose to follow them would be left alone but they could not use force to cause another person to join their religion. Ayn Rand doesn't believe in charity but in a world dominated by objectivist beliefs you would be allowed to give away your entire paycheck if you wanted but you could not force another person to give up a penny of their money if they didn't want to. It's a philosophy of freedom and some people are uncomfortable with the level of freedom given.I normally don't do this but I would like to adress something I read in a previous review. There is a very powerful scene in this book where the main character Ms. Taggart is trying to free a friend who has been unjustly imprisoned and tortured by a desperate government agent. She tells a guard to open a door at gunpoint. The guard refuses because he claims not to be authorized. The character tells him he is the authority. He refuses and she guns him down without hesitation or remorse. The reviewer actually said she had a problem with a guard being killed for doing his job and that Ms. Taggart stopped regarding the character as human when he refused. When I read this passage I remember thinking how this resembled a possible incident at a German Concentration camp where a guard claimed to just be following orders. The truth Ayn Rand is trying to show us in this incident is that each individual is the ultimate authority and when you give up that authority to the point that you would participate in the imprisonment and sadistic torture of an innocent person for the supposed good of the state you have sold your humanity."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of the coolest books ever written, not because it uses language in any interesting way (it doesn't), but because it explores a concept that most other books don't: happiness is good.Unfortunately, because of the style Rand uses, it's extremely easy to get caught up in the manner in which a particular point is presented. For example, if you came to any of the following conclusions, you have entirely missed the message:- sharing is bad- only a few brilliant people matter- emotion has no valueAtlas Shrugged is about passionate people engaged in a web of interdependency. Yes, the characters are unrealistic. Yes, the bad guys are one-dimensional. Yes, the book is long and Galt's speech somewhat tedious. So what? The story is engaging and stirs up avenues of thought otherwise drowned out by every other work that implicitly and unknowingly adopts an alternate philosophy by default. Some of the book's central themes include:- you have a right to pursue your own happiness- if it makes you happy to help others, this is a better reason for doing so than because someone else told you to- more can be accomplished by working as a team than by working alone- people and your relationships with them are the most important things in lifeYou shouldn't read this book with an expectation that it will change your life. The book is worth reading because it a) has already changed the lives of lots of other people which is interesting by itself, and b) it is a genuinely good story."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the most incredible book that I, or anyone that I know, has ever read. It proved to me that my way of thinking was not wrong, my value system not deviant, and my philosophy not an abberant production of an 'antisocial' mind. Miss Rand illuminates deep, powerful questions that face individuals perpetually. The plot is woven in a sublime, intricate fashion. When I read this work I forgot that I was looking at pages as clear, blue thought filled my mind and bid me to question myself and my actions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...and believe me, I've read many, many books. Not only is the philosophy illustrated herein the best I've ever come across, but the novel itself--purely on artistic grounds--is the most skillfully written of any I've read. The plot is fascinating, suspenseful and well-integrated (I find some new connection each time I read it)--the characters are well-developed and interesting, and Miss Rand excels at their characterization--and the story is driven solely by the characters; the author refrains from resorting to chance happenings to move her story along. I first read this book at age fourteen, I have read it three more times since, and it never ceases to hold my interest to the point where I have a great difficulty putting it down and going to sleep at night. :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is by far and way the greatest book I have ever read. Writers just don't write with the convictions and ideas that Rand did anymore. While the volume of the book may be intimidating, by the time you get to the end you will wish there was more. A must read and must own. I recommend this for everyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's easy to bash Atlas Shrugged. To mention just a few of its problems, the book is about twice as long as it needed to be, Rand makes the same point again and again and again, her characters are either perfect in every way or utterly despicable, and she apparently had some weird obsession with violent sex.This is not a great novel by any stretch of the imagination.HOWEVER, I have to admit that there are some things Rand does really well, better than any other novelist. Atlas Shrugged is unique in its celebration of the entrepreneur. The book truly makes you feel the excitement of entrepreneurial energy -- the drive that enables certain people to pursue their visions relentlessly and build great companies that provide us with things no one could have dreamt of 100 years earlier. The passions of Rand's heroes infect you with an appreciation of what a person with vision, talent, dedication, and freedom to act can do. And the achievements she celebrates are not what most novelists focus on; rather, they are the achievements of business and industry.This celebration of individual effort is intertwined with Rand's more controversial message -- her attacks on altruism and the welfare state. In Altas Shrugged (as in her earlier novel The Fountainhead), selfLESSness is \\"evil,\\" while selfISHness is the highest virtue. Her message seems to be that people are degraded when they make themselves servants to others. Instead, they should concentrate on developing the highest in themselves, and encourage others to do the same by not giving them a crutch.Whether you ultimately buy that or not, it does make for an interesting thought experiment as you read Atlas Shrugged. Also, while developing that theme, Rand provides what may be the only mainstream fictional demonstration of the unintended consequences of regulation and income redistribution. That strand of Atlas Shrugged is thought provoking, to say the least.There's a certain manic, cult-leader quality to Rand's writing that makes it not good for teenagers and other impressionable folks. But for older people, who can keep her in perspective and can sample her ideas as a refreshing change, Atlas Shrugged can be very rewarding."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book, but after making it through the more than 1,000 page marathon, I'm kicking myself for not having read it sooner.If you're considering reading Atlas Shrugged, be prepared. It's no weekend page flipper. While I can usually tear through a hundred pages at a reading, Rand's writing really makes you evaluate each sentence and challenge your perceptions. Don't read this unless you're prepared to not put it down for a few weeks and critically challenge your beliefs and perceptions. I found myself reading two or three pages, then setting the book down to really think it through for hours (something I'd usually never do for a work of fiction!).Rand's writing can also be tiresome at times... such as Galt's nearly 100-page radio address. Even more tiresome is how depressingly, exhaustively extended the persistance of some of the characters is. Yet, in retrospect, this process seems to work, illustrating how in real life, we too tend to continue down the wrong path way to far.Finally, if you're interested in objectivism, Atlas Shrugged is a great place to start. It is rich with the metaphors Rand uses elsewhere and introduces the reader to the foundation of the study."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I once came across a notice on a church bulletin board that read: &quot;If you need a helping hand, check out the end of your sleeve.&quot; I don't know where they took that quote from, but it could have come straight out of Ayn Rand. Whether or not you agree with Rand's politics or her philosophy, you have to admit she is one terrific storyteller. Rand gives us a world set in a decade we can only guess at, in which the nations have become &quot;People's States&quot; and the United States has grown bloated and ineffectual with the code of &quot;collective responsibility&quot;. Standing agianst the coming crash are a few intrepid industrialists whose philosophy is from each according to his ability, to each according to his output, never mind his needs; led by the enigmatic figure of John Galt, who threatens to stop the motor of the world -- and does. Rand has come down as an apostle of selfishness and her socialistic villains are so evil as to defy belief; but she makes a convincing case for the need for people to think and act for themselves rather than surrender their brains and their integrity to a governmental authority. The sheer size of this book has intimidated some readers, but Rand knows how to capture our interest and hold onto it through almost twelve hundred pages. You may not agree with all of her premises, but she has combined some interesting characters and a fascinating plot into a really great book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a must-read. While sometimes wordy, everything written was done so with care, and even the &quot;long speeches&quot; of which she is denounced for are interesting. This is a good look at a way of thought not popularized on television, the radio, in government, or even other books. It isn't a long standing seller through a quirk of fate.The book is not too long at all, as some might lead you to believe. This book was intended to give a world-view of what's wrong in today's life. This is no small feat, to say the least. I have read many negative remarks about both this book and her philosophy, and let them continue to say such things. Les Mis is considered great, too, but I couldn't stomach it. I couldn't even watch the movie. If you like philosophy, melodrama, and thought-provoking literature, then there is no way you should pass this up."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have spent years studying in school and have read thousands of books. It was only after I finished college that I read Atlas Shrugged. I wished that it had been required reading. Unfortunately most campuses are staffed by liberal looters. This book is one of the most eye opening and life changing experiences I have ever had. If you are looking for intellectual guidance or an injection of adrenalized ambition, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Many other people have written detail analysis and opinions of this book. I will brief by comparison. Simply read this book, it is worth your time and worthy of thoughtful analysis.The story is fiction, but by many accounts you want to believe the characters are real. Rand writes from an idealized point of view where heroes hold on to their beliefs and the villians eventually crumble. Many have discussed the pro-capitalist view point of the book, but there is a more important fundamental that is a string of continuity from start to finish and that is the importance of thinking. The act of engaging in actual analytical thought, questioning the status quo and standing up against anyone who endorses simply following the herd."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Firstly, this is a sturdy paperback that I am very rough with and have had no problems.Secondly, this book is becoming more relevant every day. Her power of premonition is scary. There are also characters that remind us that the human ability to work and create still exists. These characters remind us of the struggle against nature that has occurred generically for thousands of years, and more recently in the United States."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let me make this just as simple as I can. Rand opened up a world of wonder as unique as Columbus' discovery of his new western world in 1492. We all only wish we had the creativity, advanced learning and IQ of the literary economic giant we simply can Ayn."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Considered one of the two most influential books, the Bible being the other. The story presents a compelling glimpse into Ayn Rand's philosophy. It causes one to stop and re-evaluate how we view values, virtue, good, passive acceptance, etc. I read newspapers and view national events differently as a result of reading AS. So many events today are almost a replay of AS.I am on my second reading and finding that I am getting as much more out of it the second time as the first. The reader, Mr. Brick, is fantastic.I definitely recommend this book and this audio version."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In Atlas Shrugged, which is published by Dutton, the content being published is fantastic, as Ayn Rand intended. The general errors in printing, however, detract from the \\"Atlas Shrugged (Centennial Ed. HC) (Hardcover)\\" printing. A number of pages have characters that are cut off at the margins, leaving one decipher what they are. Truthfully, this does not detract from the reading experience, since Rand wrote so well, but only serves as a frustration to the publisher Dutton.As I wrote in my review of 'The Fountainhead,'\\"It is unfortunate that one cannot rate the author, publisher, and the distributor separately. In such a system, Ayn Rand would be five stars, Plume would be one star, and Amazon.com would by five stars.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was sucked into this story from the first page onward. What I had anticipated as a tome containing dry comparisons between the 'producers' of society and its 'looters' was really a fantastic story that intertwined the motivations of each of the characters into an enjoyable plotline. This could really have been divided into 3 separate novels and been just as enjoyable. The one aspect I wish she would have covered in the story would be the potential policies that would have allowed the characters to be successful at the end. We're left to assume that there is a happy ending, but no real discussion is given of its results.It definitely provides a thought provoking set of ideas that can be used for further discussion among rational and pragmatic adults."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After catching a review in the Wall Street Journal, this book made my list to read. It is intimidating at close to 1100 pages of small print, but I am glad I gave it a go. It is an engrossing story that held my attention. Rand tends to get a bit preachy at the end. There is a 50+ page monologue by one of the main characters that quite frankly could have been said in about 5 pages and doesn't add much to the point she is trying to make. Overall I would recommend the book but you have to be willing to commit a good bit of time to getting through it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'd first read Atlas Shrugged more than 40 years ago and never thought that insanity of government would come to pass. Little did I know just how topical and appropriate her premise would become in 2009. Her writing style is not particularly appealing to me but her concepts and conjectures are. I wish I could say that it's an enjoyable read, but I don't believe that it is nor that it was intended to be. The word \\"harbinger\\" kept ringing in my head as I read this."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is amazing.

Raise my rating to six stars!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Critical judgment of Rand's controversial novel must ultimately depend on the reviewer's standards of criticism. For those who are sympathetic to Rand's general philosophic view, &quot;Atlas&quot; must be given hard marks--that much all fair-minded individuals can agree upon. Admirers of Rand who, for some reason or another, have never read this work, hardly need a critic of Rand like myself to tell them they ought to look the thing over. There are plenty of Randites who can fulfill the office of recommending &quot;Atlas&quot; to other Randites. But what about those who are not admirers of Rand and who do not sympathize with her philosophical views? Should they take the trouble to read Rand's massive tome? If Rand's admirers are correct in their view that &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a great masterpiece, we might think that anyone seeking to be well-read ought to add &quot;Atlas&quot; to their reading list. But suppose this is not the case; suppose &quot;Atlas&quot; is not one of the greatest novels ever written. If so, it would be a waste of time for any non-Randian to read it. It is this question that I will address in this review. Should non-Randians read &quot;Atlas&quot; because it qualifies as great literature? Or should they avoid it precisely because, as literature, it fails?If we examine &quot;Atlas&quot; solely on the grounds of literary criticism, rather than as a work of philosophy or propaganda, I believe that our verdict on the work must be largely negative. I say this, not because of the glaring weaknesses in the novel's characterizations and its painfully artificial contrivances of plot (although these certainly are serious enough problems), but because of a far more serious defect that towers over purely technical concerns. I have in mind the prevailing attitude which the novel projects, an attitude of blistering, passionate hatred towards anyone who disagrees with the ideas which the novel seeks to propagate. Rand was passionate not only about her ideas, but also about those who had the temerity to differ with her on any significant issue. This passion is present on nearly every page of the book. Anyone who disagrees with Rand can hardly miss it. In the seventy page speech by the novel's hero toward the end of the book, it practically leaps off the page and grabs the offending reader by the throat. If you don't care for Rand's ideas, you would have to be a masochist to read this novel.This is why the praise of the novel by Rand's admirers is misleading. Since they agree with Rand, they don't notice the degree to which she abuses those whose views differ from her own. Lacking in empathy for anyone who has the gall to think differently from Rand, it never occurs to them how offensive &quot;Atlas&quot; is to the nonbeliever. But it is a plain fact to any non-Randian who has trudged his way through its eleven hundred pages of hate. Now it should be obvious to any cultured individual that any novel which projects furious, unbridled hatred towards those who do not agree with its author can hardly be regarded as a work of great literature. You look at any great novel--say, for instance, Tolstoy's &quot;War and Peace&quot; or Drieser's &quot;Sister Carrie--and you will find that disagreement with the author's political and moral views do not in any serious way compromise enjoyment of the novel. Tolstoy was a pacifist and Drieser a communist; but you don't have to be a peacenik or a commie to get something out of reading &quot;War and Peace&quot; or &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; But unless you are sympathetic with Rand's Objectivist philosophy, you will get nothing out of reading &quot;Atlas&quot; except a massive rhetorical whipping.For this reason, it is really quite beside the point whether &quot;Atlas&quot; has a good plot or is well-written or demonstrates a high-level of literary excellence. As a novel, it fails because it breaks one of the cardinal rules of great fiction: it promotes hatred and contempt rather than insight and understanding. It is a great work, not of literature, but of philistinism and darkness. Whitaker Chamber's, in his notorious review of Rand's novel, tried to capture the attitude Rand projects towards dissenters with a metaphor that has ever since enraged the novel's admirers. &quot;From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged,&quot; Chambers wrote, &quot;a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber--go!'&quot; While I can understand the outrage of Rand's partisans at this remark (they make the mistake of taking it literally), if you understand exactly what Chamber's was driving at, you will realize that, far from slandering the book, Chambers has merely used a metaphor to more vividly describe the prevailing spirit of the novel. And although Rand certainly would have opposed literally sending people to gas chambers, it is clear from the tone of the work that she desired some kind of awful punishment to be visited upon those who dared to resist her message. But books written with this kind of scathing hatred and contempt for humanity are not worth the trouble of reading. &quot;Atlas&quot; will long remain a favorite work for those who admire the author's ideology. But as for the rest of us, we must regard the work as a curious abomination, not fit to be read as literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand appeals to our basic selfish instinct: The strong succeed, the weak leech.That premise is the bulk of her intellectual prowess and many many years ago I found it interesting and alluring. Yet, with maturity, comes a better sense of how this world works.Regardless of all the political focus Rand seems to be getting lately, as a literary work this novel is mildly entertaining two-thirds of the way through and then falls apart. Then it's not about story or plot, it's about indoctrination. It's about propaganda. Okay, that's fine for the pulpit. But really sucks for a novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A mesmerizing first 700 pages make it well worth reading - But despite its seductive vitality, a morbidity lurks underneath.Her depicition of the collapse of society is grandiose and disturbing - and as epic fiction that aspect is a success.But her characters are superhuman to the point of being suspect. Should we identify with them, or worship them? Should we also worship Ayn Rand?So I wonder :Is this novel just a massive revenge fantasy?Or is it her bloated, massive effort to cover up her own ultimate mortality and fallability?One thing it is not, is a celebration of the mind. No celebration of the mind would slice reality right down the middle so bluntly in order to produce a black half and a white half. If you want a real manifesto for rational thought, read Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World. You will cry tears of wonder.I still rate it highly because it will test your personal convictions. Will your worldview survive a 70-page speech by John Galt? Will your values resist this monstrous tower of words? Mine did. And I feel stronger for it. So I am glad I read it.As fiction it is thrilling and incredibly suspenseful. But it's also a fear-ridden nightmare masquerading as love of life. It is manipulative and megalomanical, and in my personal opinion, ultimately juvenile. And it was a new experience for me to see a juvenile worldview presented with such authority, eloquence, and conviction. Beware."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I offer a rousing (although slightly exhausted) cheer for Ayn Rand's magnum opus. This nearly 1,200 page monster novel will try your endurance, but it is well worth the effort. In its pages is expounded Rand's objectivist philosophy as it plays out in the lives of her several chief protagonists and their relentless foes. For the sake of brevity I will avoid a discussion of the plot and other technical aspects of the story, as these have already been fully exposited in the many hundreds of preceding reviews. Instead I will limit my commentary to general impressions and applications of Rand's thinking.I must say up front that there is much about objectivism with which I agree, at least in its practical outworking. There is also, however, much of that philosophy to which I, as an evangelical Christian, do not subscribe. Like all purely materialistic worldviews, it is grounded, I believe, on certain presuppositions that provide a rather shaky foundation. Rand does not seek to answer fundamental existential questions like the origins of matter and of life. She merely takes these as a given and builds her intellectual framework accordingly. I also do not concur with her philosophy of unbridled egoism, which directly conflicts with my understanding of God's design for human relationships, although I do agree that all people should strive for excellence in all areas of life. Finally, her assessment of religion in general, while justified in certain respects, paints with too broad a brush, in my opinion. For her to lump true Christianity in to her sweeping condemnation of religion displays a deep-seated ignorance of true Christianity (as compared to various distortions that are often labeled as Christian).Nevertheless, I find a great deal of overlap in the practical outworking of Rand's worldview with mine. As both a Christian and an intellectual (the two are, in fact, not mutually exclusive), I find that Rand's insights into the heart of man are extremely accurate. She expounds both with great vigor and incisive clarity just what is going on deep in the core of the human psyche. She and I start at different points in our consideration of the subject, but we reach many common anthropological conclusions.Her politics are essentially libertarian, and her economic philosophy is unmistakably laissez-faire capitalism. These two factors alone will cause many politically liberal readers to reject her work out of hand. Her heroes are driven, ruthlessly competitive industrialists. Their foils are emotion-driven, \\"progressive\\" socialists. No one can possibly miss Rand's political and economic message, which is informed by her deep-rooted animosity toward Stalinist-era communism. Interestingly, this novel carries a cautionary, and indeed eerily prophetic, message for the modern age of Obama. It is as if Rand looked 50 years into the future and foresaw the very political and economic conflict that is raging in America today -- the death struggle between capitalism and socialism, between a fundamentally Marxist worldview and that of Adam Smith or Milton Friedman.Rand's philosophy aside, my critical assessment of the novel consists in three essential areas. First, her characters tend to be hyperbolized. Her heroes (most of whom just happen to be objectivist philosophers) are larger than life. The true titans of industry and finance that she seeks to idealize are probably most comparable to Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller and Morgan. Likewise her villains, while recognizable from modern analogues, are whinier and more contemptible than real life. Second, the story is longwinded and a bit redundant. She spends 1,000 pages laying out her philosophy in narrative form, and just in case you missed it in the first thousand pages, she repackages it ad nauseum in the endless radio address. That was one chapter I was glad to finish. Finally, the end of the story was a bit predictable and more than a little anticlimactic.Overall I would characterize this novel as a must-read, not necessarily to make us all objectivists, but to understand the practical implications of her frequently insightful philosophical views, and to take warning about the ramifications of punishing the achievers and the producers in our society. She clearly expounds the paradox that those who are most \\"selfish\\", that is, those who pursue their self-interest with the greatest fervency, do the most good to society as a side effect, while those who make the most noise about wanting to benefit society through \\"selflessness\\" actually end up doing it the most harm. You may not agree with all Rand has to say (I don't), but you will be challenged and, I believe, you will benefit from being exposed to her ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My father and I have been mentioning this book to each other about once a week as we observe what's going on in the economy right now. For example, the propping up of failed businesses, the strangling of the free market, the worship of government to solve problems instead of emerging creativity from the private sector....yep, sounds like Atlas Shrugged!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The first thing that I would like to note about the negative reviews is that there always seems to be disparaging remarks about the length of the book, over 1000 pages. Essentially, these reviewers are saying that Ms. Rand is belaboring her points. Well, the idea is to make you THINK about what is being said. It took me six months to read this the first time through; it was like a very rich meal that I took in courses. I recommend other readers consider doing the same.I just read Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett at nearly 1000 pages. According to many of the negative reviewers, Mr. Follett must have been belaboring his points about building cathedrals and surviving the tyranny of 13th century Europe (which, by the way, was the logical result of a Christian philosophy, fully applied).To go on, many of the positive reviewers have done a great job of talking about some of the intricacies of the plot. What I would like to talk about is the significance of the philosophy in the character development. The heroes and villians are often described as cartoonish and one-dimensional because no one could be so idealistic; either to the positive or the negative. I disagree. Being from Northern California and currently living in Seattle, I am aware of many, many people that have devolved into the kind of creatures that Ms. Rand describes in her characters of Wesley Smoot, James Taggart and Betty Pope. Walk through the streets of Seattle or San Francisco and it is also easy to pick out the sullen, depressed, dismal faces of the nameless crowds she describes that cry out for the perverted \\"social justice\\" that society is currently idealizing.I also know a few--a very few--of the Dagny Taggarts and the Hank Reardens and the Francisco d'Anconias of the world. They keep my hope for this world alive. And they have something in common. If they are not already explicitly Objectivists, when I describe the basic tenants of the philosophy (its really very simple to understand, with layers that are simply iterations of the three axioms upon which it is built) the singular response they give is \\"What else would you believe?\\" Really, those are the ones that give me the most hope. I've met two.Keep in mind that this book was named as the second most influential book in the United States (after the Christian bible) in a survey conducted jointly by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress. What that says is that the leaders and thinkers of this country are adopting this code or at least considering it important, whether they agree with it or not. If you would like to be a leader or a thinker, I suggest you hop on the bandwagon.David BatsonTrader"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"According to an earlier edition of \\"The Norton Reader,\\" the Roman philosopher Telemachus was supposed to have said, \\"A big book is a big misfortune.\\" It's a generality, alright, but Mr. T. would have recognized \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" right away.If you are familiar with \\"The Fountainhead,\\" you've already met the uber-architect Howard Roark (think Frank Lloyd Wright with a dash of Mike Hammer), the intellectual neurotic Dominique Francon (think Rand herself), and the noble and gutsy businessman Roger Enright (think Howard Hughes). In \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" Rand has left the neuroses mostly to the lesser characters. Dagny Taggart, Ms. Railroad, is Dominique after a life time of analysis and treatment. She retains, however, Dominique's love/hate relationship with love and sex, though it's more like love/neglect/ignore. Hank Rearden, the man of steel (actually Rearden Metal) is basically Howard Roark blended with Roger Enright.In this novel, Rand envisions a near future where most of the world has succumbed to the fate she dreaded and despised, creeping socialism. There is a People's State of Mexico, a People's State of England, a People's State of France, you get the idea. Our own beloved USofA is beginning to swing in that direction, and the business-builders and job-makers like Dagny and Hank find themselves squaring off against the forces that want to level the playing field of the economy essentially by flattening the economy.If you're tired of, or disagree with, Rand's Objectivist/capitalist dialectic, you might as well give this one a pass. I personally feel there's a pretty decent soap opera here, with the sort of protagonist we don't see nearly enough, a strong, intelligent and determined woman, who knows what she wants, and doesn't give a damn what others think. The problem is, that soapy tale is buried in an anti-\\"Das Kapital\\".I can't imagine anyone reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" for entertainment. Maybe we could get William Goldman to do a \\"good parts\\" version, a la \\"The Princess Bride.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An absolute masterpiece. It is the capitalist manifesto. You will read things in this book that you have never read before. Examples-\\"Money is the root of all good\\", Robin Hood is bad, never live for the sake of another...

It, and its author, have been vilified and deified. Reviewing this book is as challenging as it was reading all 1168 of its pages. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is truly a &quot;piece of work.&quot; It is a triumph of philosophy, much more so than the quintessential &quot;great American novel.&quot; The greatness of this book is in its ideas more so than its literary value. Rand is not a writer on par with Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, or Thomas Wolfe. However, she is a visionary, like her hero, Aristotle. Her fans are fans of her vision, not just her words, and she has spawned millions of them over the years.&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; was Ronald Reagan's favorite novel. It was the most influential book William F. Buckley, Jr. ever read. Obviously, this gives away its premise, which is conservative in nature and therefore anathema to liberals and the literary establishment they control. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and Rand herself were shoved into second-tier status by college professors and bookstore chains, but long before talk radio, she proved that conservatives win in the marketplace of ideas. Her works have been international best sellers for decades. Clubs, forums, seminars, web sites, and chat rooms devoted to Rand have given her legions of loyal supporters a chance to ask and get answers to the many, many questions that her novels have inspired. For years, Rand toured the country, delighting audiences who seemed to literally worship her. Following her own novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and influential non-fiction books &quot;God and Man At Yale&quot; by Buckley, and Whittaker Chambers' essential &quot;Witness&quot; (1952), &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; gave impetus to the conservative movement, which broke from the Rockefeller wing of the Republican party to launch Barry Goldwater's Quixote-like 1964 campaign; eventually the Reagan Revolution; and finally the sea change which promises to make the first half of the 21st Century an era of unparalleled American power.Steven Travers is the author of &quot;Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman&quot; (www.sportspublishingllc.com).

If you cherish reason and thinking then you will be astounded by where Rand will lead you. If you love mysticism, ghosts, goblins, angels, devils, and gods then do not waste your time here. This is a book for those who believe in self responsibility and not for those who suck the blood from others to survive."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Never have I read such a book that expresses so clearly what is wrong with the world and how those who fight for what is right struggle to overcome their incompetent inferiors. This is a story of good vs. evil that deals with the ideas that hard work, a sharp mind, dedication, etc. are the only ways to live life. This is a story of how those who are lazy, those who are looters and moochers of other people, try to stop those who fight for what they believe in, fight for the right to use their minds to do great things, fight for the right to fullfill all the potential that they possess. The characters in this book are amazing, and they are true hereos in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For anyone who has pondered seemingly complex issues like social security, welfare, environmentalism, or &quot;social responsibility,&quot; this book is essential reading. Whether you are devoutly religious or socialist, or a capatilistic business guru, Ayn Rand's presentation of objectivist epistemology will enlighten you. Furthermore, a suspensful and intriguing plot prevents this book from become another dry philosophical textbook."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you have ever wondered at the behavior and motives of those who enjoy hurting others and holding them back, this book will give you some insight. The basic theme of the book is that an evil exists in people and society. This evil is understood by those who embrace it and use it but is not understood by those who suffer from it. The growing comprehension and understanding of this evil by the &quot;heroes&quot; of the book may help you understand what drives people you encounter. While this book gives only a partial answer to coping with this evil it does at least help you to understand it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Perhaps one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. Amazing depth, great story line, thoughtful characters, and a provocotive philosophy. A must read for every American citizen who wishes to understand the basic tenants of capitolism. Caution, if you are a modern day liberal, it may change your philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is the most fantastic book I have ever read. In this novel Rand puts her objectivist philosophy into action. What transpires is a novel that shows her ideas about the power of the individual and reason. However, the book is also a fantastic read, it is easy to get caught up in the story and only later realize what Rand was exemplifying. This is one of the few books I have ever read that has had a direct and lasting effect on the way that I think."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As probably one of the few Ayn Rand fans who is NOT an objectivist, I believe I have a unique perspective. Her writing is excellent, but her style is a little too reminiscent of that of her hero Victor Hugo. In other words, although I'm sure it's all in there for a reason, the book itself probably could have been cut down more than a little, making it a more succinct read. Also like Hugo, her &quot;revolutionary&quot; character makes a speech of 10+ pages (compare Enjolras from _Les Miserables_ to Galt, or even Roarke in _The Fountainhead_). This similarity does not detract from the work itself, but is quite noticable and may distract the reader.The characters are, I believe, the most vivid she ever created. Dagny, particularly, is probably one of the most complex and interesting literary creations I have come across. Her personality, actions, thoughts--all are documented, and worthy of study. What I do not understand, however, is why in this book, _The Fountainhead_, AND _We the Living_ , her main female character has relations with all of the &quot;good&quot; main male characters. Now, Rand was into man-worship; however, this is more than a little silly. I'm not saying it couldn't or shouldn't have happened; it is just an odd pattern.It is the relations between the characters in _Atlas Shrugged_, and the relationship of the characters with themselves, I think, that makes it such an enjoyable novel. Rand delves into the thoughts of the protaganists beautifully, and exposes their inner workings in a unique way.As a whole, the book is enjoyable. However, it must be remembered that Rand was writing for a particular time and place; she had left a rapidly deteriorating Russia (as per her semi-autobiographical description in _We the Living_) and so had very strong feelings against communism and the like. So of course Rand is all for laissez-faire capitalism, and considers the intrusion of government into economics a complete nightmare.This book, while a literary masterpiece, w! as also an outlet for Rand's political views; and it is advisable that one takes this book with a grain or two of salt. Myself being a middle-of-the-road person, I had little problem digesting and enjoying this book while understanding why the politics were the way they were. If one is open-minded enough to listen to Rand's set of views, even if one does not agree with her, _Atlas Shrugged_ is certainly worth the effort."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If I had to sum this book up in one word it would be epic. The story from start to finish is mind blowing. Ayn Rand has a way of creating an alternate world of her own and then drawing you into it with her. Although it does have it's short comings (For instance the caracters are either one way or the other, no grey area. And the grey area is where about 95 percent of the worlds population live. And although she has many valid arguments, she isn't right about everything.) they pale in comparison to the overall scope of this book. The best book i've ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Who is John Galt? Ayn Rand seems to have a way of calling to her readers in the first sentence of all of her books. To me, when I first read that line, I wanted to know who John Galt was. That simple reason was why I was so drawn in. &quot;Atlas&quot; was suggested to me by a close friend, I had never heard of Ayn Rand at the time, and when I went to the store and saw how long it was I was a little leary. I bought it any way and read it in about a month. This was the first book that ever said what I was thinking. I directly connected with Dagny Taggart, because I feel that in a way everyone is Dagny, some people just never realize what that means. All through the book I was always realizing a little bit more about the America. It all makes sense, and I think everyone should read it, it will change them forever. I feel lucky I read it in 8th grade and picked it up again in 10th. When I first read it I was picked one a bit at school, but that didn't even phase me because they were acting like James Taggart, and I was Dagny. I would recommend all of her books to anyone, at any age."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This stunning, fictional look at the potential demons of bureaucracy and social dogma is a lasting commentary on the weakness of the masses. Never mind the lengthy monologues and verbose expression of simple ideas. This book is a must read for all. Agree or disagree with the underlying message of the book, but do not be afraid of it. This book will help anyone with any type of open mind to reflect on our world and the policies of bureaucracies (looters) and the gutlessness of the masses (moochers) that make the bureaucracies possible. Amazing number of reviews tells me that this is one well-read book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"God bless Ayn Rand, tho her destiny is already settled with Him. There seem to be those who hate them both, hate her &amp; &quot;love?&quot; Him, hate Him and love her (herself included), and love Him but like her for speaking some important truths about human freedom, dignity, and creativity, and only wish that she could have come to peace with Him. ATLAS SHRUGGED is her Gospel &amp; Apocalypse with Galt as her Christ. It is valuable, compelling, even necessary to understanding much of the modern turmoil, but it falls short due to its virulent atheism, contempt for the ordinary, and deification of the creative &amp; industrious people (who are still in reality, all too human). Great Myth, thought-provoking reading, but not on a level w/ God's Word in Christ &amp; the Bible."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand stated quite well what my own beliefs are today. I wish I would have read it when I was younger. I enjoyed the book. The story was great. But....it was too long. At times her preaching was too much. I found myself thinking \\"I Know Already!\\".I would hope to see a movie made based on this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"OK, OK, so that's a pretty presumptious title. How about this: Atlas Shrugged is the one story everyone should read before they die -- preferably when they are old enough to understand the lessons, but young enough to apply them to change the world. I've read the 1000+ page story twice and can't wait for my next visit to Galt's Gulch.Rand ties together a grand, entertaining adventure story, a philosophical analysis of conflicts between society's producers and consumers, and a manifesto on self-awareness, love and pride. If you let it, this book will change the way you look at life and local/world events.The story might be easier with a different writing style -- Rand can be incredibly detailed and long-winded. However, some of its lessons come from the precision of feeling she describes and the stepwise logical progressions she unfolds.Get the book, get used to Rand's style over the first 100 pages and then hold on for a fun and rewarding journey."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book changed my life more than anything else I have ever experienced. I read the 1000 pages in two weeks, and when it was over I only wished it had been longer- and then i proceeded to read it again. Ayn Rand is truly amazing, and although her critics do have good points on some issues, it doesn't undermine the fact that she is well-written, and in my opinion could convince anyone of anything. (Well, anyone who is open enough, and has the ability to comprehend what she is saying.) This is a serious novel that I think all intellectuals will enjoy. It may be out-dated, but her characters can still be role models even in today's world. I laughed, I cried (out of happiness), and I recommend this book highly- it is my favorite."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I listened to an audio copy of this book. I don't know how anyone could read it - even listening to it took a very long time.I think this book is brilliant at showing the faults with the philosophical system some people employ. I enjoyed the story very much. Ayn Rand is very good at subtle imagery and hidden context. The scenes are described in such detail that you feel you are remembering a movie you have watched. And there is a reason the main character is in charge of a rail-road. I thought that was obvious, but from some other people's comments perhaps not.I feel that every business person should read this book. This book champions capitalism like you have never heard it before. It make is obvious that communism, or more to the point socialism, would never work. When I found that Ayn Rand is from Russia I thought &quot;Ahh, well that explains a lot.&quot;It also champions the use of logic and reason. Something that is in short supply these days!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book no less than five times. While Rand and I differ on our ideas of a higher power, I admire her courage to put into words what most productive, self-driven people think every day as they drive to work. What would happen if all the productive, thinking people of the world were to simply...disappear, leaving the world to be governed by mediocre bureaucrats? This book does a great job of illustrating just that. The first time I read this book,it almost killed me, due to the length, and I didn't get a lot out of it. Later, an older and wiser me was able to glean much from the subtle ideas portrayed here. I won't say this book changed my life, because I was a card carrying Libertarian long before I grasped its meaning, but it helped mold and reinforce ideas I already held. Read it with an open mind, and take what you can from this thought-provoking prose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For years, I was told that one would completely resonate with this book or be disgusted by it. As you can tell by the reviews, this is very true. I resisted reading this book for many many years, maybe because of the drama surrounding it. I read it a few months ago for the first time.Loved it. Not only that, I consider it one of the most important books I have read. It helped me make some very sucessful busniess decisions with a clear mind and conscious. And I found the story to absolutely riveting.I must say that I found the concepts related in this book more pertinent today than they were 50 years ago when it was written. People have more excuses today for lack of excellence than ever. The United States of American is becoming more socialist daily. All the redundancies and incompetencies that come with socialism have become a way of life. Most people are not aware of this as they have accepted it as the way things MUST be. Rand, without any subtlety states: Things do not have to be this way.They don't. The split of those that believe in creating excellence and those that believe they are entitled to the fruits of other's labor is growing still. It didn't happen as fast as Rand depicts, but it is happening just the same. I chose my side before reading Atlas Shrugged. The book was a welcome affirmation of that choice."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"look, if you want to read a novel on the dangers of creeping statism ,then buy this book. It describes through the eyes of its characters how one government decree produces results that \\"warrant\\" another ,on and on till nothing is left of wealth or freedom. That said, the dialogue is corny ,the sex is ...weird ...This book is a polemic first, a novel second. If you agree with the point you'll love it . I have read it 4 times. I see the flaws but like the work as a whole."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is by far the greatest book I have ever read. The book shows the greatness and logic of objectivism. The heroes are the hardest working people on earth. They produce wealth, jobs, innovations, and ways to live longer. From what I have read of history; Socialist/Communist countries have few innovations to boast. The same goes with any force-ruled country. The United States, Japan, Germany, and others have far less restrictions than any civilization in the last 1000 years and are also the most productive as well as the greatest. Individualism is the reason for all of our ideas. I defy any person to show me any of the top 1000 ideas of all time (material items)that were not created by an individual.Ayn Rand's Philosophy showed me that there are others such as I. To happiness, production, thought, and money."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand culminates her whole life philosophy in this powerful work. The story, 1200 pages long, is literally gripping. The protagonist of the story is Dagny Taggart, the woman industrialist who runs the great transcontinental railroad in the US, and is a story about how her love of life, her love of her railroad, her social obligations, and understanding of man's values and morality pit against one another.Ayn Rand's protagonists embody her philosophy, and through them and this captivating novel presents a tremendous argument of individualism. For me, her words and arguments in the story clarified and put into perspective many things i have struggled with in my life, in balancing social expectations and obligations against my own hopes and desires.I recommend the book whole heartedly--it certainly changed my life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just the fact that this woman and her writings have generated so much controversy speaks volumes. As another reviewer mentioned, people either hate her or can't stop singing praise. Well, the interesting part about it all is that for Ayn Rand herself, there were two kinds of people, her kind, and the other kind. Well her point seems to be proven if you ask me. I personally agree with many of her ideals, but I have to agree with the negative reviewers about some parts of this book. She rants and raves a tad bit too much, and....the hidden valley also stretches things a little. But there are the other parts of the book which I think will stand immortal. I am from a country which went through a period of HARDCORE socialism (India) and the way she has described its onset closely mirrors what happened to my country, and look at it. I think things got a bit too personal for Ms. Rand, and she got a bit to emotional as she wrote this book. The Fountainhead describes her ideas very subtly, and this book attempts to apply them to all aspects of a persons life.....well they succeed to an extent. Either way, her ideas were mind-blowing for me as teenager, and I am sure they have influenced my life to a significant degree. A good read, but you can definitely skip the long rants."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This area is reserved to advise the people who are considering reading this novel as to whether they should invest their time and money.I suggest you do. This is an important novel, the themes of which have had deep impacts upon the modern world in which you live. It is a seductive novel filled with strong, sympathetic characters, and a plot that will carry you easily from beginning to end. The world these characters inhabit is larger than life. A fantastic world of black and white.But can anything you read in a novel be translated to the real world, as so many think this work should be? That's something you'll have to decide for yourself upon completion.Still, after multiple readings, I am conflicted.Do I agree with the theme of the novel? No, I do not. I reject its notion that the world is so binary that it only contains two types of people - those whom create the world we so comfortably live in, and those that mooch off of those creators.According to Rand's philosophy, the man who created the core architecture of computer memory, which is key to your computer booting up in the first place let alone you reading these words, should be a billionaire. Reality is, he was simply a cog deep within Texas Instruments and never saw a dime from his revolutionary ideas, not even a bonus, while TI made billions off it.Still, taken strictly from a story stand point, this novel is a heck of a ride. I urge anyone, from the high schooler who's played Bioshock and got their curiosity bone tickled to the greedy business man who wants \\"proof\\" they're somehow not a jerk, to set aside the time to read this novel.No matter your ideals, this is one of those rare works that demands upon completion you form your own opinion about not only the world you live in, but the world you want to live in."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed this book,but it was really long.I don't agree with it's theory on God,but great on Progressives.Surprised they still call themselves that after this book came out.Strange how things remain the same."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'll preface this by saying that this is one of my favorite books of all time. It is a controversial book, but don't let that turn you away from Ayn Rand's intriguing philosophy. It can also be difficult to read at times (several people that I've lent my copy to have failed to finish it), but I think it's worth it to read it cover to cover. Be aware that it is a very long book, some 1100 pages or so. To enjoy this book, you need to be open minded and receptive to the authors ideas. It's major themes/goals are to get you to think for yourself, make you feel strong, independent and confident, and to get you angry about being pushed around by whatever know-nothing that happens to be in charge. This review probably won't convince you to buy the book, but you should at least borrow if from the library and give it a test drive."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book I could consider a masterpiece-- the story is exhilarating and extremely well structured; it builds on itself and seems only to get better; it is a rewarding and satisfying read.The only flaw for me is that Rand has taken a little too much out of the emotional department in order to convey her philosophical messages-- laisse faire government, the virtue of selfishness, etc. I still really enjoyed the book, but unlike THE FOUNTAINHEAD, this one lacked depth in the characters-- there was little growth for any of them. On the other hand, The Fountainhead fails to be so flawless in story structure. In the end, I much prefer The Fountainhead, but I would still highly recommend this book. It is an awesome literary achievement, even if her philosophy isn't for you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked this up at a friend's second home in the white mountains. (I think it is one of those books you may leave lying around the house to impress your friends even though you do not really have the time or fortitude to completely read it.) It is a hefty 1200 pages with a microscopic font size... I wanted to read it because I had a vague notion that it was an important work. I had no other sense of what the book was about.What I found is that it is a naked attempt at being a Capitalist Manifesto - expounding the virtues of hard work and how that is motivated by the pursuit of profit. Not only does it extol the virtues of the profit motive, it argues quite forcefully that the success and even survival of society depends on it.At times it is beautifully written - striking really. Other times it drones on as a thesis of political philosophy... On the whole it was worth the read - but I am certain that it could have easily made its arguments in half as many words."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I won't bother with a review of the book itself, as that is more than adequately covered by many other reviewers. I will say that for the cost of this book, I should be able to expect a proofread, error free electronic text. The errors are not major, but there are enough of them to be distracting. Stray periods,\\"John Gait\\" instead of \\"John Galt,' \\"d.3'Anconia\\". Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden would never have let this product be released in this condition!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is very interesting that Ayn Rand could have written this so long ago and have the principles apply to the \\"here and now\\". Excellent entertainment and provides many topics for discussion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The writers style is very interesting indeed. Very vivid and descriptive almost to the point of overdoing it. I really liked this book though and understand why there is some kind of \\"cult\\" following of it. The characters come to life in this book and the theory behind the plot is very interesting. I understand why 50 years after the book was written it is still popular. Especially in today's expanding government. I would highly recommend that you read it for your self. Also, like I always add to my posts: get this book at the library and save your money for your future."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is very lenthy and complex. I read it years ago and decided to read Atlas Shrugged once again. To help analyze the charactors and themes, I decided to read the cliff notes first as a study guide.

Would highly recommend these cliff notes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book engages you immediately and throughout the story line my opinion on government and capitalism significantly changed.

Such a weird fluke!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged inadvertently points out the incongruous nature of the cultural marriage between political conservatism and Christianity. Rand's Objectivism is incompatible with religious belief in general, and Christianity specifically, yet much of her belief system makes up the core of American capitalist conservatism, and her following among Republicans is quite significant. For any conservative Christian reading the book, the conflict between Rand's political thought and Christian teachings is striking.While the literary merits of the book itself are badly lacking, and I cannot recommend it, I encourage those readers coming from a conservative Christian background to read the book with their religious convictions rather than their political beliefs foremost in their minds. It will be far more thought-provoking that way, rather than a simple excercise in political agreement."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just read this and it really drives home the point of how much I do not enjoy working when I think that about half of my labor goes to the government. After I think of that, then I get disgusted when I think about the dollar value of services I feel I'm receiving. I happen to work enough so I do not need any handouts, so the only things I feel I'm using are the roads, and police. The army isn't here anymore, and experts are saying its 'broken' right now anyway. Public education? Check out how many people graduate from the Detroit public high schools. I could go on and on, but its just sad. I think Rand was right, leave most things to the private sector, someone will provide a service. Gov't just needs to have a police force and army, and enforce the contracts we make with eachother when they're broken, that's it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Mostly I see this book as Objectivist propaganda dressed up in a romance novel, but that is kind of fun no. It arrived a bit earlier than simular utopian visions (in tactic rather than content) such as Celstine Prophecy and Boomeritis. Too bad the world isn't that simple. To bad Ayn isn't still around to witness the rise of the Internet and the raging post-post-modernism. The Fountainhead is fun too. Be careful if you are young and are getting swept up by ideas as you are seeking your self and a place in the world...this book might give you some lifting feelings that might lead you to accepting her ideas without much contrary thought. A striking book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book should be required reading by every student in a democracy.

At first it sounded interesting, but once I started reading the book I couldn't stand it because I couldn't find it interesting. Two-thirds of the book had little or no action, but the last third has much more action which caught my attention. The book has its ups and downs, but in the end it wasn't all bad."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Unfortunately I was persuaded that Atlas Shrugged was something worth reading.I cannot tell you how inconceivable it seems to me that anyone with half a brain can consume this rot without wishing to throw up.It's not that Rand is stupid or can't write, but the wilful misinterpretation of anything cultural of socially committed, the complete absence of humouror self-criticism, the endless repetition of the same inane faith in good men and women who want nothing but to make a profit, which will keep the world going, is very hard to take seriously.The opposite has happened of what she describes: the western world has not collapsed through inefficiencyor unselfishness, in fact it is so successful and egocentric that the environment situation has entered countdown stage, and the people in the west are consuming resources at breakneck speed, while in large parts of the world people are starving.That the book's literary worth is below zero is not the point, though every hero is tall, slender and has an iron look in his, or occasionally her, eye and every crook is badly dressed and has bad posture. That the book becomes utterly predictable, because is starts from an unquestioned faith in her theory, will delight her fans who share her faith. But it's not a novel, it's a political manifesto. What really upsets me, however, is its myopic the tunnel vision. It should have become overly clear in the past decades to anyone who reads the papers that the morality of power and money bears no resemblance to the heroism of Rand's one-dimensional characters.The dice in the book are loaded, anything said or done by opponents of objectivism is too silly for words, whereas the heroes shine on brightly even in bed, especially when they end up there together. Incidents are pre-arranged in such a way that everything that happens fits the theory. There are no surprises, nobody gains any insight, the good work and succeed, the bad complain and fail. Anyone can agree that it's better to build safe and reliable railroads than to have them decline through neglect. It's also a good idea to make better steel, and we can even agree that successful people should be able to make a profit. It seems silly and sinful (yes, I would like to use strong language, like Ayn does) to overlook all the other segments of society, and to condemn everyone that tries to expand our thinking beyond railroads and steel.Please try to read something worthwhile (I wouldn't recommend my own book, which might be to strong for your liking)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Are you looking for a justification for selfishness? Do you want to feel good about greed? Don't care about plot, developed characters or realistic dialogue? Then Atlas Shrugged is for you.Rand's philosophy is basically the same hypocritical \\"victim complex\\" tripe that we still hear from other like-minded literary and philosophical geniuses as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage and Ann Coulter. Just like they do now, Rand makes the ridiculous claim that American businessmen are terribly and unjustly persecuted. Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957. In our corporate-controlled world, her contention would be laughable if it wasn't so nasty and bitter. She contends that laws are enacted just to ruin successful businesspeople. Are there any real-life examples of such legislation? No, just the opposite. Our government allows corporations and the ultra-wealthy to shelter their income from taxes and then gives them multi-million dollar handouts, paid for by the middle class.Interestingly, Rand shares more than her philosophy with today's neo-cons...she also shares their hypocrisy. In the afterword to Atlas Shrugged, she states: \\"No one helped me, nor did I think at any time that it was anyone's duty to help me.\\" In reality, Rand received help from her parents, her relatives in Chicago, her husband, her editor, friends who loaned her money, and subsidized housing. Liar or hypocrite? - We report, you decide.Finally, it is extremely interesting to note that the materialistic, atheistic, self-centered views of Rand's objectivist philosophy are embraced by conservatives who would also claim to be Christians. If by Christian, you mean one who follows the example of Jesus, it is impossible to be both Objectivist and Christian. The two are mutually exclusive and those who claim to be both are either liars or hypocrites. Ayn Rand was both, but that seems to be par for the course with this group."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.How can one claim to have built a philosophy from just one of the tools OF philosophy? Ayn seems to be claiming to have invented the very concept of philosophy - but then since she has obviously not heard of Aristotle that's hardly the worst of her crimes.The prose is terrible. I've seen Chinese auto-converted to English with better results.The author messes up basic maths; A train travelling at 100mph passes signal poles, set 2 miles apart, \\"every few seconds\\". That's over an order-of-magnitude in error.The preached philosophy depends on such overdue inventions as; perpetual motion, rejection of Maxwells theorems, the breaking of Lorentz invariance. Basically, a different universe.Nobody ever gets sick. Which is a lucky thing since objectivism insists that you sell a kidney to have the other one repaired.Nobody has any children. This also is a lucky thing since objectivism would insist the child be abandoned at the age of... 1 day... after it fails to negotiate a deal for food.The \\"hero\\" of this story gives a 57 page monologue. That's right, what is quite probably the longest monologue in the history of the world is given by the \\"hero\\".To people who have not yet read this book, I say, remember this:I have never before regretted anything I've done. And I've done some stupid things. But all my experiences add up to make ME. Taking away any of them would make me less. Well... taking away my experience of reading Atlas Shrugged would actually make me MORE - Atlas Shrugged is so bad, it actually hunts down and kills other good experiences.Don't do it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had written a nice piece about what I thought of this book.

And it's (surprise, surprise) very popular....This novel is overlong in the extreme, full of one-dimensionals, and horribly written. Pure bad with a capital B. BAD.Objectivism (I cringe even dignifying Rand's vision with its proper name) is the purest form of skunking, existentialism's great sin, creating yourself as unique and vital to the world. So even though the two philosophies are often linked (mostly by idiots), they are in direct opposition.If you're looking for literary developments of competent philosophies check out Sartre and Camus. These guys don't pull their punches, and they don't ignore the areas of life that pose problems for their ideologies.To ease up on Rand, she did write a novel I really enjoyed: Anthem. At just over a hundred pages in length, I didn't have time to puke, because she didn't have time to rant, and her constant deployment of first person plural was amusing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For a number of years I kept hearing what a classic work of American literature Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; was. Despite repeated attempts to read this huge, awkward book I could never get beyond the first 50 or so pages. Finally at 28 years old I forced myself to read the entire thing. Classic work of American literature? Hardly. What a long-winded, confused and throughly terrible piece of tripe filled with characters you couldn't care less about, all of whom are totally devoid of normal human emotion, and ridiculous situations that were obviously contrived simply to prove a point or make some grand 'statement'. Rand could have written this book with one sentence &quot;Capitalism good, communism bad&quot; and saved me a long, mind-numbingly dull read"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book would be ridiculous if it wasn't that scary. It is basically an ode to dumb selfishness and a hate letter to society. Written without the slimmest knowledge of history it purports to present a solution to problems that never existed while skipping the ones that did. The scary thing is that hidden behind a thick mess of words is an ideology that courts the darkest impulses of the human mind.It is no coincidence that the book shares this trait with L. Ron Hubbards sorry excuses for science fiction and \\"philosphy\\" - and with another unreadable volume that prompted a cult: \\"Mein Kampf\\". And as Hitlers so called manifesto \\"Atlas\\" fed the hurt and hungry passions of the mediocre who finally had an apology for their hatred towards themselves and all humanity.Like communism, the evil twin of this kind of simplistic \\"solution\\", we usually lose biases like \\"objectivism\\" while growing up. But like growing up, some never do. So I post this one-star review completely in vain, I know. It is just my little addition to keep the star total as small as possible.To all fans of Ayn Rand out there I just say this: You are sorry little losers."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The author makes many false comparisons where one obviously true facet is supposed to prove the rest of an argument is also true -- this is incorrect, if best misleading.

Had I gotten the print version, I would have set it aside after the first 100 pages. With the audiobook, I kept listening, hoping that the story would improve. It never did. Rand's characters are childishly one-dimensional. Her \\"philosophy\\" is as profound as a fortune cookie.

Two thumbs enthusiastically down."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone should read this once. Anyone who readers it more than once after college needs to step back and get in touch with reality. It's great fiction and timeless. But despite Rand's attempt to shape the world in this mold, let's be thankful her philosophy never took hold.If you read this in high school or college, you can be excused for buying into it briefly. Give yourself a year or two of growing up outside academia, and you'll grow out of the philosophy.If you are an adult just curious what the phenomenon is all about, you might want to read a Cliff's Notes version instead. Otherwise, it's hard to justify putting yourself through something like the 70 page monolog in here."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This inane and badly written book is like a broken record of a song you don't like to begin with.Aside from excruciating description of physical detail, this book is nothing but the repetition of a mantra--The good, strong, honest, industious, capable, intelligent people are forever plagued by the bad, weak, lying, lazy, incompetent, stupid people--how profound.Had this been an actual treatise, you would have found refutations of intelligent arguments, rather than the simplistic straw-man Ayn knocks down over and over and over and over....Had this been an actual novel, there would have been interesting characters. Can anyone who loved this book point out a significant difference in the characters of Wesley Mouch, Orren Boyle, Jim Taggart, Paul Larkin, Dr. Ferris, etc. ad nauseum?Of course, there are the &quot;romantic&quot; scenes! If you like to mix guilt, shame, and violence with your sex, then you'll love Dagny's relationship with Hank Rearden!Ugh!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Getting through this book was one of the hardest things I've ever done. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is nothing more than an exceedingly long pamphlet for Ms. Rand's ironically named philosophy of \\"objectivism\\". The dialogue is stilted, the characters two-dimensional, the plot mildly interesting until you learn the true nature of the mysterious disappearances of the captains of industry. The \\"good guys\\" are veritable gods among men, uncompromising in their values and uncompromised by mortal flaws like compassion and empathy, whereas the \\"bad guys\\" (i.e. liberals, unions, intellectuals, etc.) are uniformly unpleasant, unsympathetic, and deserving of nothing but scorn (and boy does the author dish it out). Ms. Rand's message could have just as easily been summed up in one sentence (\\"Blame poor people\\"), which would have saved me a considerable amount of time and effort. The lesson I learned from this book is that just because somebody calls something a classic, it doesn't necessarily mean it's good. Or entertaining. On the other hand it does make a fine paperweight.Wow, this review hadn't been out 12 hours when someone gave it an \\"Unhelpful\\" vote. I'm sure that was an Objectivist giving it an objective vote based on its own merit. As a way of saying thank you, here are some more reasons why this book sucks. There is no dramatic tension because the antagonists are way outclassed by the protagonists from page one. There's no real struggle here, just one side demonstrating their superiority (coincidentally in the form of a universal adherence to Ayn Rand's philosophy) and the other side demonstrating their slimy ineptitude. Yawn. Here's another thing. A good author provides a strong counterpoint against their own argument so they can confront it, offer their own counterpoint, and thereby strengthen their own argument. No such counterpoint here. Whether this indicates a lack of imagination on the part of the author or a lack of faith in the strength of her own philosophy is debateable, but either way it's just another example of the many shortcomings of this novel.Here's some more stuff that came up in discussions about this book (see the 3 Star review entitled \\"Behemoth\\" for a much more detailed dissection):1) Rand's god-hero, John Galt, consistently demonstrates sociopathic behavior. He is a master manipulator who doesn't hesitate to ruin lives (of his would-be allies, no less!!!) or cause death and destruction in the pursuit of his goals. His ruthlessness is due in part to a complete lack of empathy, making him incapable of seeing situations from another's point of view. This might imply a singular dedication of purpose, but it also fits the profile of a serial killer. I wouldn't be surprised if Galt spends his spare constructing a \\"woman suit\\" sewn together from the flesh of his victims.2) Galt's prophecy is self-fulfilling. The chaos he predicted comes about not because of the ineptitude of lesser men but because of his own supervillian-style plot to destroy society. He shouldn't be fighting liberals and unions, he should be fighting the Fantastic Four. Heck, at one point he gives a 70-page monologue!!! Dr. Doom has nothing on this guy.3) The novel doesn't mention the Stock Market. Is that because the Stock Market Crash of 1929 showed the inherent weakness of an unregulated financial system?4) There are no children, elderly, or terminally ill characters in the novel (i.e. non-producers who have no place in Rand's ideal society). I assume this is because in her society people emerge fully grown from their gestation chambers at the age of 21 and once they've outlived their usefulness are ground up into an edible paste.5) The title is unintentionally ironic. Atlas didn't carry the weight of the world on his shoulders as a sign of his greatness. That job was his punishment for acting like a jerk.And what about the philosophy of Objectivism itself? I'll just say this. If the Steve Forbes of the world went on strike, I don't think my life would be significantly impacted. If garbagemen, mailcarriers, police, or factory workers went on strike, that would be a different story."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"WARNING - PLOT SPECIFICS IN THIS REVIEWI took a break from my normal reading list and read this book suggested by a person I sat next to on a plane. If I ever run into that guy again I'm pushing him off the jetway.I just didn't get it. The first 400 to 500 pages, Rand creates this long list of characters on either side of the issue of socialism and government regulation. I then waited for 600 pages for her to do something interesting and unpredictable to happen with these characters and it just never happened.The point that she was trying to make hits you over the head so many times that it becomes cliched and tiresome by the end of the book.My two biggest disappointments to this book were:Once Rand introduced us to the actual John Galt I got excited. Especially when I looked at the chapter titles and saw the one that was called - \\"This is John Galt Speaking.\\"I thought... now that is going to be a good chapter. I hoped it would be a moving essay on Rand's core philosophy. Instead, it was 40 pages of the same thing the entire book had been trying to slam home. Nothing new, nothing different. Just more cliched prose, symbolism and hit you over the head analogies. What a disappointment that chapter was. As well as the ensuing search for John Galt.I also was extremely disappointed by the ending. This book filled with angst ends like a fairy tale. They just happen to get John Galt back from the bad guys and live happily ever after waiting for the outside world to end with no personal ramifications for any of the characters you are supposed to root for. This complex world of characters and events gets tied up far too neatly in a bow by the end of it.The most unfortunate storyline of the book dealt with Cheryl Taggart. She was the only true martyr in the book. I wanted to know more about her but Rand treated her as a character not worth more development and that was disappointing because she spent so much time developing characters that I didn't care to know more about.The one thing I did really like about the book is when Galt offers to fix the generator that is being used to torture him. That definitely had some symbolism that I could hold onto and contained just the right amount of irony to make me smile.This book really disappointed though and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are many other fine classic fiction/nonfiction books to spend your time with."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have written a review on this book three months ago. I am astonished to see that the mob still believes that anyone who does not like this book is a socialist. How awful mediocrity is. That is why I love Nietzsche. There is nobody who was more anti-socialist than he. I am completely anti-socialist, but there is one thing I loathe more than it: mediocrity. That is what Nietzsche most hated. Ayn Rand just wrote books for adolescents; books which can only impress people who have no literary education at all."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read this book 20 years ago when I was in my early 20s, when I was still a misunderstood heroic genius. Several things stand out. The female lead character being raped early in the novel and the presentation of that act as one of love, the wooden robotic characters, the novel's horrible redundancy (John Galt's speech begging a cream pie in the face), and those silly on-strike over achievers trying out their philosophy in their Rocky Mountain bunker. The ultimate irony is that all people who are alive and have ever lived, are indebted to each other whether they realize it or not. Life just isn't black and white. It makes the world an easy place to understand but it doesn't make it true. In addition, Objectivism's obvious lack of gratitude and/or appreciation for the sacrifices individuals have always made for others is puzzling and ultimately disturbing. How would the heroic geniuses of Rand's novels implement the great ideas of their great minds? Dams, railroads, oil fields all involve collective effort and to imply otherwise is a childish take on endeavors that are complex interactions between individuals and institutions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Hard to believe a book this long could be considered underwritten but in fact it is. Be warned this is not a narrative. it is forst and foremost Rand's philosphy in the form of a narrative.While the book explains, again and again and again, the principles behind Rand's Objectivism, basically every man for himself, it is woefully lacking in every other aspect of good writing. The characters are all one-dimensional, they are either really good or really bad. They do no speak like real people, their interactions with each other, especially the romantic interludes are worse than cheesy.This book could have been at least half the length if it weren't for the endless pages of speeches extolling Objectivism.Just research Rand's theories and save yourself a lot of hours."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Thought I would love it, but got bored after the first few pages.

Due mainly to curiosity I bought it on my Kindle and read what I consider to be one of the most inspired literary works in the last century. Ayn Rand's intelligence is almost a physical force that grabs you through her words. She writes beautifully, I found myself reading some sentences/paragraphs two or three times just because the emotion conveyed and the construction used was so perfect. What is striking to me is that while the message of the book is so pragmatic, she delivers it almost poetically. Certainly she has extreme views but I also feel that she captured the exact essence of what America could be at its best. I read a vast amount but I've only ever reviewed one other book. While I'm tempted to expand more on her philosophy, I'll limit my approval of Atlas Shrugged to the effectiveness of its delivery. This book should be required reading at every high school in the country.

Additionally, it seems like reading this book has a long term effekt as a lot of the situations Ayn Rand describes in her captivating novel are closer to reality as to fiction. Sure, Rand glorifies her heros and paints the bad guys ugly - this might be too obvious, but does not effect the brilliance of the story. The book demonstrates how socialism leads to antisocial behaviour, stagnation, economical and mental poverty. Rand shows how altruism is just another form of suicide and that values should never be sold for obeying any idelogy - not even to satisfy the wish for a selfless one-world-fantasy as this would lead to the ultimate disaster. Rand urges the reader to rethink his or her own position, assume responsibity rather than crying for others to take charge, to make deciscions rather than having someone else make them and to try to be best we can be.I was facinated by this book and read it in English, even though my native language is German.

Riggio 4-28-10Having dodged reading Atlas shrugged in college, primarily because of its intimidating size and scope, recently, I have read many comments about how this book foretold current times in our country and world more than fifty years ago.Having set out to read this tome, I ordered it on Amazon, specifically ordering the hard bound edition. What I did not realize when I received this book that it was really a paper back sized book with a hard cover binding. Each page was filled with over 500 words, in your typical paperbound book sized font. With a total of 1,070 pages in this edition, we are talking over a half a million words. I read about 100 pages and struggled with my aging eyesight to grasp what was presented. I then searched several libraries to find a bona fide hard bound edition which came out in 1995. The print was a bit larger but still over 1,000 pages of text. I learned in my search for a normal hard bound edition that the 1995, 35th edition was the last printing of this book. The copy I bought from Amazon was the 50th Anniversary edition and came out in 2007. The original publication of Atlas Shrugged was in 1957, though it was written in the late 1940's.The book took me about 100 pages before I got a flavor for the worth of this book. When I got the library edition, it was much easier to read and my reading time was accelerated accordingly.Ayn Rand's character development was initially difficult to follow but soon took on a flow which captured and held my interest.The story is a complicated struggle between prominant industrialists from several industries concentrating on the Railroad and Steel business', and their struggle with government bureaucrats bent on social issues and progress.The capitalists represented what was bad for society and how selfish the industrialist were in their seeking profits. On the other side the beauractats were the \\"white hats\\", looking out for the concerns of the \\"people\\", both the working class and the non achievers in our society.As government became bigger and issued more and more controls over industry and transportation in an effort to create equalness, the white hats became the black hats and the industrialists the victims of opressive regulations.The bureaucrats developed into the champions of the non producers and the arch enemies of productivity and consequently creativity. The industialists are forced into an ever tightening corner in view of oppresssive regulations thus limiting and styming both production and creativity. The result is a complete withdrawal of producers resulting in the absolute failure of government.The hero of the story John Galt is for most of the book a near fictional character with many different stories about this existance and origin. Not until chapter seven do we actually hear from John Galt and his intentions based on his philosophy based on moral values to destroy the beauracrats, now being refered to as \\"looters\\" who have stalled completely any productive growth in any industry in the country and the slow but constant decline of companies and people.Dagny Taggart, an heiress to the Taggart Railroad is the idealist heroine who struggles against the looters and tries to keep the railroad in operation as industries are failing all around her. Dagny is struggling to find both meaning to life and her ideal of love. The post coital dialog between two lovers is the most interesting and somewhat astonishing verbal exchange I have ever read but notwithstanding the negatives of the conversation the two become true heroes of the book.Ayn Rand is both a suberb story teller, albeit with lots of words but also a philosopher advocating the the continued accomplishments of man while condeming the haners on. She would be appalled to see the direction our country and the world is taking today.My one criticism of her philosophy is that it does not truly recognize a higher power and man is a creation of himself and not a creature burdened by \\"Original Sin\\" therefore God's importance is diminished accordingly.The book is worth the read especially in today's political, economic and social struggles."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What is \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" about?1) At a very superficial level, it is a novel about innovative productive people going on strike against those who would use compulsion to reappropriate the benefits of their labors. At this level, people who have never read the book (and probably wouldn't understand it if they did), rail against the book as an endorsement of laizez faire capitalism, which they reflexively take as a sign of indefatigable evil.2) A better starting point, in my opinion, is to ponder Ayn Rand's charge to \\"check your premises\\", which turns the book into a self-critical intellectual challenge for readers of any political, religious or philosophical persuasion. In her book, Ayn Rand questions most of the core beliefs that we absorb by cultural osmosis and she requires that the reader use the judgment of his or her own mind rather than accepting by default the thinking of others. I would consider the reading of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" an intellectual rite of passage for any high school student with the capacity to think. Ayn Rand did not intend to start a religion--there is no need to agree with all or any of her various positions. There is, however, a need for the intellectually honest and self-aware to grapple with her ideas.3) Ayn Rand begins with the premise that your own life is a primary value and that you have the right to be happy. She defines happiness as the feeling that comes from achieving what you value. Your mind is your primary tool for survival and good comes from the exercising the inviolate judgment of your own mind. Thinking is good and the refusal to think is bad. Morality consists of voluntary exchanges between individuals and compelling someone to act against their values, their life and their happiness is both personal and social evil. In \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" Ayn Rand uses fiction as a foil for examing both the positive and negative consequences of her premises. As the novel develops, her heroes and heroines evolve an affirmation of these premises and her villians come to realize that their professed beliefs are founded on the converse of Ayn Rand's premises. What you have is a complex metaphysical, epistemological and ethical philosophy turned into story.4) Ayn Rand has been criticised as a writer by detractors who find her characters \\"unrealistic\\". While Ayn Rand would have argued to the contrary, I think that the issue is moot. In my opinion, Ayn Rand is working within a tradition of utopian writers (like Swift in \\"Gulliver's Travels\\", like Huxley in \\"Brave New World\\" and like Orwell in \\"1984\\"), where the fiction is about the ideas more than it is about the characters. While Ayn Rand did not write the sort of novel favored by post-modern literary critics, I think that any careful reader will have to admit that Ayn Rand showed considerable craft in the use of language, imagery, character and plot development. Besides being a \\"good think\\", the book is also a \\"good read\\".5) In addition to all of the above, Ayn Rand provides a good many other nuggets of thought to chew upon: the concept of \\"moral sanction\\", her psychosocial theory of human sexuality, a theory of aesthetics and her political and economic theories. To my mind, these are derived consequences, which may or may not follow from her basic premises. When Ayn Rand describes cigarettes as \\"fire tamed at a man's fingertips\\", my mind counters with \\"lung cancer, emphysema and bad breath\\". In \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" you will find both the profound and the profoundly silly. Part of the fun of reading the book is getting to decide for yourself which is which."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's philosophy on free market capitalism may be on the radical side, but even if you don't believe in 100% laissez faire, this book will show you what our economy could be like under a more communistic rule. Rand shows that the theory and practice of a collectivized economy are two very different things, the latter resulting in devastating effects on innovation and incentives for progression. Her presentation is phenomenal and captivating. You'll feel anger toward the government underlings, sympathy for the \\"greedy capitalists\\", and compassion for the book's protagonist's, Dagny Taggart, long and arduous struggle. Most important is that you will experience the eternal struggle between individualism and collectivism, and one of the extreme ways that individualism is dealt with. If you have any interest in economics or business, this book is a great read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Considering the year Ayn Rand wrote this book makes it even more compelling.

It was far, far, far too long. She wasted a lot of paper. She's a terrible writer. She did a poor job developing the story, probably because she was so focused on conveying her political philosophy. She's so dogmatic that she comes across as preachy and the book absolutely lacks nuance. She hits you over the head with a friggin' sledgehammer with her beliefs throughout the story -- it gave me a headache! My recommendation is that you skip the story and go straight to the explanation of her political philosophy at the end of the book, after the story. Again, what a waste of tons of paper."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book, although slightly entertaining, is utter crap philosophically speaking.

This book might be handy, however, if you've run out of toilet paper or need a new target down at the shooting range."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One phenonmenon which used to baffle me was the immense popularity that quasi-articulate writer-philosopher Ayn Rand seemed to enjoy among young people back in the late 60s, especially given that her novels (and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is probably the most egregious example), which are little valued among literary academics, were primarily vehicles for propogating her incredibly selfish philosophy of \\"objectivism\\" (she named it herself) -- a remarkably atheistic, utterly eogcentric, extremist philosophy which might fairly be described as what some have called \\"anarcho-capitalism\\".I surmise that Ayn Rand gained her phenomenal popularity with younger folks for two major reasons: first, she opposed the Vietnam War; and, second, there were some very energetic and naive student \\"activist\\" organizations busy during the late 60s pushing her writings. Also, she became known as a feminist.I wish that more people would take a little time to review Ayn Rand's (1905-82) biography and her extremist thought, but I suppose that would be asking too much. But, if they did, they would discover that Rand was originally born Alisa Zinovjevna Rosenbaum in Russia and, as a young lady, managed to make her way to America with ambitions of becoming a glamorous Hollywood screenwriter. Perhaps we have here a hint of the angst that later went into her \\"objectivism\\" -- she had fled a rigid, communistic, socialistic, totalitarian scene to come as a refugee to the heart of contemporary creative capitalism. She was overjoyed, celebrated all aspects of unbridled, laissez-faire, and became a staunch patriot. All this is reflected in her later novels.Around 1950, with the assistance of a few supporters and followers, Rand launched a \\"think-tank\\" to promote \\"objectivism\\". One of the better-known disciples at the time was Alan Greenspan. Others she influenced include people that we might today describe as \\"neocons\\".Rand sold loads of books, and even now, I have read that the sales exceed 500,000 copies per year. One can visit almost any bookstore and discover for themselves that there is no shortage of Ayn Rand books on the crowded shelves, either in the \\"literature and fiction\\" aisles or in the \\"philosophy\\" sections. When Americans are surveyed about which books are the \\"best\\" or the most \\"influential\\", Rand works such as \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" are inevitably ranked high, usually in the top five. In the meantime, if you ask literary critics and professional philosophers the same thing, Ayn Rand books will frequently not even appear on their lists. I think that this is revealing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are fond of deeply flawed arguments and bombast, then you'll love Ayn Rand. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble of wasting valuable hours reading the awful ramblings of a writer (please, let's not sully the word &quot;philosopher&quot;) who substitutes analytical rigor with delusional and narcissistic assertions. By the way, to call &quot;objectivism&quot; a philosophy is akin to claiming that &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; is a good movie."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, I'll start by commenting on Rand's philosophy. I agree in large part with what she says about producing, self interest, etc. But she presents everything as SO black and white, so all or nothing, so extremely one way or the other. Another reviewer used the word &quot;caricature&quot; which is right on the money. But I don't get the impression that she saw it as such. The philosphy she espouses as she presents it is dangerous because it is not as simple as she would like for you to think it is. Don't let yourself be fooled.Secondly, I'd like to comment on the literary merits. I find it ironic that she spends a long 1,100 pages writing ad nauseum about exemplerary, almost superhuman people who are capable of producing extraordinary work while her own craft (writing) is barely even worthy of the compliment of mediocre. I would love to find out how many times she used the phrase &quot;he/she felt as if&quot; or &quot;he/she suddenly felt such-and-such without naming it&quot;. Subtlety is not her strong point but redundancy apparently is. Her ideas were crystal clear on page 400 but she careened ahead.In summary, boo."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'll keep it short. The story is compelling, very compelling. The philosophy is disgusting. I found that I truly hated all of the characters that the reader is supposed to admire, and vice versa.

The best way to obtain this book, in keeping with Rand's world-view, would be to steal it from a homeless person who uses it as a pillow."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like the snake in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; singing &quot;Trust In Me,&quot; Rand's words have a hypnotic effect that lull the reader into deadly sleep.

When you get to the part where her hero erects an enormous golden statue of a dollar sign (think &quot;golden calf&quot;), be afraid."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is in ATLAS SHRUGGED, her major novel, that Ayn Rand presents most clearly her vision of a human society based on her secular philosophy 'Objectivism.' In its way this novel functions as a sort of 'new Torah' in Rand's secular cult, telling the tale of how 'John Galt' liberated his people from bondage to the 'second-handers' and 'looters' and led them to a new land, flowing with milk and honey, in which they could observe the Law declaimed in Galt's radio broadcast.It must be acknowledged that Rand has a fairly healthy sense of some genuine virtues, for example the role of human beings and the human mind in the creation of wealth. Nevertheless her opposition to 'religion' - which she dismisses as 'mysticism' and the 'primacy-of-consciousness premise' - causes her to leave her virtues hanging in midair, as it were, ungrounded in any real obligation on the part of human beings to live in any particular way or in accordance with any particular Plan. (The holes in her antitheological armour appear quickly enough once one examines her 'benevolent universe premise' closely.)In consequence, many of her followers fail to recognise that she is in fact trying to defend certain traditional *religious* views on the basis of an *irreligious* foundation that cannot support them - and thus make the error of accepting her *premises* along with her (highly unoriginal and often highly flawed) conclusions. Her premises do not in fact support those conclusions, and so the philosophy of 'Objectivism' is an unstable compromise between religion and irreligion which, if accepted, tends over time to degenerate into the very Marxism/fascism/totalitarianism Rand (thought she) was opposing. (Any former member of Rand's cult will tell you about its totalitarian atmosphere, though not all of them will agree with my analysis; some, quite wrongly, regard the cultism of Rand's movement as a *departure* from Rand's basic principles and think her 'philosophy' can be rescued from her personal errors.)ATLAS SHRUGGED is in some ways a readable novel, if awkward in spots and tainted throughout by Rand's vicious contempt for 'ordinary' people. But John Galt is not a new Moses, and neither is Rand. And this book is not the foundation for a 'new' secular religion, but merely a recent expression of a very old irreligion which rebels against 'unchosen obligations' (are the demands of justice 'unchosen'?). It is notable primarily for its attempt to do that which Rand herself opposed in nearly all other contexts: to eat one's cake and have it too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I must start out by saying that if my high school english teachers had required books like this as standard reading I might have actually read them rather than Cliff Notes! Although this book is long and starts out a little slow, it is a wonderful book for anyone with an intellectual mindset. I feel that all of the reviewers that bash the book and give it one star are the impatient, unintellectual type that would rather read a John Grisham book or something of similar intellectual numbness. This book's plot is based on ideas and a philosophy that may be hard for many to accept. It may cause certain people, particularly those who's values it attacks, to make blanket statements concerning its lack of value or questionable literary merit, but that just illustrates their closed minded blindness to reality (similar to the characters in the book). While Rand may be pushing the extremes with some of her statements, in general the Objectivist philosophy would be one that the world's most successful people and economies have adopted in many ways. For example, the technology industry in Silicon Valley is based on a meritocracy that rewards superior ideas while showing no compassion for the weak, the lazy, or the complacent. It is based on networks of collaboration among those with ideas to improve their products and evolve to a greater level of productivity and economic gain rather than protectionism and stagnation. It is based on constantly seeking to improve products, indentify new opportunities, and develop new markets rather than ensuring a level playing field for all, strong or weak. These ideas are presented in the book through industrialists like Hank Reardon who works long and hard to develop a superior product - Reardon Metal - just to have the politicians, his competition, and people in power (who are threatened, jelous and envious of his success) try to commandeer the fruits of his labor by stripping him of his pattent rights.The people who dislike this book are the type of people who are portrayed by the antithesis of Hank Reardon - the jelous, envious, lazy, frightened people who are afraid of change, too lazy to innovate and compete, afraid to try, or just plain inferior. They cry for assistance, compassion, and \\"justice\\" because they can't help it that they weren't born with all the gifts of \\"others\\"... They wish to plague and drain society of all the profits and labor of others.

It takes someone with individual thought and an open mind to truly understand Rand's work.

Dorothy Parker wrote: \\"This novel is not to be tossed lightly aside, but to be hurled with great force.\\" Nevertheless, it consistently ranks as one of the most widely-read and influential books of the 20th Century. I read it in college, hoping to discover what it was about this doorstop of a book that is capable of evoking such zealotry among fans, and such vehement scorn from critics. Atlas Shrugged is a literary chimera: a \\"Novel of Ideas.\\" The problem with such books is that anyone with an interesting idea can write one, even if her literary talent is dubious. The characters in Atlas Shrugged, for example, are two-dimensional and the dialog is rather contrived; but the book has an interesting plot hook which allows Rand to ram home her Objectivist philosophy in an unforgettable way.Rand divides the human race into two spheres: Those who create value - artistic, material, or otherwise, and those who parasitize the creators. She then asks the question: \\"What would happen to the world if those who create value all simultaneously went on strike?\\" The answer, of course, is that the gears of civilization would grind to a halt. In developing this theme, Rand subjects her readers to harangue after harangue on the evils of regulatory and redistributive government programs, religion and superstition, bad art, and paper money. Thus, depending on the strength and direction of your prejudices, Atlas Shrugged is either ideological crack cocaine or a literary kick in the crotch. Regardless, the sustained intensity of Rand's tirades - with her characters serving as transparent mouthpieces - leaves little room for ambivalence.Atlas Shrugged succeeds insofar as it is the definitive statement of the author's personal philosophy - Objectivism - and provides cogent arguments for much of the modern Libertarian agenda. Also, Rand's division of humanity into those who create value on the one hand, and the vampires on the other, while simplistic, is nevertheless instructive. Atlas Shrugged fails insofar as Rand seems completely unable to acknowledge the gray areas and complexities of economic relationships and values. If alternatives were really so obviously black and white as they are in Rand's novel, then I'll be damned if I can figure out why everyone doesn't think as she does. The reason Rand's characters are so boringly right all the time is that they're never confronted with ambiguity. They never have to make a tough value judgment."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book as I was finishing high school on my senior English teacher's recommendation and it is still one of my favorites! The underlying philosophy still guides my life and I recommend it to anyone looking for a sense of meaning in the world today.Some readers get frustrated with the philosophy in every page of the book, but what makes Rand unique as a writer is her ability to integrate her philosophy with the plot. What this means is that it would be impossible to separate the two: the characters' actions would not be clear without the ideas that drive them.Mike FrancoEngineering Professional"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'd heard about Atlas Shrugged in the late 60s & early 70s when I was in college. I just now listened to the unabridged audio version.I worked in industry for over 34 years and in that setting saw, but never understood well, how better people (producers, people with actual knowledge and abilities) would/could be marginalized (even fired) by lesser folk.It seems there is an impulse in a segment of the population who 'must rule'. They are driven to control others often to the detriment of the enterprise. They gravitate into positions of authority (management in industry, politics in society).I had a particularly onerous experience with city/state government when I attempted to repair a modest balcony on my house (existing approximately 30 years). My experience could have been a chapter in Atlas Shrugged.The take away is that there are two types of people in the world: the ruled and the rulers. The rulers may not have the best interest of the ruled in mind (usually don't)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This might be the most dangerous book I have ever read. Those who are uncritically willing to follow ideas wherever they may lead, may be led into a new wondrous world - a true Peter Pan never never land. They may have to restructure their lives completely around this fantasy. Those who are mentally unstable will be tempted to hijack a black helicopter and fly it into the UN building - crying John Galt is Great -. Only those who are capable of independent critical thinking can read this book safely. Do not be put off by the somewhat wooden characters, its all about plot and storytelling. A great read, far better then the Da Vinci Code (not only dangerous for the Catholic Church, it annihilates almost all forms of Christianity).For those who want to keep things in human perspective, the following information may be helpful. Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum -a.k.a. Ayn Rand - was born in 1905 in St. Petersburg , Russia. She entered university in 1921* and graduated from the Social Pedagogical Division of the Faculty of the Social Sciences of Leningrad State University. This three-year course of the Department of Social Pedagogy was part of the new social science curriculum at the university, which had united the existing schools of history, philology, and law. The integration of the historical and philosophical disciplines sought to prepare students for careers as social science educators. Alissa learned to hate the new communist regime with whole her hart**. She emigrated to the USA as soon as she could. One of her first jobs was being a script girl in Hollywood. Atlas Shrugged can best be seen as an over the top anticommunist script of a pedagogy graduate. An excellent read, a nice intro to 19th century philosophy, still dangerous after 50 years.NOTES (added in 2012)* 1921 is four years after the communist 1917 takeover of Russia. Communism was in power, but it was still young, fresh, and exciting. The atrocities of the really existing socialism were hidden in the future. In contrast, all the atrocities of WW1 and the Tsars where real and recent. At graduation, Alissia was merely 20. Even at this young age, she was able to foresee the future and ignore the real problems that triggered communism in the first place -a true philosopher in the making -.** The older I get, the more I read, the more I am inclined to think this is the sentence that unlocks the secretes behind Ayn Rand's philosophy : \\"as a twelve year old Alissa felt totally alienated from - and superior to - children her own age. She read and understood Nietzsche and those nitwits didn't and couldn't \\". To really understand Ayn Rand you have to read Nietzsche as a clever alienated 12 year old would, then reread Atlas Shrugged.The big project of Nietzsche was to free the morals of man of thousands of years of Christianity. He wanted a new morality -fit for free man-. Nietzsche strove for a \\"umwertung aller Werte\\" (a radical recalibration of all values). Nietzsche became clinically mad before he could finish his project. However, if you want to know what the morality that he aimed at would have looked like: read Atlas Shrugged (or the virtue of selfishness).If you want to understand Ayn Rand, forget Aristotle, start reading Nietzsche."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Much has been said about Atlas Shrugged and about the philosophy it expounds, objectivism. No reader of Ayn Rand's works will be unfamiliar with it, and I will not specifically focus on it here.As a vehicle for the delivery of a philosophy, the use of a novel in this way is somewhat unique, and more interesting and compelling than the reading of a standard text book. Unfortunately, it is as a novel that I think it suffers.Ayn Rand, in the process of expounding her philosophy, has a habit of having characters make long speeches, both to each other and in contrived settings like courtrooms and radio broadcasts. Unfortunately, they tend to be both exceedingly long and repeated over and over by multiple characters in the novels without much change. It is as if Ms. Rand believes her readers to be so dense as to only be able to grasp her meaning by endless repetition. Of course, there is so much excess verbosity in this novel that it could probably be reduced by 60% in length, without reducing its interest level or information content, and making for a much better paced and readable work.I also find that even with the greatest degree of suspension of disbelief that there is no way one could ever envision the United States as being the true setting of this novel, some ficticious country probably being a better choice. Ms. Rand would also have been much better off if she didn't try to explain the workings of Galt's fantastic motor, which borders on the scientifically preposterous.In summation, if it weren't for the inherent value in the concept of objectivism it propounds, I believe it would probably be a novel which would never have been published. However, giving credit where it is due, and recognizing its true purpose, I am compelled to give it the rating I have. But, those who would read the book should proceed clearly understanding it for what it is, and is not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed most of this book. I am pretty sympathetic to the message of the book, but I can understand why some people would be turned off. The book is set in a futuristic United States that is being slowly taken over by collectivism and by folks more concerned with \\"fairness\\" than excellence. The book proceeds with an ever growing amount of protectionism being implemented on various industries, with the best companies and the best men unfairly hurt in the process. The protagonist of the story fights back by convincing all of the high achieving men of the country to quit working in the system and runaway to a restrictive enclave in the mountains. The point was to show the world what would happen if the creative and business energy provided by these men were to be suddenly removed, as if on a strike (Indeed, the working title of this book was \\"The Strike\\" Rand changed it on the advice of her husband). It is an interesting premise, indeed think of how our history would have been altered in the last 20 years with out Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell and other such mavens).The entire premise does require some suspension of belief. How many multi billionaires would quit their day job, sell off all of their worldly possessions in order to follow a kid out into the mountains and live in a commune? However, the story is a means to the end, which is ultimately to get Rand's philosophy out.I found most of the story quite enjoyable, however it got very tedious towards the end. Rand descends into long spiels about the evils of collectivism and how the individual is the ultimate power. I think most readers will get that after the first 5 times she says it. The other 40 are overkill. On this score, I agree with a previous poster who said she was in dire need of an editor. The character construction led a lot to be desired as well. None of the \\"good guys\\" had any detrimental attributes. They were all smart, capable, dashing and good looking. None of the \\"bad guys\\" had any redeeming characteristics. They were all conniving, lazy, indecisive and frightened. But, based on the premise that the story is a means to a larger philosophical end, this shouldn't be surprising.Overall, I liked the book. I do feel that \\"The Fountainhead\\" was a better piece of work, but this one is still worth reading if you don't mind the time investment (it is over 1000 pages). I am fortunate that my current situation gives me spare time to invest in reading (I am currently deployed in the army).

Atlas Shrugged answered all the questions I had and drove the point home in a way that I will never forget. The style is fiction, and Rand uses her story to entertain you and educate you at the same time.Granted, this book is huge and it will take you as long to read it as it would take to read 10 books of conventional length.That is, in my humble opinion, the only legitimate gripe of this book. Sometimes the author takes 50 pages to explain something that could be explained in 5. Nevertheless, it is well worth the read.

Of course I skimmed it then, what with all the other books i had to read every week. But now? Definitely a life changer in that a careful reread showed me several things. . .One, i am not crazy! Rand wrote more than fifty years ago about what I am seeing now, and feeling. . .that inner gut sensing that &#34;things&#34; are in decline, that the dreamers, the producers are ever smaller in number while the takers the &#34;looters and moochers&#34; as Rand named them are on the march. There is nothing like being self employed, running your own business, to heighten this awareness. Her portrayal of how such people think, especially when in a group pressed for a rational decision, hide in corners. muttering vague platitudes while at the same time relentlessly press their agenda behind the collective mask, that triggered derisive laughter, that &#34;OMG, someone has seen this too,&#34; or rage that such are the ones that continue to flourish.. I've traveled around the world seveal times, there is nothing like visiting a post communist nation, seeing the wreckage and malaise that still exists in some of those regions. No spoiler here. . .as I read the chapter where Dagny and Rearden search out an abandoned factory for some &#34;evidence,&#34; I flashed back to such a site in Russia, a massive sprawling wasteland, it would take a chapter just to describe all that I saw in terms of the sheer group stupidity to build that facility where they did. . .and in the cavernous ruins, it now houses sheep and goat herders. Or another such complex in Romania, seeing ragged kids crawling ove slag heaps in search of coal, scraps of metal, anything of any value. It connected in an almost frightful way when a few weeks back a flight took me into Detroit, which connected me to what I saw in Russia. .and to Ayn Rand's propehtic work which I literally had been reading on that flight.The book spoke to me on a very personal level as well as to my expectations of self, why I strive to create (author here), what is it that I write about, even some very personal aspects as to ethics and personal expectations. The further into the book, the more notations I was making to refrence back to later.If you are intimidated by the sheer size of the work. Don't be. You'll find that once into the story, ultimately you will start rationing it out, to let the experience stretch out a bit longer. Upon completion I suspect most of us then turn back to all those notations to reread, ponder, and act upon.It is work that will challenge many assumptions, a work that you will find that some greet with rage, but as you listen to their counter arguments you will hear much about &#34;feelings&#34; but little about logic, or as one friend stated, referencing Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; (which I require all my students to read), their responses will sound like &#34;Duckspeak.&#34;There is a bumper sticker on my car now.

The class warfare described in this book and the governments persecution of the successful is shockingly accurate and is happening right now. Rand wrote the book originally as warning to American's about what was just starting to happen back in the 50's when the progressive, socialist movement was gearing up here.

I now thought that perhaps Rand was describing a potentially likely society.I read Atlas Shrugged this time in the gloaming of my life, with grandchildren and great grandchildren. I realize this time that Rand described a society that we have, in my lifetime, come close to realizing.Even in 1964 no one could believe that we would sometime have a president who proclaimed, \\"You did not build that!\\", who would bail out failing businesses on the backs of successful ones, who intentionally hindered functioning energy sources to favor non-performing ones, and would proclaim that the 50% who pay no income taxes are noble and good, while the 10% who pay 70% of income taxes are dirty dogs.There are a dozens of bumper sticker gems here:\\"To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right\\".

And yes, Ayn Rand's prose is a bit wordy and repetitive, like the Bible or the Koran, but the story at the heart of this quasi-religious cum philosophical work is interesting and entertaining. Unfortunately, Rand's lack of editing and pacing and poor characterization not only bog the book down in unneeded pages and plot development, but also get in the way of telling a good story.As for philosophy, Rand's Objectivism has some good ideas, but its fundamentalism and extremism cannot be taken to encompass all of life. For one thing, I find it hard to believe that no one procreates in Ayn Rand's novels, except for one character and a minor one at that. Maybe if Rand had been a mother to anyone, she would have had a more balanced outlook on a moral capitalism that can be used and looked up to as a way of life instead of what she presents in this novel.As with anything, take what is good from her system and toss out the rest that does not work.I think altruism has its place, but not to the point that it violates the rights of another individual.I feel that love does not have to be so dramatic and either stifling and indifferent or so violent and masochistic as it is in Rand's novels.Everything is never as clear cut as it is in Ayn Rand's world, which makes her objectivism a flawed philosophy, just as Atlas Shrugged is a flawed piece of work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's a MUST READ for everyone out there.

In other words, if you want it you have to earn it. This concept may disturb those liberal readers of this book, as the book is the glorification of capitalism. Down with welfare! Down with \\"That Hurts my Feelings\\"!The premise of the book is that the doers of the world (the intellectuals and entrepreneurs) go on strike. They give to society what society desires. Since society feels that they get rich off of them the doers decide not to be a burden. Of course you can imagine what happens.The book is a story of love, power and greed.

The plot is mesmerizing, writing clear, and heroes larger-than-life. It left me feeling exalted.I realize this book is not for everyone. People may dislike it either because it goes against their most fundamental premises, or simply because it doesn't match their literary taste. However, that shouldn't keep you from reading it.

Ayn Rand had a political philosophy she called &quot;objectivism&quot; which she thought would be presented to advantage in a fiction book.As many have noted here, she was not a great fiction writer, but she got her idea across. As fiction, the book was lacking in many ways. She was given to long-winded speeches exposing her philosophy, and of course she was dead set against socialism--which endears her to many, including me, and she was an advocate of enlightened self-interest which, when closely examined, is a positive force in the world. Of course, the socialists think that they are guiltless, or would like to be, when it comes to selfishness--but they are kidding themselves.I have a recently published book, titled &quot;HANDGUNS AND FREEDOM...Their Care and Maintenance,&quot; which I recently sent to a friend as a gift because he is a wonderfully skilled writer and a fellow conservative. He sent me a check for the full retail price with the following message,&quot;I'm sure you've heard Rush [Limbaugh] giving away a free year's subscription to his newsletter to one of his callers. I've always waited to hear one of them say, 'I'll send a check for my subscription, since I pay for what I want and for those things of value that I receive.' Enclosed is my check.&quot;Perhaps it's a hangover from a book that I'm almost finished reading, after having it sit unread on my shelf for years --'ATLAS SHRUGGED,' by Ayn Rand.&quot;Here's a man who practices what he preaches. The world would be better off with more like him, in my opinion.As for Ayn Rand, as I recall she was Russian born, and had a colorful life. She was often the center of controversy, but there can be little doubt that she, like my friend, believed in what she said. I've read others of her books, including &quot;THE FOUNTAINHEAD,&quot; &quot;THE NEW INTELLECTUAL,&quot; and other of her writings. It may be true that she was an idealist, or a utopian, but I'd greatly prefer her version of an ideal world to that of the socialists who prefer equality of result to equality of opportunity, and transfer of wealth from those who work hard for what they have to those who hardly work at all.There is an old saying, &quot;The society that robs Peter to pay Paul, can always count on the support of Paul.&quot; There are a lot of 'Paul's' in America today.I recommend her books highly, but keep in mind that, in my opinion, their chief value is in the philosophy presented, and not in her skill as a fiction writer. Her philosophy may have its flaws, but not nearly so many as those of the socialists.Joe Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom and other books"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just take a look at how many reviews, heated arguments, &quot;changed lives&quot; this book as inspired.

He proved it by writing tremendous, carefully reasoned works of economic analysis, notably SOCIALISM and HUMAN ACTION. Ayn Rand says he was wrong: the reason socialism will not work is that it punishes the few Great Ones who are the only true benefactors of mankind and on whom all Progress depends. She &quot;proves&quot; it by writing an overblown novel - a work of *fiction* which by her own account (in her LETTERS) was intended as propaganda - in which the withdrawal of a handful of people causes an entire national economy to collapse and the &quot;common man&quot; (in the person of Eddie Willers), left to his own devices and initiative, is able to do nothing but wander off and die. Whom would you rather have on *your* side: the defender of the power of spontaneous cooperation, or the defender of the Special Few Who Run The World, Or Else? The economist who believes that all human action is 'rational' in an important respect, or the narcissistic novelist who believes that most human beings are obdurately irrational? The defender of a classical liberal culture in which every human being, acting as an entrepreneur, is made independent of anyone in particular by depending on everyone in general, or the defender of a watered-down Nietzscheanism who thinks the 'common man' must patiently await handouts from a handful of productive geniuses and receive them gratefully under threat of death? Which one, in short, defends a view of humanity more consonant with the nature of liberty and capitalism? It is high time someone pushed this narcissistic witch off her pedestal - in the name of the very reason and liberty she claimed to defend. Reason and liberty do not need her."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"At a suspenseful point in the novel an Errol Flynn-esque character comes crashing through a window to save the day. Rand was a screenwriter before (and even after) launching into a successful career as an author, but I wonder if her screenplays had the same Hollywood dramatics as a few moments in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".I had to raise an eyebrow at the actions of this misplaced pirate in her novel, along with a few other scenes that left me unintentionally amused. Some of them include: the heroine falling madly in love, becoming mistress to a man's values (it couldn't have been the man himself could it? I'll leave this vague for the sake of those who haven't read the book), the countless references to characters exchanging glances loaded with emotionlessness (do Rand's heroes feel anything?), and the smug attitude of her heroes when they are leaving New York City at one point in the novel, confident that because they are leaving there is no one else of value left behind. Hmm...\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" can be critiqued through the lens of a novel or a philosophical work. Continuing with the former, I felt the elitist attitudes of the characters (as a result of Rand's philosophy) were difficult to swallow. The character's attitude about leaving the people of New York behind, as mentioned above, is written within the context of the story. But because it is within the context of the story, as part of the author's premise, I had big problems with it. Egoism is extolled as virtue for Rand. But the characters I read about with their unfounded conceit (with the exception of Hank Rearden and maybe one or two others) made me say out loud: Please...As characters in a novel go, Rand's fall flat. The men and women of \\"Shrugged\\" are either for her (Rand) or against her. Without hyperbole, the characters are either a bumbling, fearful, unctuous idiot or a courageous, idealistic, intelligent, beautiful, and emotionless amalgam of stereotypical wonder. In Dagny Taggart's persona, Rand seems to put herself on the page. Needless to say, the characters often come across as either larger than life (which could be ok) to totally unbelievable (which hurts the story).Her style of describing the fools as \\"fat\\" and \\"toady\\" is blatant and manipulative. I would have loved to see John Galt (Rand's \\"perfect man\\") have at least one vice to his character. Or even better-one intelligent character, who is not a doomed fool, openly challenge John Galt's movement.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is too long. At the two-thirds stage (still only 650 pages into the book!) I had more than gotten the gist of the story, the essence of Rand's philosophy, how great Rand, Galt, and Senator McCarthy are (in that order), and knew exactly what Galt had been doing in NYC well before Rand decides to cash in on her many hints to finally reveal his occupation. I did enjoy watching to see just what it took to sway Rearden to Galt's point of view. And enough \\"set-up's\\" and \\"pay-off's\\" are created to establish suspense. However, Rand loves her ideas to the point excess. At worst she is writing diatribe. At best she rambles ad nauseam. (See Galt's continuous stream of consciousness-- 50 pages plus!).Concerning her philosophy, Objectivism, I don't mean to say her ideas are bunk. I don't believe that. Long live capitalism. For personal application, the basic tenet of Randism is for a person to cherish individualism and pursue happiness as the highest goal. Good. Fine. No problem. Be productive, seek value in one's work, and assume responsibility for one's own place and progress in life. Great. Why not? But the notion of Objectivism abhorring any form of altruism as evil seems like an excuse and misunderstanding of selflessness. This philosophical notion, personified in the character leaving NYC behind, strikes me as \\"spooky\\".I have taken an unofficial, unscientific, poll of what people think about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". In the first place, I think this book continues to be read because it is like a book that makes its way on to a Banned Book List. These kinds of books make people interested to find out for themselves \\"what all the fuss\\" is about. \\"Shrugged\\" seems to generate buzz for itself one generation after another in just this way. My crude polling data seems to say that a lot of people concerned with business, engineering, money, (and those feeling a lack of appreciation in whatever) love the philosophy. And I admit I didn't mind the discussion about money as a worthy (but not the only) motivation. For many of those who approach the novel--as a novel-- opinions range from outright dismissal to mockery.I had longed planned to read this book; it has been on my \\"To Read\\" list since high school. Now, a year out of college, I gladly will cross \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" off the list. My secret was to keep plowing through the monolithic monologues and knowing just when I could skip down to a different part, certain that I wouldn't miss anything I hadn't read before."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read Atlas shrugged 3 times now, and with each reading Rand's message becomes quite a bit weaker for me. When I first read this book at the tender age of 20, I would have given it 5 stars and raved about it like many people here, as the best novel ever written. I would dispute anyone at that time to find any flaw in the novel.I read it a second time at 24, and realized how poor the characters are, and how weak and unrealistic the story is, but her overall message still got me. From a novelistic/artistic point of view, it's a bit of a mess, but her message was sound.Now at 29, I have just finished it for the third time and I am able to pick many holes in Miss Rand's philosophy. Her mediocre writing does not help either.It is still impossible to argue with the primary message of her objectvist philosophy: accept the world in a rational manner - as it is and not how you wish it to be. On the other hand, it is becoming exceedingly easy to argue that to accept the world rationally not necessarily to accept the sort of complete lassie-faire anarch-capitalism she advocates. Her initial premise is correct (accept the world rationally), but I now personally disagree with how she correlates that into the society she thinks this premise should lead to. Her ideas on politics, economics and government are sadly and extremely ignorant. She would basically throw away thousands of years of human society and knowledge based on her own philosophy without even giving it a look. Basically, she would say if its not Objectivist its crap!That being said, this should still be required reading for any politician, if only to hear an extremely influential point of view different then what that person may have ever experienced. I would not mind if religious people read it either.For an artistic, quality, character driven novel along the same vein I would far recommend \\"The Fountainhead\\" over Atlas Shrugged. That was Rand's true master work. \\"The Fountainhead\\" actually becomes stronger for me with each reading. This is perhaps because it is an actual novel, not a rant disguised as one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"People who read and adore this books would be well advised to read &quot;Independent People&quot; by the great Icelandic author Halldor Laxness. Laxness' main character, the farmer Bjartur, is precisely the type of character Rand tries to create in John Galt. But, Laxness locates Bjartur in the real world (pre-World War I Iceland) and the results of Bjartur's independence are far different from the end of &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;The difference, of course, is that Bjartur is subject to the whims of the world around him, where John Galt's world is carefully constructed to allow him to come out on top after many &quot;struggles.&quot;Rand's flaw is obvious. She reduces the world to its component parts and subjects them all to ruthless logic. She them assembles a world based on the logical conclusions. The real world, however, doesn't work that way. Scientists, for instance, have begun to understand that the world is a collection of complicated systems which have a life of their own independent of the actions of each component part. (Incidentally, economic activities are subject to the same idea, so those who see Rand's economics as logically correct fail to see that her theories are limited by the same boundary.)So read this (or any other Rand book) with a large grain of salt. Following her theories is just as likely to see one end up like Laxness' Bjartur as her John Galt."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You can plod through this bloated tome or just read a summary.

Sorry, but we could do without a dead ultra-right, megalomaniacal, pill head, Russian immigrant telling us how to live our lives. Who doesn't think you should live your own life and that it be of your own design just as a matter of principle? How American.

At the time, I thought that the book was an extremely dull expose of the \\"evils\\" of Socialism. Well, it is. Only, you should save yourself a lot of time and energy reading 1984 instead.First and foremost, this book is an insult to anyone who ever studied or wrote philosophy. Ayn Rand herself has been quoted in several of her works as completely dismissing the works of much more intelligent and educated philosophers before her. I find it extremely ironic that she attempts to malevolently critique Hume and Nietzsche, and then bases a good portion of her material on their ideas. Equating this junk to philosophy is like calling Palmistry science.The ultimate irony is that she tries desperately to distance herself from \\"anarchists\\" and miserably fails. The book preys on the selfishness of its readers, justifying their reluctance to do things such as pay taxes or think of anyone but themselves. I would highly recommend that anyone reading this review simply ignore the cultish ramblings of most of those who give this book a high rating.Philosophically, as stated above, the book preys on human selfishness to self-validate itself. The logic, when it is present at all, is circular and based on unproven axioms. If you are looking for a good look into the mind of Greenspan and Trump, look no further. This work of \\"literature\\" is nothing more than over 1000 pages of literary self-pleasure, masking its immature and silly \\"philosophic\\" claims in complicated syntax. If you ever wondered what happened to the 13 year-olds that threw tantrums in the face of authority simply for the pleasure of resisting, look no further. To discover a cult worse than anarchism, please read this book. This is what anti-statists and anarchists become when they receive their first paycheck.The book also mocks religion, implying that it is the faith of the weak. Interestingly, Rand then titles one of her chapters \\"A is A\\" implying that believing that anything is anything else than what is evident by the senses stupid. The book completely rejects skepticism and Rand herself has remarked, \\"I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism, and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.\\" She also denies the existence of a priori knowledge, as first exposed by Descartes. Examination of the provided quote reveals this childish attempt at justification of this hypocrisy: faith is a lie, but everything she says must be true if we accept her silly supposition. That sounds suspiciously like faith to me.Economically, the book reads like a childish daydream of mystical fairies and lollypops. Rand wants you to believe that her \\"capitalism anarchy\\" can and will work in the real world. To prove this, she writes a book set in a utopian fictional world. This, of course, speaks of the logic of someone who cannot prove much of anything at all. Her characters are one-dimensional and shallow. Her antagonists are weak and easily disposed of, while her protagonists are stunningly beautiful and intelligent.Her views on sex and women are enough to make anyone cringe. Her female character engages in the most horrid and disgusting sex, devoid of emotion, solely for the pleasure of feeling dominated by a man. Keep in mind that Ayn Rand herself maintains that a woman could never be president, and should never be president. Not only does Rand pay on the easily manipulated minds of the selfish and amoral, she is a traitor to her sex.If you want to further alienate yourself from humanity and reality and create delusions of your supremacy, please read this book. Her entire philosophy reeks of this all-pervasive feeling of \\"specialness\\": that you are the most important and special person in the entire world. Her characters interact on this principle, lamenting how pathetic and shallow the rest of humanity is and equating what they think of \\"weakness\\" with evil.Her vision of the CEO is sophomoric and speaks of her illusionary reality. Her characters work hard and get what they deserve without cheating anyone or hurting anyone's feelings. They also are punished when they fail and hated for their flaws. Anyone with a television knows that the term \\"moral CEO\\" is an oxymoron. Rand wants to imply that the capitalist does what is best for them, but will never hurt anyone's feelings, without explaining how exactly this is possible or logical. A third-grader's perusal of top news stories would prove sufficient antidotal evidence otherwise.Her characters, not only shallow and amoral, are also sociopaths. They are incapable of having a human conversation without going into long boring tirades of the evils of Communism, laziness, and Socialism. Even a complete idiot can tell you that nobody talks like that in real life, even philosophers.In conclusion, you can save yourself from reading this mammoth book with the following summary: \\"perfect woman meets perfect man, has perfect philosophic conversations about the evils of socialism that are poorly masking their selfishness and egocentrism, overcomes ugly and confused opponents, and then makes kinky perfect love\\". In short, I blame this book for half the moral bankruptcy of America. Thank you Ayn Rand for wasting my time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Upon reading Atlas Shrugged, I expected the book to be a mind opening experience, being that I am a recent college graduate learning to deal with the corporate world, in which I expected this book to have it's themes. I have never been more disappointed in my life. Here are the reasons:As an economics major, I can speak first hand to the invalidity of Ms. Rand's philosophy. Her philosophy is narrow-minded, and really has no factual basis. She has little understanding of capitalism, it seems that all she really does is highlight the extreme negative qualities of communism (she spent part of her life under that system in Soviet Russia). She fails to recognize the many different social programs and government interventions that are absolutely necessary for a sound economy, instead she offers a utopian view of laisse faire capitalism in which everything works like clockwork when the government just butts out. A history lesson for all of you that agree with her...look up the late 1800s and read about what happens when there is laisse faire capitalism. Exploitation, poverty, etc. Another example is the dust bowl of the 1930's before subsidized farming.Another reason I did not like this book is that the plot dragged and I felt it was poorly written. Ms. Rand really beat a dead horse through many of the chapters to prove her points, which of course I didn't agree with at all. The book also gave a view that people are an &quot;island&quot;, meaning what we do does not affect other people, so in her view everyone should be completely selfish and do things only for themselves. This is also entirely untrue...everything that people do has a ripple effect through those around us, whether we see it or not. Once again, Rand offers a very adolescent philosophy on life.Another thing that surprised me was Rand's chaevenistic view of women and condescention of the common man. I expected Dagny Taggart to be a strong, self-sufficient character, which she is in the beginning. But what Rand is really saying through her need of and submission to Francisco, Reardon, and ultimately Gault, is that even the strongest woman ultimately gives herself up to a man. This is part of Rands whole &quot;hero worship&quot; theme, which I think is rather warped. She also treats the common man as a useless, mindless creature that the world can do without, as the world crumbles when Galt recruits the great minds to his utopia, and of course the utopia flourishes with just the &quot;producers.&quot; In her world, only the greatest minds, essentially the leaders are needed (hero worship again.) Once again, she fails to see the big picture. Where would the world be without people to tend farms, work in factories, pump gas, and flip burgers? She fails to see that everyone is part of one big machine, again she thinks that people are all individual islands that either produce or loot those that do. I thought that this was also ridiculous, as I disagree with just about everything Ayn Rand stands for.This book was nothing more than a pretentious, drawn out manifesto in the disguise of a mystery story if you ask me. Her ideas are warped and her philosophies are narrow and innacurate. All in all, I don't see how people consider Ayn Rand and influential thinker. She offers the viewpoints of a troubled teenager, not a great thinker."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are a few reasons for which I will regard this text as lowly as I do. Yes it is influential, and it is most certainly engaging. I have always believed that Ayn Rand should have stayed a novelist, she had talent there. It is in the realm of philosophy that she faltered so greatly. I would be the first to praise Fountainhead, but unfortunately Atlas Shrugged amounts to little more than propaganda writing. I know that this is a word that is far too often misused so I will clarify what I mean. I do not believe an artist or writer or creator of any sort should have the theme and meaning of a work in mind at the start of the work. The result is usually a heavyhanded and overbearing expression of that theme. It is never more apparent than in this book. Every industrialist is a noble, brilliant creature who fights against all odds to make what they have. Conversely, every one who opposes them is an ignorant peon who should be grateful for what they have. In life dichotomies are never this clean, and here it is a little too blatantly flawed. Aren't there industrialists who just inhereted there father's hard work and do nothing? Aren't there noble workers who are just trying to get fair treatment? The truth is much more ambiguous than it is being painted here. She (and I know she would hate me for saying this) mirrors the communist pamphlet writers that she hates so much when she approaches her epic tome as she has. Every character serves only to reinforce the theme she is trying to shove down her readers throats. My other huge problem is that all this heavyhanded propaganda is being served up for so-called objectivism. I don't completely disagree with her beliefs. I first and foremost absolutely disagree that she named them at all. She gave her philosophy as if these philosophical tenets are original or somehow different that what came before. They are not, at all. Her basic core consists that there is an objective nature to everything and that logic is man's great tool. Okay, and countless philosophers from Heraclitus to Plato to the analytics believed these very same ideas and expressed them much clearer than Rand ever did. I am repulsed that her and her followers pretended that she was breaking new ground when she was just restating an old idea just not as well. Then her main belief of everyone being free and independent. Paraphrasing Galt's Creed, I will live in freedom where I depend on no one and no one depends on me. That's great Ms. Rand, try reading Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche's expression of this is much better. Not to mention that every existentialist and phenomenoligist had this view point. It doesn't bother me that Rand did, just that she had the nerve to declare it a new school of philosophy. The problem is, the second branch, i.e. the rabid individualism, completely contradicts the first, the objective nature to everything. If everyone is a complete autonomous unit unto themselves, this lends itself to view of extreme subjectivity. Note Nietzsche, Sartre, Heidegger, Camus and so forth. My larger point is that this book is overrated and her philosophy is both extraordinarily unoriginal and deeply flawed. Let's just say that there are a great many reasons why the only school in the country, nay the world, that teaches Objectivism is the Ayn Rand institute. The fact that the this novel is impossible to separate from her philosophical ideals is ultimately its downfall. Yes it can make one feel empowered, but a rather forced and shallow empowerment it is. Read the Fountainhead, but her egoism is not worth the trip of this epic faillure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm a thirteen year-old seventh grader and I got this book for my birthday. I thought that it was pretty good, and I agree with a lot of Rand's philosophy, but I disagree with a lot more. The storyline was great, but the speech kinda ruined it. I thought Dagny and Francisco should have ended up together. She thinks that every man should work to earn their money, not be given it by welfare. I totally agree. You shouldn't take hard-earned money from people who deserve it. But she also thinks that you shouldn't even help people, shouldn't mourn or care about them. That's whack. Even if you don't like someone, you should still respect them as having different views than you. Some of her beliefs on sacrifice are pretty odd too. Sometimes what she said on one page was totally contradicted on the next. She left the reader with a vague, unsatisfied feeling so that she could get people who didn't understand the book to believe what she said. Also she's very naive. She thinks that the prime movers are the only people that can do ANY work, and she thinks all prime movers are objectivist. Yeah right. Wouldn't it surprise her to know that Bill Gates, the richest man in the U.S., actually cares about public opinion, makes products for the public, and is a very nice guy? Also, Dagny had sex with about every man in the book that had time to take his clothes off and she didn't get pregnant, nor was the fact that she could have ever gotten pregnant ever confronted or given thought. But overall, I have to give the book four/five stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had really hoped to enjoy this book more than I did. I consider myself a Laissez Faire leaning Libertarian. I am glad that I finished the book, but considering as little as I enjoyed it, I wish it had been much shorter than 1100+ pages.My biggest confusion with Rand's philosophy is her worship, yet simultaneous admonishment of Greed. With Chapters such as \\"The Utopia of Greed\\" and \\"Anti-Greed\\"- which is a Chapter explaining the failures of not being greedy- I find no mutual ground with her in terms of economic liberty. She \\"speaks\\" out of both sides of her mouth. To her, it is moral that John Galt and company are \\"greedy\\" (which is hard pressed to find their display of this behavior), yet immoral for James Taggart and company to be greedy. I think perhaps, her usage of the term \\"Greed\\" is incorrect and became a major distraction for me. Greed is a rapacious desire to obtain material wealth- meaning one will lie, cheat, and steal to obtain possessions. This does not seem to be the character displayed by any of the producers in the book. Greed is antithetical to Galt's speech, yet Rand seems to use Greed as her philosophy's cornerstone. Greed is not trading value for value- it is trading value for non-value. Economic liberty is founded upon trading value for value- not otherwise. Greed was displayed in the character of Rand's looters and would have served better showing their greed as being their moral downfall.In regards to Rand's mystics...I felt that her dissection of the Statists, or the Mystics of Muscle, was perfect. I cannot recall another book that explained the motivations of Statists so well. Unfortunately, I was distracted again by her Mystics of Spirit. Yes, there are many Collectivists who use the power of the Church rather than the power of the State to rule mankind. I would hope to believe that these people were those she spoke of- not all people of faith- but she never specified. I am a Christian, but my strong sense of Liberty is rooted in my faith, not stifled. There are certainly individuals over the centuries who have used faith as an excuse for collectivization, but if scratched hard enough, their faith in a loving God is a thin veneer for power over the naive and unstudied. There are plenty of Scriptures that in fact support Rand's desire for economic liberty. For instance, not to muzzle the ox as it treads (Deut 25:4), to have balanced weights and measures (Prov 11:1), the worker deserves his wages (I Tim 5), etc etc. For someone to refer to the founding fathers as much as she does, who were mostly Christians or at the least Deists, I find it interesting that she finds such a contradiction between Liberty and Faith.This is a book of Utopian society. It is worth reading simply because it is an anti-collectivist society (to a degree) and is a fresh breath from all the other collectivist Utopias. Would it work? Perhaps, in the first generation. Once Dagny and her multiple hot lovers leave their New Atlantis to their children- it will simply be a return to the old ways of human nature- the unremitting struggle between freedom and slavery. Perhaps, I enjoyed the book very little because I am a believer in Economic Liberty (as well as most Individual Liberties) and feel that Rand is doing us Libertarians no favor by including Greed as a pillar of our belief system. Greed is a vice, not a virtue. Perhaps, I'm breaking rank with my fellow freedom lovers, but I won't stand by anyone diluting the message of liberty with inane worship of a depraved behavior. Sex is a great experience, Rape is not. Trade is a great experience, Greed is not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As novels go, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is not your father's Oldmobile. It is an overwrought, overlong, overstated, didactic diatribe against creeping socialism which features a seventy-page speech articulating the idea of a capitalist utopia that stands as the novel's intellectual zenith. For all of its excesses, the novel remains truly wondrous and powerful in its eloquence -- a stark and stylized glimpse at what our world CAN be from the mind of a truly unique visionary.It is little wonder that this novel has captured the imagination of so many these past forty-plus years. The futuristic society collapsing under the weight of its own bureaucracy is more frighteningly real today than it was in 1957. Our government has become so gargantuan and unwieldy and even sinister (remember the grassy knoll? -- Abraham, Martin and John?) that the glacial erosion of our personal liberties seems an inevitable truth that we must accept in the name of our own national security.The politics we know today is no longer a public debate over competing intellectual visions. The &quot;V&quot; word has no place in the politics of the modern. Our train is now commandeered by two parties of engineers that fight for control of the wheel yet disregard that the tracks ahead are out.In our quest for individual identity, our society has ignored the crying need for a Grand Unification -- for a culture that respects our individual differences but accepts that we share a common goal. That goal is our shared Vision. Rand's Objectivism has been displaced in today's world by a subjective set of disparate beliefs that denies any ultimate Truth (however elusive) and has effectively suctioned away the values that originally helped undergird this nation. In their absence, a vacuum has been created into which Rand's &quot;Brave New World&quot; fits nicely.Whether you subscribe fully to her Objectivist philosophy is unimportant. There is so much here that IS true that -- like it or not -- some of it will change you indelibly. In the process, what Rand's novel does convince you is that if a world is ripe for change, the right person with the right idea is the most powerful thing on Earth. When the world is overrun by vermin, the Better Mousetrap will have the world beating a path to your door.Yes, there is a better world out there and there still is hope we'll find it. Only when we seek the qualities of a John Galt in our elected officials will we force our political parties to offer him or her as a candidate."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"And am still wondering. As both a novel and an outline of philosophy, this book failed for me. The first third of the novel or so had me going--it was almost a suspense story and I wanted to solve the mystery of &quot;who is John Galt?&quot;. But as the book moved on, I found myself not caring about any of the characters. Real people do not fit into such narrowly black and white categories. Everyone is either an industrialist paragon of virtue or a government bureaucratic type who is spineless, selfish, and stupid. Dagny Taggart, the only real female character in the novel, jumps into bed with one powerful man to the next, and they cede her to each other as a sort of prize won. The last third of the book was torture. I have read few things less enjoyable to plod through than Galt's 60 (60!) page radio broadcast at the end. I kept reading, though, because I thought surely the author wouldn't have put this in without having something important or new to say? Nope, just a repetition of everything that had already been hammered home without sublety in the rest of the book. The whole book would have benefitted from a more judicious editor"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What I've found so satisfying about this book is how the sum of its entire meaning so consistently fails to echo anything before it. Reason, Individualism, Capitalism, and Egoism are not concepts created in AS, but are united into a meaningful whole, with a common unshakable root: read the book. It doesn't do any good to just say this, you have to read it and spend genuine effort thinking about the philosophical essentials and trying to find fault with them. You'll have to use them to deny them, but it's still good to try, just to convince yourself.To the negative minded: do you have a positive you uphold and defend? Is this why you attack AS, because it is so opposed to your shining ideal? What is this ideal, so that I may know it and stand corrected? I'm all the more eager to learn it if it isn't rooted in collectivism and religion, both of which have such a rich history of slavery, death, and destruction (Nazism, Fascism, Communism, The Dark Ages, etc.).Also I would like to help out the arguments (and even the rants) of others who strongly dislike AS, so that you don't humiliate yourselves so much in the future. It hardly does you any good to denounce Objectivists by calling them &quot;slavish&quot; or &quot;cultists&quot;. What is to be a cultist or slave but to be a collectivist or under the power of one? Next you'll have to say that we want to force everyone to agree with us and that we want to dominate our fellow men, and that we are unthinking and blind followers, that Rand is our God, and the head of an Objectivist State. If you want to make us (and anyone who can make a rational connection) laugh, then feel free, because we will then know that you never bothered to find out what Objectivism is, or can't, in which case you have my deepest sympathy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I would simply like to say that this book stinks. It's a long-winded and malicious treatise by a second-rate demagogue who was about as dense as her devoted followers. She considers the majority of people in this world to be parasites, but it is her self-centered philosophy that is truly parasitical. I would like to say this, but the pro-Rand forces might make enough of a stink with Amazon to censure me, just like they did many of their previous critics. Like Rand, it seems, the Objectivist notion of freedom applies only to the few they select."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is extraordinary Rand's adherents refer to ATLAS SHRUGGED as her \\"masterpiece\\" with no small measure of pride, since the book is the literary equivalent of a train wreck. Of course, all of her \\"work\\" is basically indistinguishable unless you are actually concerned with drawing absurd distinctions between her ridiculous characters. They are not really characters; instead she has two tedious characterizations which she then fails to personify as characters in any reasonable way. Reading SHRUGGED gives the same sense of macabre voyeurism one would feel at some gruesome accident. My jaw continually dropped in grim fascination every few pages after some banal spew was passed off in the most hapless, disjointed prose this side of the tenth grade as some sort of self-evident profundity. Her laborious and redundant writing ought to be regarded as insults by those \\"objectively\\" convinced of their uniqueness.Basically, SHRUGGED is an appeal to the anxious and afraid personality. It is no wonder that the deeply insecure would be the most responsive to her one-dimensional cosmology, since any actual human remotely resembling her heroes would be out enthusiastically mining uranium with a garden trowel or something. Rand's version of heroism is tailor-made for the self-loathing; a simulated philosophy in which the angst-ridden and privileged irresponsible can retreat. Instead of celebrating industrial Atlases, Rand creates a safety blanket of rationalizations for the dysfunctional. Her form of the hero and her celebration of that form are contradictory; she lathers sentimentality on the rational egoist for being so unsentimental, so that he can have significance. In Rand's world, the indifferent hero desperately needs to be worshipped.Debating the pros and cons of \\"objectivism\\" entirely misses the point. There is really no substance to any sort of philosophy that is discussable. For all the blathering about reason, it is never utilized to support the validity of her worldview. For instance, skip the 1000+ pages of drivel and open the back cover. Then read the \`Essentials of Objectivism.' Note the declarative statements of what constitutes metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, etc. Then note the reasoning used to support her claims.... This will prove difficult since there is absolutely none. For all of the pretension to being a rational \`Ism,' Rand's \\"principles\\" (doctrines) are really just a collection of meaningless, dogmatic claims that are not substantiated in any way. A theory involves a system of concepts that are related to each other in a logical way (e.g., Premise & Premise therefore Conclusion). Objectivism does not even bother to do that. One's premises must be justified in order for one's conclusion to be sound. Objectivism does not even rate being called \\"pseudo-philosophy,\\" rather it is a set of bizarre, hackneyed claims that have no relationship to the things they are ostensibly about.Objectivism is basically an aesthetic in the sense of it being a mirage of self-validating flavors. To even need this monotonous mirage is to contradict it, thus an absurdity. Not only that, Rand's mirage is a quasi-individualism that requires all the individualists to be exactly alike. An inward sterility is the only way an individual can acquire meaning, thus to be unique is to be in a dull conformity with the other heroes. For Rand, genuine interpersonal relationships are based on rape, both in the abstract and the real, showing nothing more than an incapacity to relate to others. How bizarre is that? No wonder Rand needed cult techniques to create a collective of toadies to tell her that her individualism has significance."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As a literature, Atlas Shrugged is pretty poor. Much like The Fountainhead, take away the heavy handed philosophy and what you have is basically a trash novel. Like many people searching for answers in their youth, seeing the world as evil and rejecting religion, I found Rands work to be remarkably cogent. Now I know better. In Rands world, everyone who thinks differently is a cartoon characature of evil. (Think Snidley Whiplash). John Galt (aka Howard Roark) is the superman who mesmerizes the public, when in actuality his \\"brilliance\\" is full of blowhard contradictions and rationalizations -- much like Rand herself. For an \\"objective\\" view on Ayn rand, see the movie \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand.\\" It's great, but for selective tastes. Fans of Rand will hate it while those unfamiliar with her work won't get it. But for those who see the good and bad in her work, it's on the money. She certainly had something to offer and this (overlong) book is probably the best place to understand her views. They were ahead of their time but the theme is wearing thin -- or should I say, in a world is more \\"objective\\" than ever, the same problems exist. That's human nature -- something Ayn Rand never understood very well."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it to see what all of the fuss was about. First I read Fountainhead and found it interesting, even though it was a bit heavy-handed. I think Fountainhead was a much better book; probably because I could see some depth in the characters and it was the first time I had been exposed to Rand's point of view. Sadly, Rand covers a lot of the same ground with Atlas and the characters in Atlas are one-dimensional. The reader gets to choose from strong,smart, manly heroes (Dagny included) and the smarmy, wimpy, whining losers that make up all of the characters with few exceptions. I understood early on that Government was bad, the Creators were good, and the rest of the people were pawns, but Rand goes over and over and over the same territory. Did I mention that she goes over the same territory again and again?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The world would be a more productive place.

The book is quite well written and enjoyable.I read this book several years ago and I've never been quite the same as I was before reading it.

It will rock your world, quite simply."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read that book about seven years ago because I was intensely curious about Ayn Rand and her books. So many people waiting for the bus or riding one seemed to be into her books so I bought a hardback edition and started reading it. I could not stop reading it and turning the pages. When I came to the last page, I was so terribly disappointed that the marvellous story had to come to the end. I WANTED MORE!!!That book made me see how the material value is determined and how it is diminished by the intensive governmental intervention as well as the corporate interference.The strong parallel between the society as depicted in the 1957 book and the society in reality is astoundingly accurate. You owe it to yourself to read this book as to understand the financial crisis of 2008 better.Ayn Rand does understand the economy and its ramification on the modern society so splendidly. She also told it very brilliantly.I shan't reveal who is John Galt and what is the \\"motor\\" that moved the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I love this story.

It brings a whole new layer to the characters, especially Dagny.Rand makes you think about your life and how you react when faced with a challenge or decision. It makes you question charity and welfare. It makes you wonder why some people are in destitute situations when there are always jobs to do, even if they are less than desirable or require more work than one might get paid for."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged should be thought of as a sequel in imagery only to her other classic -The Fountainhead. This novel fortells the destruction/implosion of American society by our fatalistic approach to living without concern for others and society at large. Mrs Rand style of writing is somewhat gossip columnish in frank style but is still effective in portraying the major characters faults, aspirations and actions with vivid color. The novel denotes the struggle of a brother (Jim) and sister (Dagny) Taggert who run the family business of the Taggert Transcontinental Railway headlined by the Luxorious(?) Comet train. She vividly portrays Dagny Taggert's acumenal and better business management as being the only reason why their railroad line is still operation. Jim Taggert is only a figurehead at best with a few personal problems (he beats his wife and calls her a whore about a year into their marriage) he is a poor excuse for a human being in just every facet of your imagination. He should be restricted to a neighborhood cocktail lounge. But little at a time close friends and lovers of Dagny are introduced and expertly developed. The millionaire Reardon steel magnate who is married but bored with and out of love with his spouse. The idealist character-John Gault. An automotive engineer who develops an engine which runs on ambient light and heat energy. Dagny discovers this engine as it is left after the automobile factory closes and she becomes obsessed with finding its creator. There is a running line said well before and after she discovers this motor-Who is John Gault? The novel is 1168 pages long but it is captivating and obviously had a profound effect on societies intelligensia of the 1950's and 60's. It is a book were the pages tear easily and my binding is very weak after one read and the pages are soon to fall out. I wish this novels was housed in a better binding."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'd been recommended by my mentors in the self development field a million times to read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged before I finally got round to getting it: Christmas 2006 - some six years after I'd first heard of it. And even then, it lay dormant on the bookshelf for another few months. Before I continue, let me point out that there will be spoilers of form in this review.Being an avid reader of anything self development, its one thousand plus pages put me off reading it, since I was expecting a much shorter, non fiction book of true self help style and not some monster of fiction; I didn't want to spend a few weeks or months plowing through a book, hoping it would measure up, only to discover I'd wasted my time on rubbish when it could've been spent on a decent read, such is the value I place on my time.Eventually, on reading the synopsis one day, which resonated heavily with the philosophy I'd been furiously honing for a while, I decided it was time to delve in, reasoning that it was now or never. And was I pleasantly surprised. The more I read, the more I couldn't believe what I was reading! Every chapter, every scene, every interaction, left me reeling and exclaiming, \\"Yes! That is how to live!\\"To say that this book, which is the fictional representation of Ayn's 'Objectivist' philosophy, fit with my own, new, growing philosophy - is an understatement. Rather, at a time when I was just building the foundation for my site, I was suddenly given fresh purpose and impetus.The book itself is very well written. The plots are racy, the characters - deep, the backdrops - massive and the moral - right. Ayn Rand leaves no stone unturned in giving a detailed background on all major characters - and even some of the smaller, less important ones.The book's events are broken down from every relevant viewpoint, allowing you to form your own alliances with the teams and characters of your own, calculated choice. Although you won't have gone too far in Atlas Shrugged before taking the right side.Indeed, for anyone that has a flicker of, at the very least, 'suppressed' anger at the seemingly unrelenting, merciless, surreptitious journey toward a totalitarian state - worldwide, I challenge you to not get riled and fired-up at the evil in the book - because it is this evil which is represented in our media today.The antics of the enemy in the book will fill you with fight, passion, cause and ambition and you will duly feel inspired to become your own version of a Hank Rearden, John Galt, Dagny Taggart, to step out your door and face our own Dr. Robert Stadlers, Mr. Thompsons and Jim Taggarts. And you wouldn't be alone: A poll carried out in 1991, by The Library Of Congress and The Book Of The Month Club reported Atlas Shrugged to be the second most influential book behind the Bible.And if a survey of 1,239 American adults - conducted by Freestar Media/Zogby between October 10 and October 14, 2007 - asking the question, \\"Have you ever read the book Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand?\\" is anything to go by, its 8.1% affirmative would seem to suggest that I'm not a member of an exclusive club in being a reader myself.Quite simply, if you're reading this review, there's a good chance that this book will do something to you. Something good. I strongly recommend you make it the very next book you read. And when you have, come and tell me what you think.

I thought it was a great book, and it was the first book that really attracted my mindset to this philosophy. Though, I think everyone can learn a lot from this book, I really think it should not be taken in the literal sense. Think about the main themes of this book: \\"Free-thinking,\\" \\"Selfishness,\\" \\"Importance of Mind,\\" etc. It displays these themes greatly, and gives great examples in order to persuade someone in this philosophy.This book, however, is a starter. Once you grasp the concepts in the book and change how you see everyday life, and how people are motivated, take a step back and make your decisions in light of this. Work hard, learn, and do things for yourself, but I think in light of this, you can make a change in others lives, as well (even to not expect things in return).I respect that a man/woman who works hard earns their reward and has NO OBLIGATION to share it, but I admire the person who does work hard for themselves, but can also find it in themselves to work hard for others, as well.Rand's \\"Free-thinking\\" scheme is just that.

The book has its redeeming moments and weaves in and out of some very interesting sub plots, but it is just too over- simplified and most of it antagonists too one dimensional to be given any attention. The indutries if the U.S. are bascially run by only a handful of individuals - no stockholders, no real board of directors (That term was always a no-no - see &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;). Although purporting a somewhat futuristic look at the world, it just for some reason ends up not &quot;feeling right&quot; - 1950 set at the new millemium.Also, Ms. Rand's attempt at writing an action novel in parts, reads like a cheap dime novel. Overall, I liked it more than I disliked it, but for the amount of time it required, it just wasn't worth it. For the newly initiated, read &quot;We the Living&quot; instead.

I have read this book several times and cannot decide between two opposing opinions about the work as a novel. (The ideas stand alone.) On the one hand, her characters are all a bit two-dimensional, and the scenes melodramatic. This sometimes makes it hard to swallow.

You can hardly blame anyone. The book usually runs about 1200 pages and has type similar to what's found in stereo instructions, with about the same level of excitement.This may be due to the fact that the author Rand is not english speaking, but in fact Russian, and likely wrote the book as some knee jerk reaction to Communism. However if you want GOOD knee jerks reactions to Communism, just read Animal Farm. This drivel doesn't have the of satire and realism Animal Farm does, which is strange, because it features talking animals.The book makes a case of Objectivism, however to make this case it needs to use a hypothetical story with humans who's actions lack any apparent emotion or humanity. Good guys are good, and only are good, in every scenario. Bad guys are bad, and are always bad, in every scenario. Whereas even in books like Animal Farm, their most atrocious characters often have redeeming qualities and vice versa. I imagine the reason for this is her \\"philosophy\\", much like Marx on the Liberal end of the same spectrum, seems to crumble when real people are used to illustrate it.The whole point of the book is Atlas, in this case a train company with a super metal, \\"shrugs\\", deciding to take their technology and form a ConservaUtopia where rugged self determinism reigns, and the world crumbles around them without Atlas to support it.However only sociopaths, which the characters are, believe themselves Atlas. Believe that if they shrug, taking their brilliance away, that no one else will take their place. Yet this happens, all the time. Calculus didn't go to the grave with Newton, nor did the assembly line with Ford, mostly because other people replicated and improved upon their work with their own.This is what essentially makes Atlas Shrugged ego masturbation. Atlas revolves around the belief that no one does good for it's own sake, but rather good is the result of the whims of a few select great and perfect people. If the Government attempts to piss them off with regulations they will leave the poor and unwashed masses to destroy themselves.This would, of course never happen, and the book must take wild leaps in logic to support the basics of the plot. For example, the super metal is created basically by one person, with only a passing mention of scientists (who apparently deserve no credit). No. No metalworkers, no foundry, no testing, no testers, just the will and perfection of one person with \\"special knowledge\\" no other man could possibly possess.Yeah. Okay.This is of course the very problem with Atlas Shrugged. Ironically, if she were right in this book, and companies or people \\"shrugging\\" really poised a threat to Government, Bill Gates wouldn't be a billionaire today."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged isn't the best written book around, and Ayn Rand's position isn't perfectly thought through, but it holds the essence of some very good sentiments, and as I imagine she didn't write it simply to amuse, if you can pull from it some applicable ideas, you'd be well off.I would never suggest that someone follow Ayn Rand's Objectivist position in its purity, I mean, unless you really believe that anyone who fails deserved it, and that there's enough to go around for everyone, even after you've gobbled up everything you can. But while she takes her position to the level of world domination and grants her characters the credit of having complete control of their destinies, (she completely disregards the impact of environment on a person's situation, and their attitudes towards life and everything in it) she also understands what very few people know: that the only path to self-respect and honest pride is to hold yourself to the standard of the rational being. I mean, once you reach a certain level of awareness, you can't pretend that you matter for magical or superstitious reasons (I'm including religion in that, sorry), you can't even really pretend that there's a greater fate for you than the grave, but you also can't let go of that sense that you matter, that you're worth looking up to, worth being remembered. So the only way to keep that sense of worth and meaning is to earn it, and the only way to earn it is to succeed, or at least to try your honest best to succeed.This is where Rand's contempt for the masses comes in, because she, like anyone who sees their situation rationally, is offended by people who are incapable of navigating through their life, of exerting control over it. She's offended simply because that control is there to be exerted, so, she reasons, of course they deserve what they get, if they fail to exert it. The problem I have with this, which is where I think many people have taken exeption to Rand's philosophy, is that there is some merit to compassion, and her philosophy leaves no room for it, simply because she believes that we all have perfectly free wills. I think this is a somewhat out-dated idea, at least in the intellectual community, but at the time that she was writing, the idea of determinism was less accepted. However, today, I think people are beginning to understand that someone who is homeless might just have a history worth factoring in before you go and decide that only an idiot could get themselves homeless. That history might very well include NOT learning certain \\"simple\\" life lessons (very simple when you're raised by an adult who knows enough to fill you in), such as \\"you're not worthless\\", or \\"hard work can achieve most anything\\".Rand doesn't forgive anyone for just being a human being, not so different from an ape, just one step removed really. But we can be more than an ape, if we choose to be, and THAT is where she is correct. Just don't fall into the trap of letting that idea justify stepping on others simply because they haven't seen, or learned, what you have, or because their experiences and life haven't prepared them to cope with the difficulties of facing Ayn Rand's ultimatum.So read the book, but don't go all or nothing on it, because it doesn't have it all, but it does have something worth gleaning."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read many philosophy books by the likes of Montaigne, Nietzsche, Marx, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, etc., but none has so enthralled me as that of Ayn Rand. Whilst I've often found parts of every philosophy I've read to be intriguing and even some times reasonable, never have I found such a book that inticed me to wish to look into many of said authors other works. Now, don't interpret this wrong, for I am very critical and would suggest that for any person that reads this book that they also become aware of the rational criticisms out there that exist, in fact, I recommend upon finishing this book, each individual read an article written by Michael Shermer of the Skeptics Society, entitled, The Unlikliest Cult. Rand's philosophy contains within it many idea's that could definitely enhance the way a person lives life in this world as well as understands it, but it can also work as a tool to limit many people who have a superficial and cynical outlook or predisposition towards others. If you've never read a philosophically inclined book before, don't let this experience limit future reading's with various schools of thought, always, continue to judge for yourself, because Rand's philosophy can enable many who allow it to, not to think for themselves."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I began reading Atlas Shrugged a few weeks ago, I had literally no idea what it was going to be like; I only bought it because a friend of mine who usually reads good stuff had been completely engrossed in it. Now that I've just finished it, my feelings are somewhat mixed.I agree with a lot of the comments that I've already read on this board. This book needed some good editing! It had already made its key points with the subtlety of a sledgehammer by the time it was halfway through, but then it kept repeating them OVER... and OVER... and OVER. (That speech at the end probably could have been about 20 pages shorter without sacrificing any of its content.) And the characters were ridiculously perfect; I don't mind that they were virtuous and smart, but then they all had to be ridiculously attractive, too? And HOW many people were in love with Dagny?!? With that said, I did find the story gripping, and once I got into it I didn't want to put it down.I definitely think that this book is primarily a vehicle for Ayn Rand's political/sociological/economic manifesto. This is not necessarily a bad thing; she had some good ideas which she was passionate about and I respect that. However, I think some people get so caught up in this that they don't inspect her ideas closely enough, because they are so enraptured with what they are reading. Rand paints the world as completely black and white, so some people come away from this book feeling that anyone who denigrates the novel must be in the camp of the morally depraved &quot;moochers and looters.&quot; For the record, I am a female engineering student at one of the world's top technical institutions, and I don't see myself ever becoming a &quot;looter&quot; in any sense of the word.My complaint against Rand's ecomonic theory is that it is valid in the oversimplified world of her novel, but less so in the real world. Rand makes a point of showing industrial giants such as Rearden who have buit their fortunes from the ground up, very Horatio Algers rags-to-riches-ish. By doing this, she implicitly (for once!) tells us that ANYONE can rise to greatness if only they have the right talent and drive. However, this sort of class mobility is virtually nonexistant in today's society. To those who question this assertion, I would highly recommend any number of contemporary sociology books, such as Jay MacLeod's &quot;Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations and Attainment in a Low-Income Neighborhood.&quot; This is why I question Rand's fierce opposition to ANY sort of need-based social welfare program: because there really are people who might have minds and spirits to equal Hank Rearden's, but who will never get the opportunity to use their talents to benefit (yes, benefit!) the rest of the world... unless they are granted some sort of non-profit aid. So I would disagree with Rand's fierce condemnation of any not for profit organization.Additionally, Rand worships money as an absolute standard of a product or service's worth. I have to wonder how she would address topics such as the discrepancy between the salary of a pro-athlete and a science teacher. Which person is contributing more value to the world? Yet which person is reaping the greater material reward? I'm sure that Rand, a great lover of intelligence and technology, would find the science teacher's work to be more worthwhile... so how would she explain the difference in rewards to these two people? I use this example to illustrates how money is not the absolute moral yardstick that Rand makes it out to be. Economic price setting and wage setting are much more complex (and sometimes flawed) than her basic money=value axiom assets.Despite these complaints, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to broaden their ideas and challenge their mind. It made me think about old issues in new ways, and it introduced me to a few ideas that were entirely new. I recommend it in the same sense that I recommend many Michael Moore films: it's often dogmatic, one-sided, and over-the-top, but it makes some good points and will get you thinking. (I doubt that either Moore or Rand would be thrilled with that comparison, but there you have it!)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You'll only be entertained if you agree with her philosophy wholesale or don't have one in ther first place, in which case you might want to kiss your free will goodbye. Lets be frank any philosophy that is based on a work of fiction can't be taken seriously.The characters are profoundly UNimaginitive, they're all the same, and how they react to situations flies in the face of the realities of human psychology (a science she had a profound distrust in). Granted, these heros are supposed to be exceptional, but the only way they're exceptional is how exceptionally boring they are, and how readily they engage in conniving, manipulative behavior (or \\"rational self-interest\\" to objectivists).The premise is flawed, too, since it rests on the mistaken assumption that if all the CEOs and captains of industry took off the world would just fall apart. Equating wealth with ability is the most obvious piece of fiction in her premise, wealthy people aren't exceptionally \\"able\\" so much as they are pathologically goal-oriented and opportunistic. Was rand naive or dishonest?I might reccommend \\"the fountainhead\\" instead, as it is a better book and slightly less long-winded and pretentious that atlas, but a warning to the uninitiated: All of Rand's novels are a vehicle she uses to indoctrinate the unsuspecting. (the word propaganda comes to mind) They're all preachy to a degree, and her later books are the worst in this regard; it's not surprising she dispensed with the pretense and retired to the bully pulpit after writing atlas shrugged.A proper career path would have been to formulate the philosophy FIRST and THEN write a book based on the philosophy. Doing the reverse just makes it look like you're, well, a loon. No wonder she was laughed at by academia. Sure, rand may have had a philosophy, but she hated people who disagreed with her, so she is disqualified as an intellectual, in my book. Even if some of her ideas had any merit (some did), she did them a disservice by not allowing them to undergo the academic scrutiny that ALL philisophical ideas undergo. If she had any confidence in her ideas, what did she have to fear? (yes, fear)She couldn't present her ideas calmly, so what you have is the over-reaching, paranoid invective that is atlas shrugged.Snap out of it, America, Rand was always just a writer of fiction of limited literary merit. It will be a cold day if you can find a reader who is NOT an objectivist say this is a literary masterpiece.And yes, I read this book twice back when I didn't know better. I used to be a fan, but I grew out of it. Some call it loss of idealism, I call it maturity."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"REASONS FOR READING THIS BOOK: First, it's a great story. Whatever differences you may have with Rand's philosophy, you'll probably be impressed with the way she presents it to you. The book gets a lot of flack for trying to be half-philosophical treatise and half-fiction, and not getting enough of either. And while I don't necessarily disagree, I will say this -- people who call the book pseudo-philosophy should be thankful she wasn't trying to rewrite the Critique of Pure Reason (Lord, I shudder at the thought), and the people who call it psuedo-fiction should be thankful she wasn't trying to rewrite War and Peace. Second, the book will make you think. As you might have noticed from the other 500 reviews, it's not a story that you will be neutral on; you will either rigorously agree or violently disagree. Third, some of the ideas themselves DO have substance to them, despite some of these scathing reviews, and it IS possible to have your life made better by reading this book.REASONS FOR NOT READING THIS BOOK: First, it's reeeeally long. The book easily could have been 400 pages shorter, but Rand likes to drive home her point by creating characters whose sole functions are to repeat things that other characters have said. Second, Rand is not nearly as original and she claims to be. She says at the end of the book that her only philosophical debt is to Aristotle, which is not only false but extremely arrogant, if that sort of thing sets you off. Third, many of her ideas just don't work. They look attractive on paper but don't translate well in real life (this, I suspect, partly explains why 90% of her fans consist of high school students who (a) have never read anything as &quot;intellectually weighty&quot; prior to this book and are therefore irresistably seduced by it, and (b) haven't experienced enough of the real world to realize that the human population can't be neatly broken down into the extremely intelligent and the extremely incompetent... there's a lot of middle ground that both Rand and her cult just don't take into account).As I read what I just wrote, I see that the reasons for not reading the book look a little stronger than the reasons for reading it. But I should say that I DID enjoy this book, and I do think you should read it... if for no other reason then to see what all the hubub is about."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow - what can I say. This is my favorite novel of all time. Rand comes the closest I've ever read to capturing the true nature of man in this novel. What a genius she was. The novel is a bit too long and the 10-page soliloquies could have easily been shortened without losing the point, but the characters are perfect symbols of human nature at its best (the heroes) and at its worst (the villains). Rand's use of language is musical:p. 761 - When describing the Sky & Streets of New York: \\"The sky had the stagnant breath of a furnace and the streets of New York were like pipes running, not with air and light, but with melted dust.\\"p. 832 - When Dagny's company started to faulter due to the lack of supplies in the world, Rand perfectly illustrates Dagny's anxiety: \\"An emergency file in her office kept a record of all the crucial materials still on hand, on every division of Taggart Transcontinental. Like the file of a bankrupt, it kept registering losses, while the rare additions of new supplies seemed like the malicious chuckles of some tormentor throwing crumbs at the starving continent.\\"Rand also uses an incredible amount of symbolism:-trains representing minds in motion--when the trains stopped running, minds stopped innovating (which in turn made more trains stop running)-train track respresenting man's life going in a straight direction, purposeful, not circular-dollar sign - the sign of the trader, the moral man-oak tree representing America, strong in the beginning, but rotting from within-steel/metal and the bracelet made of it - represented products of man's mind- and of course - Atlas Shrugging...to name a few. But the biggest contribution of Atlas Shrugged are the underlying themes that fill every page and promote Rand's self-designed philosophy of objectivism. Those themes are:-The Individual vs. The Public Good-True Values-Taking Responsibility for One's Own Actions-The Categorization of all as Looters, Moochers, & Producers-Stopping the World's Economy-Sex as an End to the Means of Production, the End Value-Greatest Virtue: To Make MoneyNeedless to say, I recommend it to anyone who can find the time to read a 1000 page book.

I also found it to be in that class. It had a profound effect on me. I was moved by it toward a (even more) conservative view of politics and economics, to the extent of becoming a little too \\"mean spirited\\" and maybe a little paranoid. I realize now that Ms. Rand is considered by some, accurately in my estimation, to have been an extremist. She was also an atheist, which viewpoint leaves one without hope outside of this world. Notwithstanding, her message regarding the liberal, anti-business, free lunch crowd rings through with refreshing clarity and truth. There is much wisdom in her philosophy, and as a bonus, this story wraps it in a great hard-to-put down novel. This is one of the great books of the 20th century.

I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in my late 20s, and the ideas presented in it blew me away, and I've questioned liberal policies ever since. Yes, Ayn Rand has some really long and boring speeches that made me want to say, \\"all right, already!\\" But the insidiousness of liberalism that holds the successful with such contempt while at the same time making them responsible for taking care of everyone else is spot on. I see examples of this day in and day out. Anyway, this was one of those books that changed the way I look at the world. Hey people, if you want to share the wealth, you need someone to generate it. Get out of their way, show them some respect, and have a little gratitude for the public benefits that result from private profit.

It depends on your worldview.This novel is about the de-evolution of America into a Socialist-verging-on-Communist nation and the fight (or non-fight) that pure industrialists put up against it. The government, in their attempts to \\"help\\" the lower classes advance, steal and loot everything (read: money and profit) from the hard-working individual, via taxes and moratoria on production, thus destroying any benefit of being a productive worker/member of society. With people having no incentive to work, the country's infrastructure crumbles, bringing the populace that the government was supposed to help down with it, thus exposing the goals of nihilistic politicians and the inherent fallacy of need-based beliefs/programs. This is just the backdrop of the plot; I will not give anything else away.I will be blunt and say that if you are a pure Capitalist, Republican or Independent, or believe that people benefit themselves and others by making money and being productive memebers of society, you WILL enjoy this novel. If you are a welfare recipient, a Democrat, voluntarily part of any left-leaning, organized labor union, or someone who believes in handouts and entitlements, you WILL NOT like this book. Although, if you identify with the latter group, you should still read this book.To summarize, Ayn Rand, with this novel, espouses the belief that in order to receive profit, whether it be monetary or not, you must be a person of ability, not need, and engage in the acts of working, trading and bartering, and living up to the high premise of moral self-interest. This in turn will allow for the mutual benefit of all parties privy to your actions: society. Then, and only then, can the individual truly be free."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not a review of the literary qualities, or the philosophical basis for the novel. It is not about whether I agree with it or not. It is about a clear message delivered by a book.Many of those who have criticized the novel for it's literary qualities have used their philosophical opinion of her viewpoint as a guage by which to judge it. I believe that is a backwards way of thinking.There are those that criticize her work for being too strong, too rigid, too uncompromising. She is criticized for not leaving room for other points of view. Personally, I think the world is desperately short of bold, well-thought out novels such as this that make no apologies. I can hardly make it through half a chapter of a philosophical novel without finding it so chalk-full of concessions that I can't find the author's opinion anymore. I end up with a watered-down, socially acceptable scrapbook of ethos by patricians with tenures to keep. They don't want to ruffle many feathers. I do not think that Ayn Rand should be criticized for explaining exactly what she thinks and why. For those who say that it's too black-and-white, or that it states there is a right-and-wrong,....for those who back down into the incomprehensible greyness of an infinite universe and claim that they are better off or smarter because of it shouldn't be judging a novel that took seven years to write, and many more years prior, to plan.If you think that the message of this novel is repetitive, look out at the world. People are all so afraid to stand up, to fight for what they believe. There are not enough people who are sure of themselves, confident and happy. If you are the author, how many different examples of greyness in society and in people will you have to address to completely accomplish your point?For those that criticize the novel for being so sure-of-itself, you probably prefer the grey, the temperate, the moderate. And the grey has become your new black-and-white--your new absolute, your new comfort and security in a world with which you cannot cope. There is no real thinking within the grey, only the vast space of feelings which do not dare.Once again, this review is about a clear message delivered by a book. The only reason you are disappointed at her \\"dogma,\\" is because she doesn't make room for you in her--and that is the point of the novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The world is full of Ayn Rand haters, lovers, worshipers, apologists, and everything in between. And then there are those few that honestly respect her. I am such a man, for of all people in the history of ideas, Ayn Rand is deserving of respect and admiration.The truth is that books like Atlas Shrugged demand quite a bit from their readers, more than most people can handle or give. But Ayn Rand never wanted to reach out to the masses. Rather, she focused her work towards the smallest minority on earth - the individual.If you have a working brain and you care about ideas then you must do yourself a monumental favor and read Atlas Shrugged. It is not easy nor is it simple. Everything that you know and believe may be questioned. But you will come away from the experience as either a better person or a furious one (or both, like me). Rand will hit you where it hurts with her passionate and truly brilliant story of what happens when the motor of the world stops.I owe Ayn Rand quite a bit so let me tell you that if you can properly integrate your life with her philosophy, it will be a good one - difficult or not (good does not always mean easy). Rand does not make life simple for her readers but she does give you the tools to live it well.Just remember two things. First - Don't try and \\"convert\\" your friends and loved ones to Rand's philosophy if they are not interested in hearing about it. You can better convince these people by allowing them to watch your own success in life. Many a friend has been lost by someone who couldn't reconcile their new found love of Ayn Rand with their old life. Judge your friends accordingly but also remember the value of benevolence when trying to deal with them. They can be swayed to better ideas with reason, and if not, you may just have to let them go - or accept them for the value that they bring you. After all, not all people accurately describe their values and ideas, yet many of them are worthy of praise and admiration nonetheless.Second - You don't need anyone's advice on integrating Rand's ideas. Do it on your own through books and introspection and live a happy life. Trying to please the 1000's of rand-fans and haters out there in the world will make you crazy. Ignore them. For the most part, Rand did too.Also read: Tai-Pan, Shogun and Noble House by James Clavell and Foundation by Issac Asimov."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading this monster of a book, there is no surprise in my mind why \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is one of the most influential books of our time. Three-dimensional characters. Intriguing plot. Unpredictable ending. It's all there. I've never read any book like \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and it's clear that there's no book like it.The main detraction from the book is not the book itself, but Rand's famous, or shall I say infamous, philosophy that came from it: objectivism. I'm not going to belabor the tenets of this philosophy for this review here, but I suggest that a reader need not be inhibited by that philosophy to enjoy this book. Indeed, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a platform for that very philosophy, and thus many will find it difficult to separate the two, particularly if they are familiar with it. That being said, if the reader can appreciate \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" for what it is, a great story that doesn't compare to any story out there, then you will enjoy it tremendously. The book will also force you to confront your own beliefs and in that regard, it is a positive thing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having heard high praise for this book, I was disappointed to find an allegory so blunt that I found it of little intellectual value. The characters fall into two classes: those who agree with Rand are beautiful, heroic, brave, and successful, holding up the world; those who disagree with Rand are ugly, cowardly, and ruining things for the heroes. All characters are static; no one changes sides or questions their beliefs. As a result, the book is predictable and stale, with the plot telegraphed only a few pages into the book.Furthermore, the plot is of minor consequence in the book. Rand introduces her objectivist philosophy through some very long speeches (one is ~60 pages, others are nearly as long). Most of the speeches reiterate one another; the book could have easily been half this length if the same ideas were not repeated constantly. Again, there is no room for moderation; readers are forced to choose one of two extremes.The objectivist philosophy, unfortunately, is doomed by its extremism. Rand believes that businesses exist only to make as much money as possible, and that they should be allowed to do so free of government intervention. One only needs to read recent headlines about Enron and WorldCom to realize that leaders of successful businesses are NOT always beautiful and heroic and that government intervention and regulation IS occasionally necessary. I would recommend that readers of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; also read &quot;The Jungle&quot;, an equally preachy book that shows the occasionally ugly side of unrestrained capitalism. Atlas Shrugged actually produced the opposite effect that Rand intended; I found myself sympathizing with and defending those that she calls cowards."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand believed passionately in freedom, and nothing expresses why with the power or to the degree that does Atlas Shrugged. Originally titled The Strike, this &quot;very long essay masquerading as a very long novel&quot; (in the words of Morton Blackwell) chronicles the voluntary withdrawal from society of the inventive, entreprenureal class in the face of growing collectivism, and the societal collapse that results. While Rand wrote at mid-century, readers who lived through the following fifty years will appreciate just how insightful she was, and the haunting parallels to life in the East Bloc, socialist Western Europe, and our own United States.Atlas Shrugged makes the most compelling case for economic and political freedom you will likely ever read. Few books have ever had such influence, and the book loses nothing with age.Nevertheless, the reader must understand up front that Rand was more than a libertarian, and that her cultic &quot;Objectivism&quot; was far more than a philosophy. Much more of Atlas Shrugged than not (and far more of libertarianism than not) is consistent with Christian thought; but the Christian reader must pay close attention to Rand's more seductive passages (and would do well to analyze closely John Galt's 60-page [!] speech at the end), because some of her thoughts are not what they appear to the less astute reader, and her philosophy is militantly (hostilly) atheistic.Even so, this is a masterpiece of freedom, and simply must be read and appreciated. There is nothing like it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As this is a book review, I make no commentary on the validity or efficacy of Rand's philosophy. Clearly her books continue to exert strong influences. However, it would be far easier to claim Rand the greatest philosopher of her time than to claim her even a passable novelist. Simply put, this book is poorly written. Wordy enough to make even D.H. Lawrence blush, the text is repetitive and bereft of nuance. Also, one might argue that the Brothers Grimm created more fully developed characters than does Rand. Without question, this book served it's purpose; it gained a wide audience for Rand's philosophy. And that's not such a bad thing, because her ideas are in fact quite provocative and have a place at the table of debate. The writing itself, however, doesn't belong in the same conversation with the works of Conrad, Faulkner, Joyce, and other 20th Century masters. Come to think of it, it doesn't belong in the same stylistic conversation with John Grisham and Steven King.

But it's not really that:Rand takes no prisoners in this book. She is consistent in her insistence that anything that cannot be derived from objective reality and reason cannot be invested in---including all forms of organized religion, which she coldly and methodically dismantles as \\"mysticism\\".That passage, set up through the whole book (but driven home much later), was where my hair stood up, because most prominent modern-day conservatives love this book---but also consider religion to be the source of morality. Rand insists that morality springs from simple self-interest and reason, and her attacks on religion are every bit as brutal as her attacks on socialism. This made me wonder how many conservatives have actually read the whole thing!The downsides of this book are twofold:First, although an amazing epic, the sex scenes are almost laughably adolescent. Rand likes her men to be men, and to take what they want, roughly. I'd advise you to try to just endure those passages, or find them funny like I did, but just try to remember that you're not really reading the book for the bedroom scenes.Second, the book is quite long, and in several parts, less would have been more. I think this why I missed a lot the first time---I was probably skipping whole sections trying to get to the point--but instead I accidentally skipped OVER the point. You have to read every page.Overall, this is still one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It makes clear that we can either live in a world where we get what we want by voluntarily creating and exchanging value for value, or we can live in a world where we loot a shrinking productive-class and hope to trade the spoils through political pull---until the day the productive-class (\\"Atlas\\") shrugs."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Shrugged is a big book and should not reduced to a paperback of this size.

It's a hard read especially at first, but hang in there because its worth it. This book will challenge you to think and it will challenge your beliefs. I am a born again Christian. I make that point because even if you are or aren't, you can get a lot out of this book. Ayn Rand was an atheist and its very apparent. If you can get past your argument against atheism, this book will give you insight into why some people don't believe. She had such profound insight into human behavior. These behaviors are found in everyone, it's just that Christians think they are hiding behind their self righteousness :-)....I found this book so incredibly relevant. If you're a hard charger who's ever worked for a big company where politics are over production, you will appreciate this book. I understand if some people would shun this book because of her somewhat whacked out philosophies, but that would be a disservice to yourself and the wisdom and insight found in this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am assured, by the reviews, that this is a book worthy of my attention. The great books and authors have always spark controversy, and there is pleanty to go around on this cite. I have read several of Mrs. Rand's other books (both fiction and non) and have found all of them, in the least, intresting. Respect must be given to an author such as Ayn Rand, for even if one does care for her fiction or philosophy, at least you know what you do not like, and sometimes that is half of the battle. So thanks to all those who have taken the time to write their thoughts on this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas, I admit, is a awsome read.

Also read it in about five minute incraments or you may actually belive what Rand preaches! I wont try and sway you with tweleve hundred page books or long discussions in smoked filled rooms. I will however ask all of you that read this to have the courage and the intelligence to look deep inside and ask yourself not &quot;Who is John Gault&quot; but &quot;Why am I here&quot;.

Don't let the ideals put you off"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's magnum opus is definitely worth a read. A word of warning: this is not a typical novel. Be prepared for a world-view that you have not seen anywhere else. As you can see from the reviews below, Ms. Rand is loved--and hated--by many. My advice to anyone about to dive into her works: read it critically, but with an open mind. Let yourself be drawn into her fictional universe and exalt in the struggles and triumphs of her characters. Do not, however, assume that because Ayn Rand said it, it must be true. Do not let yourself enter the personality cult that has been constructed around her by Peikoff &amp; Co. Above all keep in mind--despite what she and her cult followers say--her philosophy is merely an outline with many incomplete technical areas. That does not mean what she has to say isn't worthwhile--it IS!--but that you will need to work at it to integrate the good things that Rand has to say with your own practical experience. What's the book about? Well, to boil it all down (and not give too much away) it begins as the story of a woman who runs a railroad company, struggling to keep her company prosperous in a dark and uncertain time. There is much, much more to the book than this...but this is how it begins. I only give the book four stars because it was quite long and, frankly, at times it was plodding. Overall though, it is an excellent novel with a revolutionary message. I think everyone ought to give it a read at least once in their lives!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is the most perceptive philosopher of our time (or any other). I can readily perceive why she has so many &quot;followers&quot; around the world. As a &quot;tax refugee&quot; from Europe, no one has to tell me how the &quot;weak&quot; feed upon the &quot;strong&quot; until nothing is left at all -- see Sweden. However, no matter how right she is or how passionate her cause, she is not the greatest writer and this is not the best book ever written. Ms. Rand can be &quot;long-winded&quot; (the central premise of this book could be fully articulated in a pamphlet) One character's speech runs an incredible 60 pages or more (depending on the edition). Ms. Rand not only beats the dead horse, she gives it riding lessons. She makes full use of the idea that truth=beauty=truth and that heroic figures (by definition) does not compromise. Ms Rand's female characters believe they will never submit to a man who is not strong enough to &quot;overpower&quot; them. These ideas did not originate with Rand (unless she is Greek and much older than she looks on the book jacket)but are widely used to criticise her books on the basis that she has a &quot;master race&quot; mentality or is a non-feminist. But, as a philosopher Ms. Rand has no peers. She completely eschews the idea that the acquistion of wealth must be atoned for by charity or austerity. I have never read a criticism of her philosophy that specifically pointed to flaws in her arguments. Most are personal attacks on Ms. Rand or the people who agree with her. I am still trying to understand how followers of the idea, &quot;I will live for no man and ask no man to live for me&quot; can be described as parasitic. Like Polonius, Ms. Rand says, &quot;Neither a borrower or a lender be&quot; only she extends this to every aspect of public and private life. The only other author I know who articulates this philosophy and is a much better writer is P.J. O'Rourke. However, Mr. O'Rourke's writings are often dimissed as humour (he is the funniest writer America ever produced) and his key arguments are easily lost by a lot of readers."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I tremendously enjoyed the plot and development of the story of Atlas Shrugged. The Objectivist philosophy, though, so pervades and weighes down the book, that I get this sense of a bitter old woman who just wanted to someone to throw her a bone every so often. But handouts are not the way our capitalist society should maintain the survival of others. Sure, the heroes are good guys. Sure, the villians are bad guys. Sure, the system isn't perfect. I agree with her on the self-importance of personal achievenment idea. I do not agree with her values, which, left open and by themselves, include extramarital sex, suicide, rape, theft - and they all have to be justified; which obviously denotes some sort of counter-intention. The love affairs, for some reason or another, come off as being the by-product of something totally cerebral, leaving the glass half-full, but also, half-empty.Rand's greatest contribution in ideals from Atlas is really not economic, or social, or even satirical, though. It is in her utopic vision of a man whose weight is in that dollar sign he produces, and whose values they are measured by, regardless of his or her acts. If you can swallow this, you'll like Atlas. If you can't, take the idea of usefulness to be rich out, and why we still need the wealthy to become wealthier in this country."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked up Atlas Shrugged and read it with very little knowledge of &quot;objectivism&quot;, other than it thrived off the virtue of selfishness. I found that I pretty much couldn't put the book down after I got deeply into it. The pages would pass by in hundreds, and even though the material was as long as 3 novels, it consistently kept my attention. For a book that's page count totals 1084 pages, 900 of them kept me riveted, which is a feat in itself. At around page 950, it seems as the story deteriates and Rand's personal views are the only topics remaining in the story. 50+ pages are used in a single speech (which isn't a hideous speech, do not get me wrong) but isn't exactly the approiate place for such a thing. From this point on, the story only deteriates into senseless acts that do not even reflect the Characters ideals. Atlas Shrugged seems more like a gigantic example of Rands Objective views. Even though Atlas Shrugged was a hefty delivery of objectivism, it brings up many interesting ideals and a clearly stated motive for objectivism. If anybody cares to listen to the word of neither a radical of objectivism, or a morally opposed patron, Atlas Shrugged is a decent book to read, but far from horrible, or the greatest thing written to date as long as 3 novels, it still kept my attention.

Love is a purely conditional thing to her: To be loved, you must earn it through achievements or admirable qualities, etc.So while John Locke would agree with her totally that nobody should be FORCED to provide another human a job, or have their liberty or property confiscated, for whatever the reason, he would have no problem with VOLUNTARY providing of assistance to a beggar. Ayn Rand, while acknowledging the freedom of people to do so, looks down on any altruistic act with scorn.Still her economic ideas, I at least believe, are quite correct and logically irrefutable. There are two world sets of premises here, the &quot;capitalist&quot; and the &quot;collectivist&quot; and the book then proceeds to run BOTH through the Logic chopper to their absolute conclusions. Human Emotions, which by nature aren't logical, are also sent through the logic chopper, which is what causes some people to have an uneasy feeling about the writing.One emotion/human idea that she hits dead on is the idea that people are &quot;whole&quot;: Your outward life is a reflection of what drives you inwardly. You can't operate in one endeavour by one worldview and another endeavour by another, without having some cracks form. As Fransisco d' Anconia puts it: &quot;Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I'll tell you his entire philosophy of life.&quot; That's true: Are you attracted to the form and function of an athletic body, and the discipline that went into making it that way, or are you attracted to the outward appearance of something, in the form of a specific type of clothing, and the message that conveys, etc.Try as some might to discredit Ayn Rand, nobody to this day has been able to refute Ayn Rands' economic ideas. At least not logically. The reason being is that her logic is absolute. Saying &quot;I don't like it&quot; is not a refutation, and &quot;It won't work collectively&quot; is not either, since what is the collective but a bunch of individuals. In that way, it's the Anti-Marx book: Marx CAN be refuted logically page after page, but it is a huge cry for humanity. (Logic example: only two classes--owner and worker/exploiter and exploited. It's a false dichtonomy since it does not take into account you can be both at the same time. I own stock in the company that I work for, which makes me an owner. So I am an owner of the company, but I'm also a worker, so therefore I'm exploiting myself.)&quot;What if the Prima Movers stop?&quot; Someone might ask. A typical response from an Anti-Rander would be: &quot;Someone would step in their place.&quot; But if someone could step in their place so readily, then there goes all arguments against the absolute existence of malevolent monopolies and their creators.In closing, this book is a great book in telling you why the East Bloc collapsed with massive defections over here, or why LBJ's &quot;Great Society&quot; has become an Irony in itself. I wouldn't base my concept of &quot;forgiveness&quot; on it though."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm glad I read this as an adult. Makes for great discussion.

The parallels are numerous: in each work, the protagonists believe they should do whatever they want without regard for anyone else; they make windy, pages-long speeches to that effect, and call it philosophizing; and they're both dull, repetitive behemoths that fail to justify their excessive length. Strange as it may be to say, I find de Sade's work the less offensive of the two: while his depictions of disgusting, violent sex acts made me gag, his portrayal of his nation's elites as corrupt and self-interested at least had a ring of truth to it. Ayn prefers to naively believe that her elites' self-interest serves as a guarantee against their corruption (Rearden gives a speech about it). Actually, her argument goes further than that: freeing society's elites from responsibility to anything other than their own conscience is the only way that society can survive. If she says so. I'm curious how this book came to be so popular with the far-right, Libertarian crowd. Rand may have intended 'Atlas Shrugged' as a model for a libertarian political philosophy, but in fact the book advocates an aristocratic, oligarchic social organization. Galt recruits only those exceptional people worthy of his ideas to come live in his mountain utopia; they watch the rest of the country starve, then burn, while Eddie Willers (competent, but not visionary) dies alone in the desert.As much as I'd like to complain about the novel's hollow characterizations, stilted dialogue, overheated romance novel prose, and petulant tone, those complaints seem to miss the point. The point of 'Atlas Shrugged,' after all, is the philosophy. I probably shouldn't have been surprised that the philosophy of 'Atlas Shrugged' was as amateurish as the rest of the book. But after years of hearing raves about the wonders of Objectivism's essential document (John Galt's speech), I guess I was just expecting something a little more rigorous. What I got was \\"A=A.\\" Seriously? That's it? That's a tautology, anyone with even a nodding acquaintance with epistemology can explain why that's problematic. I know Rand had little use for academic philosophers, but it's pretty ironic that someone who so strongly champions reason wouldn't at least be acquainted with formal logic.The bottom line for me is this: if you're serious about political philosophy, go read some political philosophy. If you're after an exciting novel that can make you think, check out Graham Greene or Raymond Chandler. Their novels don't shout their points at you, and you won't hurt your back picking them up.Curiosity drove me to read 'Atlas Shrugged' at roughly the same time it pushed me to read 'Twilight.' 'Twilight' was by far the better book"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The movie sparked interest in the book. the price set by the publisher quickley washed it away.

A failed attempt to replace moral values with the ruthless reality of business competition. The weakness of the arguments is utterly disappointing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every few years I pull out Atlas Shrugged and read it again. Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

The lengthy speeches also get to be a bit tedious, the gigantic radio speech made towards the end made me just about pass out from boredom - it seemed to be just the same words all the other characters had spewed out in all of their individual speeches, just strung along and coming out of one character's mouth. Thanks for the recap, Ayn, but I read the words fine the first time.Otherwise, I am fond of Dagny Taggert's character. For some reason I like her practical and &quot;Ice Queenish&quot; outlook on life - this character is quite opposite from me and she was presented well enough that I felt like I could see this world through her eyes. I'm just grateful the world in this book doesn't exist, at least not to this extreme degree.There is some good social commentary in there, and some things that will (or at least should) make you think. But, it's fiction, and I don't see the real world going this way anytime soon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Words cannot do justice to this masterpiece, to say the least of the astounding heroine who wrote it. I cannot believe that a woman of this magnitude existed on this earth and wrote a book like this. I wish there were more like her, but what Ayn Rand was only happens once. However, a happening like her is more than enough to last an eternity. Thank you Ms. Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think it's a mistake to just dismiss Ryan's work (and I enjoyed the Fountainhead) and also a mistake to not judge the book on what it is supposed to be. A novel. Not a poltical tract (although novels can cover poltical issues), but a novel.As a novel it can be alkward at times. We know right away in about a hundred pages who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. Anyone who is an English major is a fool, those who want to make money are &quot;gods&quot;. Those who seek charity to help the poor are suckers (at best) and rude idoits at worst. (as the relative who asks for money from Redrean but tells him they want it in cash so his name is not attached to the charity.)I guess I can see her point in the wish to get rid of restrictions that hold back progress and how sometimes the world punishs those who do &quot;good&quot; work (not morality but in terms of quality.) but this one sided arguement very quickly sounds like the arrogant chats I had in college with closed minded selfish men and women who saw their &quot;greatness&quot; even if it wasn't there. (And when it was there it was just something to put up with. I still think Hemingway is a great writer, but he could be a major ass at times. he was a great writer in spite of being an ass - not because of it.)I could take the book more seriously if the other side had a fair shot in the chat (the best art - like Shakespeare's - gives you both sides of the conflict of ideas) but as Ryan herself once said she was not intrested in debate but in full agreement in her views.But you can't deny her skill, just that this book is overrated. The Fountainhead is a bit better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The masterpiece and overture of Rand's 'Objectivism' philosophy- and beyond that atruly superior look into the realities of communism and capitalism and howthese concepts apply even to our every day lives"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In what should have been a good novel with a good storyline is instead a book killed both by the long-winded rambling of the author and the addition of the author's personal philosophy. This philosophy interspersed throughout the book (I can't call it a novel) kills the momentum of storyline many, many times....the chapter titled \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\" is especially intrusive to the storyline and can be skipped without missing anything from the story. The author should have instead written a companion book with her philosophical views and referred to sections of this book for clarification. Instead you have this book which should only be about 1/3 of its current length....it's about as much fun as reading a long textbook on a subject that doesn't interest anyone....it took me months to finish it....I wanted to continue following the storyline, but dreading to continue reading it because of the long-winded storytelling and philosophical addendums that kill the momentum of the story. (And that's pretty bad coming for someone who normally reads entire novels in just a few days.)In regards to the author's philosophy itself, it's a pity that the author chooses to lump all religions together and just refer to them as mystics. As is typical of immigrants from Russia, she mentions \\"reality\\" a lot and rejects, without reason, all religion....relying totally on only what she is capable of seeing with her five physical senses. This, again, is typical of Russian immigrants from a country of few churches and really shows a lack of comprehension on her part on the subject....instead she merely chooses to reject it.The \\"ONLY\\" thing of value would be the example of government out of control and too big....and then the final result of that. Now, if someone could just edit this book down to about 1/3 its current size, remove the rambling and the intrusive philosophical sections, you'd have a pretty good novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read the book more times than I have fingers, literally. Each time, I see a different side. I have read some of the critiques on this place. One thing. If you had to read this, then that was for your grade, so in that, you got paid for your time. If you bought this and then decided it was too long, whose fault is that for not skimming the book, but being TOO LAZY to read but the back cover?YES, it IS a bit unrealistic, but that is to prove a point. Animal Farm proves a point too, but I doubt pigs talk. Yeah. Animal Farm is shorter, but the points proven in Animal Farm and in in Atlas Shrugged are very, very different, and it would take a fool to replace one with the other. Read both. Don't substitute out of laziness.I personally found this book to be very good. I read the first book, Fountainhead, because I was bored to death, and the book was thick, so I took it up. I loved it. I have read that book I don't know how many times, and I still love it. Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are as holy to myself as the Bible is to some, perhaps more so. It doesn't say \\"oh, everyone's a bunch of slackers\\"...but that there ARE slackers, and it makes no sense to feed the slackers by giving them your corpse so they can dance and laugh over your dead body while breeding a million more slackers to kill off all the producers and crash the world.For those that do not see why generations should be allowed to leech off of welfare when they are perfectly capable of helping themselves and don't bother trying to get a job....for THOSE people, THIS IS THE BOOK. The book that puts those ideas, those values into words. The book that will set you free, by telling you the words for the emotions and thoughts that you always had but just didn't know how to express. This is the book of dreams.For those that like sitting on your butts and eating while your neighbor works to pay for what you eat, well, don't read this book, cause it'll probably [annoy] you off bigtime. Finally, you see, someone knows what's happening, and someone had the guts to put it down in writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In writing a review of Ayn (pronounced like 'mine') Rand's Atlas Shrugged, one almost feels compelled to write two reviews. Certainly, after an 1100+ page tome, a reviewer should say something about the quality of the book as pure novel. So I will.Atlas Shrugged is Bloated, with a capital B. In reading the book, it is clear that Ayn Rand had talent and could have written a marvelous novel. It is also clear what she didn't have was an editor with any guts. This book should have been only a third it's size. The author would have been able to tell the same story and make the same philosophical points in that space. Instead, the reader is treated to sililoques that go on for 50 or more pages and a seriously sluggardly pace of book.Other problems with this novel were majorly shallow characters, highly unrealistic fictional world, and too much whining by the author over the characters she clearly didn't like.As for the philosophy that is supposed to be expounded in this book, there are many and varying opinions about it. Mine is that it is evil. I am not an educated philosopher (incidentally, niether was Ayn Rand) but I can easily write that any philosophy that purports it an evil for a mother to feed her child out of duty, rather than buy a hat that she wants, is evil (for more on this read the radio address near the end of the book). Even that aside, her work is hardly original. Any serious book on various schools of philosophy would clear up that misconception. And, her ideas are extremely short-sighted. She takes no account of what would happen in society if ALL seemingly altruistic endeavors stopped.Ayn Rand is also a coward. In Atlas Shrugged, she creates a Utopian world where she can manipulate everything to create the outcome that she wants. The fact is, this world is CREATED. By using the tool of a novel, she does not have to make her philosophy work in the real world. In her book all of the 'good guys' are beautiful, hyper-intellectual, rich, and super-moral according to their own standards, they never allow their emotions to take control of them, ever. All of the 'bad guys' are ugly, stupid, moochers, who are running around ruining the world with their over-emotionalism. No one in this book has children - any reader who has children will appreciate how different that makes things. I just can't help think it cowardly for Ayn Rand to have created this perfect situation to put out her philosophy, especially since the situation that she creates is sooo contrived.Ayn Rand was not a philosopher. Because of her insistence in repeating the same message over and over to her readers, she ends up not being a good novelist, either. Read her book only if you feel that you 'should' in order gain a broader knowledge of what is out there in the world.For those interested in more information about Ayn Rand there are many biographies in print that you can find at Amazon. Some love her and some hate her, but you should probably read some stuff about her personal life (way juicier that her books) before you seriously consider hopping on her philisophical-wagon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged at the suggestion of a good friend who swore the book had a powerful influence on him while in college. I can see how it's anti religious pursuit of rational self interest as a philosophy can be attractive. I don't agree 100% with the philosophy, but suffice it to say that if Rand had argued it in a 20 page pamphlet, I would probably have been won over.But its important to seperate the fiction from the philosophy. In fact, that's where most of the people reviewing this book err in my opinion. Many are criticizing or defending the philosophy, which would be sensible only if you were reviewing a treaties on objectivism. But we're not. Here we have a fictional book.There is a massive gulf between the skill set necessary for writing a book on philosophy as compared to fiction. The imperatives for a philosopher may include a strong grasp of Logic, dialectical ingenuity, a deep sociological and historical insight and a scientific method for noticing a societal pattern and devising a consistant theory to explain it.Fiction however is a whole other animal. If a fictional novel has a philosophical angle, no one really expects it to be airtight. That's just not one of the priorities of a fictional novel. The author could even get their philosophy spot on and still fail to deliver a good book. A writer of fiction needs artistic creativity and a sense of imagination. The practical priorities in a fictional piece include an engaging style of writing, a good story and good characters who are well developed and easy to identify with. At least the reader needs to believe them and stay interested in them through to the end. It's here that Rand fails. On an epic scale.So many times I had to put the book down with a cry of \\"you've got to be kidding!\\". Endless page after page of repetition. The characters are all exaggerated caricatures and made from two basic molds. One is the intelligent, independent, beautiful and resourceful leader of Industry and the other is the greedy, lazy and scheming parasite who plans to devour resources wherever he can find them. That's it! There are no characters that fall in between!Rand who's father's Pharmacy was confiscated by the Bolsheviks in Russia, obviously has a bone to pick with communism and is determined to vent her frustrations and hammer home her very elementary criticisms for as long as the reader's willing to indulge her. In fact if I were to pick one word as the motivation behind this book it would be \\"BITTERNESS\\". On top of that, it's pretty clear that the main protagonist, Dagny, is basically Rand herself, and though there are several male characters that fit her superman mold, there is only one woman who is deemed worthy of it, and as such Dagny is the only woman who any of the good guys find attractive. It's like Rand is asking us to join her in a teenage fantasy where all these beautiful supermen are interested in no one but her... all because of her mind.Apparently \\"Rand remarked that the core idea for the book came to her after a 1943 telephone conversation with a friend, who asserted that Rand owed it to her readers to write a nonfiction book about her philosophy\\". I hope that this friend of hers lived to read this book and regret her thoughtless remark. But to offer her the benefit of a doubt, how was she to know it would be so long?Everything, but EVERYTHING in this book is predictable hundreds of pages before it happens! Again.. just because you have a philosophy to espouse doesn't mean you can force feed the propaganda to your readers in the guise of fiction and hope to keep them interested. As others have indicated, Rand uses these unbelievable characters as puppets to blurt out her theories in long speeches (one over 50 pages in length) and in the process completely alienates and bores her readers. I imagine that even her friends and her agent gave her the same advice, since she thankfully moved on to non-fiction and never wrote a novel again after this book.I always finish a book that I start, but since reading this I have realized how downright ridiculous that policy is, and that I should have stopped wasting my time with Atlas Shrugged a quarter of the way through."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's novel has undoubtedly become a classic, enshrining her in the history of philosophy very prominently, for better or for worse. Believe it or not, (has this already been posted?) it came in 2nd only to the Bible in this Library of Congress survey of books that had made a difference in people's lives: loc.gov/loc/cfbook/booklists.htmlCriticisms of the book's length are not entirely unwarranted. Rand takes a while to finish the first act (Her endless scene setting goes on into triple digits of pages until she introduces Francisco d'Anconia,) and the long radio broadcast at the end was an unnecessary sledgehammer swung full force into a weakly opposing wall of socialist, mystical, and Judeo-Christian dogmas already imploding over its poorly laid foundations. The attacks on the simplicity of the characters however, are really out of line, since Rand \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was designed to reach well beyond the simple novel.What I find most redeeming about Atlas Shrugged is its impassioned but well-reasoned defense of free market and self-affirming doctrines, regardless of their correctness. Too often as a college student did I see social welfare activists tear-jerk their way through debates with sub-par arguments, demonizing the opposition under the guise of honest and fair discussion. Rallies are chiefly held for 3rd World countries and the downtrodden and impoverished. After all, what's exciting to a young 20something about tax breaks? Can't the free market adherents fight back with their own panegyrics and vilifications if the dialogue has degenerated? Ayn Rand gave this voice to the industrialist, the entrepreneur, and the builder, reminding us that self-determination and private ownership are basic components of American mores and people have just as much right to fight for these things as everyone else does for their own cause in a democracy.That said, I'm not an Objectivist and find Rand's book an bizarre account of economic prediction. When I saw her interview with Mike Wallace it became clear that she could not answer some of his basic criticisms of her affinity for pure laissez faire. I doubt that a real economist would have done any less than disgrace her out-sized ego on that stage. Rand's work conveniently ignores several of the uglier snags of unrestrained market forces that our country has experienced firsthand. This is not the place to delve deeply into theory however, and her simplistic ideas do not really tarnish her moments of literary brilliance. Her attack on socialism was particularly poignant in the railroad bum's account of the fate of the Twentieth Century Motors Company, an image I will not soon forget.Atlas Shrugged has maintained a 4-star rating here after 1142 reviews, and I wager that they roughly comprise of 3/4 of the people giving it 5 stars out of admiration, and 1/4 giving it 1 star out of sheer disgust. Either way you slice it, it manages to say things that few other books have done, certainly not half so enduringly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I bought Atlas Shrugged because the library copies were all checked out and had reserved lines. Glenn Beck, radio and TV commentator, recommended it. The book is selling very well now. It is amazing how applicable this book, written in the early to mid 50s, is to our current times. It is a fascinating story and viewpoint on American society. My only problem with it is that Ayn Rand says in five pages what could be said in a paragraph or two."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, Atlas Shrugged is my favorite book of all time, I own a first edition, the unabridged audio (35 hours), the abridged audio (12 hours)and half a dozen paperback copies. I have also given away dozens of copies of Atlas Shrugged over the years.Here is how I would approach this book if I had never read it. (And I envy those who haven't read it because it is such a treat)...If you are a big reader, then I would read the book as it is written. Most people will invest between 25 and 40 hours to read this novel. I think it is gripping, and keeps your interest as a mystery story, but for people who don't read a lot the smalltext and 1000+ pages are daunting.If you are more used to reading pop fiction or 200 page business books but want to understand what all the fuss is about with Atlas Shrugged, then I would highly recommend the Abridged Audio version of the novel. It runs about 12.5 hours and it conveys the primary message of the book. And once you have a taste of it, you might find yourself reading the entire book anyway.The book is so topical right now in 2009, as our government again tries to relearn the lessons of the past-- that profits and productivity are not evil, and are instead what makes modern society possible. Without the men of the mind, willing to take risks and work on their dreams, we would still be in the Stone Age. Governments forget this basic human truth at their own peril.If you haven't yet read this book, you are a lucky soul and shouldn't delay. (The Fountainhead is also excellent, but start with Atlas Shrugged in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The thesis of this book is perhaps more relevent today than it was when it was written 50 years ago. The story is not completely compelling in its own right (though it is generally an enjoyable book), but the insights of its message and representation of an important point of view should rank the book among the top political philosophy works of the 20th century. While I don't agree with every point made in this book and aspects of the economy that are no longer prominent tend to date the story, with the recent massive intervention of the government into our economy, the themes could apply more readily in 2009 than 1957."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this novel three times. I'll read it again.Each time it seems to live in my mind on a grander, higher scale.In interviews and in some of her nonfiction books, Rand has said that the purpose of a novel is to entertain, to tell a good story. In ATLAS SHRUGGED she has accomplished this purpose, possibly better than any other novel. I haven't read every other novel; I don't want to read every other novel, so I won't attempt to say or prove this with certainty. I will say with certainty that ATLAS SHRUGGED is not a good story; it's a great story.Reportedly, Rand's intellectual friends were continually asking her to write her ideals into nonfiction (maybe so they could digest them better); yet her soul lived in stories painting the heroic in life. She believed we live in a beneficent universe and that human beings were meant to achieve great joy, and to feel that joy in every moment.In ATLAS SHRUGGED, Rand proceeded to dramatize (not to intellectualize) her concept of why we have thoughtlessly allowed ourselves to pervert this beneficence, and how to get back on track.Many would say that a 50 page speech, given to the world by John Galt over secured radio waves, is more intellectualization than dramatization. I read that clear radio voice as drama perfectly staged within a well executed plot; I saw it as well earned, actually necessitated, by the complex weaving of multiple mysteries building unequivocally to the dramatic enlightenment presented in that speech.The first time I read Atlas, in 1986, it took me a few months to get through it. It had taken me years prior to that to get past the first scenes of Eddie's \\"causeless uneasiness.\\" I would read carefully to the point of him recalling the magnificent oak tree which was rotten inside, and I'd put down the book. Eddie's gestalt was so depressing and confusing, I couldn't push forward, couldn't go beyond this budding and painful awareness in Eddie, a seeding of consciousness which felt as if it had nowhere, no way to blossom.Maybe I sensed the plot would move slowly, complexly, mysteriously, dramatically ... backward ... into the darkest night of the soul of the human race, before it would be ready to lift into any type of healing light.It took me a while, a bit of growing, to be ready for that backwards, downward soul drop.Yet, when Atlas lifted the reader into Galt's Gulch, I soared.I soared higher than I've been taken by any work of fiction.Is it a great story when an author takes a reader into the bowels of human culture, into the primal, absolute absence of true thought, paints that dank sewer-of-a-world brilliantly with the deepest, richest, most frightening and heart-wrenching color and clarity, then surges the reader suddenly upward on the strongest wings available to an embodied human form? Is that a great story, or what??I'm speaking beyond the airplane ride Dagney piloted to break through to a small setting where a tiny, almost toy-like railroad was a more true-to-life example of that industry than the ugly, gritty, dark world beyond Galt's location.When I say, simply, that there are true CHARACTERS in this book, I might have to set that statement against a contrast which would have to consider that there may be no true characters in any other novel. But, I don't want to say that, exactly. I merely want to exalt as it deserves, Rand's executed skill as a novelist.I love stories. I love characters. I consistently read books I'm able to unfailingly and honestly give 5 Star reviews.But to read ATLAS SHRUGGED is to be temporarily diminished in ability to fully enjoy other novels. This is why I hesitate to read it again right away. The contrast in the depth of characters, the complexity of plot and subplot machinations, the beauty of the mystery which unfolds in pacing so perfect it cannot be called pacing, it must be described as a natural, living sequence of cause and effect, all this honoring of the true form of the story, of a saga, is almost too rich to exist in the same time frame of other examples of human art.Even as I exalt Atlas, however, this time I will be able to return immediately to my culinary cozies and love the heck out of them. Why? That's for me to know and you to find out, if you're interested.For a placement of my customer review of ATLAS SHRUGGED on Amazon.com, I chose the cover of this novel which was taken from a painting by Ayn Rand's husband, Frank O'Conner. He was an artist; he gave a worthy image for his wife's novel.I admire and appreciate every artistic version of this book, every exquisite cover presentation; the book's gestalt has the capacity to draw greatness from anyone who attempts to capture any nuance of it. But, I wanted to honor Rand's husband's contribution to her career as a novelist, a contribution which went beyond what most of her readers would be able to imagine. And I love O'Conner's red sun setting, his glowing, straight steel rails heading toward that day's end. I love the deep greens and iron-rust-red of the sun ball, and more.I will stand, spine straight as possible with arthritis, and salute Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. They lived. They suffered. As all of us, possibly they suffered unnecessarily, as a matter of maturing as a race, as a matter of growing in consciousness about cause and effect. In their art, Ayn and Frank transcended the pain and left us gifted.Live enthralled within this book as a story, as a novel, first. Then begin thinking your own thoughts, making your own living, one you're able to enjoy as who you are, not as Ayn Rand, not as Frank O'conner. As you. A simple person rich in capacity to enjoy the most basic of moments, to feel the grandness of human life in every breath.Remember the perfect flavor of that cheeseburger Dagney relished in the small diner which almost magically appeared on her hardrock route to nirvana. (And you wonder why I love culinaries?)Maybe that's what Rand wanted to accomplish all along. She wanted to give each of us that unique individual inside, terrified of shining, filled with shame (afraid to eat, even). Maybe she wanted to tell us, no, to show us that we have made no Original Sin. We were born free.Now we must each live free, in our own way. And, to be a hero might not mean to conquer impossible dreams which we honestly don't want to reach. Maybe it means to enjoy each day and do what we can to live as who we are, to know who we are. Inside and out. As unique individuals, each unlike any other, yet coexisting with other individuals who are interesting to know in their variety of faces, not masks.Who is John Galt?Who are YOU?I know who I am. Sort of. I'm gaining on the concept daily.Rest assured that life was meant to be abundantly benefic, not a pain in the patootie.For attempting to paint this awareness in words and oils, I thank you Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. Wherever you are (somewhat against your precepts, I believe your consciousness still exists), \\"live long and prosper,\\"Linda G. ShelnuttAuthor of several Kindle books, including:Molasses Moon"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Even if you do not agree with Rand, her point of view and the way she flawlessly demonstrates the absolute worst case scenario should be, at least...seen.People like Dagny Taggart, Francisco D'Anconia, Hank Rearden...we don't usually see people like this because they have already been broken. This isn't to say that life should be a constant battle...and to read Atlas and come away with the fact that the literal translation is all out internal war...is completely absurd.The way you should read Atlas is to understand that ability should take precedence over want. The creed of John Galt should be taken and placed into an avenue of the reader's life. Rand isn't a religion...it just validates people who believe in themselves and what they can accomplish.Atlas Shrugged is an excellent read, even if you are for whatever reason, biased against it before you've given it a fair shake.Read the Fountainhead first...if you don't identify with the morals and charcters in Fountainhead, then save yourself the time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This has been and will always be one of the best books I've ever read. It describes a philosophy of existence, in Rand's terms, \\"of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, and reason as his only absolute.\\"You will discover why one's productive achievement is the highest moral purpose of one's life, why it is that the men of the mind go on strike, who is the motive power behind every invention and every achievment, and what happens when the the creators of that motive power refuse to live under conditions of the \\"sanction of the victim\\".Take it or leave it, Ayn Rand makes her point very clearly. She had no choice but to express her philosophy in such terms. The complaints from the reviewers are that the characters have long dialogues, are one-dimensioned, etc. But what Ayn Rand intended to do and did was illustrate a point. She did not intend to create a soap opera, she created a work of philosophy, and it should be read as such. If you ever doubt whether to read it or not--read it, and judge for yourself. I don't want to ruin the plot for you; I don't want to go into the discussion of the characters' specific actions. But read it, and discover what is the best within you. You will then have to answer to yourself which moral code you live by."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book might NOT change your world view, but it probably will.If you have not read \\"The Fountainhead\\", I recommend starting with that book. It is somewhat easier to read, has a quicker flow, and a much more narrow metaphysical scope.I also recommend that you read a few biographical pages on Ayn Rand, and orient yourself to historical events in the first half of the 20th century to gain perspective on the setting of this story.If you read and understand \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", you will be able to recognize, in everyday life, the methods of living that you want to avoid: ignoring the finite and concrete reality of things; side-stepping personal responsibility; and unreasonable expectations of others. These habits are used by millions of well-intentioned people in the world, today, and most of these people are destined to be overtaken by the reality they deny.This book demonstrates, in a theoretical and logical scenario, that investment in yourself, honest thinking, and responsibility for your own actions are all that the universe requires of you, to live a happy and successful life.If you do not walk away from reading this book, believing that you should be happy, and enjoy life to the fullest, well I'm sorry, but you have missed the point.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did, the several times I've read it, cover to cover. It is not historical and not prognostic, but has elements of both.I also recommend \\"The Age of Reason\\" by Thomas Paine"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm down with the moral premise Ayn Rand advances in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". This is an epic saga that keeps you turning page after page after page after page. After page. But there's quite a bit of room for trimming from the 35th anniversary paperback edition I managed to get through (almost 1100 pages of small type). To say Rand is longwinded is a gross understatement. Galt's radio address - which clocks in at 56 pages - makes a Bill Clinton State of the Union address seem like the briefest of sound bites. A nation of starving people has no chance of mustering the intellectual stamina Galt demands as he restates his premise over and over again. I was rooting for Dagny and her boys but Rand has some unusual ideas about what constitutes human perfection, specifically perfection of the mind. The strikers are all type \\"A\\" smokers who don't exercise, burn the midnight oil at the office, catch 2 hours of sleep and then enjoy a breakfast of coffee and cigarettes - and still resemble Greek gods. Perfection of the mind is incompatable with nicotine addiction, which represents failure of the IQ test of life. They'll all undoubtably leave great looking corpses when their hearts explode at 40. For all the philosophical exposition going on, this book felt, at various points, like science fiction, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and the Justice League of America. Galt builds things like a motor that converts static elctricity into unlimited power and some sort of electronically projected visual force field to hide his mountain lair. Dagny goes over the rainbow to pentrate the force field, crashes her plane and wakes up to find Galt, Francisco, Wyatt, et al., living in the striker's equivalent of the emerald city. The super hero executives all get together at the end to rescue Galt, complete with Ragnar Danneskjold swinging in through a window to shoot the last looter thug. Overall, an absobing story with a powerful sociological message, but it's just a bit overlong."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have to respond to a reviewer a few places below on the page. First of all, ending the review with &quot;Go Howard Dean!&quot; shows that you had no interest in writing a review but only in championing a politician. Then you give advice to Rand for when she writes her next novel. Rand is dead; Atlas Shrugged was written in the 50's. Finally, why should Rand include God and family on her novels? Atheism was one of the core tenets of her philosophy. You may not agree with her, but why should she have included something which she clearly states in her philosophy is something she rejects?That said, I did enjoy this book. It shows the logical extension of liberalism that could occur if it were allowed to flourish to its conclusion. This book and The Fountainhead were the two reasons that my political idealogy changed from that of a liberal to a libertarian. For a thought-provoking book that might challenge your beliefs, in addition to an excellent story with gripping characters, read Atlas Shurgged. Although I give it 5 stars, I must voice the most common complaint against Rand's writing. Her characters, with very few exceptions, are black and white. People are either all good or all bad, and while I enjoyed her capitalistic politics, I disagreed with her A is A, B is B &quot;rational&quot; explanation for all things. She attemps to justify this part of her philosophy by making the characters extremes, so much so that they hardly seem human."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"With out question one of the top five more important books of the 20th C. and the number one concerning the present political spectrum. Communism did not need arguments against it because its extremism took care of its own implosion. It is the mild and creeping socialism that has been eating slowly at the efficiency of the European nations that one needs awareness to. This book sparks that awareness. Essential reading for our times."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Should be required reading for all students - although may be tough going for anyone under 20. This is an ode to capitalism like you could never imagine - thank god that Any Rand had the imagination. Atlas Shrugged and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance have been my top two life-shaping book picks for as long as I can remember. Read them with the eyes of a student and preferably at the same time as a friend or book club - you're going to want to talk about these books. I'm not kidding. There are big ideas here and the likes of which many people don't encounter often - the world will change before your eyes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a must read for those interested in learning more about the philosophy of Ayn Rand and Objectivism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Excellent read. This should be taught in high school . . . Period."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again. I've also listened to the Abridged Version on Tape and CD many times. Powerful book. Should be read by everyone!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First and foremost, Atlas Shrugged will forever change the way you perceive money. Money represents a man's inalienable right to his achievements and thus to the pursuit of hapiness. As the book vividly portrays, a world without incentives will fall to pieces. When it is wrong to care for your hapiness, there is no meaning in life.It's true, the rich have a selfish desire to please themselves. But if it were not for that selfish desire, there would be no reason to trust anyone. Social bonds are a result of exchanging values, not of vices. Loving someone merely for his existence or capacity to feel is a despicable act. Were it not for reason, feelings would have no justification.Despite the story's tragic nature, Ayn Rand brings a very positive outlook to life. It is impossible not to agree with her. By the end of this massive novel, all you need is a little common sense to know that she is correct. If you do not agree with her, check your premises. There is bound to be a contradiction.If you want to know what makes America great, buy this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've just finished reading this book and it is very good, all these things about the real meaning of being human and live it is remarkable. I'm still feel motivated by the words of the radio speech(although it is very long)and I really hope there are a lot of John Galt outhere. If not, everybody should read this book to encourage them all to start living."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One could look at Atlas Shrugged as a book about a railroad, but he would not have been taking this book for what it truly is.When read, and understood, this book brings a new idea of the importance of life.It is a book of integrity. It shows people for what they are truly capable of against all odds. Dagny, John, Fransico and all of their friends set an example of taking action against what they consider to be unjust to themselves and to all people.Though this book is in some ways unrealistic, its true beauty is in the suggestion that true greatness for all people can be accomplished by a man with an idea, a group working with him to make that idea into a reality and a great deal of intention. It also gives us hope that there can be ideas that benefit everyone.I don't know about you, but I've had enough of this viewpoint that only a certain amount of good for a certain amount of people can be achieved. I agree with Ayn Rand in her viewpoint of going all out and really doing something to fix up this world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; though some may criticize it as long or a bit on the fantastic side, underscores the very real consequences and costs of tinkering with markets and individual liberties. Her characters Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart demonstrate many of the characteristics of people who are driven by sheer will and determination, and also serve to show the reader exactly how lesser men seem to be motivated only to mar those who work and succeed.My only criticism is that Rand's portrayal of the book's many socialistic/liberal characters tends to oversimplify their motivations and philosophy. Socialistic policy, while dreadful, is derived from much more complex ideas than those allowed by Rand. Still, the novel does a fantastic job of demonstrating the follies of a managed economy, union activities and the welfare estate."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book Atlas Shrugged is a book that needs some revision. There are parts in the story that just drag on for a number of pages. The reader loses interests during these parts. Luckily there are some parts that make up for the excessive usage of words, for instance all the love triangles and conflicts between characters. There are not too many twists and turns causing action in the story but when there is, it is unexpected and hardly predictable regaining the attention of the reader. Overall the story line is very well thought out and interesting, that is why the book Atlas Shrugged is worth three stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I do think Atlas Shrugged is a good book although sometime I feel confusing. I feel tried and bored of that 1000 pages. Actually, I think some of the parts are useless and meaningless that we can ignore. I hate the frist few parts of the book, it's really a hard time. However, after I passing it, I feel the book is quite exciting.The book contents a lot of political aspects. You won't feel bored of that because Ayn Rand does a good job in explaining them. Ayn Rand's philosophy is very special for me. What she said in the book is I never thought about. Her philosophy is contrary to ours, but I accept her points.I do recommend people to read this book. It can open your mind. When I reading this book, it makes me think a lot. My mind is making agreement/disagreement with Ayn Rand during read the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's philosophy is known as objectivism. It is essentially having a objective reason and purpose for every action you commit.Atlas Shrugged is one of two major novels that outlines her entire philosophy while trying to show how it would be applied. That is why this book deserves a 5 star rating. Any philosopher can give generic ideas with no application. Rand puts it all on the line to show exactly how she means her philosophy to be interpreted.The student of philosophy will be able to understand her philosophy quite clearly after reading this. If you agree with her philosophy you should encourage others to read this book. If this book is so clearly wrong then you should encourage others to read it so they will see how clearly wrong it is. Those that want it burned or object to others reading it know that she offers some very strong arguments for a position they clearly do not want to be true.This book takes place probably around the 1950s. It is centered around the industrial sector of the U.S., the only government that has not become a People's State. The main character in this book is Dagny Taggart. She is a no-nonsense VP of Operations for the largest railroad in the world. She is intelligent and is solely driven to keeping her RR as the best.The times are dim and getting dimmer. In the beginning the country is in a recession of sorts and it is up to Taggart and others like her to save the country. There are two problems that are preventing her from doing this. One, the government seeks more and more control when it should be stepping away. Second, the men of industry are disappearing one by one just when they are critically needed. No one knows where they go off to.In the sense of a novel this is a good one. It is suspenseful and intriguing. Everyone can identify with the characters in this book. Most of the antagonists have been left rather shallow. That is on purpose. They are supposed to represent certain elements of society. This book can get dry at times. One man has a 60 page speech that can seem a little preachy at times but is wholly necessary within the context of the novel.Ayn Rand is perhaps the best known and widest read philosopher of the 20th century. If you have any interest in philosophy or economics then this is a must read. Don't fear her teachings. An open mind is a dangerous thing to some people.The most important thing to remember is not to take everything you read here as dogma. Think for yourself and apply whatever ideas make sense to you and ignore that which you don't like. Think for yourself. I think Rand would object to anyone blindly following her philosophy without actually believing in it. No one says you can't be charitable to others. Just make sure you do it of your own volition and not because it is expected of you or because you feel guilty."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"reading the kindle version is infuriating. so many typos, misplaced punctuation, etc. \\"John Galt\\" is mispelled as \\"John Gait\\" at LEAST 15 times, which is an annoying distraction that pulls you out of the exposition and awkwardly reminds you that you are reading sloppily translated digital version of this classic."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Born in Czarist Russia, Ayn Rand survived the Soviet revolution and, after studying philosophy and history at the University of Petrograd, emigrated to the United States in 1926. She originally sought work as a screenwriter; having only minor success in this area, she turned to other venues and in 1943 and 1957 produced the two works that established her reputation, THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED. Although novels, both works exist primarily as platforms from which Rand describes the form of philosophy she developed: Objectivism.No philosophy can be condensed to a few simple statements, but at its center objectivism is characterized by the belief that man is an end to himself. In the process of making this statement, Rand takes several controversial positions, most of which revolve around the notion that an extreme of individualism is always positive; that industrialization is always positive; that the state's involvement in business is always negative; that atheism is the only rational position; and that those who are primarily motivated by altruism are intrinsically flawed and ultimately dangerous. The overall result of these thoughts is a sort of uber-capitalism in which financial success is equated with self-worth.Rand's critics point out that she is very inconsistent in the application of her ideas and that, while claiming to eschew any standard morality, actually has a tendency to conform to precisely that--and that while she claims to be proponet of capitalism it is just as easy to use her concepts to justify fascism. Rand's philosophy also has an extremely black-or-white quality; something is either entirely bad or entirely good, a stance which allows no room for shading of any kind. Although she certainly inspires a hysterical devotion among followers, Rand is not considered a philosopher by the vast majority of contemporary philosophers, and Objectivism is generally considered superficial at best.At the time she wrote ATLAS SHRUGGED, Rand had reached a point at which she construed her concept of personal individuality to mean that she should not seek any sort of editorial comment regarding her work. When advisors suggested she cut the work for readability and clarity, she refused--and the result is an extremely long book that runs to 1069 fine-print pages in paperback alone, enough to intimidate even the most determined readers. It is also a very, very repetitive book in which the characters and situations restate the same fundamental issues over and over and over. And to add a final nail in the coffin, the conclusion is profoundly ironic, for it tends to undercut Rand's philosophic stance, a fact that she seems to have missed.Reduced to its bare essentials, Rand presents us with two pivitol characters, Dagny Taggart and John Galt. Taggart is a rail road executive who finds herself beset by union demands inspired by socialist-leaning leaders in both government and society, demands which threaten to destroy both her ownership of the company and the company itself. She gradually drifts into a circle influenced by John Galt, a heroically-styled industrialist who seeks to end such situations. Galt forms a group of mighty industrialists--and brings the socialist demands to an end by having these leaders stage a strike. The irony involved, if one hasn't noticed, is that while Galt and his supporters are very anti-union (as was Rand herself), their solution to unionization is... unionization.Over the years, ATLAS SHRUGGED has been described as among the most influential books published. I find that difficult to believe and for several reasons--but most particularly because I cannot imagine that enough people have read it for it to have any great hold on the thoughts of the population at large. Certainly people have bought it; it has never been out of print and sales are consistently solid; and I myself cannot count the times that I have seen it residing in various bookcases. At the same time, however, I seldom meet any one who has actually read it from start to finish. When I do, they tend to describe the novel as \\"interesting\\" rather than inspiring or empowering.The underlying problem with ATLAS SHRUGGED is that it is a philosophical dissertation presented as a novel instead of being a novel that presents philosophical positions. The characters, settings, and situations are important only as vehicles to Rand's thoughts--and as such are as dry as dust. Even without taking into account its length and repetitive nature, ATLAS SHRUGGED is a horrifically uphill read and about as enjoyable as attempting to cross Death Valley at high noon without a drop of water.My own sentiment: if you are interested in Rand's philosophy, read THE FOUNTAINHEAD, which encompasses the same ideas but actually works as a novel (and a gutsy and exciting one too) or simply go with an abstract of the main concepts of objectivism--which will run considerably less than a hundred pages.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \\"We the living\\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"(&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; being an old favorite, I got caught up in reading over the reviews collected here. There are a number of things one could say about them, but I thought that there was one fairly common opinion in particular that seemed to me to be an important misunderstanding - so I decided I'd write a review myself to explain it. This is also in the way of an hommage.)This book is not a novel, in the usual sense, at all. Rand quite deliberately kept it free of the sort of particular, &quot;realistic&quot; details of place and history that characterize that genre. Despite its length, it's really better looked upon as an extended fable or allegory. This is why the characters are more types than complex individuals, why they give speeches that develop the theme rather than the plot, and why the plot as a whole has such an obviously constructed quality about it.In a &quot;novel&quot;, these would all be defects; in a fable or allegory, they're simply aspects of the form. And in terms of that form, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a towering literary achievement, among the greatest of the past century. It's true, the book has its weaknesses, even as a fable - it can be repetitive and bombastic, it's anything but subtle, and it occasionally displays some odd fixations (side-effects, I think, of both its time and its author). But none of that can negate its truly astonishing demonstration of the power that allegory is able to convey when done right -- when, as here, highly recognizable types of characters and situations are brought together in a compelling narrative founded upon a philosophical mystery or paradox, the resolution of which unleashes the full force of the allegory's meaning.Ironically, for the atheistic Rand, works of this sort often carry with them the sort of charismatic aura usually associated with great religious figures or texts, and this can represent a danger, no doubt. It's a danger lessened considerably in this case by Rand's strong upholding of both reason and the individual, twin themes that undermine the trance-like faith characteristic of the newly converted. Nevertheless, this is a work so potent with moral charge that it seems the whole culture treats it as gingerly as an unexploded bomb. Studiously ignored by academia and media alike, it's thrived for over forty years almost entirely by word of mouth alone. And it's not just the numbers that read and re-read it year in and year out that mark it as such a remarkable cultural icon - it's the numbers who rate it as the single most influential book in their lives.Now, if you're rash enough to disturb the deliberate silence surrounding Ayn Rand, you'll soon find it's a fragile stillness - like the great heretics of old, her very name can provoke a reflex hostility ranging from scorn to rage, as some of the reviews here illustrate. Not that this is surprising - in the present context she is indeed propounding a great heresy, directly challenging some of the deepest and most cherished of our moral precepts and beliefs. And of course, Galileo notwithstanding, heretics aren't always right. But how do you ever know, how can you decide? Because what if, in a particular case, a heretic IS right, and all of our conventional &quot;wisdom&quot;, with its fear and hatred of the heresy, has been leading us ineluctably into a trap that's slowly closing around us? Well, the thought might at least prompt you to give the heretic a fair hearing.Here then is what I'd propose to those curious (and brave!) enough to give this book a try: bypass the Introduction (which should have been an &quot;Afterword&quot;), suspend preconceptions for the duration of the experiment, and set yourself to read just the first chapter before deciding whether to continue - it's appropriately titled &quot;The Theme&quot;, and it's only a little over 30 pages. At the very least, it WILL give you something to think about."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have to admit that I am not normally big on novels, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one.Fans of Nixonite authors who try to sell you on &quot;The Rich are getting Richer&quot; will not like this book and that is exactly why they need to read it.Although this book is a novel, there is a lot of truth in what Ayn Rhand writes in here.I highly recommend Atlas Shrugged. It will blow your mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is perhaps the crowning achievement of Rand's career. The manifesto for Rand's Objectivist philosophy on life, Atlas is an elaborate tale woven through the use of rigidly developed characters who represent the two polarizing forces at play in Rand's philosophy. John Galt, Dagny Taggart, and Hank Rearden, among a handful of others, are the leaders of the productive, virtuous element of society, representing capitalism, industry, and Rand's own Selfishness. Meanwhile, Dagny's brother Jim and his cast of corrupt, spineless characters are the \\"looters,\\" representing socialism, destruction, and the degradation of the self.Through the use of symbolic characters and a bleak, industrial setting, Rand demonstrates the utter destruction that would befall the world should the \\"looters\\" take over, moving the focus of society from the individual to the collective, from excellence to equality, and from productivity to laziness. Rand constructs an intricate plot, one that is remarkably able to portray all the implications of such selfless, socialist views in an industrial society. The result is a clear case for the unhindered, capitalist state in which one acts for oneself and creative endeavors are allowed to flourish. Yet Rand does not stop by simply naming the problem and explaining what should be. She sets up a problem and presents its solution, found in the personal integrity and selfish actions of her leading characters: Dagny, Galt, and Rearden. Through these characters, Rand lays out a means by which to uphold one's virtues and stop the destruction of society, even if doing so means \\"stopping the motor of the world.\\"Atlas Shrugged is a long, detailed work that is more ideological than practical. Unlike most philosophers, Rand applies her ideas through fictional means. While others simply expound their beliefs, Rand has found a creative and original way to demonstrate them and all of their various implications. Critics of Rand's work have called it extreme and unrealistic. This assessment is in fact correct, although these are not flaws of Atlas Shrugged. The novel is not meant to be realistic. Rather, it is an allegory, told in a theoretical, idealistic manner. The characters and situations are not easy to relate to and they are not supposed to be. Each of the novel's details serves a purpose higher than that of developing a character or advancing the plot; every element connects to and demonstrates the overarching philosophy that Rand is attempting to present.Though an impressive piece of work, Atlas does have its flaws, and some major ones at that. Rand's philosophy is driven home with a narrative that, though it contains many great ideas, is extremely long-winded and repetitive. Within this lengthy discourse, however, Rand is only able to present her ideas through extreme examples. This means that her characters are either completely good, pure, and righteous (the producers) or evil, corrupt, and destructive (the looters). There is no middle ground, no one whose intentions are good but who is just going about those intentions in a misguided way, and no room for improvement. Those who are good always have been and always will be, and those who are bad are evil to the core with no hope of reform. No one changes, for better or for worse, and change does not appear to be an option. When a character realizes the error in her judgment and tries to amend the course of her life, she winds up overwhelmed by the challenge and commits suicide. Needless to say, this is not a very motivational message to deliver to those whom Rand is trying to sway with her ideas.One rather well-known fact about Rand is her adherence to her religious beliefs - or lack thereof. Rand was an atheist, and this is just as clear throughout Atlas as in her other works. Religion is quite obviously absent from Atlas, only mentioned for the purpose of dismissing its validity. Yet Rand's strict interpretation of right and wrong, justice and virtue, would be easier to swallow if there were a higher moral purpose attached to it.Another glaring omission can be found in Rand's theory of sex. Rand presents sex as the physical celebration of virtue and the act of appreciating all that is worthy in oneself and another being. This is commendable, yet this is the only value she attributes to sex, justifying the act regardless of its circumstances so long as these elements are involved, which is perhaps not surprising from a woman who justified her own extra-marital affair to her husband. In doing so, Rand neglects the higher purpose of the act: procreation. Considering the importance characters such as Dagny, Rearden, and Galt place upon production, this oversight is hard to believe. Yet several elements that are essential to a healthy, productive society are lacking: marriage (healthy marriage, at least), children, and family.Also troubling is the idea with which the reader is left at the end of Atlas Shrugged: that the only way to bring about change in such a flawed society is through destruction. The last fifty or so pages of the novel take on a violent, desperate tone that almost feels as though someone else has written them. While Atlas ends on a hopeful note, this hope is only achieved at the expense of society itself, a rather depressing prospect. Perhaps, however, that is Rand's intention: to provide a warning that will help to prevent our reaching such an extreme state.Despite these flaws, Atlas Shrugged is an admirable work. If you begin this book expecting a typical work of fiction, you will be disappointed. But if you go into it looking for solid, thought-provoking ideas and a carefully crafted philosophical analysis, you will be glad you made the effort."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I neither love nor hate this book; it absorbed me throughout but I was certainly aware of its shortcomings. And at some point I realized I was smirking at parts I was meant to be awed by. For instance: While hunting down John Galt, Dagney stops for a burger at a road-side joint and realizes she's in the presence of greatness because the short-order cook behind the counter has made the best hamburger she's ever had! (Naturally, it turns out he's a genius philosopher who has dropped out of society, along with the rest of the world's geniuses! Sorry, but the idea that he revealed his greatness through his burger struck me funny!) Plus, at some point Dagney is put in the position of having to make an elaborate breakfast, something (it pointedly says) she has never done in her life, yet, because she, like the \\"short-order cook\\", is one of the world's greatest people, she just somehow \\"knows\\" how to do this without a single mis-step, as though she'd been doing it all her life. I got a little impatient with the way Rand insists that her heroes can do absolutely nothing wrong, whether it be running a train system or cooking bacon and eggs for the first time. Unrealistic.The idea that one of the heroes withstood physical torture without making a peep was a disturbing message: Do Rand's \\"ideal\\" people not feel even physical pain?Plus, Dagney sure got to sleep around a lot. And one more thought: Do these people ever laugh?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"and I've read a huge array of books. I picked this up when I was 19, and couldn't put it down until I finished it a week later.You don't have to agree with everything Ayn Rand says. I don't. But the core of what she believes, and her method of portraying it, is spectacular. Selfishness loses it's bad reputation and is reinstated as self interest. Ambition, intelligence, and innovation are awarded the highest praise. The hangers on, haters, and boot lickers, are fully revealed as the shallow little creatures they really are.It solidified my way of thinking, and helped me define what I really like and don't like, and why. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In these times it's important to know that we do have a voice and we can make a difference. Atlas is a wonderful story about the world coming to a standstill because those looking for a handout pushed those who produced just a bit too far. Look around, it's exactly what is happening today. A government that promotes wealth redistribution and a compliant media were alive and well in Rand's novel published more than 50 years ago and lo and behold they are here today. Wonderfully written and eerily prescient it is even more important today than ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There seem to be three types of people in the world: People who love Atlas Shrugged because they agree with it, people who hate Atlas Shrugged because they disagree with it, and people who have never read it. I find it very sad that people who don't agree with her philosophy can't appreciate this work of fiction for what it is... a work of fiction.Okay. Now let's get a few things out of the way. For starters, yes, Ayn Rand was a little crazy. Scratch that, she was pretty nutty. Let's be honest about that.For another, yes. Atlas Shrugged is long. Ridiculously long. Stop complaining about its length. If you didn't read all of it, shut up and stop complaining about it. Go read a short story that can fit within your attention span.Now, one more thing I want to point out. You don't have to be all gung-ho about Objectivism and capitalism in order to appreciate the message of the book. You don't have to agree with everything in the Bible to believe that one should love others, right? The main point of Atlas Shrugged is essentially that you should try to earn what you get, instead of begging for it simply because you \\"need\\" it... really you just want it. What I took from this book wasn't that I needed to go out and run a national railroad and make billions of dollars; I gleaned more of a \\"go out and take what you want\\" attitude. The meaning of the book is NOT that money is all important: it's that you as a person are what is important. You have value, and your value is determined by what you do. So go out and do something.There are also a few more interesting, and thought-provoking ideas in the novel. For example:\\"The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them...you create a nation of lawbreakers - and then you cash in on guilt.\\"Isn't that true? When you think about it- which most people don't unless they read this quote- this is actually very true.Despite its length, and despite Rand's eccentricities, this is a very well written novel. Rand writes beautifully, regardless of whether or not you like the content of what she writes. That alone in my book earns Atlas Shrugged a few points."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A very tedious read (1200+ pages). I can tell that Mrs. Rand is Russian. She may be a great writer but, my god, would these characters pleeeeze GET TO THE POINT(!) in a hundred words or less. No wonder her America was dying. Who wants to listen to all this drivel. People, even in the fifties, didn't express themselves as her dialogue (?). To be fair: Yes, there are moochers and looters. Yes, we punish success. Yes, jealousy is a huge motivator in many. But say it in fewer words and clearer sentences. Work on a realistic solution. Maybe this story would work in Russia where they love to talk, but not in the good old USA. Ditto for The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking reads ever, if you have the attention span for it. As it turns out, I did.How to explain it? I was, and still am, much more moderate than most people who get into this. I think, and continue to think, that the free market system is driven by power-hunger like any other competitive game in society, and that rules are necessary to keep the most vicious and disrespectful behavior in check. After reading this, I understand better than before why that is my belief.The description of Rand's morality is clear here, and it represents something that has gone well beyond being a simple novel. It is a philosophical explanation of the reasons why self-interest is not only efficient when at its best but also respectful when at its best. The ethic reminds me of the ethic of battlefield soldiers who are driven to succeed, the ethic that says that they need no quarter, no leniency, no mercy, no restraint on the part of their adversaries, that such rules of engagement are anithetical to the hope that they be tried at their full capacity. To reach the fullest of their potential, they require everything the enemy's got. (By the way, I'm an Iraq vet majoring in economic history) I love this kind of competition, and the ethic behind it is purified in this book. Rand did not need 1300 pages to relate it to me. After the first chapter, I got it, although it was a very long chapter. The sanctity of the victim, plus D'Anconia's speech on money, were the most illuminating portions, but the ethic is so cohesive and well-explained that it was almost over-proven.Of course, I don't really understand why violence was place out of the realm of rational action in this book. In a world of scarce resources, violence can be very logical. Assume that what most of the advocates say about the 'moochers' is true: Why not accept and embrace violence as yet another form of empowerment, another case of the weak being rightfully vanquished by the strong. Why not? The world has overpopulation problems. There are, thanks to the reduced need for non-professional labor brought on by outsourcing and technology, a lot of useless people out there.If people's value is dominated by their economic contribution, if that is how we arrange the hierarchy, then why not kill the weak and useless? My opinion: Because success, regardless of the system and the ideology and the ethic, is much more random than we like to believe, and we do have a basic respect for the downtrodden that comes from knowing that there, but for the grace of God, go I. Relatability to the unfortunate kills this philosophy as a real worldview. It is simply one perspective, one colored, emotionally, by a woman who was close to the horrors of Stalinism and couldn't bring herself to advocate taking her philosophy to the full rationality of cold violence. Like any pure ideology, any dogma, it can be dangerous without restraint, the kind of restraint we get from the unnecessary emotions like pity and 'unearned' love. We are all vulnerable in some way.That's what it comes down to for me. If you look at ideology as a scale, this belongs very far on one side. On the other is Judeo-Christian social tradition and communism: Those have a lot in common. One side advocates empowerment and strength, and one side advocates shared vulnerability and trust. In the real world, where we are all individuals but we are all also parts of a society, our appetite for respect shouldn't allow either to dominate completely. By all means, read it and absorb everything about determination, work ethic and personal empowerment. But don't make it the end all be all. There's much more to learn."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Could somebody please explain why I can buy this book as a paperback at Amazon.com and import it to Australia but can't download it to my Kindle?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is a classic and very appropriate for our current times. It was received in good condition and in a timely manner as well"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand suffers from the worse case of diarrhea of the pen I have ever come across. The story is a merge of philosophy and fiction, a massive undertaking, and Rand writes in 15 beautiful descriptives what can be said just as beautifully and meaningfully in 5, which is a major detriment to both her fiction and her philosophy.It's almost understandable (but certainly not acceptable), given the philosophical undercurrent, that her characters are, for the most part, very black and white; it makes her points clear quickly. It's a shame she couldn't have used that same \\"clear quickly\\" aspect throughout her book.For those who might say that the dragging of the plot was perhaps deliberate, as a metaphor for how everything good must be worked for, I would have to reply that bad writing is no way to make a point.In the world Rand's lead character wishes to create in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" individuals of intelligence, reason, logic and responsibility would live in a civilization run by the most reasonable and logical individuals, and of course people who are lead by intelligence and responsibility would never have strong differences of opinion (written with sarcasm) and ultimately the answer to the opening of the book \\"Who is John Galt?\\" would become \\"We are\\" in a society of clones (the \\"titans of business\\") and drones (workers).This is the major flaw in the philosophy of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\": in the end all of Rand's \\"Responsible Individuals\\", with their personal determination, vision, passion, refusal to be coddled or to coddle, would become Galt knock offs.Yes, there were moments of \\"ah\\" and \\"oh\\" in this book, and there were moments when I found myself looking forward to reading. There's certainly nothing wrong with being responsible and individualistic. If not for Rand's beautiful but horrifically tedious style, there may have been more of those moments."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957, which I think is helpful to know to understand the context in which it was written. It was shortly after the Korean conflict and in the midst of McCarthyism, when the fear of Communism was on most Americans' mind. The book revolves around John Gault, one of the most enlightened minds in the country. When he learns that his invention of a motor that would be fueled by static electricity thereby increasing the efficiency of virtually every aspect of civilization is going to be subsumed by the government and become the property of the state, he decides to go on strike.The \\"brain strike\\" as he refers to it, is subsequently taken by all of the major leaders of industry, transportation, and commerce throughout the country. Those individuals who are responsible for the economy and ultimately the country's survival walk away and join Gault, where they're free to use their minds and their abilities without government intervention to advance technology, efficiency, and ultimately their own profitability within their hidden and closed civilization. As the titans abandon the country, the country quickly falls apart and the government leaders who insisted that their decisions were always for the betterment of society are revealed to have destroyed it with their involvement and control.I'm conflicted about this book. On the one hand, to read Rand's political philosophy during a time when our government believes that some businesses are too big to fail and has intervened in order to save them, and at a time that many citizens believe that the government is becoming too involved in the decision making abilities of its citizens, was remarkably appropriate and timely. And there were passages that I thought were brilliant such as when a government leader, pleading with Gault to intervene and rescue the country by offering him all the power and decision-making abilities possible, tells him that if he thinks the citizens should be free he'll be able to force them to be free.On the other hand, there were many things about the book that I couldn't stand. Rand's characters, who are supposed to be some of the brightest people on the planet, speak using dialogue that was juvenile at best. All of her characters were one-sided. Those who were proponents for her philosophy were given the best of characteristics while those whose beliefs were contrary to hers were given all of the worst. The government officials, the real antagonists in the book spoke and acted as if their sense of logic hadn't evolved since the 6th grade. She places the book in a poorly thought out futuristic era. It's never explained what year it's supposed to be. But apparently there's some need to have a calendar continually and inexplicably projected into the sky for people to refer to. Every time that was mentioned I thought \\"she's finally going to explain what the point of this is\\" but she never did. Throughout the book her characters go on long drawn out tirades in which they explain Rand's philosophical viewpoints. The final one given by Gault took me two days to read. The book is extremely and unnecessarily long and winded, kind of like this review has become - so I'm done."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"_Atlas Shrugged_ (1957) is a 1084 page novel by Ayn Rand which serves as little more than a vehicle to express her philosophy of rugged individualism and laissez-faire capitalism. I found the novel itself to be a decent science-fiction novel even though the underlying philosophy behind it remains highly dubious. The novel approaches the world from a hard absolute point of view dividing people into three categories - producers (the capitalists-industrialists of the novel), looters at the top, and moochers at the bottom. The characters presented by Rand are at once utterly ruthless egoists or envious weaklings who plot against them. The novel takes place in the future at the end of the \\"machine age\\" in which the creeping state has slowly taken over industry pushing the producers out and giving rise to a totalitarian system. (Rand was heavily opposed to the Soviet system she grew up under and this book arose out of her abject hatred for the state system of Soviet communism.) The main protagonists are chief industrialists who attempt to keep their businesses alive despite the fact that the state has captured nearly all industry. They include Dagny Taggart (a railroad executive), Hank Rearden (a steel magnate of great intelligence), and Francisco d'Anconia (a former copper magnate who has become a \\"worthless playboy\\"). The relationships between the protagonists are larger than life and human relationships are reduced to little more than sexual conquests or monetary transactions. Throughout the novel the question is repeatedly asked \\"Who is John Galt?\\" as a cry of despair. It turns out that John Galt is a genius of extraordinary powers who has developed a perpetual motion engine. Together with Galt and Ragnar Danneskjold (a philosopher turned pirate who now steals back taxes allegedly robbed from the hard-working producers), the elite group of industrialists, inventors, composers, and financiers \\"go on strike\\" and form a society based on individualist principles known as Galt's Gulch. In the meantime, various members of the outside world have managed to take over more industries and are shutting down Taggart Transcontinental and Rearden Steel. The world has quickly degenerated to a police state totalitarian society similar to the Soviet state and famines and outbreaks are occurring across the United States. The elite planners worry that they need the assistance of John Galt to serve as chief economic planner to force the system to function adequately. Galt emerges and gives a lengthy 60+ page speech amounting to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and praise of individual initiative, competency, and capitalism. In the meantime, the government has created a secret weapon known as Project X. Galt is tortured but manages to survive. And, finally with the help of Dagny Taggart manages to emerge and will reclaim society for individualism.I felt that this novel was a clever science fiction read; really there exists nothing like it. But, I do not think the philosophy can be taken seriously. Rand ignores the spiritual side of man and her philosophy ultimately became as absolute as any communist dictator. Still the book is interesting for its praise of the \\"machine age\\" of early capitalism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A book everyone should read especially in todays world. I gave it to my granddaughter who is studying finance in college."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A friend who read both Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead in the early '80s introduced me to Rand via discussion over the Christmas holiday, so I bought the 50th Anniversary edition at B & N; I finished the book today. I give Atlas Shrugged 3 stars for its overall quality as a serious and compelling novel. Its main fault mainly consists of the 176-page period between Dagny's return to \\"hell\\" and the beginning of Galt's speech (pages 747-923), within which little important takes place, and I thus quickly skimmed through. I also skimmed through several scenes of unnecessary drama between characters I didn't care about, such as Lillian and Cherryl. I can take very limited melodrama, and melodrama involving minor characters is too much of an irritant.I studied the basics of Rand's character and philosophy before reading Atlas. I found Rand to be rather interesting, yet flawed. And my interest only grew the more I read people on liberal blogs trashing her like she was the original neocon, from whom Cheney and Rumsfeld and Bush hatched, destined to destroy the world as they have. I find it fascinating how much inspiration Greenspan got from Rand. Studying Rand and her ideas lead me to believe that she was not exactly what these liberals make her out to be, but I knew that I needed to read Atlas to see her put her thoughts into fiction before I could confirm that.I was right, of course. Rand was a conservative, not a neocon. Some of her ideas are conducive to what has led us to ruin, but (Alan Greenspan excluded) they can't be the inspiration for the neocons. I believe that Rand would find Bush and the gang to be horrible people who practice the art of poison unto what she would consider effective government and policies. A few of my thoughts toward Ayn Rand follow.Ayn Rand had a philosophy, but was not a philosopher. She was a strong-willed woman who was highly influenced by her childhood and grew to be talented, artistic, dramatic, emotional, odd, dark, hypocritical, elitist, and somewhere between confident - narcissistic. She may have been obsessive or had a psychological disorder. Concisely, she was an intelligent and talented person who was limited by her eccentricities.Obviously, Rand is most criticized for her advocacy of Laissez-Faire Capitalism. Does it not seem that the most gaping flaw in her philosophy is that she did not appear to understand that all economic systems become corrupt because people are stupid? She clearly understood that people are stupid and that Communism was corrupt, so how could she come to believe that Capitalism would be immune and thus ideal? Well, this is why it's important to read Atlas Shrugged, because in Atlas she demonstrates her belief that regulated Capitalism also will fail because people are stupid. Her answer is that the only way to attain successful Laissez-Faire Capitalism is to let the masses kill each other and allow the world to sink into chaos, to be saved by a ruling class of the most brilliant and capable people alive, who will become the ruling class, install Laissez-Faire Capitalism, and rebuild the world into utopia. How much of that is fantasy? How much is a result of the governments she had experienced up until 1957? What I do believe is that if Rand's life continued and she were alive today, she would simply say that the deregulated Capitalism we've had so far is a miserable failure because of the corrupt idiots who have executed it, and until the best and brightest only rule, failure is inevitable. This distinction is why she is not a neocon and would not advocate what we're seeing today, and the people who think they're liberals who vilify her ought to pay attention to this.As for the rest of Ayn Rand's philosophy, I agree with those who say that she's not a particularly consequential thinker. She admits her philosophy is an ideal one, centered around what man ought to be. If I overlaid my ideal philosophy on hers, there wouldn't be much deviation. In fact, I think it's essential to have an ideal framework of thought. However, a philosophy for the real world is likely to have more impact and success, and I have one of those too. It seems to me that Rand's propensities for drama, fantasy, and narcissism (plus perhaps more things) led her to believe that she was a big-time thinker and ought to be recognized as such and accomplish great things accordingly. What apparently happened was enough gullible people fell for it and helped her get where she wasn't going without their assistance (okay, so I contributed $8.99 to buy Atlas!). Really, she ended up making herself believe that she lived up to her philosophy as well. Page 1070 (the final page) of the 50th Anniversary edition I read includes the following quote: \\"I have always lived by the philosophy I present in my books---and it has worked for me as it has worked for my characters.\\" To put it mildly, significant selectivity would be required for that to be true; Rand did not consistently live up to the ideals of her philosophy.So, I've done the Rand thing. It's time to shelve Atlas. No need to read The Fountainhead. I'll happily take with me the parts that resonated, though. My favorite is a theme from the John Galt speech...the angry ranting directed toward the masses who wreck the world. I rant too, Ayn. I understand the contempt for those who don't live up to their potential all too well, and I wish I could fix them or eliminate them. And when I get disgusted at them, I find I, too, place zero worth on their lives. Maybe the next time I'm alone in my car and a chance to rant appears, I'll try to say what John Galt would say."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"We all know this is a highly controversial book.First thing to say is this: I'm not an objectivist. I've read alot of stuff about the character of Ayn Rand, and I believe that I would've very much disliked her if I ever met her.That said, I have only recently discovered the merits of individualism, and reading this novel helped me give words and form to the ideas that I had developed. Long before I read this, I was a fascist. My beliefs led me to join the infantry, and during my first deployment, I started to think that maybe my ideas had been wrong. Fast forward a year and a half, and I was deployed again, this time very much against my will. By this time I had come to believe that there was nothing more important than the individual.My mind was a ripe target for this book at that time. Many of the ideas that I had at this point lacked the proper words to describe them to people. Atlas Shrugged helped.The characters are caricatures. The good guys are ridiculously good, the bad guys are ridiculously bad. The only character that I truly liked was Francisco. I lost all respect for Reardon when he cheated on his wife with Dagny. The scenes in which Francisco talks to Reardon, however, are among my favorites in the book.If I was to judge this book solely on its narrative and depth of characterization, it would probably score a 2. But the philosophy is one that very strongly resonates with me.It should of course be noted that even Ayn Rand recognized the simplicity of her characters. Of course, this acknowledement doesn't make them any less shallow.If you consider yourself a lover of freedom, capitalism, or a Libertarian, this should absolutely be on your reading list."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this 45 years ago and still reread it every few years. Don't be put off by the length. Its so compelling I read it in three days the first time and the plot pulls you along. Then one can go back and linger more deeply. Even after all these years there are still parts I need to revisit.Atlas Shrugged and Fountain are the best American novels I can think of. Such incredible depth."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is an excellent book of fiction, about big business and big government. The storyline starts out in a happy time, with government not too big, and thriving capitalism.It goes on to detail a government that becomes too controlling, and the resulting failure of the economy and the corporations that provide jobs to the people who want to work. Capitolism is destroyed by liberal government.Everyone is forced to be dependant on the new fascist government, and all freedoms are taken, one-by-one, from the people and businesses. The best conservative business owners, smartest inventors, and hardest workers go on strike, hiding from the government control, and making their own way in their own land.Ayn Rand was originally going to call this book 'The Strike', but changed the title to Atlas Shrugged.This book is fiction, but eerily like what is happening in our society right now (2009)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is easy to review this book negatively. I cannot think of another novel that employs a similar format--it devotes far too much time to what turn out to be minor characters, it is overtly didactic in the extreme, the plot devices and revelations are extremely easy to foresee, and secrets are often needlessly kept from the reader. The narrative is divided somewhat arbitrarily into what I came to think of as two parts, which seemed to have little to do with each other. The book itself is as much an exposition of a philosophy as a novel, and the novel aspect suffers accordingly. The philosophical posturing can at times be burdensome and repetitive. It takes too long at the beginning to involve the reader in the central conflict or in what turn out to be the main characters.Then is it a terrible book or a good one? Certainly the philosophy alone couldn't be good enough to overcome the book's many storytelling faux pas, could it? Again, Rand's central philosophy (later termed Objectivism, of which this book is the defining manifesto) has its flaws, which are indeed numerous.So why the 5-star rating? It may sound trite, but this book is the best example I could offer of a whole being greater than the sum of its parts.Yes, the characters can in many ways be considered two-dimensional, but they do change in subtle ways. Their struggles are wholly believable; their triumphs are real ones. And the world, society itself, is raised almost to a level of \\"character-hood\\" by the way the story unfolds. And this character undergoes a profound transformation indeed.Yes, the philosophy is rammed down your throat a bit ham-handedly. But the author has made no effort to disguise it; it is not as if, quietly and by degrees, one is made to believe something abhorrent simply by reading; as you read, you learn what she believes and why, and you either take it or leave it. Either way, it is a singular accomplishment. There are many philosophies that are simple, original, or profound. Rand's is all three. I offer specifically Francisco's \\"money\\" speech, or Jeff Allen's description of the decline and fall of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.I found myself caught up in this book far more than perhaps I would have thought it deserved, had I merely had it described to me. It swallowed me whole for two weeks. I knew the philosophy was being presented with all the subtlety of a firehose; I let it wash over me. In points, I agreed with it completely; in others, I found it repulsive. But I could not ignore it. The book has something to say about love, sex, politics, economics, history, human nature, happiness, greed, shame, courage, selfishness, art, and exceptionalism. Every idea presented may or may not be true, but each is worthy of consideration.Perhaps most importantly, the book is timely beyond almost anyone's ability to predict. I read it while traveling, and hearing the occasional newscast in an airport left me thinking \\"haven't they read Ayn Rand?\\" I have thought this many times since. Reading the book in the 80's or 90's might have left a reader feeling like the author set up a straw man and then let Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden (among others) knock him down. Today we see that, as deeply contradictory and dishonest as the antagonists' credo seemed, it holds an incredible amount of sway over our own world. But only after reading Atlas Shrugged do I fully recognize it.As a novel, this book does in fact overcome its flaws in above average fashion. As a philosophical treatise, it is interesting and well worth reading. As a warning, it is nothing short of fascinating, frightening, and motivating. In a word: indispensable."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Very good quality book, larger print and easier to read than paperback. Its spooky how Ayn nailed the events we are witnessing on a daily basis so many years ago.

Time to escape to Galt's Gulch."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is what I learned from this book: Self-reliance, self-responsiblity, the power of the human spirit and will, Independence, and a desire to be great. I learned that morals rather then being based on the whims of priests or philosophers, could actually be based on concrete, rational, empirical and fact proven grounds, and that if it could not be proven thus, it shouldn't be a moral. I learned that morals are based on value, and that the only value each of us has is our own life, and that when seen in this light all my morals should be for one purpose, to protect, provide, or promote life. My life, and those I love.I learned I should always act in my own, long-term rational self-interest. Long-term and rational because if I just acted in my own self interest all the time, without any regard for the long-term affects, then nothing would stop me from thinking that robbing my next door neighbor would be a bad thing.There are many things I am still struggling to completely understand in this book and I have reviewed it often. There are parts I am sure are Truth, and parts where I think she missed the mark. There are parts where I believe she let her own strong emotions and emnity towards what she viewed as the evil in this world get the best of her own rational mind. She is only human after all. In the end, she is a certifiable genius, and this is her magnum opus, and In my opinion a great work of FICTION, that just happens to teach many valid, and many important concepts, morals, and rational thinking. I would recommend it to anyone, and let them be the judge as to its merits. Whatever anyone else may think, this book had merit for me, it provoked a lot of thought, and soul seeking, and that in and of itself lets me rate it a well deserved 5 stars.

The weeks of reading this novel helped me to change, mature, and to develop my philosophy on government, economics, relationships, and life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First of all, let me say that this is a really long book...too long. I don't see any reason it should be almost 1,100 pages in just about the smallest print possible to comprehend. Having said that, it is a rewarding book, full of insight, perspective, and prescience. I never thought of how flawed a Communist/Socialist system could be until I read this book. Rand dissects the greed, deceit, and opportunism behind a deceptive government system in a way I have never seen before. She has an uncomprimising yet understandable vision that is reflected from her own horrific experiences in a Communist hell, where she barely escaped and almost starved. Her rage against such a system is justified and she channels it into a compelling story in Atlas Shrugged.This book has transformed the way many college students think, especially in terms of how advantageous a capitalist society can be. In Rand's view, only selfish motives can ultimately bring about progress and hence, the achievements that will most benefit humanity. Her views have merit, too. Would we really be motivated to undertake as many of the grueling endeavors we do without motivations that are inherently selfish, namely money and ownership? Maybe a handful of us are innately altruistic, but the majority of us are not, and if left to depend on altruism alone, we would surely perish.Philosophical ruminations aside, there is a lot to dislike about this book as well. While Rand's prose captures images and sensations like few other authors have, this is somewhat tempered by her absolute need to hammer home a message that is well-established within the early parts of the book. She makes it clear that she believes socialism to be the root of all evil from the beginning, yet she feels the need to keep pounding away at the reader's brain in case we missed it the first fifty times or so that she very explicitly said it. Subtlety is not this book's strength, and its hardheadedness wears on the reader. Granted this was written during a time of anti-Communist sentiment, but Rand doesn't trust her readers to make their own judgements and winds up coming off as elitist herself, not to mention condescending.The characters, while often fascinating, frequently and irritatingly break into philosophical discourses practically every page. Some of these discussions and arguments are really thought-provoking, but too often, it's obtrusive and gets in the way of creating well-rounded and human characters. Almost none of them have layers; almost all of them are either completely virtuous or completely evil. She writes a novel that achieves greatness in many respects, especially in plotting and substance, but is severly lacking in others, namely her inability (or lack of restraint) to create characters with flaws as well as values.Rand creates a terrifying and, for its day, timely environment where the world is on the brink of collapse because of people's unwillingly to rely on each other and their gullibility to a system of empty promises. She evokes many emotions with her writing, which is quite strong overall. If it weren't so didactic, I'd be willing to award this book the full five stars, but as it is, it's a worthwhile read. It's bloated and overlong, but there's a reason it's a seminal classic. Her philosophy is a little extreme and many certainly won't fully agree with it, but at least she's got one and isn't afraid to imbue her work with it, which is more than can be said for a lot of other books out there."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed the book Atlas Shrugged mainly because I of the emotion that each character portrayed. The other asspect of the book as in the societal and ethical aspect were a bit extreme. The constant power struggle for money and control of others seemed a bit unrealistic. Overall I felt that this book is a book that could be enjoyed due to its fanstacy aspect but not to be based on reality. If one enjoyes the emotional journey of the human mind and what drives people then Atlas Shrugged is a book that they show definetly read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...Actually, I very much did enjoy the novel. Its political (and social) philosophy seems to mesh well with my understanding of the world, particualarly in that, just like my world view, objectivism is overly simplistic, very contridictory, and generally anti-social.While getting into the novel -- maybe the first 50 pages -- is a little tough, overall it is a page turner . . . except for a few redundant passages of preaching, and one unnecessary chapter of absolute podium pounding. The novel's success seems due to characters that, while superhuman and at times two-dimensional, are strangely engaging, as well as a plot that is an interesting inversion of the usual; e.g., a focus on the oppression of the owners of the means of production.I hesitate to give the novel four stars because of its problems in readability, but three is too low on account of the presentation of the philosophy, specifically in its application of economic philosophy to personal and family relations. Therefore, I give _Atlas Shrugged_ 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Ayn Rand's book, Atlas Shrugged, with no prior knowledge of her philosophy. In fact, I had never even heard of Rand. Though her book may seem to push for readers to learn and support her theories, it is still enjoyable reading for those who do not agree with what Rand has to say.The books 1000+ pages make it seem overbearing and unnecessary. I do believe that Rand could accomplish her argument and convey her thoughts in fewer pages. I'm sure the philosophical points of the storyline do require some space, however, there is one part in particular that could be cut completely. Throughout the book Rand makes a plea for her argument through her characters and the events that occur, but towards the end of the book one character gives a 60-page monologue in which he explains the philosophy, which has just been expressed throughout the entire book! Also, some parts of the book seem \\"dragged out\\" - sort of like the movie Cast Away, that's more than two hours long, but could have easily finished in less time.Though I found the book rather lengthy, it was still enjoyable and I was able to make it through. The intensity and intrigue of the characters develop the story a great deal and are helpful in keeping the reader's interest. Another imperative point to make about this book is that it is realistic; it makes you think about what would happen if the events of the book occur in real life. In fact, we have actually seen some things like it already - Microsoft and Enron. The book actually reminded me of Fahrenheit 451, which I found fascinating. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is not specifically looking for a romance or action, but just some thought-provoking, insightful reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Things I liked about Atlas Shrugged:1) It talks about people being creative in the kinds of jobs that are not considered to be so- engineering, smelting, dispatching,etc. and damned if she doesn't make it exciting.2) The sex is pretty hot3) It makes some pretty great arguements that if a person is personally fulfilled and honest about their needs, they have more to offer the world.4) I really couldn't tell what was going to happen next5) The secret hide away- that was a cool thing, too bad they had to do work while they were there6) The clever little ways the master plans were put into motion-I love cleverNot so thrilled about:1) Hardly any kids, with a book so concerned about the future, I would think one of those future embodiments might be around2) The &quot;One good woman&quot; syndrome.

What I found was more like Tom Robbins channelling the spirit of Alan Greenspan. Yes, Atlas Shrugged is little more than a vehicle for Ayn Rand's money-worshipping philosophy of greed. But it's how she pulls it off that's infinitely charming. She has Robbins' weirdness, but with a driving commitment to absolute truth that gives her work a powerful edge.Atlas Shrugged includes such improbabilities as a submarine-captaining pirate who steals from the poor and gives it all to the rich, a lost Atlantis hidden in the Rocky Mountains, a perpetual motion matchine that runs on static electricity, and a sonic doomsday device along with the more mundane trimming of pulp novels: mysterious disappearances, sordid affairs, fiendish plots and, as I mentioned before, an airplane chase.Atlas Shrugged is what I like to call \\"Pulp Philosophy\\" (or, if you prefer, Philosophy with a car chase). I picked the book up because I wanted to know what Rand thought about things. But I finished it because it's good fun. Just don't take it too seriously.--Not written by Alkelda, but her husband [who didn't check to see under what profile he was writing.]"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Before I go into any details about AS, I wan't to let anyone who's reading my review know that I am by no means an authority on Rand's work, philosophy, or any philosophy, for that matter. This is actually the first philosophical book I've ever read... Well, on to the review, with the stuff I liked listed first. First, I thought that the entire book was an amazing work of fiction. Although I admit that the characters in the book, although for the most part pretty real, have some rather impossible characteristics, they are still some of the most memorable people I've ever read about. I don't think I'll ever forget people of the likes of Dagny, Galt, Rearden, or any of them, for that matter. Now, as to what I didn't like about the characters. I thought that it was a little odd that every character was so, well, extreme. For instance, every character, minus perhaps Eddie Willers, is either perfect(or maybe perfect, just confused), or absolutely, no-way-around-it evil. There's no one in that middle ground, which is so blatantly unrealistic that I'm surprised that Rand didn't catch it. Then again, I see this book as almost a Bible for Objectivism, and I personally think a lot of the characters in the real Bible are absolute crap too. As for the philosophy that the book advertises, I basically agree with it, although there are some parts I don't. I agree completely with what another reviewer said, about how the philosophy tends to breed people who, thinking their being like Dagny or Rearden, don't even deign to notice the opinions of others, unless there the same as their's. Obviously, you can't go through life thinking anyone who disagrees with you is a complete idiot. Although they might be, you could just be decieving yourself and disregarding the opinion of someone you really shouldn't. Besides this fact and a few others, her philosophy is very sound. I think her ideas about money are absolutely correct, and her thoughts on doing everything with your own happiness as your motive, although they sound distasteful, make complete sense. One other thing I loved about the book is simply that its sooo long. The copy I had was 1074 pages long, with print the size you'd normally see for subscripts. That meant a huge amount of my time was occupied with an engaging, thought provoking read, which is all I can ask for in a book. Well, that's basically all I have to say. The book was, overall, despite its flaws, an amazing read. Its one of those books that you not only can read several times, but probably should read several times, just to keep Rand's ideas fresh. I think that anyone who's interested in philosophy or money should be required to read this work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow-I didn't think that I could make it through the countless hours listening to the reading of this book, but as I has countless hours on the road, I couldn't find a reason to stop, since I had been thinking about doing this for years.This is not a review of the book, only the reading of it in the audiobook. It lasts over 60 hours, so you really need to like Scott Brick's voice to make it through. Well, It leaves something to be desired.The protagonist's voices are all done in a forceful manor, measured and purposeful. Patient as though speaking to a child. While this is acceptable, since people that are as driven as these may well speak like this, after speaking so long to subordinates who aren't as smart as they are and cannot comprehend the broader world. The falsetto voice of Dagny Taggart starts to get a bit annoying by about chapter 10 and slowly gets worse after that. Picture a breathy Marilyn Monroe combined with an emotionless Mr. Spock from Star Trek.The rest of the characters are entirely, without an exception, read with a whiney, scared, dopey and uneducated voice. Here, picture Barney Fife.This is annoying and condescending, since the listener is not given the opportunity to develop his own opinions about the characters. The entire world is incompetent except for the main protagonists. This may well fit the the author's opinion and view of the real world, but the effect is to turn the story from fiction to science fiction. A story taking place in a parallel world - again out of Star Trek. A world similar to our own, but where people act and talk strangely and in a manor very much unbelievable"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I FIRST READ THE BOOK.

The sooner you read this book the better you will be in life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book though written over 50 years ago, is a mirror image of our government and society today. I had just completed a chapter about a coal mine owner who just walked away from his business because he was overwhelmed with the government bureaucracy and intrusion into his business. The next morning on the news a man in AL walked away from his mining company because he couldn't deal with fighting the government just to stay in business. Several times this has happened as I read this book and I am not finished it yet. This book is a real eye opener. Ayn Rand was a very intuitive aand creative person to put her philosophy in a novel format. A great read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There have been many excellent reviews of this book and after reading a few I hesitated to throw in my two cents but I think I have something different to say. Complaints have been made about the shallowness of the characters and the improbability of the plot. I think the author was attempting to put a social experiment into novel form. Any scientist will tell you that to create an experiment, certain controlled elements must be involved. \\"Real life\\" seldom exists fully in experiments because there are too many varibles. That is the case here. The characters are one dimensional on purpose. The removal of the great thinkers of industry from the equation is not realistic and consequently the erosion of the American economy is much faster as a result. This is the purpose of the experiment however. What happens if. . . ? If this book had been written as a documentary on what happens when multi dimensional characters act as you would expect them over time, this book would have been much longer. This artifical scenario was required in order to distill the message down to it's essence. If you want a \\"realistic\\" story on the same topic, read a history of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. An in-depth version of that story would be have to be multi-volume in nature.This is a great book albiet with noteable flaws. I firmly beleive in the essence of the message. However, charity should never be ignored but it should not be government charity. As the book points out, government, buy it's very nature, is too corrupt and inefficient to dispense it. I get satisfaction out of giving money to charities and therefore it has value to me. I get little out of paying taxes. Religion, given short shrift by Ms. Rand, is essential to the grounding and rounding out of our values. This and the heavy philiophical angle are the reasons for the four stars and not five. I have a B.A in Education and I found it hard to wade through. I skipped most of the 60 page masters thesis on philosophy that passes as a speech to the masses in America, the vast majority of whom would never have listened to it all. The plot alone says what needs to be said. If you majored in philosophy in college, go for it. Wade in there and drink it all in. I disagree with those who say you need to read that to understand the book. I am very glad I bought and read this book. It took ten days and it was well spent. The Japanese have a saying though. Everyone should climb Mt. Fuji once. Only a fool climbs it twice. I doubt I will go back and re-read it any time soon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I purchased this book for my husband's birthday and was very disappointed to find that it arrived damaged. I returned it to Amazon and requested a replacement, which also arrived damaged. I've never had a problem with dented or torn books from Amazon before, so I'm thinking that this edition was made with materials too flimsy for its massive size. I ended up returning it outright and plan to buy a hardcover edition instead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My experience with purchasing this book through Amazon was very quick and efficient. The price was right too. Despite the length of the book, I am enjoying reading it. I find it unbelievable that this book was written 50 years ago (+) and how well it relates to today. This just goes to prove that ideas and ways to run a country or a government... are never new; just new people think they can do it better. REALLY? I believe in individual freedom and liberty as described in America's founding documents. I don't believe that any government or head of state has the right to pick and choose who wins or who loses in business or life.

I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged could be prophetic when all is said and done. It's eerie to see some of the similarities between the culture that Rand depicts and our current society.I particularly liked how the people within the government were portrayed. They were always looking to other people to solve the problems while trying to hold on to power themselves.This book is definitely worth the read. It will open your eyes to what the logical conclusion of our current path of government is.My only criticism of this book is the length. There were too many speeches in my mind and a lot of the book seemed repetitive in ideas and could be cut out. Other than that, probably the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Greed, for the lack of a better word, is good. And greed will save the United States of America.&quot; One has to suspect that Gordon Gekko's famous speech in Wall Street was inspired in small part by Ayn Rand's masterpiece. Reading it, even a dyed-in-the-wool Communist will understand why free markets work and government intervention and planned economies do not. Rand's masterpiece is timeless and a must-read for every political-science and economics major in our colleges. Unforgettable (if somewhat one-dimensional) characters, a purposeful plot, and an unquenchable belief -- the freedom to choose one's own destiny, good or bad -- make this not just a book, but THE Book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have found that Objectivism isn't very radical at all, and many people are quasi-Objectivists without knowing it. For example, her metaphysics is easily the most popular system in the world, that &quot;A is A,&quot; and although she is branded as a cult philosopher, none of her conclusions are derived from anything otherworldly or revelatory. Most of her criticism comes from the fact that her followers are die-hards, and in a rational world, that would be considered virtuous.Atlas Shrugged is a perfect introduction to a great thinker and a provocative philosophy. Do not dignigy the posts on this review board which make invalid criticisms. Before reading, keep in mind that Atlas Shrugged is a work of Romanticism. The characters and ideas are exaggerated intentionally to bolden their stances, courses of action, and clashes against one another. Do not be discouraged by uniformed reviewers who have not arrived at the obvious. Miss Rand herself divulged that Atlas Shrugged, like all of her fictional works, is a story about ideas. Therefore, when you read a post criticizing the believability of her characters or plot, remember that this is intentional and should not detract from the author's artistic merit. Her primary purpose is to portray man &quot;as he might and ought to be.&quot;Furthermore, do not consider the posts that say her philosophy is a brainwasher because someone's distinguished college professor said so. One person made the claim that Miss Rand would chastise someone for giving bread to the poor. This is simply untrue, and much more information on this can be found in her other books, such as The Virtue of Selfishness. Her ethical/political stance does not promote blind intolerance of others, such as the poor- it advocates free choice as to whether or not you wish to give. It does not urge one to lie and cheat his way to the top- it asks that one adhere to his or her values and live life in an honorable way.At first, I too was very critical of Objectivism, until I realized that its premises weren't very different from those I've always held. But the most important thing is that it brings this to your attention, and in a way it brightens your values and love of life.I believe that most of Miss Rand's critics are afraid of her because she demands the best from them. They are afraid of that notion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having read voluminous amounts of literature considered the greatest in history. I have no need to list each tome (since I would then be forced in giving a comentary on them, because I can't help myself.) I, and a great deal of the Western Philosophical world place Atlas Shrugged among the great works of human history. If this sounds nutty, it was proclaimed the second most influential book of all time by the Library of Congress! It needs no defense from me, it is truly the peak of creative writing. Extremely complex, and far from the accusations made by some other reviewers who clearly haven't read the book. If someone idealogically disagrees with Ayn Rand, then their expectations would be imposed on her works. Thus causeing a callous disregard of the brilliance of the work.As Atlas Shrugged compares with other great novels of thought such as Orwell and his 1984, most people agree that 1984 is brilliant. In fact, some people who hold idealogies which bring about conditions like those in 1984, for example communists, also feel that 1984 is brilliant. I think that both Rand and Orwell were fighting a idealogical battle against the same people. Namely the socialists/communists, but Orwell never mentioned the soc/com by name. He merely showed the masses what it is like under a communist system (or rather a tyrannical oligarchy/despotism, which all communist governments in history have eventually became.[excepting a few short lived small scale expiriments where the people in the society had the ability to leave]) Rand, on the other hand, attacked the idealogy behind communism (and socialism), this is why Orwell is praised and Rand is despised. Because a person can read 1984 and remain a soc/com, but it is very hard for a soc/com to read Atlas Shrugged and to remain so.I would wager and can in fact claim, having had expirience that all of those people who give Atlas Shrugged a low score have not read it. All socialists whom I have talked with about it, blurted forth accusations against it. Yet ultimately admitted that they had not read it. Or had begun reading it only to get a few pages into it before quiting. This is because it is very hard for a liberal (socialist) to read it, because it is true. And it ultimately condemns the individual's belief system. As a person who was &quot;redeemed&quot; by this book, I strongly suggest it. Both as a good read and as an excellent philosophical work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged challenges the way modern Americans and modern American society function; hence the excessively vitriolic responses in this review section. Readers are being jolted out of their comfort zones and being told to question the way they think. But the essence of Atlas Shrugged, and Ayn Rand's philosophy, is simple: the book declares that an individual has no obligation to anyone or anything else - not to society or to other individuals. The reason so many people react so harshly to Atlas Shrugged is that they demand that others feel obligated toward them. They have grown comfortable in the quasi-socialism of American society, where each citizen is expected to take care of everyone else. And the essential message of the book is positive: Ayn Rand is glorifying the productive capabilities of man. How can that be a negative thing? Why does that offend so many people? It's equally important to note that most readers who enjoy Atlas Shrugged DO NOT blindly accept everything and anything that the book and Ayn Rand have to say. Despite Rand's own assertions that one must accept everything or nothing of her philosophy, intelligent readers today can sift through the minor inconsistencies and fallacies of Objectivism to glean the positive, life-affirming aspects of the book as a whole. The inability of those who claim to dislike the book to intelligently discuss its merits is the same ignorance that afflicts modern academia. Where is Ayn Rand in the universities today? Nowhere - professors know that her philosophy refutes everything they try to teach, and they're scared to address it because they don't know how to refute it. If Rand's philosophy were so easily discarded, professors would have no hesitation to introduce it and identify its fallacies. And no one can claim that the philosophy doesn't warrant attention. The mere fact that it generates such heated responses from people on both sides clearly demonstrates its impact and the need to study and discuss it. If professors truly cared about opening students' minds, they would welcome the opportunity to address Ayn Rand's philosophy. They would learn that people DO endorse aspects of her philosophy, without blindly following everything she had to say."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There have been a lot of nasty reviews about this book -- not sure why -- but let me say this: if there is ever a book that is worth reading it is this one. It will change your life. It's long, yes, and challenging in parts, because of the precision of Ayn's word choices, but it will take you to an amazing world that will make you entirely rethink everything you've been taught about life and what gives life its meaning. The heroes of the story are industrialists, persecuted for simply being profitable, damned by society at large for providing the best within themselves. The villains are power-hungry bureaucrats and lobbyists (much like today, no?), who use the virtue of these industrialists to catch them in a game that will only have one devastating result. But even more than this, the book is about being human and the choices that we must make, in love, in business, to live for ourselves or to live for the sake of others -- and what that really means.

I ordered it, and am in the process of listening to it (I'm currently on Disk 34 of 50 disks, which total about 65 hours of audio!) The quality is exceptional; Scott Brick is a wonderful artist. He effortlessly creates a distinct voice for each of the major characters, and there is never any question of which character is speaking at any time. I recommend the set with no reservations, save one: I have never figured out why the set was offered at $37 when it was first released, and shortly afterward I checked back and that price was GONE...now it is up to $116.80 (as of today). I don't know if mine was a pricing error, but I do know the set is definitely high quality and if you want to do Atlas Shrugged on audiobook, you won't be disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand got a good look at the \\"hope and change\\" the Bolsheviks brought to her country, and the decimation of the middle class. Health care didn't fare too well either, as her father's phamacy was confiscated (presumably to \\"spread the wealth\\").Rand draws the struggle between the classic liberals and the statists into sharp relief. This black-and-white contrast is intentional, to clarify what is at the heart of the power grab of those who claim to have the masses' interest at heart. In the end, dictators emerge with the power, who may dispose of people and material resources as they choose.Ayn's prophecies are far more lucid and accurate than Nostradamus's. In her case, she isn't writing pure fiction, she is recasting a story that she saw unfold in her early life. Ayn escaped the Soviets by emigrating to America.

For example, the typical person who submits a poor review of the novel mainly defames the readers who have enjoyed it, not the actual philosophies that have been embedded into the ficiticious form. For those people who have asserted that readers who have enjoyed &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; are victim to low IQ's-- it is actually you who are victim to blatant stupiditity. Please attack the premises of the book, not the intellect of the reader. Such a constructive argument would be of benefit to both yourself and to your readers (note: not all reviews are mired in ignorance-- some are actually well-reasoned criticisms of objectivism). Now moving on to the intelligent reader: &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; deserves its labeling as a classic of modern fiction. The fundamentals of objectivist philosophy are presented to the reader in the form of ficition, which is certainly easier to digest than a tedious manifesto on moral law (e.g. Kant, Mill, etc.). While the story itself can sometimes be laborious, and Rand's prose is not as beautiful as Faulkner's or Marquez's (among other literary giants, of which Rand is not); the reflections upon human greatness are spectacular. That, to me, is what counts, and that is why I have given &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; a terrific rating. In parting, I will offer one last idea: &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a book meant for those readers and intellectuals who are on some level bothered by societal pressure to succumb to humility and self-sacrifice. It depicts man as a hero, not as the tragic victim of his own incompentence. If these views in any way accord with your own, then read and cherish &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; If, however, you believe that man is something other than great... well, if you're not going to at least construct an intelligible argument against greatness, then you should have your tongue cut out by garden sheers, and your hands smashed by a mallet.

My review of the 1/9th+ that I have read should be seen better than one who has completed the book and passed judgment on it. Firstly about the artistic scope. Ayn Rand is so far describing mental processes better than any author that I've had the pleasure of observing. Her theorums and analyses are akin to an interesting psychology textbook. A character (spoiler-proof :-) loses their virginity in the section before the section I'm in now. Rand explains the situation in excruciating mental detail, but refrains from using explicit language or tones.

This is from near the novel's beginning:&quot;She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the pane hung over empty darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while.&quot;Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The coat collar was raised to the slanting brim of her hat. A sweep of brown hair fell back, almost touching the line of her shoulders. Her face was made of angular planes, the shape of her mouth clear-cut, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. She kept her hands in the coat pockets, her posture taut, as if she resented immobility, and unfeminine, as if she were unconscious of her own body and that it was a woman's body.&quot;She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be.&quot;It was the song of an immense deliverance.&quot;She thought: For just a few moments -- while this lasts -- it is all right to surrender completely -- to forget everything and just permit yourself to feel.

Rand's epic resonates deeply for me, and unlike many, I actually thought John Galt's famous speech was very finely written. I have revisited her ideas many times, and I firmly believe that even if you ultimately disagree with Ayn Rand's conclusions, the book will wake you up, and make you think, and stay with you for years to come. In a life crammed with triviality, that is the best recommendation one can give any work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Have you ever read 'Atlas Shrugged'?&quot; I asked my roommate.&quot;Naah. I heard it was three times as long as it needed to be.&quot;No matter what else one might say about Ayn Rand, it cannotbe denied that she was first a philosopher and a writer bydefault.The case for objectivism is clearly, if exhaustingly, laidout in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. The productive, the creators, arehailed, while the unproductive, the parasites are given theirjust desserts by the end of the novel. The idea that onecannot live off the effort of others, but must stand on one'sown feet and survive by the sweat of one's own brow is an ideathis country was founded on. Somehow, we've forgotten itunder mounds of policy Ms. Rand reminds us in this weightydoomsday missive.&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a worthy read. The plot is fascinating,even if the characters are one-sided (the same can be said ofThe Bible). Though Ms. Rand tends to make her point multipletimes within the same scene, the story never stops. It'sscope and depth are breathtaking.Whatever you feel about Ms. Rand's philosophy of objectivism,and there are definite holes in her logic (oddly enough, thisis one of the values she holds most high), &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;will change your life. You may not come away a dyed in the woolbeliever, but you will uncover much of what's wrong with thecurrent American way of life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most powerful novels ever written and when you consider that the major theme is about the relationship between the actions and consequenses of hundres of characters throughout every strata of society, it's an amazing feat. Rand's ability to weave a series of complex economic lessons into a compelling plot makes this book a superb tool for teaching lessaiz-faire economics in the guise of entertainment. That having been said, the book does have a couple of flaws. Rand's characters exist only to advance the plot. They are cyphers aside from the brief moments when they declaim their economic or philosophical positions and then act on them, to the advancement of the plot, but without making the characters anything more than chess pieces. Mind you, they're brilliantly manipulated chess pieces, but they remind the reader that this is ultimately less a novel than a morality play. The second flaw is the thirty pages of Galt's speech that ends the book. I've read Atlas Shrugged half a dozen times, and I've never gotten through that speech in one sitting. It kills the climax of the story. It's really unnecessary, as the rest of the novel more than makes her points."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was written to voice a possible future political climate as Ayn Rand foresaw it. It is similar to George Orwell's \\"1984\\" in that their main theme includes a controlling government. But Atlas Shrugged's purpose, government and its scope are very different. The tongue-in-cheek humor and allusion in 1984 is missing from Atlas Shrugged. 1984 was written in 1948; Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Both are well written. Both, in order to make their story work, weave in a little science fiction.Atlas Shrugged is also available in audio book form, for those intimidated by its 1000 pages.Atlas Shrugged is far more complex -- and long than 1984. The government's purpose in both is similar but Atlas Shrugged begins with a normal country similar to that of 1950 America (sans the influence and control of the Constitution). Powerful politicians, business leaders and scientists are the policy makers. These \\"behind the scene insiders\\" sell their form of \\"government\\" to a gullible, ignorant and self serving public, using two tried and true political ploys: (1) to each according to their ability and to each according to their need (translation: class warfare); (2) for the good of the people.The protagonists are also powerful business leaders except they oppose the idea of government control over the individual. They fight for individual freedom for all as outlined in the original Constitution.A note to younger readers: Rand's style uses lengthy character development and conversational interaction. Although a real \\"page turner,\\" it is not the fast paced modern style of writing. It is important to the story (especially to her conservative views) but at times seems a bit wordyAs a novel, it is a great read and I do not want to spoil it. I only give you the essence of the book so you can decide if it is a book for you. I leave the details for your exploration and discovery. To accept an abbreviated summation of Atlas Shrugged is like looking at a picture of the Grand Canyon and believing that you done \\"been 'dere, done 'dat.\\"Atlas Shrugged's real purpose unveils the weaknesses and consequences of liberal thinking. It is an accelerated picture of the politics from the 1930's, through to a fairly accurate mirror of what Ms Rand foresaw would exist in today's politics - and beyond. Happily, it does not have a sad end.In a sentence, Atlas Shrugged is an epic novel of romance, mystery, conspiracy and intrigue. It is well written and gripping despite its technical and political weaknesses, which are easily overlooked. (Remember, it was written in the 1950's.) It is heavily influenced by its conservative author. This is so evident that a person steeped in liberal philosophy will find it most objectionable. Conservatives, independents and libertarians will find it thought provoking, controversial and enjoyable.In keeping with the liberal agenda of today's universities, 1984 was on my required reading list. Most people have heard of, if not read 1984 but few have heard of Atlas Shrugged.I mention the following to exemplify the political climate in the media and publishing world. There are two \\"top 100 lists\\" of America's greatest novels, both published in the late 1990's. Atlas Shrugged heads one list but deserves no mention in the other. One list was authored by the editorial board of Modern Library (associated with the publisher Random House) consisting of 11 authors (who graciously included a number of their own novels). The second is a poll of 200,000 selected readers. I leave it to your wisdom to select the one listing Atlas Shrugged #1.Ayn Rand was an influential conservative, ahead of her time. Today, there is a conservative \\"Think Tank\\" named after her. [...]"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every few years I pull out Atlas Shrugged and read it again. Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As to the story, it is magnificent. Amazing that 54 years after release it still relates to today's economy. I will not review the story - it has been rated the 2nd most influential book on the planet, after the Bible. I'll leave it there.Physically, the book is nicely hard covered. The cover has a glossy finish and the spine is strong - too strong to lay open on a table while you eat lunch, but not obscuring the spine side text. 1079 pages of small print - looks like 0.0032\\" thick paper. The paper feels thin to the touch, almost like newspaper. There are 51 lines/page on the even (left) pages, 50 lines/page on the odd (right) pages. (Does anyone know why that is? I'd like to know.)

The plot was engaging and intense, with an interesting mystery that unravels with every chapter. This book never stagnates - the story is always moving forward, and every aspect serves a purpose in developing the plot.Ayn Rand's prose was extremely enjoyable. Her abstract portrayal of beauty was unique and unforgettable.I was fascinated by the different plot devices that the author used throughout the book - from the strong tree (and terminal), rotted from the inside, to Dagny Taggart's railroad, that served as the blood feeding the country's spirit.Atlas Shrugged can be read as a story in and of itself, but if one chooses, he may notice the unique philosophy that served as the basis for its greatest characters and themes. Ayn Rand's purpose in writing was to portray the ideal man. Painting a portrait of man as he can and ought to be, Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged will challenge your every premise, and the premises of the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Only 150 pages into it but it is a stunning book and amazingly relevant to today and what is going on.

What is the true nature of a mixed economy? What's the proper role of government?By the end of this book you will know and relish the supreme power of moral ideas.

That is one thing I have to give &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; - it is one of the few so-called &quot;classics&quot; that is suspenseful, creative, and compelling to read. Whether you agree with the philosophical tenets or not, they are presented in a clear way, within the framework of an interesting plot.The biggest reason I can give you for reading this book is that it really is inspirational. It is a book of heroes and heroines; its most insistent point is that the human mind makes anything possible. Most &quot;classics&quot; present the reality of human suffering; Rand presents a vision of human glory. And for sheer promotion of reason and logic, I think she is unmatched.The one complaint I have to make about Rand is that she is no psychologist. As many reviewers have pointed out, her characters are one-dimensional, unrealistic, and stereotypical. All of them are divided into the pro-Objectivism and anti-Objectivism camps - Rand presents no middle ground. Objectivism itself - at least the way it's presented in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; - also has a couple of major loopholes; the philosophy is worthy of analysis, and that is each reader's personal responsibility. But while Ayn Rand is not the best philosopher in the world, she does think for herself using logical, compelling arguments, which is more than I can say for some other intellectuals.Please don't let your own philosophical opinions, or the stylistic flaws, stop you from reading &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; It will inspire you to keep working for the things you believe in, and to recognize your ability to create your own happiness. And if, as one reviewer said, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; should only appeal to people ages 17-19, it is because they are the ones who have the most hope in the future, and the most trust in themselves."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What a mind...A truly brilliant work from a truly brilliant mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Good art will change your life. This book has meant a lot more to me than even that.Or more precisely, it has changed my life in a more complete and beneficial way than I could have hoped for, and in a way that everybody on this planet needs. It was thanks to Atlas Shrugged that I went from listless self-pity to a belief that I could be happy in my life without anyone else's help. There is a real problem with the common train of thought today that being successful is not fulfilling. Work and purpose are seen as dark dangerous things. The result of this mentality, I think, is dreadful. No one tries to love their work, no one tries to take pleasure in things. People are afraid to embrace this world -- to embrace their life, their real, present life -- because the common wisdom is that doing so will leave them empty and regretful.Well, I embraced what Atlas Shrugged had to say, and have found that life itself can be the most profound source of joy it has to offer. But by 'life' I mean determined, purposeful living.I would love it if everyone in this world gave their own lives a chance. Happiness, they would find, is a lot easier than sitting on a beach acheiving enlightenment or cutting your arm off and giving to the poor."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's funny when you read a talented writer like Rand, and look at all the drivel (Grisham, etc.) that is published today, and realize that there are not many great writers in the world now.

Galt's speech is simply too long. 2) I didn't like the senseless killing of the guards at the end of the book.Aside from that, a terrific read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In my early twenties, I came under the spell of Ayn Rant and her Ranting. I cannot say that this book was useless. After a time, however, reality sets in and we must live life in the real world. The \\"virtue\\" of selfishness sounds silly after one gets married and has children. Thus, as I got older, I found that this book was simply a collection of caricatures. The closest that we come to a character is Francisco, but all the others are not. Dagny Taggart is a slut business manager - managing a transcontinental railroad -who manages to sleep around with three different men: Francisco d'Anconia, Hank Rearden, and John Galt. Other than sleeping around, Dagny is simply a hard worker. Hank Rearden is a hard working metal business owner who gives his wife a bracelet in the form of his new Rearden metal; Rant can be profound at times... Rearden is married to a contemptible woman whom he sleeps with occasionally when he is not in bed with Dagny. John Galt is the mysterious guy who is supposedly the smartest man in the world, but alas, he is the most boring, ridiculous character of the entire book. This wise guy's plan is to get all the smart people in the world to drop out of society, hoping that the world will collapse. Of course, Dagny, being the slut for all the smart boys, jumps in bed with John Galt after she meets him halfway through this tale; this is another of Rant's profound insights into virtuous human character. Galt invented an electric generator that runs on the static in the atmosphere; I suppose that A is not A after all. This strange machine supplies all the electricity for a fraction of the cost of conventional energy production. Rant is obsessed with some unimportant place on the East Coast called \\"New York.\\" This place has big buildings that require much electricity for lighting. After Galt and his promiscuous friends evacuate all the smart people from this \\"New York\\" in an airplane, they watch the lights go out across this strange city. Dagny swears the oath to get into Galt's religious-like political cult, \\"I swear, by my life and my love for it, that I will not live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine.\\" Such high poetry is the climax of this Mosaic tale. Moses leads his people out of the land of Egypt to the Promised Land and Pharaoh and his army are destroyed in the Red Sea. Galt stars as Moses, d'Anconia as Aaron, Dagny as Miriam, and the rest of the world perishes like Pharaoh's army after the grand departure of all these narcissistic smart people. Ayn Rant simply recycled the Exodus tale with twentieth century caricatures of inventors and business people.Toward the end of the book, this strange Galt fellow takes over all the radio waves in the country to broadcast a political speech that takes up several dozen pages in the book. It supposedly summarizes Rand's \\"philosophy\\" of Objectivism. The good thing is that this \\"philosophy\\" has been sufficiently debunked and destroyed by several professional philosophers, the latest being Scott Ryan. This section of the book reveals that Rand did not sufficiently develop her mind to understand such a complex subject like philosophy. Those who are familiar with philosophy might find this speech most hilarious section of the book as Rand's mind attempts to \\"grasp\\" philosophy. Most readers wonder why Rand inserted a political pamphlet inside a novel in the form of a speech. But, cutting through all the fluff, smoke, and mirrors, that is all this book is: a political pamphlet."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand has a lot of interesting ideas in this book--what she doesn't have is a novel. This story is NOT interesting, with its 2-D characters and 50pg philosophical diatribes interrupting, of all things, a RAILROAD DRAMA. She just has no idea how people--any people, including herself--operate and why. She seems to think that when people fail in business it's because they are stupid, lazy misanthropists. What makes it worth reading (regardless of your political beliefs) are the ideas and arguments about the nature of human greatness and government. Not that they are right, but that they get your mind zinging, focusing your own beliefs as you say to yourself &quot;What the? But that's not true because...&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is not an understatement to say that this is the most important book ever written.

There is a lot of controversy about the cult-like aspects of Objectivism. However, the only way that Objectivism could ever be considered a cult is through a deep misunderstanding of the real basis of the philosophy-independent thought, logic, and reason. The connerstone of the whole philosophy is that no one should take anyone's word for anything: you must discover and know by your own mind.As much as I enjoyed the knowledge that this book led me to discover, I must admit that I am not a fan of Ayn Rand as a writer. Her style is lacking, and she seems to get bogged down in making the same point over and over.My differences with her style aside, I think that everyone should read something about Objectivism. Although Atlas Shrugged is not an &quot;easy read&quot; it is still a very enlightening and telling book with a message that should not be ignored or overlooked. If you are looking for an entertaining book to pass the time, skip Atlas Shrugged. If, however, you are interested in modern philosophy or would like a break from the nihilism of most ancient &quot;thinkers&quot; then enjoy.I recently read Atlas Shrugged for the second time, and I can say that there is more to learn from the text than I picked up the first time through.Ayn Rand has also written some strictly philosophical works that explore objectivism without the fiction framework.

They can project the ideal world (esthetics) in which individuals live free (politics) to pursue happiness (ethics) by using their minds (epistemology) to understand reality (metaphysics). However, when the dominant philosophy of a culture is anti-life and anti-mind, misery may be the only prospect. The world is doomed unless a hero fights the good fight; unless the most able rise to the occasion. How is this achieved? Who is John Galt?

It's long for one - I love epic's as I call them. But the story. It should be the G.O.P. manifesto! It's so incredibly conservative in every way possible - I get frustrated w/ the characters at times because of how absolute they are in everything they do - everything is \\"The most...,\\" \\"The greatest...,\\" \\"The best...,\\" \\"The biggest...\\" And being a very liberal person myself - I want to argue w/ Ayn Rand or the characters on the statements that they make - wanting to explain to someone where their theories are WRONG! But there's no one to talk to - I just keep reading and reading...Yet the story fascinates me - I really liked the first 3rd of the book, the building of The John Gault Line - as that section was ending I couldn't imagine what the rest of the book would be about - I thought it was a complete story as it was... Then it just keeps getting better and better - I keep thinking I have it all figured out, like most movies and books, but Ayn Rand was definitely a woman of a different era because where she takes the characters is in directions even today would be considered drastic or radical.I'm not even sure which character it is I like better - Dagny Tagart? Francisco D'Anconia? Or Hank Riordan?I'm still captured in it (spent my entire weekend buried in this book) and I'm going back to finish it now!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Undoubtably the most profound book written, and rationally the most sane"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Quality of all the recordings was very good.

After my old paperback finally fell apart after many re-reads, I decided to splurge and get a better edition. It's definitely higher quality than the original mass market paperback. The print is bigger, the paper is nicer, and it has better cover art. The cover quality is a bit disappointing- I expected it to be glossy and instead it's just thicker paper so I don't think it will look good after several re-reads. For the price, it's a good book. If you're a Rand fan looking to put a nicer book on your shelf for display (or are getting too old to deal with the tiny print), go ahead and buy it.Oh and for the record, I don't consider myself an Objectivist, but this is a wonderful novel with many great ideas.

Should be required reading for ALL new registered voters."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The importance of this book rests in two areas. First, on a base level, are the characters. There is a clear divide between most of the life-affirming and destructive characters in the book: People like Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden, Eddie Willers, and others on one side and sneaky characters like Jim Taggart, Dr. Ferris, and Orren Boyle on the other. They anchor the book. However, what makes the character list more interesting are those who you don't truly know on which side they will go, such as Dr. Stadler, Cheryl, and the \\"Wet Nurse.\\" These are the most interesting to watch because they fall the most in the middle of character development, influenced heavily by both their attitudes and the worlds in which they live. For example, Stadler seems to want to be happy (as in watching the billy goat), but believes his course is stuck in one way and can't be changed (as seen with Project X).More importantly, the philosophy divulged in the book is what makes it work. It's a book where the idea seems to be in existence and leaves it for the characters to discover or ignore, instead of the characters creating the ideas themselves. Thus, a good portion of the book is taken up with philosophical discussions and monologues. They can be a bit long, but they are very detailed and interesting to read. If there is anything on the philosophy with which I disagree, it's the route Rand takes to describe it. We should work for our own happiness, but I think that all lives are equal , and that the argument should have rested more on doing what makes our lives and the ones of those we love better. She makes allusions to this at times (most notably, in the discussion between Hank Rearden and Francisco D'Anconia at the steel mills), but I wish there had been more.I have two issues. One is the descriptions she gives when discussing characters, especially in the romantic scenes. I hade heard about the forcefulness of the sex scenes, and I was a bit startled by it. I also believe that the language tends to read like a Fabio-like romance novel in its description in these sections. Also, Ayn Rand can be a bit preachy in discussing her beliefs. I stated earlier the thoroughness of the philosophical discussion, but there are times when she goes into overkill; the long monologue near the end of the novel (about 60 pages in this version) is a good example.However, it is an engrossing novel and a very influential one. Every time I have read it (whether I agreed with sections or not), I feel invigorated and want to do something immediately afterwards. The influence comes from giving one the confidence and comfort to not be afraid to experience (as she states it) \\"the joy of existence\\" and not be afraid to succeed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Why this is not required reading in college or even high school is beyond me. A truly an eye opening book. I have recommended this to all my friends especially those in business.I only wish my boss would read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What would happen in our society if the best and the brightest stopped producing? The motor of the world would stop. Who is John Galt? He is the embodiment of objectivism, the philosophy grounded in uncompromising individual competency and productivity. Creeping socialism produces incompetent moochers and looters who use the extortion of guilt to take money and goods from men like Galt without earning them. Rand's novel follows the personal lives of Galt's heroic friends as they plan and build their secret utopia and allow the general economy to collapse on its empty socialist promises. Rand looks at her philosophy from every possible angle and interrupts the story with lengthy explanations. This style is reminiscent of Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain. The writing style is simple and direct, and the characters engage in conversations that are far from the ordinary. This is a great novel for the careful reader willing to spend time with the lengthy work and take notes on key premises."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like the Shins cd Natalie Portman had Zach Braff's character listen to in the film \\"Garden State,\\" this book will change your life.

To me, this is what makes this book a must read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand holds a special part in my heart, simply because &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was the first book I read seriously. However, sentimental values aside, I still consider her to be great thinker, but as a writer, she is somewhat above average. If it was possible, I will give her three and a half stars, because her style isn't quite a four, but her thoughts are more refined in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; than in &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot; There is less confusion, but Rand muddles some of her points by over-pondering. It is ultimately a *study* of what she wants to convey to her readers (i.e., her beliefs), but in some cases, the readers are left to swim the myriads of suggestions and ideals of her own. It is as if she knows what she is talking about, but the readers have no idea and are left to piece the parts together.I still consider this better than &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; simply because it is a better reflection of her philosophies. I do not agree with all of her ideals, but on a strictly objective level, I think this is her greatest book (other than her short stories, which hold their own... and perhaps her best written pieces). It's better than three stars, but not quite four stars. I kind of wish she wrote more essays than she did novels, because momentum and presentation is less important in essays.I do recommend this book, however, just because it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Well, this nice over-1000-page book gives a nice intro to Rand's philosophy of objectivism. There were times were I just wanted to put the book down, throw it across the room and never pick it up again. But I was intrigued, I kept reading and it was a nice way to see how it went.I'm sure you've read the past reviews on what the plot is, so I won't retell what the plot is to you all, but the book just didn't get interesting until the last third of the book. There are many parts that are dry, repetitive, and sometimes pointless; but they all help out in some way to capture what Rand is trying to say. I would recommend this book if one has time and really wants to know what Rand is trying to say. If not, go for the cliff notes. They may not be as extensive, but hey, I think learning the philosophy is the point of the book, not the plot."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just for her humorously sarcastic skewering of the left-wing, socialistic mindset, Ayn Rand deserves great credit. Lillian Rearden's dinner party early in the novel, complete with the introduction of many of the left-wing intellectuals who despise her husband, Hank, is Rand at her best as she yields her witty, satirical stilletto to great effect.However, Miss Rand's characters are almost all narrowly black or white, good or evil, and thus unrealistic. James Taggert, Orrin Boyle, Kip and Ma Chalmers, Cuffy Meigs, Wesley Mouch, Dr. Floyd Ferris and Dr. Robert Stadler are all evil and parasitical. Hank Rearden, Dagney Taggert, Francisco D'Anconia, Ellis Wyatt, Ken Danniger, Midas Mulligan, John Galt and even Eddie Willers are virtuous, wonderfully absolute egoists and industrious. Few people are portrayed in shades of gray- the Wet Nurse, who begins bad but is taught the value of the virtuous egoists at the hand of Hank Rearden; Cheryl Taggert, who originally has the values of the egoists but is corrupted by her marriage to the evil James Taggert; the hobo, Jeff Allen, who belatedly understands the morality of the egoists; and Eddie Willers, who, though he shares the morals of the egoists, is simply not a superman.The egoists of Galt's Gulch are superheroes. That must be completely understood. And with these superheroes, Ayn Rand receives her own ego boost. Dagney Taggert is her alter-ego and the male superheroes are the men who are stalwart enough to be her lovers. These superheroes are extensions of Miss Rand's personality and her perception of her own brilliance. The superheroes- Dagney Taggert, D'Anconia, Wyatt, Rearden, Danniger and the rest- are all the best at what they do. Most of them excel at industry but others are the best the world has to offer in music, law or acting. Each can work twenty hour days and arise after a couple hours sleep to put in another twenty hour day of complete brilliance. Almost all the more developed characters fly their own planes the way we mortals are limited to driving our autos. Comically, the philosophical superhero Hugh Akston, withdrawn from society and operating a diner in Wyoming, cooks the best hamburger Dagney has ever eaten. Better than my outdoor hamburgers? I think not, Dagney. But there is little that these superheroes can not do.... As one would expect with a woman with an enormous ego, Dagney is assigned three lovers in the novel. The three are arguably the three greatest men in the world- D'Anconia, Rearden and Galt. Though D'Anconia's willing separation from Dagney is more plausible and his acceptance of other lovers in her life is more believable, Rearden's ready acceptance that Dagney becomes Galt's lover is hard to fathom. Rand hints that Rearden accepts Galt as the greater man- hardly likely. ... Ironically, due to the manner in which Rand writes her novel, Galt is the most boring of the three lovers in her life. In fact, one might say that the long-suffering Eddie Willers is more interesting than Galt. But, in the end, Rand feels compeled that Dagney must bed down the three brightest lights in the world.Finally, ...the weakest part of the novel is about ninety pages boring the reader with Galt's speech to the country about the virtues and wonders of objectivism, Rand's philosophical \\"gift\\" to the world. And, of course, everyone listens intently for two hours as Galt plods through Randian objectivism. A speech by George W. Bush would be more interesting. At least Bush can be undeliberately funny."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What is wrong with the world? Ayn Rand answers this question in her novel \`Atlas Shrugged'. Atlas shrugged is a novel about the conflict between good and evil. But, this conflict is seen in a startlingly new perspective.Growing up, I was exposed to Hindu, Muslim, and Christian religions as well as communism. After a careful examination I had concluded that all of them were good. All of them preached the virtue of sacrifice and the evil of pride and selfishness.My concept of the good was shaken after I read Atlas shrugged.Atlas Shrugged is a story about ingenuous, proud and productive businessmen who are morally condemned by philosophers of altruism. These businessmen who have an immense love of life, who rely on the use of reason and technology to attain their selfish goals and who never strive for anything at the expense of others, are shown to be the symbols of the good. Intellectuals and politicians preaching altruism and selflessness are shown to be evil. Smearing the selfish morality of the businessmen and claiming to have noble altruistic goals, politicians exploit their productivity and wealth and pass a string of restrictive regulations.Because of their passion for life and extreme capabilities, the morally condemned and politically strangled businessmen keep on producing. They never question altruism and hence accept an unearned guilt. People take this for granted.Businessmen ultimately realize this and go on strike.Without the mind and effort of businessmen US economy collapses. Reason, selfishness and productivity are convincingly shown to be indispensable for the survival of mankind.Atlas Shrugged is a powerful story about heroes. Within a masterful plot it covers topics ranging from metaphysics to politics to psychology. For anyone who is interested in knowing \`What is wrong with the world' Atlas Shrugged is a must."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a great book, for all of its flaws. There are many things to recommend it, but Ms. Rand lost her ability to deal with characters in any terms but black and white. With The Fountainhead, the characters were all believable; only Roark and Toohey represented pure good and pure evil, respectively. Here no character was anything but an extreme. Worse, the many heroes all speak in the same \\"voice.\\" Namely, Ms. Rand's voice. She hated collectives, having lived through the early days of Yusef V. Stalin's reign of terror; she was a champion of individualism, yet ironically all of her heroic characters are clones of herself and not individuals. Back to the Fountainhead: please compare Mike, Steve Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Dominique Francon, and Gail Wynand, all of whom were Roark's close friends. These were portrayed as individuals bonded in friendship by one key quality (self-esteem) rather than a series of speech-makers. A previous reviewer pointed out, correctly, that the speeches were boring. I will say that the 3-hour speech by John Galt was the ONLY speech in the book that could not have been edited without damaging it. ALL others could have been amended or even eliminated. What is more, most of her ideas were repeated too many times.Compared, however, to the strength of Ms. Rand's ideas, I cannot say this is a bad book; if not for her stumbling block of creating \\"straw men,\\" making her heroes too great and her villains too rotten, this could have been a masterpiece complete. I could have awarded it 5 *'s. I can still give the book high praise, all of which would repeat what has been said previously; but if you can only read one Ayn Rand book, I recommend you read The Fountainhead instead. Furthermore, please consult Radzinsky's biography of Stalin to understand the reasons why Ms. Rand hated intellectuals who made excuses for terror, why she predicted \\"naked animal starvation\\" as the inevitable consequence of socialism, and in short why she despised Communism. Because Stalin was real, God help us all, this portrayal has so much more: actual history and an extreme sense of fear, with the ideas implied by the material more than preached. In general, those who tell the readers what conclusions to draw have a weak argument; keep that in mind in reading Atlas Shrugged and drawing thereby your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I though it was fantastic.

Whether you agree or not in the end, read it, and experience new ideas you aren't likely to find elsewhere. (Someone also said it is 'high school level' writing, a sentiment I find patently ridiculous. The writing is simply very precise and descriptive and I do not think anyone would argue the book fails to present its ideas adequately.)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was my first attempt at conquering the work of Ayn Rand and I am glad that I made the endeavor. The daunting task of conquering almost 1200 pages of complex fiction seemed, at first, to be insurmountable. However, I found this story to push me forward, always anxious to see what happened on the next page. I would have gladly given it five stars, except for the 60 page monoogue provided by John Galt towards the end--that was a bit tough to swallow. I don't mind long speeches, so long as they are purposeful and fit the charcter. In my opinion, Galt was succinct and concise enough in his beliefs that he could have stated his intent in about a tenth as much time. Thus, I felt that speech was out of character a bit.The other characters were very well developed, only flawed by the lack of balance within each of them. In other words, the &quot;good guys&quot; seemed to have few or no bad qualities, while the &quot;bad guys&quot; had no redeeming qualities. This may be a part of Rand's philosophy of people, but it is one that I disagree with.The story was complex, filled with irony, drama, mystery, even romance. I was amazed that it held together so well throughout. I look forward to reading other works by Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a very entertaining and inspirational book about people that find their own self worth through their hard work, their success, and their determination. Though there are many people who take Ayn Rands philosophies to the extreme, and who will insist that this work of fiction is a tome to base your life upon, the basic philosophy in the novel is simple. . . work hard for what you want, and dont expect others to carry you on their shoulders by freely giving you what THEY earned. This is a simple message in an entertaining book, with the benefit of being one of the very few novels that invites you not simply to escape into its world, but to relate it to your own world and to think about your own place in it. Reading this novel is truly an experience I would recomend to everyone, especially those who are looking for a book with a great amount of substance and character."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is truely a masterpiece. It is a book about heros and heroines. The heros have impecible integrity (their integrity is so complete that it seems many people today cannot even comprehend it). It is only when the heros forgo their integrity do they fall victim to the vicious looters and moochers attempting to destroy them. The looters and moochers are constantly scheming against the heros and bit by bit are able to slowly overcome the heros by undermining their decency. However the heros are onto the looting/mooching schemes and have devised a plan to redeem their position. The plot is simple good vs. evil. The storyline has a multitude of twists and turns, but is clear and easy to follow.The book's setting is familiar. It plays upon the social climate of America. Through this familiarity Ms. Rand brought the book and the characters alive and even brings in the political and moral aspects of the reader as part of the storyline (fabulous). As the book progresses the seperation between the good and evil characters widens until the reader is forced to take a side (To confirm this read most of the other reveiws, they are not about the book's storyline but about the reviewers philosophical or moral viewpoint).I don't want to give away the ending but it is a book about heros and heroines.As you can probably tell I really enjoyed this book. I think you will also."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I heard Neal Boortz discussing this book on the radio months ago, and I have become interested enough in Libertarianism that I wanted to understand more. I purchased the book and managed to finish it in around 5 weeks. This was the first book by Ayn Rand I have read, and it was a great read. I could relate to the main characters Dagney Talgart and Hank Rearden more closely than I expected, and what they experienced from the people around them was very similar to the way I view most people myself.If I have a problem with the book, it would be that I thought the book went on a little long. I thought the points Ayn Rand was trying to make had been hammered home by the time Dagney's plane crashed in John Galt's valley. The next 350 or so pages started to drag. With the exception of John Galts speech, Henry Rearden's defection, and Galt's capture by the government and escape, I found it hard to read the rest of the book. However, for the first 600 pages, I was mesmorized by the ideas Rand was conveying, and I thought her points were interesting,logical, and intelligent.I found it amazing to think about Ayn Rands vision of the future and how close to what she described we have really traveled. It left me understanding how important it is that we fight the expansion of liberal thought at every opportunity before we go too far and alienate the producers to a point of no return. Ayn Rand is a true visionary, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A very good friend of mine gave me this book as a gift for Christmas. He was so eager for me to read it, saying that Rand was the best writer he had ever read. I had no context to understand his excitement about a book. Even though I am an avid reader, I have rarely encountered a book that embodies thought and form so well that I prefer its world to my own. Once I finished the first 20 pages of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; I knew what he meant. Rand, like few other authors, is so passionately devoted to her vision of how things could be, that as a reader I became intoxicated with that vision. It is not unlike the attraction of religious fervor, which may explain the way many people respnd to Rand, both positively and negatively. Even though here book is extremely intellectual, there is a passion beneath that intellect that does not go ignored. Rand's goal is clear: to portray an individual so ideal, we should want to become him or her, if only we had the courage.Purely as a work of fiction, it is a wonderful narrative filled with love, mystery, intrigue, and epic adventure. At times Rand's voice is very heavy and didactic, especially toward the end of the book. The first two sections are far more engaging than the last, which mostly plays out all the events leading from the intrigue of the first two. The book has a few minor shortcomings, i.e., extended preachy sections and odd (and potentially harmful) ideas about the relationships between men and women. These can be overlooked largely due to the scope of the book. They end up feeling like tiny detours from the main purpose, which is to explain a philosophy through a novel. The didactic speeches are a symptom of how difficult this task is.As a philosophical treatise, this book is unparalleled in its daring and its approach to define Form through Function. The ideas Rand embodies in this book are just as relevant to the 21st Century as they were to her time, perhaps more so.As with all moments of intoxication, the feelings fade with time. The question is will the ideas remain as appealing to me the longer I am away from &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;? To some degree their appeal has already faded, but the work helped me further shape my knowledge of human nature in a way that could not have happened without Rand's help. And by the way beware of addiction. I plan to drink some more of Rand's tonic again soon, even though the book is 1100 pages long."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've based this review on the incredible writing style, pacing, and plot development. While Ayn Rand is perhaps best known for her philosophy, I am very much taken by her writing abilities. Whether or not you agree with her premise, Atlas Shrugged is a well written character study, and an engrossing read. If you are an aspiring author, you will do well to study her style."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's Atlas Shrugged is the greatest artistic acheivement in the history of mankind. It's theme and plot are masterfully integrated. Each choice of the author's was made to further the examine the theme and to identify a new aspect of it. Each integral sub-theme was demonstrated enough to prove it, all the while moving the plot ever closer to it's triumphant climax. Rand succeeds in her life's goal to portray the ideal man. Secondary to this goal was the formulation of her unique philosophy of Objectivism - in which she defines a rational code of ethics based on an uncompromising dedication to reason in epistemology. Not only will Atlas Shrugged change your life, it will change the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book for a reading assigment in high school. I thought that it would be a real drag but once I got started, I discovered that it was really interesting. Ayn Rand is a brilliant writer and her characters are very intriguing. I found it hard to put the book down! Rand also gives you a new perspective on life through her theory of objectivism. I highly recommend that everyone read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, is the one book that is a must to own and read if one wants to survive in the world. Period."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, I thought several aspects of the story just weren't realistic, but after all, it is a novel. For example, the book didn't explain why somehow, the Congress nor the President never got involved to stop the &quot;beuracracy run amok,&quot; regardless how totalitarian Wesley Mouch became, and regardless how bad economically things got. I don't think Americans would just sit back and let the government assume that much control, and I don't think politicians considering re-election would let things go so far without intervening. But, then I'm an optimist.Despite these problems with the concept, the story is enjoyable as a novel, and also teaches the price everyone pays for not being politically aware, and the consequences of not taking personal responsibility for one's life.It was both a very intriguing and enlightening read, and I recommend it to anyone (even socialists and other leftist types who supposedly have an open mind anyway, right?) No need to be scared of a little truth..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A brieft note: Reading over the reviews given by numerous readers, I observed one fact that disturb me a great deal. Why is there so many personal attact towards Ayn Rand? One reader even wrote &quot;the fact she was short, dumpy and unattractive&quot;. I understand that fact that none of us are professional critics, but shouldn't we, the readers, concentrate on reading and anaylyzing the book, instead of focusing on Ayn Rand's personal life and physical outlook. ALSO, if one just briefly take note of the extreme different of rating the readers gives to this book, one would notice that nearly all readers gives either a 1 star grading, or a full 5 stars grading. Doesn't this brief analysis suggest that we, the readers, fail to provide a review that provide a COMPLETE analysis over her book. It seems to me that each reader finds one point which jumps onto their mind and irresponsibly assume Ayn Rand's book only contains that one single point. A review, as I understand it, should be an analysis on the author's ideas, her writing styles and skills.Lastly, the fact that so many readers actually spent their time to write such lengthy reviews shows that her book draws lots of attentions. Thus, anyone who haven't read it should take a look of it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had no desire at all to read Rand's work because I assumed it was a dry discussion of her philosophies. But someone told me that they're quite entertaining novels, so I tried Fountainhead and found it very palatable. Then I read Atlas Shrugged and - maybe it's because it's so long - after completing it, I almost felt as if I had actually made/accomplished something just as lofty as what the characters themselves were creating. It is a very fine book, as long as you occasionally remind yourself that Rand is presenting her point of view, not sharing a fundamental truth.There are two reasons that I didn't go adopting her objectivism philosophy immediately after devoting a solid chunk of my life to reading her book and becoming very invested in the story - the first being that I was already cynical about the whole theory; the second that I had just read the back cover of Jon Stewart's book which basically mentions how people act like jerks for a week after reading this book. After finishing it, I can see how objectivism's aspect of \\"I'm better than you because I despise you\\" can appeal to some. So if you already secretly think you know it all, don't read this book because you will undoubtedly become absolutely intolerable. But if you know who you are and what you're about already, Atlas Shrugged becomes just another great novel, albeit one in which the protagonists ramble to each other quite a lot about things which seem less and less important as the book wears on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Pundits have stated that ATLAS SHRUGGED is the magnum opus of Rand's literary output yet it is not so nearly approachable as is, say, THE FOUNTAINHEAD or WE THE LIVING. It's importance though lies far beyond its literary value and that is precisely the reason for the still-ferocious battles over this work. It has had a profound influence on the American scene - one that is continually undervalued due to the diametrically opposed views of the intellectual and academic elite that set our cultural norms.I'll make two admissions - one, I loved the story and the book for its literary worth and two, I did not finish the SPEECH. It would have been helpful if Rand had been more open to the idea of editing and pared back both the speech and some of the many redundancies one finds. That aside, one is astonished at the originality of the seminal idea - that people of ability should stop apologizing for both it and the material goods that ability engenders. If there is one point the book makes with perfect clarity it is a clear explicatation of who depends upon whom.The intellectual earthquakes triggered by this book can be seen in the Libertarian Party, the birth of mainstream magazines as REASON, the acceptability to admire the one system that has provided better than any other (capitalism), privitization and deregulation and the ascendancy of Greenspan, a Rand disciple, and monetary policy. These are all enormous shifts in thinking from what was the norm in the fifties and sixties.As in the Fountainhead, the hero remains shadowy, more an idea than a person. Just as the FOUNTAINHEAD was the story of Dominique and Wynand, ATLAS SHRUGGED is the story of Dagny and Reardon. The rise and fall of the industrialist alson with his affair and love of his life is the central driving force of the book. I would have loved to have seen this made into a movie or better - television series over several nights - but now think it would have been impossible to faithfully present the action in the same spirit as the book. Let the story stay as it was meant to stay - it is more refreshing that way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged has been selling well for nearly 50 years. It is easy to see why. Rand love Hollywood movies and she was also a philosopher. As a result, she is one of the very few philosophers who can write fantastically. This is one heck of a page turner. Peopled by two types, action driven doers and parasitical whiners, Atlas Shrugged details a final showdown between the moochers and the producers, the complainers and the thinkers, the doers in life and the observers. Written during the cold war in 1956, it is stunningly relevant to controversies we are engaged in and battling today such as affirmative action, religious terrorists, moral irresponsibility, etc. You may absolutely despise Rand's heros - they are arrogant, atheistic, self centered, disdainful of the weak and dim-witted - but you will find it difficult to keep from reading to the end. Rand can write up a storm - her pen blazes on each page because she cared deeply about what she was writing. But don't get the idea that this is some intellectual cold blooded affair - this is one heck of a novel - full of humor, insight, sex, adventure, etc. It is written on an epic scale with an eye for everything that encompassses life. Rand is a controversial figure - even an unlikable one - but I like her book - it is great. If a book is to be judged by its ability to pull you in and give you a great emotional and intellectual ride, then \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" scores big time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are not many female philosophers, and certainly few women so relentlessly supportive of human freedom as Ayn Rand. This novel is an interesting vehicle for her philosophy, but sometimes, her extreme viewpoint makes the behavior of her characters seem a little silly.For example, in order to illustrate her views, Rand peoples her novel with, on the one hand, a tiny and elite band of highly principled and uncompromising capitalists, and on the other hand, large numbers of spineless, mindless \\"looters\\" who only know how to be parasites. I fear that many modern, politically-confused readers will reject both these stereotypes, and therefore not accept Rand's uncompromising doctrine. This is a pity, because Rand has a valuable lesson - we should not compromise over principles.Rand's heroes have sex rather infrequently for such apparently powerful, egoistical and presumably potent individuals, but this is compensated by the fierce nature of their sexual interactions, which seem to be fuelled by almost uncontrollable lust. Yet the author repeatedly reaffirms that sex should only take place between individuals as a natural expression of their mutual approval of the values of each other's minds. Most readers are likely to prefer our modern view of sex, as the work of \`selfish genes,' especially on the part of promiscuous males, who, irrespective of political orientation or social rank, seem usually happy to serve females on the basis of physical characteristics.The books is too long at 1074 pages, and the small type used (under 9 points, I think) will doubtless encourage many readers to skip.I read the whole lot, though, and think it is a kind of imperfect masterpiece. The novel contains an image of the horror of collectivism and socialism which is rather out-dated compared to modern libertarian writings. However, the book's description of honorable people actually living their lives by principle, is unusual and extremely valuable. Perhaps most valuable of all, Ms Rand incessantly spells out the connection between political phenomena, the underlying human behavior and the principles that motivate her characters, in minute detail. Anybody who reads this book can hardly avoid being swayed towards the central lesson that human lives should be motivated by a consistent and productive purpose, as is the case with her hero-capitalists. In this, Ayn Rand was a great and inspiring teacher."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is really a one-of-a-kind book. It has everything in it from action to mystery to love to philosophy. It really makes one stop and think and offers many enlightening ideas not commonly found elsewhere. Unfortunately, some people treat Atlas Shrugged the way the looters treated the 20th Century Motor Company in the book. That is, they grab what they quickly see and leave behind the greatest value. I encourage you to read this book, and try to discover the greatest value."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I love thought provoking books that challenge the status quo and this is definitely one of those. I was already a proponent of laissez-faire capitalism, but I was not aware of several subtle inconsistencies that I had begun to accept in my view of economics and politics. This book has given me a renewed understanding of how vital it is not to hinder those who strive to accomplish great things, and this book comes from a woman who grew up in the USSR and therefore, knew first-hand the consequences that she reveals.Also wonderfully illustrated is something I've known but was not able to fully explain. That is, in a nutshell, that a man's choice in a woman (and vice versa) reveals his view of himself.The only disagreement I have with Ayn Rand's philosophy (and granted, it's a large part of her philosophy) is her belief that nothing beyond our ability to perceive exists, such as God. However, I don't believe that the majority of her conclusions are incompatible with those of a non-atheist. In fact, I believe this book identifies several misconceptions predominant in today's churches pertaining to their belief of what man is to be and how he is to view himself in this world.Ayn Rand's characters are wonderful. She masterfully explores their psychology. By the end of the book, they felt like friends and I didn't want to say goodbye.I recommend this book to all my friends! Read it! Even if you don't agree, it's an important philosophy to understand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If public schools had anything to do with genuine teaching, learning, or responsible citizenship, this book would be required reading in every one of them. Unfortunately this is contrary to their whole premise; teachers and professors alike will avoid the subject as uncomfortably as they would Hustler Magazine, as if that were the kind of work this book contained. Ayn Rand herself would surely object to having anything forced upon anyone anyway ... even this. Only a few chance wanderers at bookstores and on the net will see these priceless revelations. Some will quibble about how they would have done it better; the fact is they did nothing but a few paragraphs of faultfinding prose; Ayn Rand did 1168 pages of desperately needed reason for our time, clearly defining the Achilles' heel not only of a nation, but of almost every citizen therein as well. Whatever relevance it held in 1957, when we had not marched so far down this dark path, it holds even more today. There's little hope that a John Galt might spring up somewhere and save us; the only hope for any us is to learn and understand these principles - the same principles for which a ragtag army risked everything in 1776. The warning is that if you do read, and understand, the personal change it will evoke may be so dramatic as to actually be painful. People you never doubted as friends may prove to be turncoats ... including yourself. That's the experience I had; I was driven to see my own part in desecrating the world's one great hope, the United States of America. As bad it's been, though, I still feel better for having known; better still I wish I'd known far sooner. Whatever you pay in dollars for this book the personal cost may be greater, but the return to you is still the best of all: truth over safety, for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As of this date, nearly 700 people have contributed their opinions of this book, some at great length. I am somewhat apologetic to be adding to this huge mass.If I may, however, I would like to briefly state that this book deserves to be read by every thinking person. It is unique on several levels.This is a book of philosophy presented as fiction. The story itself is gripping, and Rand is a powerful writer. America's economic system is crumbling, in the mid-20th century, under the weight of a heavily regulated political system. Rand's heroes and heroines are the super-achievers who invent and produce and drive the country's GNP. One of Rand's fascinating precepts in this book is that her heroes perform a disservice to the nation and the world by their failure to defend freedom in the sphere of economics as a moral value.In my opinion, the importance of Atlas Shrugged is this: Our culture today tends to embrace feeling good as a philosophy. As a result, we all tend to believe that anything at all that is done on behalf of the poor, the weak, or the downtrodden is inherently good. Rand ingeniously illustrates how this philosophy fails at the national-political-system level. She shows that policies that extend benefits to the lower strata of society at the expense of the higher can have the effect of undermining the wealth, the soul, and the strength of that society. Whereas policies which may seem cold and heartless and ungenerous can in fact provide the greatest good to the greatest number of people.As a novel, you will certainly enjoy Atlas Shrugged. You will never push your way through a book over 1,000 pages so quickly. As a treatise on ethics and society, I believe that every reader needs to ask himself the question of how the application and the validity of Rand's ideas differ at the individual level and the overall social system level.One of the five most important books you will ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"We'll establish something straight off- the four stars here given Atlas Shrugged rate the philosophical, and not literary value of the book.Ayn Rand's signature work, a 1000-page treatise on the practical application of the ideas so memorably expressed in The Fountainhead, unfolds through characters and actions that are anything but convincing, anything but representative of reality. Had this condition been attributable merely to the characters being standard-bearers of an ideal, as was The Fountainhead's cast, the complaint would be negligible. When Rand asks us to mold reality, however, she'd do well to avoid urging us through characters that speak identically, that expatiate on a topic during conversation for pages on end to a willing audience, and that somehow come to universally use the word &quot;unnamed&quot; with a frequency that's equally, if not more irksome than The Fountainhead's use of &quot;reproach,&quot; &quot;impertinent,&quot; and &quot;incongruous.&quot;Rand has elsewhere been called a master of subtlety- I can think of no greater fallacy. Each notable idea in Atlas Shrugged receives repeated, explicit, and dictatorial treatment through the book's course. This constant repetition, never more apparent than in the exceptional, but entirely redundant sixty-page climactic monologue, makes Rand's point well, but far too blatantly.It is precisely because Atlas Shrugged's thesis is such a remarkable one that we can afford to look past its artistic shortcomings. However often critics rail against the supposed delusion of Rand's vision, the nearly 1100 pages of Atlas Shrugged make clear the fact that the true delusion lies in supposing that one can find happiness in a world bereft of ambition, that body and soul, mind and matter are irreconcilable foes.Atlas Shrugged, additionally, pulls a reversal from the ideals of The Fountainhead's Howard Roark, though perhaps I ought to &quot;check my premises- contradictions don't exist.&quot; The protagonists of Atlas Shrugged rise through the world in pursuit of money: doctors discover cures solely for profit, composers chart concertos for greenbacks, scientists peer into the workings of the planet for cash. The Fountainhead's Howard Roark, however, insists in decidedly nobler form, that to forge great achievements, we must &quot;love the doing,&quot; that creation must be an end in itself. We find something of a descent from Rand's philosophical pinnacle in the admirable, but ultimately contrived pursuit of profits practiced by Atlas Shrugged's cast.Listening to the villains unctuously cry for selflessness, for sacrifice, and for collectivism from the start, I knew The Fountainhead had ruined my perception of these characters, established in that earlier novel as so contemptible. My patience for the words of veiled socialism I'd once held to be reasonable was dashed, and the persistent sense that, during Atlas Shrugged's ambling progression of events, I was watching the act of a magician that had already revealed her secrets to me remained.My prescription for the Rand neophyte: The Fountainhead, to receive a terse, expertly-written detailing of objectivism; Atlas Shrugged, to drive home every nuance of the philosophy, even if the text reeks of amateurism; The Fountainhead, a second time, to see the implied meaning within every page that Atlas Shrugged will have illuminated for the reader."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked up this book almost randomly in an airport book shop, and all I can say is that it was, perhaps, the best random action I've ever taken. This book is, quite simply, a magnificent achievement. As a novel, it has a fascinating, intricate plot, a wonderful cast of characters and an easily readable, enjoyable style. Beyond that, which would be enough to make me recommend the book most highly, there is the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Her characters, as she is the first to admit, are unreal. They are crafted to represent not humans, but human ideals. The heroes are of such heroic proportions and character that they are superhuman. They represent man, not as he is, but as he should strive to be. Similarly, the villains display every vice and every extreme of mindless fanaticism that men should deplore. They are like the bad guys in a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie, who are so bad that even the most liberal pacifist is just dying to see them get blown up before the first act is finished. This is a book to be read not just for its entertainment value (although it easily could be). It should be read for the thoughts it provokes, particularly in our current social and political climate. There are aspects of the philosophy that I, and probably others, would disagree with. There are aspects of all philosophies that even adherants disagree with, but one has to think about them before deciding, and that is the point. Read the book, enjoy it, and think about it. It will be time well spent."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book struck somthing inside me. I see the disturbing reality Rand described every day in my work (health care.) The intense efforts by government and quasi-government regulators to control everything we do and then consider us as blooodsuckers for making a profit (or even breaking even) comes right out the book.This is a MUST read for any educated adult. It made what is happening in the world so much more clear to me.The only drawback is the wooden, repetitive writing. Many of the characters are overdrawn charactitures. The main characters are quite good however. At 1000+ pages the book is quite a struggle especially with the long speeches the characters have (don't skip them- they are the meat of the book). Well worth the effort. Would have been 5 stars but for the excessive length. With better writing this could have been 400 pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is fantastic. A long, long read, but it really pays off. I envy those who have not read it yet.It portrays a world of forced \\"fairness\\" and \\"mediocrity\\", with the pathetic goverment leaders punishing those who produce and rewarding those that do nothing but complain and tax the resources of society and give nothing in return.The scarey thing is that this book is becoming nonfiction. Look at the government and all the \\"fairness\\" and \\"politically correct\\" environment that exist today and all the insane leaders competing for control of the country...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Quite simply the most important modern work of philosophy. Ayn Rand presents to us - in the form of an epic novel - her philosophy of Objectivism. A philosophy that is based on reason and logic.This book was more to me than twelve hundred pages of fiction. When I read it, I felt as if someone had taken my ideas and ideals and put them in print. When you live in a world ruled by men - and women - who rely not on reason, but on feelings; who claim that the collective is more important than the individual - when you live in a world like that it is a revelation to realise you're not the only one thinking forbidden thoughts.I think the real reason why people fear Ayn Rand and her philosophy is that it demands just that of you - that you think for yourself; that you put yourself first, and that you stand up for everything you do - even your mistakes. Ayn Rand - approved."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand, is an incredible book about the most powerful railroad corporation in the world's dance at the brink of ruin and one woman's determination to revive it. Taggart Transcontinental was a pioneer in the railroading industry and owned the loin share of the market. It dominated the railroading business until mismanagement and rising competition threatened to bring it to its knees. Dagny Taggart, the strong willed, business minded vice president of Taggart (underneath her brother) fights against all odds and restores the railroad to its former grandeur, only to lose all her customers due to mysterious vanishings. The plot encompasses many powerful people, including Dagny, but in the end it is seen that the whole world revolves around one man, causing one to ask, \\"Who is John Galt?&quot;Rand does an excellent job developing her characters, and why should she not...she has a thousand pages to fill. Rand goes into such depth describing her characters that one would never finish if they took time to read them all. Therefore, it is necessary to read as Ayn intended, skimming for ideas. One of her central characters, Henry Rearden, is portrayed as a harsh, immovable, steel-industry giant who expects nothing from others. If time was taken to read every word, Rearden's change might not be noticed. While skimming, however; an evolution is seen changing Rearden from a stoic gravatis man to a tender, caring, almost fatherly character when he falls in love with Dagny. Not just anyone can orchestrate such a change of direction. Only a literary master can cause the reader to hate a character for hundreds of pages and then make him or her turn around and cheer for that same character later in the book.Every book that Ms. Rand was written has definite purpose, and Atlas Shrugged is no exception. In the 1930's Ayn Rand developed a unique philosophy about human values and attitudes called Objectivism, and since then has worked that philosophy into all of her fiction works. Her Objectivism theme is evidenced by Dagny's reactions to various trials that life throws at her. In Dagny's mind the mission at hand must be fulfilled before all other things. Rand also like to incorporate the struggles and rewards of making money in her novels. In some of her novels, Rand writes from the anti-Capitalism perspective of Communism, only to praise capitalism as the communist worlds disintegrate. \\u001f\\u001f\\u001f\\u001f\\u001f\\u001f As her minion, Leonard Peikoff, once said \\"Objectivism and Capitalism go hand in hand.\\"The plot of Atlas is tedious and almost non-existent to a reader who must absorb all the material on page. Like a Monet painting, Rand's art cannot be studied up close, rather one must stand back and look at the big pictures, and that means skimming for ideas. Rand also uses flashbacks to provide a background during the first half of the story. She describes Dagny's tortured relationship with the only man who could tame her, Fransisco D'Anconia, and the relationship's roots in their childhood. Although her flashbacks are exposed and necessary elements of her story, Rand's use of foreshadowing is less out in the open. The John Galt enigma (Who is John Galt?) tells the reader that this mysterious man will be made known, but it can be easily over looked. Similar is the situation with the disappearing industrial geniuses of the world.The deep brilliance of Rand's work has since inspired me in many facets of my life. It has helped me to argue points at Junior State of America meetings. It has embed the value and rewards of hard work into my character. I think the most important lesson it taught me was that anything is possible so long as I never surrender. There were many more lessons taught by Ms. Rand, but these three are the ones that changed me the most. I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle such a monumental work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn may not be a literary genius, but her ideas have genuine merit. Many of her characters are paralleled in the conservatives of today who are tired of being dragged down by close minded bureaucrats who want only power and money and misuse their authority to get it rather than do the job they were put in place to do. I've read most of the reviews just to get a feel for the opinions of others who have also read this book. If you are a socialist liberal democrat (or just a democrat since they are the same) you will hate this book! It is not for those who think that society owes them a handout when they have not earned it themselves! On the otherhand, if you feel that you should achieve for the sake of doing your best at something (rather than being a parasite off of those who are the best) and that you deserve to the reap the rewards for your achievements with limited government intervention or extortion in the form of taxes, fees, and regulations; then you will love this book. One interesting parallel to the real world... conservatives, entrepreneurs, achievers, earners, etc. can survive without liberal parasites continually waiting for handouts. But the reverse is not true."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I wonder whether 'Objectivists' are aware of the idolatrousnature of the Ayn Rand Cult...This novel is very interesting as an illustration of Miss Rand's ambiguous relationship with the Jewish religion and her misguided attempt to retain some of its elements on a clearly idolatrous basis. I highly recommend it to readers interested in the 'cult phenomenon'..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's refreshing and reassuring to see that the vast majority of readers give this book a very high rating.Though the characters and philosophies of this fiction work may be a bit extreme, I think it is to illustrate and &quot;drive home&quot; her point. I'll also agree that she could have written it in 700 pages or less.My eyes have been open for many years to the extreme liberal movement in this country, however, this book increased my perception and helped me see the socialistic foundation of many policies that are touted as &quot;morally good for the people&quot;.This book is not religion, but instead an important piece to your overall study of politics."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book that inspires passion from those who like it, as well as those who despise it. It is philosophy dressed up under the guise of fiction.If you disagree with the philosophy, you will, if you wish, be able to ignore the philosphical statements in order to reach the end of the book. If you agree with the philosophy, you should branch off to one of Rand's other works, after excitedly racing through the novel.However, since the book is in fact fiction, it should be primarily viewed as such. The protagonist of the novel, Dagny Taggart, is one of the strongest women characters in the history of literature. She puts Scarlet O'Hara to shame.What is important about Atlas is the spirit in which it is written. Rand extolls the superior person; one will be able to tell which characters lack it. This spirit is seen in Dagny and one cannot help but root for her. Regardless of the doctrine in which the spirit-- perhaps better defined as zest-- is preached (the philosophy, again), it can be viewed positively of its own accord.But (and this may seem illogical), a concomitant theme of hatred envelops this book. People who hate this book harp on that. People who love this book tend to submerge that and concentrate on other aspects of Rand's philosophy.The literary high point of the book occurs in the second part and seventh chapter. Rand, after devoting the majority of 500 pages to development of three characters, speeds away from those characters to introduce other characters, who by implicit comparison to the trio of main characters, seem like cardboard-cutouts. But, these pieces of cardboard are made human by the pathos caused by the inability of the trio of main characters (and especially Taggart) to stop the inevitable conclusion that ends the chapter.Rand's plot twists can be seen a mile away. The example cited above does not detract from the reading of the inevitable conclusion; in fact it heightens the tension, for the dramatic irony literally reeks off of the page.The book divides neatly between the second and third section. Values that are upheld in the first two sections are disdained in the third (and the reader is well prepared for this due to Rand's voluminous verbiage); and vica versa. Characters who go on journeys often learn something about themselves along the way. The reader is well prepared to travel into the third part; a comparison with the first chapter of the book shows the reader the degree to which Rand has weaved her magic. If the book hasn't gripped you by this point, it probably will not. Put it down and read it at another point; this is book that can stand as a benchmark of how the reader's views and opinions can change over time.As an example of how a book filled with a zest for life and freedom could also be filled with such hate, consider the following:&quot;For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belonged to your neighbors-- between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one can came to say that your life belongs to you and that the goal is to live it.&quot; (p.930)The above, incredibly, is from the same author who writes the following with apparent glee: &quot;Looking down, they could see the last convulsions: the lights of the cars were darting through the streets, like animals trapped in a mass, frantically seeking an exit, the bridges were jammed like cars, the approaches to the bridges were veins of massed headlights, glittering bottlenecks stopping all motion, and the desperate screaming of sirens faintly reached to the heights of the plane. It took them a moment to realize that the panic had reached the power stations-- and that the lights of New York had gone out.&quot;(p.1064)This book will make you think; indeed, that is the point and theme of the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let me start with: I have not even finished this book. I plan to, really. Someday. Eventually..What I liked least about this book is its unbelievability. The characters are so two-dimensional. The only feelings consist of: anger, frustration, greed, selfishness, and apathy (if you can even count apathy as a feeling..) If a character felt remorse- it was because of their own selfish desires that were inhibited. Passion is reserved for greedy ambitions. People don't love. There is no motivation except for one's self. Everyone is single-minded.There were only two types of characters in this book. The Good. And the Bad. Basically Capitalist: Good! Socialist: Bad! The \\"Bad\\" people are completely incompetent and nearly unable to function due to their idiocy. Yet, somehow, the whole nation blindly follows them due to their own moronic brains. Then, the \\"Good\\" people are superior geniuses that can only do right. They have no feelings, are selfish, and deranged (hey, I'm not discriminating, the \\"Bad\\" people are like this too. Makes you wonder what really separates the two).All you hear in the book is how the Socialists hate all the entrepreneurs that are just trying to improve the world with their ideals, and how the Capitalists are innovative, the best, and want to squash the Socialists.. Yet, somehow, they can't--why are they so smart again?Okay, okay, I get it. You hate Socialist, Rand. Good. Now, moving on. Wait. There is no moving on. This book is about nothing. There is no plot. There isn't even character development, because nobody has any realistic feelings. Their reactions are totally irrational, and would never occur in any kind of operating universe. Reading this book makes me want to scream \\"Good gravy! Where are the PEOPLE in this book?\\" Yeah. So, apparently, there are some great moral values embedded at the end of this book. Which is why I will persevere and finish this book.Also, Atlas Shrugged makes me feel like a shallow person- because this book is supposed to be so insightful, and I'm just not getting it. But, then I remember: Wait, I'm not a shallow person!? Perhaps I need more depth to truly appreciate the repetitiveness that plagues this book. Whatever.This book is redundant, slow, drab, dry, obnoxious, redundant, unrealistic, interesting, and redundant.I'll admit, it's pretty suspenseful for having absolutely no direction. The writing style is tedious, but many actually enjoy it. Meh, that's why it gets TWO stars instead of one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is simply torture to read. People in this forum have highlighted its flaws, and I can only agree with all of the basic criticisms. Yes, Ayn, we get it: mankind is only catapulted forward by brilliant individual minds who must remain unfettered by the nagging mediocracy bringing up the rear of the species. The dead hand of the State will always steer us wrong, genius is throttled by mass participation in decision-making, and we should all be ranked in a ruthless and rigid meritocracy which has immutable demarcation lines. But...I wanted a compelling story! This isn't a crime of the far Right, see Frank Norris' The Octopus for a counterbalancing bore, only to the political Left. A happy compromise might be Wolfe's You Can Never Go Home Again, which shows its Leftist leanings early, but manages to remain interesting despite its political prejudices. In a nutshell, the basic problem with Atlas Shrugged is that, as a didactic novel, it completely lacks guile. Simply put, it asserts the primacy of intellectual elites in a ham-fisted, unmissable way that suggests she felt that her main audience were as unsophisticated as her many evil caricatures. Incidentally, Rand seems to be fixated generally with the architect profession as an embodiment of sui generis...readers seeking a balance on the redoubtable skill of building design might want to seek out Graham Greene's trenchant, accessable, but most importantly, brief contemplation of an architect who has recognised his limitations in remaking the world in A Burnt Out Case."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Lengthy, but intertwines governmental forms, logic, philosophy, morality, history and logic.When you ask a customer to review a purchase, you should not have any minimum number of words!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book looks like the picture and reads like the description.

We are living through what she prophesied."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have some comments and responses to reviewers' complaints.Atlas Shrugged is a work of fiction. It was never intended as a light novella or breezy romance. If you as the reader have a problem with books, move on to another author. Before reading this book, I did not enjoy long, intellectual novels; I changed my mind after finishing Atlas Shrugged.1) Many of the reviewers who disliked the novel disparage the lack of reality in its characterization. When reading the book, it is obvious the author intended to demonstrate the ultimate conclusion of the socialist system. If the world subscribed completely to the communist philosophy, all human talent would suppress or remove itself from society. Ultimately, Rand was prophetic; witness the failure of the U.S.S.R., East Germany, and North Korea. As such, the characters are very black and white. The prime mover is good; the moocher is bad. No one in reality will fit either the protagonist or the antagonist. However, you will recognize elements of the characters in people in your life.2) Rand puts into fiction what economics has long held true: man is ultimately self-interested. People want to be compensated for work. Even altruistic ventures stem ultimately from a person's desire to donate his time, effort, or money. Communism requires people work according to their ability and distributes compensation according to their need. Rand makes the excellent point: society cannot force effort, society cannot force charity.3) As with any utopian novel, there are problems with Rand's novel. Rand would argue a corporation acting according to her philosophy would minimize pollution and compensate their workers adequately; otherwise, over time, the company would cease to do business by poisoning its customers or lose its employees. In reality, this does not work. Companies are run by humans, and humans tend to be very short-sighted. But this goes back to: this is not a \\"reality\\" book, it is an idealistic novel.I found the novel very inspiring and upholding the best of the human spirit: intellectual effort. Every step forward in human history came from the use of a man's mind. It is the collective efforts of history's prime movers that allow us to travel across the country in minutes, communicate with people around the world, live in buildings that tower above the earth. The highest compliment this book should receive: it makes you think."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I put off reading this book for a long time because it had such a cult following, but I finally picked it up and found it to be a wonderful story. Though her Objectivist views permeate the novel, they don't cloud the story at all, and you don't feel like you're being preached to, except for one scene where a speech is given. I found it to be a page turner, which is a lot to say for a 1000+ page novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The novel \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is based on two industrialists, Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, who struggle with their businesses while being interfered by regulation, attacked and blamed by the intelligent people and politicians. Being courageous and talented, they beat the regulators who seem to only want to get in the way. As they struggle, they succeed again and again, only to have their victories reversed in the end. Through their struggles, Dagny and Rearden learn the importance of a rational morality. The lesson learned is that a morality with a false base is an inverted morality, and is destructive.In my opinion, the major point in this book is that Rand's heroes reject any demand for self-sacrifice, and she also thinks that thought and choice and purpose are actions of the individual, not the group. Rand's heroes are men and women who set their own purposes, act by their own judgment, and take responsibility for their lives.After I read this novel, I recommend that we should read it too even though I had hard time reading it because it is not easy to get to the point what Rand wants to give us. It inspires readers to live as men and women of the mind, to seek independence, achievement, and fulfillment as individuals in their personal lives, so I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book not to be missed! Particularly if you've been affected by the recent economic slump, which I believe is not going to turn around any time soon.I once heard that we should all read Tom Sawyer three times in our lives, once as a child, once as an adult, and once in old age. Well, I don't know about that, but I just re-read this and wished that I had read Atlas Shrugged more often.I resolve to read it in the future whenever my economic outlook changes. I see things in the book now that I would have sworn were not there the last time I read it. Last time I read it, I had no experience of economic hardship. I'm different now. In both timeframes, the book inspired me to both reflection and action.If I were to give advice to a young adult, one of my top suggestions would be to read this book, early and often."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book sums up, in story form, all of the things I have been thinking about the current direction of society, but have been unable to quite put into words. An excellent read; I have pushed others to read it so hard, that they think I'm getting royalties :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand dedicated her life to a very necessary task - providing a philosophical underpinning for capitalism. Any discussion of her work needs to take into account the fact that her then &quot;radical&quot; ideas in such areas as free markets and the primacy of the individual over the collective are now accepted as the Gospel in most parts of the world. Quite a bit of credit for this is due to Miss Rand - and if you think that's giving her too much credit, consider that Alan Greenspan used to sit at her feet (no doubt Mr. Greenspan would repudiate parts of her philosophy, as do I - no matter. You don't have to be in 100% agreement with someone to acknowledge their brilliance and influence). Atlas Shrugged was to be the summation of Objectivism, in which Ayn poured out all of her arguments in the form of a speech by her ideal man, John Galt. Did she succeed? Well, at last count, there were over 600 reviews submitted on this item - compare that with almost anything else on here. People will be loving and hating this book for as long as the printed word is around. To those that hate it because it can be a little flat in characterization, and because her love scenes are flawed, I ask that you give her credit for her courage in attempting to define a philosophy through a novel. To those that hate it precisely because of the philosophy, I will echo Miss Rand and say &quot;check your premises&quot; - a surprising number of her arguments remain impregnable to refutation, at least any logical refutation. This is the kind of book that can inspire 20-page reviews, but bottom line - you don't have to be a &quot;true believer&quot;, nor blind to the sometimes flawed writing, to appreciate that Atlas Shrugged is a book about ideas, and it continues to challenge each new generation (and give quite a few people some renewed purpose in their lives)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If anyone wants to look into the future of the California power crisis, read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am nineteen years old and this book has probably changed my entire scope of the world. Atlas Shrugged is about the joys of capitalism. In society there are basically two types of people: those who make the world turn, the capitalist, the movers and shakers, the people who drive the economy. On the other side there are those who tend to feed off of the wealth. They beg for hand outs, do just enough to get by, and are bitter at those who have worked hard and become successful.In society we usually expect the bottom half to give out on us first. We expect them to not do the job all the way, never suceed at anything, and feed off of the hard workers. But what if that top half of the world, the movers and the shakers, suddenly decided to stop? What if the worlds' industrialist, business leaders, and those that drove the economy decided it just wasn't worth it anymore....With its immortal cry: WHO IS JOHN GAULT? Ayn Rand has pieced together her view of capitalism and the world. The book is about one man who vowed to stop the motors of the world: and did..... I would recomend this to anyone who has ever worked for something in life, only to have it stolen by another person. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to start a business, start a new career, or invest in something.

At the risk of getting on a soap box, this book serves as an excellent parable of the dire direction in which society can head when it continues to give handouts to able bodied people who are too lazy to work; when it saps its citizens of fiduciary gain via taxes and thus provides a disincentive to working harder; and when too much deference is given to the squeaky wheels among us. This story sounds all too familiar, unfortunately, and I am amazed at how prophetic Rand's tale is- she must have seen things coming (can you say &quot;Al Gore&quot;?).The story's only drawback was a 75+ page soliloquy about money that became overkill over its first 10 pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Does this woman believe in editing?!?!? I mean 5 pages dedicated to how the wind feels in someones hair is a bit ridiculous!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading the first twenty pages of this book I began to equate the socio-political times in this book with those of today. The further I read I was convinced that this is where the United States is being led by the Obama administration unless we gather the strength of our people to do something about it. There is a concept today that is held by many ignorant people that their source of wealth and well being is derived by a group of intellectuals in Washington who know \\"best\\" what individuals and a nation need to create a society in which everything is fair and each individual is entitled to his/her share of wealth, regardless of whether they have done anything to earn it. Well, that sounds pretty good to someone who has no desire to create wealth, because someone else will create it for them when the government passes laws that attempt to manage a society that will provide wealth to those who think their wealth is created for them by the government, when such wealth is really confiscated from those who create wealth in order to provide an equal amount to those who have done very little to create wealth or improve the overall well being. A society cannot prosper if so many believe they have no responsibility to make it grow and to improve the level of equality by earning what will improve their own lives and others. The concept of Robin Hood is a nice story when applied to the kingdom that serves only itself unless there is a method created to attempt to make things fairer. But a kingdom where a Robin Hood is necessary is not one that has served its people. The best way for a government to serve its people is to allow them the freedom to be as creative and energetic as possible without interfering with their affairs. A society with government that allows economic freedom will be far better than one that does not. A government that confiscates the wealth of those who provide the wealth will eventually lose all those providers and will have nothing to redistribute.This is essentially the concept of Atlas Shrugged. It is a story that reapplied, could describe America, a great country that gave away its wealth to its less than successful citizens, poor countries of need and wars of justice. We gave our wealth away without concern of where additional wealth might be created. It is so foolish and so sad.I encourage all to read this book because it likely the story of America, a country that was so wealthy that it gave it all away. We still have a small chance but it will be difficult because of all the promises of future welfare, Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security payments that we are required to make but have no money to do so.

Ayn Rand is a master in portraying heoric individuals triumphing over the collective-relativist mentality.

It didn't really change my point of view, but it did bore me a great deal and I was happy when it was finished."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I call \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" objectivist propaganda, I do not mean Rand was remotely as bad a person as Goebbles or Stalin, or even that Objectivism is necessarily wrong. I mean it literally: it is a book whose real purpose is to promote the faith of objectivism, essentially a non-fiction philosophy essay spead out over 1000+ pages. It is a novel in name only.There is no character development. All characters are either completely good or completely bad from the very start, and do not change. Furthermore, we can (unsurprisingly) predict with certainty how they will behave in all situations: the good guys will follow Objectivism's philosophical recommendations to the letter, the bad guys will act like \\"socialists\\" (or like Objectivists think socialists are like).The plot is preposterous: a few technocrats and their friends and helpers literally stop the modern world in its tracks by refusing to participate in it. After society duly crashes, they return to the smashed world to re-make it in their own, objectivistm image. This absurd result is only made possible (even in fiction) by Rand's strict orthodoxy: the few objectivists are all-powerful (just like Ayn Rand thinks objectivists would be) while the millions, or billions, of \\"looters\\" are completely incompetent (just like Rand thinks \\"socialism\\" makes you).Rand took herself her philosophy far too seriously to be a good novelist. She could not forget objecivism for a moment; the only thing she seems to have cared about in any person--real or fictional--is whether they are objectivists. This in itself doesn't make Objectivism bad, or wrong, as a philosophy. But it *does* make \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" a failure as a novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book took half of everything I believed and crushed it. This is the most important book I've read to date. Atlas Shrugged is truly amazing. Thank you Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's true that Ayn Rand's novel is daunting. It is not for people who are not willing to approach philosophy with a rational mind of their own. In terms of literature, the style and characters are suited to Ayn Rand's purpose. I think it is unfair for people to criticize her style as uniteresting. To give a fair comparison, it has the simplicity of authors like Hemmingway and Salinger, but lacks their effort at subtlety. That is not to say their is a need for subtlety. What I appreciate most about her characters is their consistancy. Despite accusations that they are not realistic representations of humanity, I find that they never act in a way inconsistant with their beliefs simply for a convenient plot device. I would also like to point out that there is a great deal of allegory in this work, and that when your characters are the embodiment of certain ideals, such as in Dante's Inferno and William Golding's Lord of the Flies, there is a certain framework in which your characters must act. In terms of her philosophy, Ayn Rand's ideas are very similar to those of Emmanuel Kant. She relies on a philosophy that places human dignity as the highest virtue and dictates that morality based in reason is the means by which one preserves this dignity. The basic idea of the book is that society is divided into two groups: the mystics and the men of the mind. Among the mystics there are the mystics of muscle who are the materialists and the mystics of faith who are those who ask men to live for the sake of others alone. The men of the mind are those who rely on their reason to guide them, they are everyone from the inventors of motors to those who are able to act appropriately without instruction. The novel discusses how the mystics loot the minds of the productive men of society. The crucial point here is that the men of the mind are not just the rich producers, this is not a novel of class warfare, they are workers in factories, they are simply men who are good at what they do. They may not be the best, but they are simply good at it. Ayn Rand's philosphy is not a rationalization for greed, it is a rationalization for personal responsibility. As it is unfair for you to be forced to support the lives of others against your will, so it unfair for them to support you against theirs. The idea is that all forms of work are good, and that the men of the mind, if left to their own machinations will benefit society. They work for their own interest, but it is not unearned money they seek. It is not even worldly goods. It is happiness. This is not a justification for the rich, the majority of the rich in this book are painted as the blackest of the black. Ayn Rand makes a distinction between the rich who have earned thier profits and the rich who became rich on the backs of others. All of her heros are self-made men, and are admired by all classes of workers. They are honest and fair. As for the 100 page Galt speech. It is long and for those who immediately perceive the full implications of the philosophy, some of it is unneccessary. However, I must say that it is a refreshingly complete examination of a moral philosophy as presented in a book. In closing, this book is not for those who have no interest in examining philosophy or ethics. If you don't like the ideas of Emmanuel Kant, you will not appreciate this book. If you appreciate authors whose characters have layer upon layer of personality, you will find her characters too honest with themselves and self-aware to provide such interest. If you are a personal who delights in a puzzle, in the epic struggle of a woman with her desire to maintain the railroad of her grandfather and her desire to live by the moral code she finds most just, if you are a personal who wishes to approach all ideas with reason in mind and is willing to disscard less rational ideas for more rational ones, you will enjoy this book. It is a jouney, and that can make it difficult to get through. But if you approach it with a rational mind, you will find that Ayn Rand makes no attempt to persuade you with guilt trips, only with reason. As she says, trust no one else's certitude; rely solely on that mind and reason which is your own."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Politics comes down to \\"how much government?\\" The people who want more we call communists, socialists, liberals, or just leftists.

I cannot and will not argue with her on this idea, as I do not completely disagree with her. However, my comment on this novel revolves around her attempt in this novel to describe the various elements extant in the world which she believes work to destroy this near-godly spirit embedded in the persona of modern man.&quot;Atlas&quot; is not a work for the fence sitter. Reading it will make all but the most stubborn minds take one opinion or the other about her viewpoint. This polarizing effect makes many people hate the book, and it made me want to hurl it at the wall several times. Frequently, I found her view, which describes the Objectivist philosophy, destructive and unrealistic. To be honest, when you consider man to be a demi-god whose purpose in life to destroy the elements of life that try to crush him, it is nearly impossible to write a book that is either realistic or that will appeal to all who read it.At best, Objectivism scores its best points in its economic statements. The way it is presented, it certainly makes sense that the primary goal of industry should be to make money, and the public good be damned. For what other purpose should industry exist than for the building of wealth? From the viewpoint of this novel and from other sources on Objectivism, it makes as much sense to suggest that businesses look out for the public good as it does to insist that charitable organizations should exist to make money.In the end, I do not agree with Objectivist philosophy, but that does not mean I do not admire this book. To be sure, this story is pure fantasy, and those that would endeavor to follow its example are, in my opinion, foolhardy, but this novel exists as an exhilarating work.

You may not agree with everything in the book, but I would be amazed by anyone who could put it down after reading it and still think that legal plunder is a sound foundation for a nation. The exciting story will carry you along with ease, despite the fact that the book takes several days to finish.

The characters are one-dimensional beings whose only function is to recite the &quot;philosophical&quot; ideas of Ayn Rand at appropriate situations. The plot is overly long and unengaging, without the subtlties and complexities that generally justify long novels. All of the ideas of Ayn Rand can be contained in one page. None of the characters can be said to be interesting, much less sympathetic. As a book advancing philosophy, this book is dumbed-down and simplistic. As an epic, this book is unnecessarily long.

( Although, when I read reviews comparing Ayn Rand to Adolf Hitler, I am reassured that there are still very few of them ).Ayn clearly demonsrates the evil of the collectivist mentality (something Hitler promoted by the way) that has overcome this once great nation, thanks to the whiny, moron liberals who keep reproducing and brainwashing their young.If you are the type of person that believes that an individual can and should GREAT, then this is the book for you. However, if you're the typical whiny person who believes that the world owes YOU something ,then don't read this book. In fact please go live somewhere else!!!These words may seem harsh ( awwww ), but &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is more than a novel. It is a warning of the inevitable future that may lay ahead if the people of this world do not start using their brains that genetics ( not GOD ) gave them.People must realize that an individual owes nothing to the world, and that the world only owes him the freedom to achieve his values.If this makes sense to you, then read this book. Otherwise, I shall enjoy watching you self-destruct!!!Oh yeah...you wanna know what it is about...right? Well...in a nutshell...In a once great USA that is slowly falling apart from the parasitic collectivist movement, a small group of individuals struggles with the fact that they are supporting a world of ungrateful leaches and &quot;looters&quot;. They are the thinkers, the innovators who are carrying the weight of the world, and they decide to &quot;shrug&quot; it, leaving the leaches and &quot;looters&quot; to fend for themselves."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Abominable selfishness posing as a philosophy, perhaps from the very same demonic muse that infected/possessed Nietzche.I couldn't even get into the actual prose, so hideous was the author's hatred toward her fellow people.Rand's philosophy was a mixture of cartoonishness and arrogance--the kind of stuff usually seen only in straighjacketed philosophers or totalitarian dictators.By the way: IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO ENCOUNTER A QUAINT, SIMPLE, YET UTTERLY RUTHLESS DESTRUCTION OF RAND'S PHILOSOPHY, READ &quot;OLD SCHOOL&quot; BY TOBIAS WOLFF. Wolff destroys Rand in one fell swoop, and does it through the voice of a near child."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the vilest pieces of crap to masquerade as a novel written by a woman who strings words together and calls it writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I never thought I was smart enough to read a book like Atlas Shrugged when I was younger. One person in my life kept telling me over the decades that I HAD to read this book. Well, after many years, a great deal of maturing both chronologically and mentally, and loads of experience, I opened the cover and began.I hope that Ayn Rand gave this book to her psychologist/psychiatrist or was hoping, when this book was published, that one would take up the cause and approach her to offer his/her services. This has got to be one of the darkest, most cynical, and depressing novels I have ever read. And, I would be remiss if I did not say that it was loaded with sadism and masochism--if one is into S&M.; I know that some would say that my description of the story is true and was part of her point!I cannot believe that her editors didn't see their way clear to tailoring down the unnecessary amount of verbiage she spewed throughout the pages. How many different ways can one say the same thing and then say it again? Too bad Moon Struck wasn't around when this was being written so that someone could have referenced Cher slapping Nicholas Cage's face and telling him to, \\"Snap out of it\\"!After all this anticipation, I concluded that Atlas Shrugged was the most disappointing book I have ever read. Disappointing isn't a strong enough word for a novel that I waited until this time in my life to tackle. I almost laughed at myself to think that I believed I didn't have the intelligence or capacity of mind to understand this 'great' work--said tongue and cheek!To insure myself that it wasn't just me that had this reaction, I spoke to any number of people who I respect when it comes to the world of books and good writing. Two in particular, one being a professor; the other runs an advanced book group, had the same reaction.Just so I don't leave any doubt, I am not expecting every book to read like a fairy tale come true. I have great admiration for books that lure me into the dark side of the author's expression. This book missed that lure. Instead, I felt assaulted.I give credit to anyone that can get through this vast sink hole of darkness. I wonder about those who praise this work as they revere Ms. Rand like a literary goddess. Do they really believe this was great writing or are they part of the herd? But, then again, what constitutes great writing?Enough said.

There is a lot to learn here."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"(This review is written for readers of The Fountainhead who are considering reading Ayn's later and \\"more developed\\" novel.)I read the Fountainhead last year and was practically in love. The book was incredible; it had a fantastic plot, an exceptionally intriguing main character with oodles of depth and who was facing a brutal struggle. Also, it had architecture! Bonus. Roark's struggle in that book was something that seemed utterly triumphant; a colossal struggle, truly epic in scale, and for me an incredible experience in a book. Struggle being the operative word in that novel: it was evident on virtually every page.That all being said, readers of that book by and large found more to be said in the book's near-spiritual tones; by and large, readers seemed to respond to it as if it offered a liberating viewpoint extolling the goodness of being one's self, more free from the constricting over-regard for others that is often promoted in society. That's not really what Rand was going for. Ultimately, it is an important part of Objectivism and a core concept to her, but not *the* theme. As a generalization: if you didn't think Toohey was a HUGE character who consistently grabbed your attention and made you feel ill in The Fountainhead, I would venture to say you didn't quite get what she was going for.For this reason, Atlas Shrugged was written. It takes the main theme of the Fountainhead -- that struggle -- and makes a novel out of it. In my opinion, this is done at the direct expense of the characters. Atlas Shrugged has characters, sure, and they have backgrounds (though not quite as much as in the Fountainhead in my estimation, but close)... but their backstories aren't the point. It's about their struggle. A quick plot summary will tell you the details of the struggle, but this struggle is painfully evident. Painfully.I give this book three stars in a capacity that has zero to do with the novel's philosophy and everything to do with its dedication to making it way too clear. To her credit, this was exactly Rand's goal with this book. But if you enjoyed the plot and characters and the true depth in the Fountainhead, and that's why you're here, I'm not quite sure you'll be as satisfied as you might expect. Dagny Taggart is simply no Howard Roark. This book comes on too strong and way too bluntly. Repetition is present on like every other page. I get it. I understand. It's clear why this is such a \\"conservative\\" book (politically speaking) in a way that wasn't as painfully clear with The Fountainhead. I just don't like reading philosophical porn, I guess -- it's too explicit for me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a book about war.It's an action novel - a thriller, almost, with as many ups and downs and plot twists and romance as any good adventure story. And while the war is not a militant one, it endures as one that takes place on a battlefield of economics and ideals, values and work ethics, people and production. The characters are heroes and villains. There is good, and there is evil. But these never appear in the way that one expects when first diving in to Atlas Shrugged. And of course, there is the eternal mystery: Who is John Galt?Ayn Rand has created a hefty read, to be sure: 1168 pages of solid text. But the prose is like poetry; she transforms the sweaty, gritty workplace of steam and fire and coal into the masterful beauty of creation at work. The ideas are the embodiment of philosophical perfection; her interpretation of the true values of Capitalism would leave even Adam Smith breathless. Rand captures the romanticism of production at its purest, and then tears out your heart when the evils of the world raze that beauty to the ground.Overall, a superbly excellent read. Strongly recommended for the intellectual, the romantic, the economist, or just the curious reader.These characters and the story they tell will stay with you to your old age. And, if you allow it, Rand will renew your faith in capitalism - as it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was written in 1952.

I have only one remark. Rather than using 50 CDs (!!!), why not thinking to alternative supports and formats, such as one pendrive filled of mp3s?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was amazed by how prophetic Miss Rand was with this book. It was as if she saw the future in her crystal ball. She clearly saw the contempt for the individual that the socialist movement in America has. Many of the themes she explored have come true in the last quarter of this century. She accurately portrayed the nanny-state mentality and the arrogance those on the left display. The characters were, at times, wooden and one dimensional but the point was made. Sometimes in this life things really are black and white and not a million shades of gray. My only gripe was the overly long-winded speech by the John Galt character near the end of the book. It made the mythic icon she built him up to be seem rather nasty and ill-tempered and sort of a disappointment for me. I would hope that a new reader of this fine work would be open minded and see the parallels in our modern world to the dissmal world the welfare pimps in this book wrought on America and the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is the best book ever written. It blew my mind. That's all I can say about it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand has put together a story that is compelling and intricately-weaved that allows the reader to explore her philosophy of Objectivism. This is a classic from a philosophical and social standpoint. (although not necessarily from a &quot;writing&quot; standpoint) Even if you don't agree with all the contentions of objectivism, this story allows you to explore its premises in a lighter way than reading her treatises do. This book has changed and continues to change my life. Do you ever feel like you have to reject reason in order to do what others expect of you, especially in order to keep your job, or just to get along in the world? This book will help you understand the dynamics of that dilemma.

The second time I picked it up (several years later), I got past the first 70 pages and couldn't put it down. I read Atlas in less than a week - staying up all one night, and spending a weeks vacation reading. Since that week 20 years ago, I have read the book at least 10 times. I know the answer to &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; He is a &quot;timeless&quot; hero! It's hard to believe this book was written in 1957, over 40 years ago. The theme holds true today just as it did in 1957 - the only thing that gives it away is the dime cup of coffee. Ayn Rand is a romantic realist, and a fine novelist. I love her work and have recommended this book and Fountainhead to many, many friends - and many have read them both and feel the same way I do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I find that this book is the most refreshing illustration of courage and intellect that I have yet read.

Although she does not posses the finest style, nor does she write particularly deep books, she places within her books her philosophy, and forms a masterful plot around her (via Aristotle) beatiful, simplistic maxim &quot;A is A&quot;, reason, honesty, and truth. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is the story of every person who believes that those who have the ability do, should be rewarded for their doing so, and that those who do not, should not.

I have another prediction to go with it:you won't care. Even those who can't understand Objectivism will almost definitely find the book worth their while. _Atlas Shrugged_, ranked on national surveys as being second only to the Bible as the book listed as a primary influence, has shocked, frustrated, and liberated more readers than any book written in Rand's era.

I believe the bible might be only a bit longer then this piece of work. This book almost reminds me of Stephen Kings the Dark Tower series as everyone in the book seems to live in some wierd parrell universe to our world. She makes the people(socialist) who do not conform to capitalism look like total fools and people like Dagney Taggart and John Galt as the only rational people on earth. She simplfies the whole debat into a set of super humans and idiots. But this book although written i believe about 50 years ago is hitting home HOW.This is how. We are now reaping the fruits of Capitalist greed. I am no socialist but becouse of the greed of wall street and becouse of our bad law making(such as doing away with the glass-stiegal act) we now find ourselves in the hot seat where our government is now using trillions of tax payer money to pay for corporete greed. Ms. Rand where are the John Galt's and the Reardens of Rearden steele in our country? This book just does not connect to our world anymore. Amereica has lost its manufacuring base and is now a nation that only produces pop music and banking instruments. I hate to sound harsh but the John Galts never did exist. But to be fair to Ayn Rand it does seem like some of the socialist morons she potrayed in here book do exist in this country and ARE trying to silence anyone who does not believe in what is fair in there minds.

Objectivism and Libertarianism are supposably not the same thing, and that its the Libertarians who are plagarizing the Objectivists, and all that garbage. But don't believe it. They're both exactly the same.My first reading experience involving Rand was the Fountainhead, during my early Libertarian years, which I did find quite good. The reason is that, unlike Atlas Shrugged, the Fountainhead pertained more to individualism and 'bucking the system', as they say.Because this book was so entertaining, I thought that, since Atlas Shrugged was supposed to be her masterpiece, that SURELY it would be even better.Holy Crap was I WRONG!!The novel is long.....pretensious.....overblown.....overhyped.....and to be quite frank, I'm just plain OVER IT!But the real problem here is not the novel itself, which, if that were the only problem, then it wouldn't be a big problem. It would just fade into the obscure annals of history.No. The real problem is the philosophy behind it....the aforementioned Objectivism (Libertarianism)No matter what you call it, its poisonous and amoral. Although one will constantly and eternally debate what is 'moral' or 'immoral' in human society, the TRUE evil is that which is 'amoral', that is, one that feels he/she/they is completely (almost psychotically) inapplicable to society's laws.Objectivism is nothing more than looking down on those who do not agree with Ayn Rand. That's it. If you don't believe in lazzeis-faire capitalism, anti-altruism, anti-business regulation, anti-religion ideas that permeate Rand's though, you are irrational and therefore SUB-HUMAN!Libertarianism is just as bad....hell, its the SAME THING!But this book slapped me out of my Libertarian daze and revealed me to the true evils of Libertarianism....that all of that civil liberty stuff that they constantly advocate....free speech, privacy, moral crimes abolition......is nothing more than A MEANS TO AN END.....and that end is a completely unregulated economy......COMPLETELY unregulated, where the white collar crime of Enron, Halliburton, etc. would go unpunished, unnoticed, and REWARDED!Objectivism (Libertarianism) encourages the greatest of human evils.....greed, hatred, and egotism.I will only reccomend this book for one purpose, and that is as a warning to all of those who feel even a small nudge to follow Rand.....Do not allow yourself to be sucked into Libertarianism OR Objectivism......for even though you preach liberty, you will find that your own liberty is in a cage, and held captive by the ideas of a woman who could not look beyond her own ego."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Don't quite understand why this book is so popular, it could have been written in 300 pages instead of 1000+ pages, projects a world which is highly unlikely and the plot is pretty damn boring."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Note: This review contains spoilers.I first read Atlas Shrugged in 2000 and I bought into it on more of an emotional level than I should have; I felt angry and wronged, but of course, I was the fatalistic target audience of the book: a big headed kid with a passionate dislike for authority.Looking back on it I can see that Ms Rand was also somewhat fatalistic in her actions. She was hurt and lashed out at a system that she had felt wronged her just as I felt after finishing this book. So in reaction to being oppressed by Communism she created an equally extreme and opposite philosophy from Communism. This is much like any person might do as a result of oppression under any fundamentalist ideals be it cultural, superstitious, philosophical or authoritarian.When first reading the book there was a constant nagging thought this is completely removed from reality and this is perhaps the books biggest failing. The actions described in this book and the philosophy just don't cross that fundamental pragmatic barrier that so many have (correctly) faulted Communism for failing to achieve.To further support my point, others have also identified the absolutism of the \\"end of the world\\" strategy as a major failing. So much so the abridged copy I saw modified the ending to have less of an apocalyptic feeling to it. Instead was more of a feeling of hope and a potential for a fast recovery for the world instead of the feeling that everyone bunkering up in Colorado waiting for complete and total collapse of society.Another problem with the ideals spelled out in Atlas Shrugged is that they have helped validate the actions of crony capitalism in todays society and this has indirectly brought moral and financial ruin to our world economy. With a lack of proper regulation and the sense of a moral high ground the financial industry today seems almost justified in immoral behavior. I understand that Ms. Rand does not approve of cronies but what other option does she leave while working under a corrupt system? Are we supposed to feel validated when we see Hank Rearden begrudgingly engage in cronyism and succeed? Of course we are!Lets imagine your the CEO of a national bank, for a moment. Do you engage in crony capitalism and continue to enjoy a comfortable life or do you stick to your morals, refuse to participate and become a sort of wanderer? ...I think if you look at all of the CEOs around, the answer is clear."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There is a reason why college students love this book, join the Objectivist's Club, and then fall into real life and join the political party of their choice. If they truly loved this book, they they will be a Republican. If they hated it, as I did, as I do every one of her books, you will be a Democrat or Democratic Socialist. I was 8 months pregnant when someone gave me this book. I made it to page 753. Then, when the deserving rich have made a commune for themselves in the Rocky Mountains, one of their members discovers a cure for cancer. They decide that the struggling masses of working and unemployed worthlessness that is the rest of the world do not deserve to have this cure (even though the cancers may be caused by the rich's own companies and/or lack of safety devices in factories). At page two, I called my best friend and said \\"This book is a right wing manifesto, right??\\" She said yes and wondered how long I would actually read it. On page 753, I threw the book as hard as I could against the wall. Then I tore it into little pieces. Very little ones. It took a few days. It was far more fun than actually reading it. Look, her basic philosophy is NO government. Man's basic birthright is to make himself happy in any way possible. If that means stepping all over other people, then all the better. The stepped on deserve it! Why didn't they get out of the way, those morons! The basic problem with Rand and with her \\"philosophy\\" (I do not believe her book or her ideas are a complete philosophy. I believe they are conservative masturbation), anyway, as I was saying, the problem is that Rand completely omits the FACT that you cannot, can NEVER omit the link between self and community. The only reason rich people are rich is that there are thousands of people working to keep them that way. The reason poor people stay poor is that there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to keep them that way. I'm not an idiot, I have a Ph.D. in Rhetoric and Social Justice. If you want an innoculation against this horrendous, criminal book, read Paulo Freire'sPedagogy of the Oppressedor Cornel West'sRace MattersorHope on a Tightrope: Word and Wisdom by Cornel Westor evenNIV Pocket Thin New Testament With Psalms & Proverbsby Jesus Christ and other good people. If you are religious and smart, readIntroducing Liberation Theology. Or, just look around you. Think about how you ignore the people who clean your messes up, the people who ring up your purchases, the people who keep the entire infrastructure of the world running. They don't deserve a cure for cancer, but the CEOs of Philip-Morris and Nike do? Please. Go out and commit and act of love today. And just don't read this book, unless your reading is to arm you against those who have read it and believe it. THINK! The book, for me, boils down to this: A huge slap in the face to all working class people in the world. All of them. (working class defined as: people who have only their labor to sell; people who live from paycheck to paycheck; people who have no health insurance; people who cannot afford good education for their children -- not even an apartment in a good district -- people who are not in unions but who do physical labor -- teachers, miners, farmers (not the conglomerate farmers, but single farmers), factory workers, sweatshop workers, secretaries, telemarketers, data entry processors, mailmen, etc., etc., etc.) You or your father and mother or your grandparents were most certainly from the working class. If you are the first person in your family to complete a college degree (B.A.) then your family is working class. If your parents didn't complete high school, they are working class. I could go on, but Rand believes that NONE of these people deserve anything good. She would spit in their faces and use the heel of her boot to grind it in if she could. She is a nightmare human being, good only as a negative example of what NOT TO BE.

When I read it, Atlas Shrugged set my soul on fire. In a world of injustice and irrationality, Atlas Shrugged shows a world of men as they can be and should be. A hymn to the nobility of man's spirit, Atlas Shrugged tells of a beautiful woman who runs a railroad and her quest for an ideal. It tells of an America in which looters and criminals in Washington try to smother the productive men of ability in this country. It tells of one man, who, in order to save the world, had to destroy those whom he loved most. Upholding individualism, reason, and rational selfishness, Atlas Shrugged is not only a philosophical triumph, but a literary one as well. Ayn Rand's 1000-page masterpiece shows such integration, such skill -- every word was written and rewritten until the sound, the meaning, and the meter were not only perfect for the sentence, but for the entire book. Written with unimaginable passion, Atlas Shrugged elicits so much feeling on the part of the reader -- as I read it, certain phrases or sentences made me just lean back, close my eyes, and savor the words on my tongue. Controversial, intellectually challenging, enthralling, exciting, and totally entertaining -- Atlas Shrugged shows Ayn Rand's genius as a writer and her ability as a storyteller.

I matched up Rand's AS with Heinlein's &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; while I was waiting with my army infantry unit for the &quot;ground war&quot; segment of the Gulf War to start. Philosophical treatise wrapped in a novel is a good description of this book. Its a chore but you can separate the book into the categories: the story and the philosophy. As far as the story part of the book is concern it was good if not bloated with the authors delineation of the tenets of &quot;Objectivism&quot;. The characters are interesting and in some cases likable, if not much too black and white. The characters were their work and their work was their mind in its greatest form and glory but not a one of them seemed like they ever had a day off or were having any fun. You wouldnt invite Hank Rearden or Dagny Taggertt to your barbeque because they would be about as much fun as having a party with a bunch of mannequins. As far as the philosophy was concerned I dont see why people have such a Love/Hate relationship with it. Look at it, judge for yourself, take away from it what makes sense to you and move on. I dont know any religion or philosophy that you have to believe 100% of every word as dogma or you discard the whole thing. Some of Rand's philosophy makes sense a bunch doesn't. I like her stand on work and excellence and money. I don't particularly agree with everything she says about charity, social responsibility, self-sacrifice and government. John Galt and Dagny Taggertt would never do the work of Mother Teresa but would you want a world without the likes of Mother Teresa, I wouldn't. Rand is right on with the portrayal of people vilifying the wealthy, regardless of how they got that way. Thats very evident in America today and it I despise it. This is the land of opportunity, if you dont think so travel around, you will see.I dont see the Nazi/fascist/rascist connections everyone gobs off about, Nazism/fascism centers around nationalism and certainly there is no nationalism in the Objectivist world, unless you want to consider the Individual as his/her own nation. Well I'm digressing and diverging so let me wrap this up, the story was interesting and it kept me going through the redundant philosophical delineations. The philosophy itself is somewhat compelling and you should pick through it to find the good stuff, and there is, and decide for yourself. Heinlein is a good counterpart read to this book, there is common ground but they come to different conclusions. Anyone who says this is the worst book they have read or the best book they have read, needs to read more."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read it and see the issues unfold clearly before your eyes. How should man live his life? What political system is best? Should we rely on reason or emotions for guidance? If you take ideas seriously and like to think, this is the book for you. It offers a rational philosophy based not on supernatural revelation or subjective emotion, but on what is and man's ability to discern it - all of which is argued in a superbly integrated and suspenseful story sure to keep you up late many nights in a row. Introduce yourself to the characters you'll wish sat across from you at the office - introduce yourself to a new approach to life"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just graduated from college in Fall 2012, and took the last semester off to relax for the first time in nearly 5 years, and take a breather before beginning graduate school. Being a very libertarian minded individual who is constantly at odds with my more dogmatic peers and professors who tow the party line for (primarily) the Democrats, I was always mad at myself for never taking the time to read this work. I was at the book store around Xmas time wandering aimlessly through the stacks looking for the perfect gift for my brother when I saw this on the shelves and decided to pick it up as a present to myself. In retrospect, It was a very wise decision.Instead of giving you a specific breakdown of content (which has been done fairly eloquently by others in reviews), I will tell you what I was able to pull from the book that I find to be useful. I had an undergrad professor of philosophy once tell me that philosophical works are like a toolbox, meaning you can take from them what you find useful at the that time, and leave behind what you don't. I think much of the problems we have in contemporary America stem from peoples inability to accommodate this perspective. The same old nonsense of \\"as a democrat I must believe in, and support the following platform...\\", and conversely \\"as a Republican, I must believe in and support the following platform...\\" is precisely the type of irrational thinking this book seeks to warn its readers about.I do believe there is inherent danger in giving too much control of our lives to governmental entities or their appointed lackeys. While the narrative of this book is intentionally dramatic and perhaps unrealistic, I think the dangers of governmental interference and its contribution to the possible collapse of the economies of US and the world is a very real and timely threat. The long and sometimes sorted tale of this novel, using a dystopian type of plotting step-up, brings this point across in convincing fashion. It was impossible for me to read this book and not immediately draw parallels and correlations in my mind of current events which bear striking similarities.Many might criticize this work for highlighting the importance of individual achievement vs. their rather lofty notions of collective good. This coupled with the similarly whimsical, contemporarily prevalent notions of \\"greed\\" might also send the same demographic howling in protest. However, when employing a rationalist perspective, the idea of high achievement=high reward , I find to be both intellectually and personally satisfying. This work only reenforced this to me through use of its narrative.The power of the human mind (at least among some of us), to think, reason, plan, and achieve is paramount among John Galt, and various others within the book. Removing these elements from society through the strike, reduces said society to the lowest common denominator. To me, this strikes a particular chord, especially considering that some elements of contemporary society still cling to the stone age notion that labor controls economic forces.This book is a very well written and intriguing journey through a future that may not be as far removed from reality as we might think, and I would highly recommend it to people of any political persuasion. I think there is something here for everyone, and it will challenge political dogma and conventional wisdom at every turn."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I wish i would have read this book when i was in High School. It would have saved me years of being a sheep.This book was written 60 years ago and I am amazed that I hear and read the same lines word for word that were in this book.It spells out exactly what is happening to our world, and one way that it could end up if we let it.If you believe in the greatness that we as a society can be, read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read a lot of books, but since a serious book is a major investment of a person's limited time and energy, I don't like to recommend books, or give them as gifts. Doing so is an impertinence: it's as though the giver knows better how the receiver should be spending his own time. For similar reasons, I never refer to a book as a \\"must read\\". I am quite weary of such over-hyped phrases, along with the word \\"genius\\", and such clich&eacute;'s as \\"breathtaking in its scope\\" and \\"makes you question everything you thought you knew\\".This is unfortunate, since those bromides are the only accurate way to describe Ayn Rand's novel \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Ayn Rand really is the genius of the millennium. Her literary ability really is rivaled only by Shakespeare. She really does make you rethink your fundamental approach to life, particularly human morality. Ayn Rand's epochal ideas really will influence the future to the same degree that the ideas of Aristotle, Jesus, and Newton have influenced the past and present.What are those ideas in a nutshell? They won't fit into a nutshell until after you read the book and digest the ideas for yourself. But I can try to get her viewpoint across by saying that I think that Ayn Rand offers man a new way of life, a new vision of himself. I see her, not as an atheist (although technically she was), but as a secular theist. In effect, she views man as a god, whose life on earth is a sacred end-in-itself, never to be sacrificed. Atlas Shrugged is like a man-worshiping Greek statue put into words.You think that such heavy philosophy can't be a suspenseful read? With any other writer you might be right, but, in fact, Atlas Shrugged is an intensely suspenseful page-turner of a mystery story. You really will enjoy having your fundamental ideas challenged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a well-told work of fiction. However, the reader should be aware that the events in the story, as in any work of fiction, come out as they do because that's how the author wanted the outcome to be. Although Ayn Rand does try hard to make it appear that what happens is the result of logical necessity or of some law of human nature, no such thing is really true.As far as \\"objective\\" merit goes, Ayn Rand's philosophy strikes nearer to true than do many of its rival metaphysics. Objectivism is better than monotheism. And it is also better than socialism. But despite those superiorities, it is flawed, and the flaws are the result of two false premises: (1) the assumption that humans in general are rational actors and (2) the assumption that every form of collectivism is as unnatural and, hence, is as failure-prone as Marxism is.First, people in general are not rational. They never have been, and probably they never will be. On Earth you can find ostensible \\"humans\\" on either side of the borderline of sapience. Humans act, most of the time, on emotion. They form their beliefs because of emotion. Expecting the majority of humans to be, to think, to act rationally so that CAPITALISM will work wonderfully for all who will engage with it constructively is very much like expecting humans to be, to think, to act in such a way that SOCIALISM would work wonderfully well for all who will engage with it constructively.In other words, Rand's advocacy of capitalism contains exactly the same flaw that a Marxist's advocacy of socialism contains. Both she and they imagine that human beings are something other than what they really are. Rand over-estimates the extent to which humans can behave rationally. Marxists over-estimate the extent to which humans can be made to behave altruistically.Second, although elsewhere (e.g. The Virtue of Selfishness) Ayn Rand deplores the deceptive use of the \\"package deal\\" argument, she uses it herself. Rand casually throws together into one category collectivism of every form. But there are important differences between one basis for collectivism and another. And those differences matter because they result in some forms of collectivism working better in practice, as judged over millennia of recorded history, than certain others do.How many readers of Atlas Shrugged thought that the maliciousness of Hank Rearden's brother and mother were just a bit over the top? That their manipulative ways were somewhat too extreme to be plausible for a family? That was my impression, too. It is a family without maternal or filial love. When Ayn Rand wrote those characters, she did it with the intention of setting the family in the same category as Marxism. And the two definitely do not belong together, even though both are forms of collectivism.That package-dealing identifies Ayn Rand as a perpetrator of philosophical fraud, for she cannot have been so ignorant as to have done it by mistake.Two hundred million years ago, species were competing with each other for survival, and the main advantages were strength and ferocity. For a very long time, more power meant larger size. The big dinosaurs could overpower (and eat) the smaller dinosaurs. But at some point, about 100 million years ago, nature found a limit with that strategy. Because, you see, strength increases in proportion to the square of body size, whereas weight increases in proportion to the cube of body size. There's a size that is best for useable strength in land creatures, and, once evolution had made creatures that large, there was just no point in making them bigger, since bigger would be weaker.Evolution never stops finding ways for life to compete, and by 60 million years ago, it had found its alternative: intelligence. But whereas reptile babies hatch with enough survival programming for some of them to get past the hazards of their environment, infants of an intelligent species are relatively helpless when they are born. There is just no telling how many times species with intelligence appeared, only to die out because they would not act collectively, would not guard each other, and left their young exposed, just as the reptiles had always done.But, fortunately, nature's blind experiments with life found a remedy, a behavioral patch that would make collective action possible for creatures having a sufficiently strong mutual biological relationship. The patch was a new emotion, which we call love, and which at first was an emotional attachment of a mother for her children. Subsequently, males would begin to feel it, too, and their behavior would change so that the mother and their children would be better protected, better sheltered, better provided for. (Specifically, the children must be his or the biological basis for collectivism wouldn't be strong enough.)And, gradually, the biological basis of love became somewhat broader, so that creatures came to favor their brothers, and then their cousins, above those who weren't related in any important degree. The Arabs have an expression that summarizes it well. \\"Me against my brothers, me and my brothers against the tribe, me-my-brothers-and-our-tribe against the neighboring tribes,\\" and so on. The strength of the collective bonds created by love vary in proportion to the degree of biological relatedness.And that's where racism comes from. It's a simple, evolutionary extension of the family feeling. When Ayn Rand called racism \\"the LOWEST form of collectivism,\\" she was quite, quite wrong. It is the highest, the most natural, and the most workable form of collectivism. It is a form that should not be packaged-dealed with Marxism. A dog with an empty supper dish is, after all, more like unto a dog with a full supper dish than unto a cat with an empty supper dish.The proper measure of man is what he is, not what he owns, and certainly not what he has been \\"licensed\\" to use.So be aware, as you thrill to the story in Atlas Shrugged, that Rand's philosophy contains a flaw, a hole, from which you can draw some incredible loads of reasonable-sounding, yet false, conclusions about the nature of man and about the proper organization of human society."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think it probably was a good read but it was so-o-o heavy that I just didn't enjoy it.

Almost finished with it though."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had long wanted to read this book, and my interest was rekindled after seeing the first movie. Having finally completed the task, I find myself feeling underwhelmed.I quickly tired of reading the endlessly rehashed philosophy. Every character was only too willing to launch into a pages-long exposition in the dryest professorial language. And after finally reaching the book's climax, what do you get? Yet another rehash--the longest yet to boot. This drains most of the entertainment value out of the fictional narrative surrounding the preaching. This is a shame, because I mostly agreed with the philosophy. Which made it all the more disappointing to find myself so thoroughly bored at reading material I was largely on board with.I was a little surprised, especially after reading that the author had grown up during the communist takeover of Russia, to see how lightly she treats the villains in her story. While evil, they are mostly inept, and entirely unfamiliar with the methods all historical socialist regimes have used to maintain control. The military and the police are almost unmentioned. It leaves you with a strange theoretical world where capitalism trumps communism (as it naturally does). But in the real world communism is held in place through the brutal application of force. I had a difficult time suspending my disbelief to the point of accepting the odd limp-wristed approach to control of Rand's government.The weird emotional state of the heroes also stands out. Sometimes they're like robots, or someone just replaced by the Body Snatchers. Other times they are overflowing with wild mixes of feelings that only make it to the surface in a glance or flick of the eyes that every like-minded character immediately understands perfectly. Yet somehow not a single character in the book knows exactly what they're feeling. You could make a drinking game out of the number of times a character literally \\"can't identify\\" the emotion they're currently experiencing. To be safe, you should stretch the drinking out over a few days.A much shorter, edited version would be a good thing. Maybe the movies will accomplish that. In a world hell-bent on ignoring the destruction wreaked by socialism across the globe, Atlas Shrugged could maybe help to open a few eyes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is still a great read that refutes the failed progressive policies that seek to undermine the importance of personal responsibility."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What is it about this book that makes the people want to praise it to the skies or condemn it...whoever did read this book (at least all the 50 odd people I know who read it) never remained non-commital about it.Even if you are not seeking out Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy, this book makes you think.

Ultimately, the crux of her argument seems to be this: fiscal conservatives can live apart from disconsolate liberals; liberals, however, would be lost in a wilderness of despair and hunger without the beneficent presence of liberterians to show them the way to the 'promised land.' It is an interesting thesis, and has provoked much discussion, as evidenced by the tome's popular acclamation. I, myself, ponder the consequences of, say, dividing America into two distinct spheres: one embracing supply-side economics, the other totally immersing itself into the quicksand of socialistic policies. One need only compare the fates of the United States and the now defunct U.S.S.R to divine the answer.My sole point of disputation with regard to her compelling thesis is her anathema to all things religious. Rand, through her characters, expresses her conviction that religion is basically for 'suckers', an oppressive tool for subduing the masses. Most Liberterians seem to espouse similar sentiments.Yet, as an aspiring J.D. candidate here in Virginia, my studies have revealed that atomistic 'capitalism' did not emerge on its own, it was not conceived with 'malice aforethought.' No 'big bang' here, my friends! Capitalism/Individualism is an offshoot of Christian principles. The most palpable principle being that man is made in God's image, and therefore, as an individual, his life is not to be taken from him without some sort of due process owed to him by his government. The protection of lIberty and property as inalienable rights flow from this principle.In Roman and Greek society, there was no concept of subjective, individual rights as we understand them in modern Western civilization-- a civilization steeped in Christian ideals. Atomism, per se, traces its roots back to Paul's doctrine of evangelical liberty. In the centuries to follow,as Europe became increasingly Christianized, Franciscans, Dominicans, and Calvinists would argue whether life, liberty, and property were inalienable gifts from God. Ultimately, they were all christened as such. (Dec. of Independence)Ultimately, as evidenced above, liberterianism, as a political philosophy, has as its foundation, Christianity. Is it no small coincidence that subjective individual liberties have not emerged in China, India, and other non-Christian nations? So, let us not be too quick in dismissing the value of religion. As Russell Kirk eloquently stated, &quot;culture begins with the cult.&quot;With regard to the book itself, it is an interesting, thought-provoking read. I recommend it to your liberal friends."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think that the 600 reviews that are here say enough.

True, the characters are one-dimensional. True, events are contrived to prove a point. True, it's hard to believe in such a &quot;black and white&quot;, &quot;good or bad&quot; world with no gray areas.BUT...this book is the starting point for truly intellectual thought concerning the state of capitalism and the steady stealthy growth of socialism in the United States. If you find that Republicans and Democrats are confusing and unclear, Ayn Rand will explain it all to you. By the end of the 1000 pages you will understand her point very loud and very clear: individual liberty is being compromised and too many people are just letting it happen because they don't know any better. This book, though flawed, woke me up to the injustices of our &quot;welfare state&quot; and how the problem of poverty can really be solved.Ayn Rand is not right about everything. Having grown up in a totalitarian society, she developed very extreme views which do not all apply to the United States today. However, reading this book is a joy for the vivid picture it creates of a much too large government that, under the guise of &quot;social justice&quot;, takes apart the most free nation in the world and impoverishes its people.Love it or hate it, it will make you THINK.

Although I can't say I agree fully with the late Mrs. Rand's view, I can say that her philosophy is sound and noncontradictory. The simple plot and noncomplexity of the characters is what makes this book easy reading, the highly developed theme and philosophy make the book enjoyable and rewarding at the same time. It forced purpose into my life and inspired me to work hard at everything I do, and save time by doing only doing what I deem to be necessary.

Admittedly the characters are a little black and white; there is a very clear distinction between the good guys and the bad. Overall, though, I loved the story and I had found myself having strong emotional responses to their actions-a sign that the author has done a good job. The book was rather long but I found that it did an amazing job of keeping my interest. (This coming from a person that shies away from books of half the length.) Ms. Rand is pretty clear about the message she wants to deliver in Atlas shrugged. For the most part, the extent to which a reader buys into her message will be proportionate to how much you enjoy the book. Many themes are repeated but they do serve a purpose. I personally found the \\"So you think money is the root of all evil?\\" speech to be magnificent. In all honesty, I did skip over a 30-page speech toward the end; it got to be a little much. I general though, if you keep an open mind I think you'll enjoy the book and you may very well find that it changes your out-look on life. I can honestly say it's changed my view of my place in the world for the better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely.

The ideas behind Rand's philosophy are the focal point of the novel. These theories are indeed difficult for the village idiot to understand. However, for those of you with a higher level of intelligence, you will be able to make an adamant opinion of its context. You will either love it or you'll hate it. There is no middle ground. If you live in a world where one man's goal is another man's happiness, this book is not for you. If you are more concerned with yourself above others, I suggest you read it. The idea of selfishness expresed in the book is often taken the wrong way. There for, you must decide the thickness of your skin. If you tend to see only what lies directly in front of you, you will find this book absurd only because it seems harsh. If you are a firm believer in &quot;God&quot;, this book is not for you and I highly suggest you listen to that bit of advice. It will question your beliefs and few enjoy the denial of their reason to live.Atlas Shrugged is, in my mind, the greatest book I have ever read. It is not for everyone.

It is a book espousing a life philosophy, but it portrays the philosophy against the backdrop of an industrial love story. The story line is pretty good, but the real reason to read the book is to understand a philosophy that has become a classic and created a cult following.Atlas Shrugged is a thousand plus page book that is tedious at times, especially the first third of the book. The dialog, culture, and technical details are straight from the 1950's when the book was written, and Ayn Rand makes no attempt to make the book timeless in this sense. Sometimes the dialog reads as one would expect people to speak in a Humphrey Bogart movie. Detailed descriptions of clothing, drinking, and smoking are very much postwar United States. Rand puts many industrial details into the novel story line. These perceptions are from a time when steel and railroads ruled the United States. For readers under 40 it may be hard to imagine such a time. Again, these are not reasons to avoid the book, only understand that there may be an extra effort required to look past those dated references to see the philosophical story.The story itself becomes more and more interesting as Rand throws one amazing twist after another. You won't find yourself saying &quot;I know what is going to happen next.&quot; If you do, you will probably be wrong. Ultimately your enjoyment of the book will probably depend on your political persuasion at the outset. Persons already leaning toward Ayn Rand's philosophy are ecstatic at finding an author who has qualified many viewpoints with philosophical logic and a real life situation. At the same time her very rigid and comprehensive life philosophy will turn off others.To describe Ayn Rand's philosophy, now referred to as objectivism, would be to give the book away. Suffice to say that the philosophy is perhaps even more relevant in today's society than it was 45 years ago. Cult groups have emerged on the Internet to discuss the philosophy. There is even an official web site run by Ayn Rand's executor. Once you read this book you will be able to converse with those at parties who like to drop names such as Ayn Rand when you casually say &quot;Yeah, I read that.&quot; It really is an undertaking and a journey."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is inspirational and motivational.It is a literary work that everybody should be exposed to.

It is up to the reader to agree or disagree adopt or reject the ideas presented.For all the reviews I have read on Amazon this is my first submission because I felt so strongly that the book was misrepresented, if you have come this far....&quot;click to buy&quot;.It has influenced my thoughts, my reasoning and the way I live life. :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book cannot be read without creating strong feelings either for or against Ayn Rand's philosopy.For some, like myself, it is inspiring as you get a chance to envision what the world could be like.

It is true that one may never encounter such a man as John Galt or such a woman as Dagny Taggart, that does not mean the characters are impossible (they were not infallible); but characters full of nothing but compromise, characters with no firm principles - philosophical drifters - will provide no firm philosophical ground, but rather quick sand - this is why Rand did not base Atlas around characters who were half & half. In a compromise between good and evil, it is only the evil that has anything to gain; life has nothing to gain from death. Hank Readen has nothing to gain from Orren Boyle.Rand wrote as a Romanticist, \\"not with things as they are, but with things as they might be and ought to be.\\"---Galt's speech is long, because it is meant to be a summary of the philosophy presented in the book, that which came to be the base of Objectivism. It is unlikely that a first time reader of Atlas will be able to digest and retain all the philosophical points made throughout the first 850 or so pages, and that is why the speech is there. One will have read the philosophical points in an understandable / demonstratable context presented in 'human situations' earlier in the book, and then with Galt's speech, be presented with the specific conceptualization of the situations. That is, many aspects of the philosophy presented in the first 850 pages, are presented through actions, Galt's speech puts the actions into words. It is essentially taking all the actions / human interactions / events / etc. and removing them, and taking the philosophical statements that those actions represented, and putting them into a speech.---Someone previously stated that Rand regards most of humanity as a 'herd', this is completely false. Rand did not use collectivist terms, such as 'herd', to describe a number of individuals. She was an individualist, and as such, was strongly against collectivism and its many forms.---As accurately stated by Leonard Peikoff:\\"Ayn Rand is to Aristotle what Kant is to Plato. Both sides of the perennial duel, in their pure form, have finally been made explicit. Kant's philosophy is Platonism without paganism. Ayn Rand's philosophy is Aristotelianism without Platonism.\\"---Regarding Atlas, many of the negative comments are about 'one dimensional' characters; I have yet to see a review explain exactly how the characters are one dimensional.There was also a comment that Rand's philosophy morphed from being 'about excellence' in The Fountainhead to being 'about making money' in Atlas. This implies that there need be some seperation between the two, this is false; if it were true, then only those who are financially successful could be mediocre, and only those who were financially unsuccessful could be brilliant. Atlas takes the individualist focus in The Fountainhead, and completely integrates it on a wider scale (to cover many characters, interacting with a focus on the economic system). Atlas is about business, capitalism (and thus freedom) vs socialism/collectivism/etc. The Fountainhead is about the oppression of individualism, Atlas is about the oppression of individualism with the display of the very wide ramifications of such. Howard Roark did not work without pay, he specifically wanted to be paid to do his excellent work. Henry Rearden did not want to produce / innovate *just* for money, he specifically wanted to create the best metal (it is shown that he loved his work, and strived toward the creation of the best product possible), knowing full well that if his product was the best (given the situation is a free market economy), it meant he had a tremendous opportunity to try and make money off of his product...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The best book I have ever read. In practical terms: it rekindles my spirit for living, which had unknowingly diminished over the years (I am 37 y.o.) - it helps me regain my original work ethic and explains why I allowed it diminish - it explains some of my marital...challenges - and it allows me, once again, to be unashamed of excelling. A good mystery, yes, but it is Ayn's original philosophy explained using concrete characters and events that sells this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn may not be a literary genius, but her ideas have genuine merit. Many of her characters are paralleled in the conservatives of today who are tired of being dragged down by close minded bureaucrats who want only power and money and misuse their authority to get it rather than do the job they were put in place to do. I've read most of the reviews just to get a feel for the opinions of others who have also read this book. If you are a socialist liberal democrat (or just a democrat since they are the same) you will hate this book! It is not for those who think that society owes them a handout when they have not earned it themselves! On the otherhand, if you feel that you should achieve for the sake of doing your best at something (rather than being a parasite off of those who are the best) and that you deserve to the reap the rewards for your achievements with limited government intervention or extortion in the form of taxes, fees, and regulations; then you will love this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of my top 5 books, but I can understand those that hate it. If you cannot tolerate criticism of religion, stay clear. Some have pointed out that there are &quot;better&quot; philosophical books, and criticize this for being a novel. True. For myself, I am always interested in book that have a lot of people that love it. I imagine that Ayn would have understood that any artistic endeavor that addresses morals and is loved will also be hated. Atlas Shrugged is clearly a milepost that will be discussed for a long time. You may love it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand captures the readers attention at the outset of the story and never lets you go. Nearly impossible to put the book down. I have personally read the book 7 times and am looking forward to an eighth."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book several times and am constantly amazed at how much each read awakens my mind. The characters are extremely inspirational, and she does a fabulous job of showing the reader how complex and everyday concepts like love, freedom, evil, etc. exist in reality. (I mention this because one of the many important points the book makes is the importance of words/concepts being used accurately to describe reality---not 'floating abstractions' that cannot be built up from sensory perception.) People use abstract words constantly and yet often don't really know the meaning of these words---yet they believe in them and use them to form conclusions and shape their lives (and the lives of others).Many people feel that the book is too long, but I disagree because it deals with reality, which includes everything---how long should a book be that addresses everything? It definitely has philosophical approach to the plot and makes me think of all of those \\"philosphical\\" class-room discussions about philosophy and how silly they were compared to this book (e.g., brain-in-a-vat, how do you know such-n-such, etc.). This book is what philosophy SHOULD be, not irrelavent brain-teasers that belong in novelty books.I have always been centered in reality and find that this book approaches reality in the same way I do---by reason. (It's filled with intense emotion both by the characters and ellicited from the reader.)I think it's definitely one of the top 5 books in human history (and written so recently!). The reason I say 'top 5' is because I haven't read all the books and I'm allowing for the possibility for others to be as important (e.g., Principia?)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a book that one either loves, hates, or just plain doesn't understand. It has been my experience that those who wholeheartedly agree with Rand's philosophy LOVE this book, while those who do not believe in free-market capitalism hate both Ayn Rand and her books. So much for objectivity!!!All too often people rate a book such as this based upon the philosophy it espouses, and not its literary merits. Well, I'll try to do both.As a philosopher, Rand is for the most part dead-on. However, there is nothing very original or groundshaking offered here. Two hundred years earlier Adam Smith said very much the same things in &quot;Wealth of Nations.&quot;Yes, self-interest is good for everyone. Why? According to Smith, an individual operating in a free-market who seeks to further his or her own interest must inevitably serve the interest of the market (other people); therefore, selfishness is indeed a virtue. Money, then, is only a measure of the value contributed to others (the market). So, if a person is wealthy, and did not acquire that wealth in some fraudulent or criminal way, then that wealthy person must therefore have contributed more value to society. Again, all of this requires a free-market.In &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, all characters are in fact caricatures. They only exist on the extreme ends of the producer/parasite spectrum. Rand does this to make her point, but I've already seen &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and prefer a little more subtlety.As the book's literary merits... I won't lie to you. Reading &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is about as much fun as a trip to the dentist--particularly if you already agree with its philosophy. I am an avid reader, given to long bouts of reading very boring, technical material. Still, I found it incredibly difficult to finish &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; It's best taken in small doses."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"But I think it's important to view it in the proper context. Personally I admire many of the goals of liberals. Unfortunately in practical terms many of their ideas are not very well thought through. And in my personal life I try to be as giving and helpful as possible. But when it comes to fiscal, economic, and political issues most liberals can't see the forrest for the trees.This book really solidified many feelings that I had but couldn't articulate. Man's mind being his own, the right to do as one pleases, and most importantly the right to be free and not a slave. And you can be a slave without shackles. Not as deplorable a situation but inhibiting nonetheless.The book extolls the virtues of work. Any form of work. But it gives deserved emphasis to the truly creative and intelligent leaders among us who are greatly responsible for our collective prosperity and productivity.The writing is just beautiful. I can still remember reading the scene where Dagny is riding the train cross country with the wind in her hair. Truly romantic and inspiring. And the mystery of Galt carries the story along from it's prophetic opening to its' ultimate climax.I firmly believe that each of us as individuals should endeavor to help our fellow man as much as we possibly can. It is another matter entirely to be forced to do so against ones will. But our choice to do so or not is a matter between us and our creator. Period. No one else has the right to impose their beliefs on another individual or require that they work to serve any interests other than their own or the interests of those they choose to bestow their blessings upon. Choose being the optimum word.I believe that governments role should be at its core singular in purpose. To protect the rights of the individual. And I think that a distinction needs to be made between equality of results and equality of opportunity. I'm stongly support the concept of equality of opportunity but I could care less about equality of results. As long as there is true equality of opportunity then I say let the chips fall where they may. Where opportunity has been unfairly denied then I would applaud any means to remedy the situation.We should not forget however that we are all sprung from the same well and should view ourselves as brothers and sisters rather than friends and foes. There is a commonality the connects us all and yet we are all individuals. We should be free to act as such."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having been altruistic and naive for all my 41 years of life, Atlas Shrugged has changed my life and for the better. Experiencing ignorance and stupidity pushing the men of minds out of political offices and the school system in my hometown, Ann Rand has given me the reasons why it is happening. She does not give me an answer of what to do about it except to not agree with the stupidity. She has shown me the majority is not always right.How enlightening it is to hear that it's okay to make money and not give it to the moochers who refuse to work. On a daily basis I have moochers begging me for money and begging me to charge their purchases only to have them never pay me back. I used to feel guilty for not giving what they wanted and NOW I don't care! They can go work just like the rest of us.I do feel that Ayn Rand doesn't answer some questions that need to be answered in Atlas Shrugged but maybe I'll find them in her other publications."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"WARNING-- PLOT POINTS GIVEN AWAY. IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK YET, YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS REVIEW.Oh boy. What to say about this one. How about, first, that it's 1070 pages long. I was reading it on the train one day, and a guy leaned over and said, \\"That is really small type.\\" This is Rand's opus, the culmination of her philosophy, Objectivism. I can picture her, after the success of The Fountainhead, walking into her publisher and saying, \\"Here it is. Don't cut any of it. Publish it just like this or not at all.\\" Included in this 1070 pages, about 950 pages in, as the climax, is a FIFTY PAGE speech by the hero about the evils of socialism. It reads more like a bad thesis at that point. Here's a sentence: \\"Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral wilderness, you dare not fully to be evil, or fully to live.\\" Now imagine that for fifty pages. I was furious at that point. The arrogance of something like that... Get off it. Please.Basically, her philosophy boils down to a justification for selfishness. Her characters are static, the \\"heroes\\" extol her philosophy in dragging, unrealistic monologues, and the \\"villains\\" are so unbelievably evil and stupid that they're little more than paper targets. I really liked the story early on. I was into it for the first 700 pages or so. I liked the characters, thought they were admirable and heroic. I liked the arguments between people, the clashes of logic and intelligent debates. But the more I understood her philosophy, the more I despised the book. The only character I thought was moral ends up losing his mind, sobbing on a railroad track in the end. But then again, he wasn't moral according to Objectivism, because he was actually a loyal, caring, kind man.As for the plot: Basically, as America's leaders turn to Socialism, a group of America's greatest thinkers withdraw themselves to a hidden Utopia, refusing to have their genius taken advantage of by the \\"looters.\\" One by one they vanish from society to join this Utopia, until in the end only one is left. The thing that kept me reading was to see whether or not this last person was going to give up and vanish like the others (which I equated to a kind of suicide) or fight against the government. I won't ruin it, but I was not happy with the ending. Oh, and get this. In order to get into this Utopia, you have to vow: \\"I swear that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another to live for mine.\\" Basically, any kind of Good Samaritanism, Christian moral values (or pick any religion, except maybe Scientology), are in complete opposition to the ideals of Objectivism. Yeah. Sounds like a great way to build a better world. Every genius for himself.A word of warning in reading the reviews. This book topped a \\"Reader's List\\" alternative to the National Library's list of the top 100 books. Also atop that list were other Ayn Rand books and a bunch of L. Ron Hubbard books. That might tell you something about the slanted reviews you'll get about this book. Although believers in Objectivism don't strike me as the same cultists as Scientologists, there is certainly an element of belief that everything Ayn Rand ever wrote was genius scripture. It's not. From a literary viewpoint, or a philosophical one.

Atlas Shrugged was by far the longest, most excruciatingly boring book I have ever read in my life. (And by \\"longest\\" I don't just mean page numbers, but that it took forever to read because it was so bad). I read a lot, and a lot of different things, but this book was absolutely dreadful.The story itself takes place in a \\"futuristic\\" (for the 50s) time and focuses mainly on Dagny Taggart, the heiress and vice president to a transcontinental railroad. Along with her, our other big characters are fellow billionaires Francisco D'Anconia and Hank Rearden, as well as her assistant/friend Eddie. Aside from them and one or two others, pretty much the entire world is nothing but freeloaders. The world economy is tanking hard, because the world has given way to a socialist brand of thinking. In this society everyone is \\"equal\\" and must get the same thing as the next guy, even if he didn't work for it. Achievement of any sort has lost its appeal, as anyone who is good at anything ends up being overworked, underpaid, and a cash cow to the lazy, freeloading masses. So we go through this story following the plight of the poor persecuted billionaires... Notice how those words just don't look right together?To begin with, this book is too long, and I mean WAY too long. It's over 1000 pages, and at least half of it could have been cut out or condensed and still made the same point. Heck, 2/3 of it could have been cut and it still would have made the same point! Its length made it so laborious to read that it's the most unpleasant literary experience I've ever had. This book is such ridiculous propaganda it's painful and almost insulting. It's pretty clear why this is the wealthy conservative's go-to book when they complain about not wanting to pay high taxes. Rand equates caring about someone's feelings or self-esteem as being a complete wimp and weakling. What's even more disturbing is that she seems to imply that anyone who does not think like her (i.e. Dagny and her friends) doesn't even have \\"real\\" feelings! It makes someone saying their \\"needs\\" or \\"rights\\" to something...which they very well might need, should NEVER be handed to them no matter how desperate they are. You know, because the elderly, disabled, ill and children need to work for every little thing just like everyone else! People who ask for help are just lazy, dumb freeloaders who want a meal ticket! It's disgusting how the book portrays anyone poor as lazy and incompetent. The morals of this book annoyed me so much I almost wish there was a society that worked like this while Rand was alive, just so she could see how it WOULDN'T work.Even with all this the book isn't ALL bad. Despite her appalling political opinions Rand is a good writer, but nothing that interesting happened in this story until 650 pages in. While I also must say I disagree with the morals presented, there are some valid points, such as: people often feels better about themselves if they've earned what they have, people shouldn't be kept on in a job or paid a high wage if they don't do well, people have a right to wealth they have earned, and competition is necessary for society to flourish. All in all, this book was a boring, unpleasant experience, and I only managed to finish it through sheer determination. It's got a twisted sense of values and a moral/point to the story that makes me want to kick it across the room. So...only read it if you have to."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't read very fast, so this took a real commitment. It's really scary how this book reads just like today's headlines, only written 55 years earlier. Rand writes a good book, but sure goes to the extreme in &#34;describing&#34; things. Adds a lot of fluff. Enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Long read, but mostly very engaging. Some of the monologues drug on in a preachy way, but overall the book was great. I found it interesting that there were multiple instances of the book's politicians sounding eerily similar to our politicians today.

It was so relevant and poignant to current events (I read it in the early \`80's) that I marveled it had been written in the \`50's. Objectivism is \\"the concept of man as heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" Beautifully written and portrayed, and many arguments powerfully made. Besides absolutely glorifying in the human spirit I enjoyed other aspects of the book; guilt as a debilitating power, mediocrity as more powerfully destructive than evil, and the essential beauty and necessity of capitalism. And finally, the incredible passion and energy unleashed by a human's spirit freed.Certainly Rand's image of man approaching G~d with his head held high and his arms held wide is instinctively alluring and powerfully consistent with Spinoza.So much has been written about this great book that I'll keep this review short; some have said it's tortuously long. Worse, some say it's a philosophy of \`selfishness.' Get over it and read it and internalize it. And the next time someone begins talking about yet larger government, or post-modernism, tell them to read the book. Enough said."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are two distinct issues to judge when reviewing a work such as Atlas Shrugged. Since it is a presentation of serious philosophical ideas, particularly in politics and economics, it must be judged on the merit of the ideas espoused. Since it is a novel, it must also be judged on its artistic merit.The economics and politics presented in Atlas, as well as the underlying ethics, are radical. The book exemplifies time and again that there is no \\"happy medium\\" between good and evil, between freedom and tyranny, between truth and fraud. \\"My truth may be different from your truth\\", Atlas leaves no room for that. Ayn Rand presents her understanding of the good, and gives no apology. That alone is enough to enrage people in the typical 20th and 21st century mindset, where certainty itself is widely accepted to be impossible and the manifestation of certainty synonymous with unacceptable arrogance.Certainty, however, is an inseparable part of the philosophy presented in Atlas. That reality is what it is, whether you agree with her or not, is the basic principle Ayn Rand builds her whole system on. If two people disagree, one of them must be wrong - there are no contradictions in reality.Atlas makes clear that individualism is the only proper form of moral and economic evaluation by showing, in detail, the effects of various public policies enacted for \\"the common good\\" on actual people. Whether you agree with Ayn Rand's wider generalizations or not, it is undeniable that the cause-consequence chains she uses to illustrate each point are sound.The political and economic policy advocated implicitly in Atlas Shrugged, resulting from the ethical and methodological principles mentioned above, were not new even when the book was published. In terms of politics, the Founding Fathers of the United States defended pretty much the same principles in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.In economics, the same sort of policies had been identified as positive by Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations (Bantam Classics)) and others, the fundamental reasons for their validity explained in detail in Carl Menger'sPrinciples of Economics (The Institute for Humane Studies series in economic theory)(also freely available online) and the fundamental errors in thinking that lead to opposing theories scathingly exposed by Frederic Bastiat in works such asEconomic Fallacies.There is less that is new in the policy advocated in Atlas as there are a compelling illustration of those truths in the story and characters, an integrated, structured argument for the validity of the principles underlying those policies, and an unabashed expression of absolute certainty in them. What is groundbreaking is the proof that those ideas are fundamentally right, not simply something that seems to work out.The ideas, however, remain as true today as they were when the book was originally published. It takes an active mind to identify parallels between the 1950s setting and today - but the parallels are there, and in force.Artistic judgment must keep that intellectual framework in mind. Atlas is not a novel about balance and compromise, it is about certainty and truth. You will find no \\"flawed heroes\\" or \\"virtuous villains\\" in this work. It is unsurprising that so many criticize Atlas' characters as \\"shallow\\". They do not conform to today's standard of \\"interesting\\", but that standard is exactly what Atlas was meant to challenge.Atlas is also not a novel about moral redemption or forgiveness. It is a novel that illustrates the philosophical fact that reality is causal, not forgiving. Ayn Rand develops her characters, both good and evil, by leading them to the ultimate consequences of their fundamental convictions. Her characters learn and act on their knowledge - but they don't change their essence midcourse.Most of the negative artistic criticism, therefore, results from not realizing that to make the points Atlas was intended to make its characters could not be \\"interesting\\" by current standards. Further understanding shows that those standards are the result of the same intellectual subjectivism and moral relativism that Atlas Shrugged frontally challenges.Some artistic criticism, however, is valid. The work is very long and some philosophical points are relentlessly hammered on throughout the story. The much mentioned 60 page speech completely disrupts the flow of the narrative. Such are the compromises inherent in presenting philosophical theory by the means of a novel.Personally, I consider Ayn Rand's other great novel to be her best, artistically. I recommend new readers start withThe Fountainheadfor that reason. And, if the novels spark an interest in the underlying philosophy,Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand (The Ayn Rand Library, Volume 6)is the place to look for a complete summation of Objectivism in a non-fiction format."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged shows that the beginning of the end happens when mediocre people turn to the government to make things \\"fair\\" for them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"READ THIS BOOK, BUT...I'm quoting Stephen Chbosky in the review title, although when he mentioned Ayn Rand in his book he was referring to her other popular novel, The Fountainhead. He has a good point.Opinionated people of all political and social types will tell you that Ayn Rand must be loved or hated, believed or disbelieved, revered or loathed. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Ayn Rand is very much an extremist, with a talent for (purposefully or not) persuading others to agree with her. In fact, such persuasion goes against some of her own principles: that the human being must depend upon HIS OWN reason to exist. Read the book with this in mind, and you will get far--agree or disagree, but do so based on your own logic and experience, not on some misguided belief that the author must be taken \\"all or nothing\\".Since this is the type of book that infuriates people, it should be read. This is my opinion. It is important to know the beliefs of the loudest extremists in order to be well-informed and so accurately find your own position somewhere in the middle. Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky and Marx and Voltaire cannot, any of them, be taken indiscriminately. That would be a plagiarism of opinion, which I think is a basic sin. But all of these authors should be read. If one is going to aspire to the title of intellectual, or even if he simply wants to think about issues, he must be exposed to all ends of the spectrum.Remember (this seems to get lost in all the debate)--Atlas Shrugged is a NOVEL, not a work of nonfiction. Ideas completely aside, this is an amazing book and a milestone in modern American literature. The writing is superb; the characters well-thought-out and INTERESTING (though I am inclined to think people like these cannot exist; Rand actually counters this, somewhat unconvincingly, in the Forward); the dialogue, description, plot and language are very powerful. Maturing writers could do worse than read Ayn Rand simply for her writing. (This is particularly impressive since English is Rand's second language.) The quality of the writing makes reading the (lengthy) book a worthwhile use of time whether or not the reader agrees with the ideas presented in it. Just don't let Rand's agreeable fluency alone sway you to her way of thinking.Read this book. It is fascinating and well worth your time, and as I have mentioned the writing is fantastic. Go into it with an open mind. But be a filter, not a sponge."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"At first I was not sure I would enjoy this book. It seemed like a cold war propaganda story against socialism. It is set in the USA with the decline of individual rights. The \\"People\\" are what matters not the individual. Of course now we have a lot of individual rights and more than ever the ability to get rich and stay rich as individuals in the US.However lets look at this instead if it was in Russia or Palestine. Places where if you succeed, the government will take what you have created for the people (and their pockets). That is unless you play ball with their political agenda. If you think about other places as where this story is based, then it really feels relevant. You will understand why there are so many people willing to die to enter the USA and other free countries."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whatever you think of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; as a work of literature or a work of philosophy, there is no arguing away its massive and enduring connection with its readers. The book is not assigned in schools, and yet it has been a continuously strong seller for 47 years now despite its daunting bulk and lengthy sermonizing. Obviously, there is something in it that speaks to people.Many here would say that it merely flatters the adolescent reader (whatever their age) and their sense of themselves as an unappreciated but superior person. There is a large grain of truth in that, and I think only a die-hard Randian would feel the need to dispute it.But there's another way of looking at that. One could just as easily say that it pays tribute to humanity's desire to better itself. And Rand did say so herself, with what must have been wearying frequency.The novel is written with the crude emphaticness of allegory. (You will never need to wait to find out whether a character is one of the good guys or the bad guys.) The critics don't seem to mind that when they encounter it in &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot;. But that style is very out of fashion now, and it opens the book to, in my opinion, determinedly wrong-headed criticisms of its &quot;flat&quot; characters and &quot;stagy&quot; dialogue. Those who complain that it isn't written like &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; are saying in effect (to borrow C.S. Lewis's phrase): &quot;Of course I don't like brown cheese. It isn't dry sherry.&quot;As for the book's notorious philosophy, I think it futile to deny that, in its purest form, it is equally unworkable and unattractive. The same can be said of Plato's &quot;The Republic&quot;, of course, so that is perhaps a soft indictment. The real point is that there are legitimate and unsettling ideas to be reckoned with here.And for what it's worth: I used to believe in socialism. After I read this book, I didn't any more."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For people who had unanswered questions from the fountainhed I highly recommend thgat they read this book. For that, as stated by Ayn Rand, is the purpose of this novel. The main idea of the fountainhead was egoism, while Atlas shugged goes more in detail with the root of objectivism, which is reason.The novel was beautifully written and has great detail and fairly good plot. She does a great job of telling each of her characters' stories' and then intertwining(may be misspelled) them into one. In all actuality, Dagny is a much more likable and easier understood heroine than Dominique. All the main characters generally have more depth and are better developed(than the ones in the fountainhead). They have more emotion while at the same time still managing to be logical, thinking beings with strength and endurance. Many authors, in attempting to give their character depth make the mistake of portraying them with too much emotion, ultimately depicting them as whiny or wimpy crybabies. Ayn Rand does not make that mistake and keeps a good balance between emotion and logic. Some stated that the characters were too cold and distant. It is not that they were cold, it is just that they thought before they felt and knew the reason behind their emotions whereas most feel blindly and put feelings before their logical mind. All of it comes down to reason, which is the essence of her characters and the story.A 'flaw' as some believe, is the fact that the book is extremely long(a little more than 1000 pages)and needed to be edited. Although I found myself putting it down from time to time before continuing (misspelled, sorry) , I believe that statement to be false. Maybe someone who is moderately slow reader or one who gets bored easily with reading would believe that to be a flaw.This book, had it been edited would not have served its purpose, for every event leads up the main idea of the book. All of the details and quotes are relavent and necessary in order to understand the overall ideas and views. Only one who cannot connect and relate them to the main idea may think that some of the events should be cut out. But my point is, don't let the length scare you away or hold you back.For many, reading this book will take some time, but not primarily b/c (because)it is long. It is mainly b/c in order to comprehend this book, one must logically think though the things she says. Although she mostly states her points very clearly, some of her quotes are not as clear and must be thought though in order to find the interpretation. A WORD TO THE WISE: NO, SHE WILL NOT SPELL EVERYTHING OUT FOR YOU, NOR IS SHE OBLIGATED TO DO SO. SOMETIMES YOU WILL HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. So once in a while, you will have to put the book down and THINK. For that is the job of a philisophical novel, to make a person think and look at the world around them. She would not be doing her job if she gave you all the answers.For those who still choose not to read this novel I say this: YOU WILL NEVER TRULY UNDERSTAND HER PHILOSOPHY UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THIS BOOK. For, everything, the base and the root of her philosophy is contained in this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a great story. It is filled with admirable characters, dastardly villains, good vs. evil, and everything that makes a good fantasy.And that's precisely the problem with it.If Ayn Rand was attempting to write a politico-philosophical novel in a similiar vein to Huxley or Orwell, she failed miserably. If her goal was to write a piece of absolutist propaganda, she succeeded- which contradicted the entire idea she was trying to express! Rand defeats libertarianism by turning it into an absolutist ideology based on iron-shod moral axioms and a single-minded devotion to endless material acquisition as the singular most important goal in life. Rather than recognizing the plethora of different personalities and ideologies that make up our civilization, she plasters them into a black vs. white mold of absolute evil vs. absolute good, 1 vs. 0, death vs. life. She commits reductio ad absurdum- by taking any ideology out to it's most rediculous end, including her own, you can turn it into a sham. She insists that those who would criticize her moral opinions are morally unworthy to do so, and, in several places in the book, suggests that her opponents, whether they are labeled \\"collectivists\\", \\"mystics\\", \\"thugs\\", or \\"relativists\\", deserve to die.In my mind, I continually compared Atlas Shrugged to a much better novel in a similiar vein- Orwell's \\"1984\\". However, Orwell's work was much more realistic, and Orwell understood that any ideology, taken to an extreme, is dangerous and absurd, be it capitalism or communism. None of his political understanding is seen in Rand's sophmoric philosophy, which sees the vast majority of humans as nothing more than sheep- similiar to the totalitarian ideologies that she despises.Atlas Shrugged, while an enjoyable read, leaves quite a bit to be desired- which probably explains why most modern libertarians have left Rand behind. Her tradition is not that of the founding fathers, nor is it that of the people of the future."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is no surprise that the ideologically blind will have a problem with this amazing and groundbreaking work, but those who read this with an open mind will find themselves entering a new world of freedom and ideas. The experience will be unsettling for some. If you have been raised to believe that life is all about sacrifice, that seeking happiness and fulfillment for oneself is a sin, that it is not selfish of others to expect to take all that you have to give (especially if you produce more, earn more and deserve more) while they see it as irredeemably selfish of YOU to expect to keep anything you work for, earn or deserve, then this book is not for you. This book taught me to say NO to others, something I had never been able to do before. It is liberating, especially for women who are taught to be relentlessly giving while getting nothing for their efforts lest they be &quot;selfish&quot;. This book is NOT about not giving credit to those who labor, it is in every way about the glorification of the working man, the thinking man, the productive man of all types, whether he be a factory worker or a captain of industry. This book celebrates ingenuity and productivity. It is against the idea that those who produce less and deserve less and take more are somehow entitled to the labor, the effort, the income and all the resources of those who produce the income, the product and the ideas. The story centers around a man and his companions who are all great men of ideals, musicians, industrial kings, inventors. And one day, they disappear, drop out of society. In other words, they go on strike. What happens when the world's greatest minds decide to drop out? This book is not for egalitarians. All men may be created equal, but they differ greatly in the sequel and you'll have a lot of thinking to do about that after reading this inspiring work. Decide for yourself what kind of human you want to be. The one that drops out and is not missed, or the one that drops out and stops the gears of the world? When a man makes himself a man of value, he is a man of value to the world. And that's the message."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Couldn't put it down, but did skip many dozens of pages of her philosophy. Read it for the characters and the plot"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you've read an Ayn Rand novel, then you've already read a shorter version of this book. If you haven't read an Ayn Rand novel, go read The Fountainhead instead. At least in The Fountainhead, the political message was coupled with a halfway decent story. Atlas, hovever, is a contrived mix of silly characters and scenarios nestled between unbelievably long winded objectivist rants. But if you're into that sort of thing, you'll love it"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the bulky novel that gave the literary world a dose of objectivism, Any Rand's philosophy expounding the virtues of ascetic self-interest and laize-faire capitalism. A big dose. At over one thousand pages, Atlas Shrugged is one of the longest novels ever written and one of the most redundant. The plot revolves around the struggle between a cast of hardnosed industrialists (Dagny Targart, a dedicated businesswoman who runs her family's railroad empire, despite the fact that her sniveling brother receives all of the credit. Francisco d'Anconida, a charismatic and dynamic millionaire playboy. Hank Reardon, a steel baron of unshakable ethic character) and a faction of progressive business leaders, politicians, intellectuals and other \\"looters,\\" (led by Targart's brother, James) who despise corporate greed, want to increase competition and focus on the \\"human elements\\" of industry. In a seemingly endless series of tricky legal and business dealings, the immaculate brainpower and unwavering dedication of the further group overrides the sneaky, spineless and potentially destructive actions of the further.Atlas Shrugged may have stood as thorough and sensible, if somewhat long-winded, explanation of Ms. Rand's socio-economic ideals, if she had only portrayed her heroes' business sense as unblemished. But no, she had to create a cast of demigods with sculptureesque physical appearances, complete emotional stability and ingenious creativity. After a dozen starry-eyed descriptions of the endless flawlessness of her protagonists and several disdainfully-toned, mud-smearing depictions of her antogonists, her work becomes somewhat hard to swallow. Atlas Shrugged has long been acclaimed as breath-taking philosophical opus and a brilliant treatise on capitalism and egotism. The novel could have been such if it been subjected to a thorough editing and stripped of some of its more outlandish elements. But its utter one-sidedness, endless repetition of ideas and absurd adulation of the hardnosed business leaders make it little more than capitalist kitsch."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's view of the world makes great sense if you are one of the fortunate few that have, versus the majority of the world that has not and is struggling to keep what little they have. On a day that Exxon announces a $10B quarter while American's are paying record prices at the pump and for heating their homes, it is probably time to rethink the logic of Rand's myopic view of the world.Sure, if you are Exxon, it makes great sense to gouge everyone. Take what you can because the people being squeezed have no alternatives or recourse. That's the Rand way.An earlier reviewer voiced their opinion that the role of government should fall into three simple categories: defense, law enforcement and the courts. By this logic, things like food safety, public health, education, public safety are crazy attempts by the government to coddle a helpless nation. I hope that this reviewer, and all those that adhere to Rand's so called philosophy will bravely turn the fire trucks away if their homes are ablaze, will passionately reject vaccinations for themselves and their children and more.I would be happy to allow every libertarian to withhold their taxes as long as they accepted no government largess whatsoever. No schools for their kids, no subsidized food or fuel, no access to public roads, no air traffic control for flights they take, no inspection of what they eat, no access to products that have been tested for safety of efficacy.Ridding ourselves of these terrible encumbrances on our liberty would no doubt usher in a new golden age of American success. Either that or it could just run the entire country into the ground."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Author Ayn Rand was born in Russia (1905) and did not leave for the U.S. until 1925. During the Russian Revolution, her father's pharmacy and the building it was located in were confiscated, and her family nearly starved. Her parents were non-religious. Thus, it is not surprising that her 1,100+ page dystopian 'Atlas Shrugged' (published 50 years ago) casts the wealthy and powerful as oppressed, is anti-proletariat, religion, and moral altruism, while also pro laissez-faire capitalism and individual rights.More surprising is that today's conservatives have so enthusiastically encapsulated her philosophy (eg. Tea Party members, The Cato Institute, The Heritage Institute, Glenn Beck, John Boehner - Speaker of the House, Alan Greenspan - Federal Reserve Chairman, Rush Limbaugh, Ron Paul - candidate for U.S. President, Paul Ryan - U.S. Congressman, Clarence Thomas - Supreme Court Justice), despite her lack of economic credentials, pro-choice atheism, and almost total contempt for most of humanity. Sales have spiked since the Great Recession.Her stated goal was 'to show how desperately the world needs prime movers and how viciously it treats them,' and to depict a world without them if people 'of the mind' went on strike. Its timing - 'the day after tomorrow.' Early on in the novel, economic conditions worsen, and the government strengthens control over successful businesses. Rand contends that independence, individual achievement, and anti-altruism enable society to survive and thrive, and that no man should obtain value from others through physical force. She saw the U.S. as a mixture of freedom and controls, moving toward dictatorship.Protagonist John Galt eventually tires of government's burden, believing it has reached dictatorship levels (eg. mandated equalization of opportunity, and contributions to foreign and domestic 'moochers,' as well as burdensome government agencies that produce nothing of value), and decides to persuade the world's creators to withdraw into a cave he has made available.Rand herself lived for her own self-interest, seducing various readers despite her own and sometimes their marriages. 'Atlas Shrugged' takes a rather amoral perspective on sex, and doesn't address family situations - probably because Ayn never had any.Bottom-Line: Total sales of Ayn Rand's novel are about 8 million. 'Atlas Shrugged' resembles a 'Grapes of Wrath' turned upside down, a parallel universe to today's reality. All its characters are simplistically either all good (white) or all bad (black). It's real value lies in helping readers understand today's conservative politics."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is among the most popular writers in America and if she - the atheist apostle of selfishness - reflects the values of many Americans, then the country is in real trouble. Like so many others, when I was 17 I was enthralled with The Fountainhad. Wasn't this about being true to youself, integrity and courage? There were certainly a lot of moochers around who cut corners,sponged on others, broke the law when they could, and often prospered,like the heroes of Wall Street. What really woke me up was reading Rand's \\"For the New Intellectual.\\" I decided to read it as carefully, rationally and critically as I could. To my surprise Rand was utimately basing all her arguments on axioms. In other words assumptions. There was no proof! It didn't take me long to withdraw from Rand's spell and to realize how heartless, unworkable and ruinous her philosophy was. The famous economist Joseph Schumpeter (who had views similar to Hayek, a hero of conservatives), once had Rand to dinner with several friends. After Rand spouted on economics for a while he said, \\"Shut up Ayn. You don't know what you are talking about.\\" At the end of Rand's life there was almost no one in her good graces and she was suffering from depression and gobbling amphetamines. She insisted smoking was not injurous even though she had to have an operation for lung cancer, paid for by Medicare. Her lifelong husband, who had been a Hollywood extra when she met him and who never achieved anything, ended up as a semi-alcoholic who told a friend \\"I'd leave her if I could.\\" So two stars and I only give it two stars becaue I admire a poor Jewish girl from St Petersburg coming to this country in her early-20s and making such a spectacular career $$$uccess. Ayn Rand is important because of the millions she has influenced, mostly idealistic young people. But if you fall under her spell, and want to be honest with yourself, you need to read at least one book critical of her ideas. There are books by Jeff Walker, Scott Ryan and Albert Ellis, whose book is available as a free download. There are also two new biographies of Rand that have no ax to grind. Rand has gotten a free ride from serious criticism for almost half a century. Big mistake, for she is one of the shapers of today's America. So if you want to read 1,100 plus pages of small print about people who do not know what the word love means, who think rape is the beginning of love and altruism is immoral, , a book filled with wooden characters, clunky dialogue, that does not take place in any real, human, workable society, but in la la land, this is the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One could dismiss \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as an flawed novel with somewhat shallow characters, a too harsh moral philosophy or an outlandish and radical preaching on free market and minimal state. In some sense, this sure could be taken as partially correct. But, it in some sense, that misses completely the point, and takes the whole book out of the real light it should be appreciated.About the structure and the characters, what can be said - Rand's ambition was never to craft a literary gem. She primarely has to deliver a point here. The characters and events in the book are merely plot devices to illustrate several aspects of objectivism philosophy. Dagny Taggart, the protagonist, represents the genius, the entusiasm and the vitality of our fully realised potential, that is unable to see that carrying the world on its shoulders, although initially possible, will only cause the burden to become greater and the suffering to become lonelier. Hank Rearden, for its turn, represents the state of unhappiness we can create to ourselves when, even when disagreeing, we choose to live by another's expectations and moral codes, the cage we could voluntarely put ourselves into. Eddie Willers is the man who find himself to be uncapable of staying shoulder-to-shoulder with his companions in terms of genius and vitality, but doesn't trying to fake what he is not, and doesn't sabotage, envy or freeride others even when all around are doing so. John Galt, the shallowest of them all, is that by a reason: he is the example of the ideal man, as depicted by the objectivist ideals.As a philosophy, it sure may be somewhat harsh. But it raises questions we, once facing them, cannot choose to ignore anymore. Does anyone have a \\"natural right\\" to claim as his the product of other's strengt? Can we place so much power in the hands of others? Inneficient (or plainly false) altruism does legitimate any course of action over consequentialism, even a openly egoistic one? And is being an egoist REALLY that bad after all? Personally, I find objectivism to be a good complement to utilitarism, my ethical school of choice.That is outlandish? Oh yeah. If you try to imagine USA becoming the living hell of inneficience, corruption and unhappiness shown in that book, you'll have a hard time. Bu again, this is a FABLE. An allegory. An don't forget: an allegory made all too real in the Latin America, the Oriental Europe, China, USSR and even African nations. More than 2/3 of the world lived that allegory in real life any or other time. And if your find a speech to be too idiotic, some political plan to be too shortsighted or some politician to be too inept to be true, remember that chances are that is a line really spoken in real history, a situation taken straight out of history books or a real life economist or leader that has only his name changed.This certainly is not the best structured or most pleasant novel I read, nor the most solid work on moral philosophy (that accolade sure goes to Peter Singer's \\"Practical Ethics\\") but it is certainly one of the works that changed my life the most.And please forgive my fearful english."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This piece of work is absolutely brilliant. This is not just a mere novel. it is art. Rand created an allegorical venue in which to project her philosophical ideals. Her focus was on the insidiousness of facism.She has the ability to write a very intriguing novel set in a very bleak, dreary environment that is grey in aura left to its on demise. But Rand takes this bleak industrial setting with characters that the general public would normally not relate to and keeps the reader compelled to relate on some level...on many levels--to take a stand on one side or the other. it is a black and white story with many grey themes surrounded in a bleak and hopeless future that ends in utopia.Rand addressed the power of individualism vs collectivism, rationalism vs. emotionalism, facism vs capitalism, moral vs. ammoral, the nature of humanity--all from a humanistic point of view.Rand challenges her readers to ask themselves--what do you value the most?Though her novel may appear very extreme in its context to many, there is no doubt that it generates the brain to start thinking and questioning things and as a true philosopher--wouldn't that be the ultimate goal anyway? to generate more questions and new thoughts?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged parallels our country today in that we are losing freedoms rapidly and our economy is diminishing.

If Christians believe love is the greatest commandment then Objectivists believe selfishness and capitalism are the greatest commandments. The book has a strong anti-communist theme and a very strong capitalist theme. The story is basically Ayn Rand's view of the United States if it ever turned into a communist country. I enjoyed reading the book though it is a little far-fetched. The characters are nicely developed and the plot is enjoyable. Besides the one chapter of pure preaching the book moves along quickly. Along with all the anti-communist and capitalist themes Rand throws in her view of love and relationships. She sucessfully applies her objectivism philosophy to every aspect of life.

The power of the book is apparent off the page as well as on. For example, observe some of the negative reviews below. Someone from Austin, Texas tells us &quot;Atlas&quot; contains a rape. It most certainly does not; that is simply a malicious lie, amounting to slander. &quot;Atlas&quot;'s detractors are so full of guilty hatred and rage that many frequently misrepresent the novel, some quite deliberately.

It is a hymn to the potency and capability of man's mind. It is the glorification of man as a rational being. It is the concretization of the best possible to man.In essence, the story takes the form the epic duel between good and evil. The thinkers and producers are demonized and plundered by the world which they work to sustain. They choose to assert themselves in a most unusual way -- by complying with the demands of their enemy in the only way they know how.The reader will come away from this novel with a feeling of exaltation toward man, a sense of confidence in himself, and a benevolent outlook toward life in general.Below I have included what I believe to be necessary background information.Ayn Rand's purpose in writing was the portrayal of an ideal man -- man &quot;as he might be, and ought to be.&quot; In order to do this, she had to create a new philosophy, as she was in disagreement with most existing ideas. Thus, her philosophy, Objectivism, was the means by which she was to achieve her end, namely, THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED.This is not a philosophic treatise, as some may lead you to believe. Philosophy is a big issue in this novel, though, for one reason: PHILOSOPHY IS A BIG ISSUE IN LIFE (THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE IN LIFE), WHETHER ONE CHOOSES TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACT OR NOT. Thus, philosophy is central to the portrayal of an ideal man -- how he thinks and acts, and why.I would like to offer advise to the reader of ATLAS SHRUGGED: do no ignore the philosophy Miss Rand presents, but do not dwell on it. Again, this is not a philosophic treatise, it is a Romantic novel, and should be read as such.For those who are quick to dismiss Objectivism as impractical or full of contradictions, I suggest that you study it more thoroughly... much more thoroughly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this book in the summer of 9th grade, and absolutely loved it.

The philosophy is absolutely intriguing, though I also find very easily misunderstood if you don't read some of Rand's non-fiction. Every time I find another aspect to the book though, I love it even more. I really do think it's one of the greatest novels ever written."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a captivating novel. The greatest \\"shortcoming\\" is that the book is over 50 years old. The heroine is the vice-president of a major railroad company, and most of the plot revolves around her desperate efforts to keep the railroad going. In the 21st century, when the age of railroads is long past, this is certainly dated. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged, although contemporary when written, takes on the feel of a grand masterful allegory perhaps like Dante, Chaucer, or Swift. It is just as much \\"fun\\" as Alice in Wonderland or Gulliver's Travels--and just as serious as the Divine Comedy. Yet, if you listen to a hour of local and national news on TV every evening while reading the book--half of the stories will sound as though they were lifted from the book--so timelessness and universal is Rand's story.This will probably be the most important book (to you) that you read in your lifetime.What is it about? It is often described as \\"Capitalism versus Communism\\", or \\"altruism vs selfishness\\"--but both descriptions seriously miss the point. What this book is really about is much more fundamental. It is about the nature of good and evil, and beyond that, the very meaning of life.\\"But I'm a good person, so what value is this book to me?\\"--you may ask. Answer: You have certainly noticed that adult \\"morality\\" is full of all kinds of exceptions and contradictions. The truth is, the world of \\"morality\\" we adults have constructed is a sham, a fraud. It is no more than \\"social convention\\"--which is to say, \\"what most-of-us more-or-less agree to\\"--and actually, despite all the \\"moral\\" justification, has absolutely nothing to do with morality or right-and-wrong, and often little to do with common sense.Still, the question remains, \\"Why isn't simply accepting the current 'social norms' good enough?\\" \\"Go along to get along.\\" Answer: To put it bluntly, the greatest evil the world has ever seen has been done by folks \\"accepting community norms\\" who thought they were doing good, or at least who could justify their actions as being \\"socially acceptable\\".The truth is, you will be quite surprised when you learn the true nature of evil. Until you have read Atlas Shrugged, evil will remain a hazy mist floating just off your line of vision, which you don't look straight at, because you don't WANT it to exist. After reading Atlas Shrugged, evil snaps into sharp focus--and like a bully confronted--ceases to be a fear, and just becomes something distasteful to avoid.As Rand richly illustrates: Just as eating too much fat can clog up your arteries, thinking \\"too much fat\\" can damage with your mental health. Some mental illness is physiological. But most mental illness is caused by unresolved internal contradictions. Reality is all there is. You do NOT have the option of living in your own private version of reality. Nevertheless, many, perhaps most, people live lives built on thier own complex lies. That turns smart people crazy, and stupid people mean and crazy.How do you avoid \\"unresolved internal contradictions\\"? By knowing the difference between right and wrong, and never, ever, allowing a rotten board to be used in the construction of your mental house. The problem is the old \\"slippery slope\\". Lie to yourself just once, no matter how trivial the lie, and the next one will be easier. Before long, you realize that you can justify ANYTHING--and with the blessings of the popular culture. And before you know it, you've lost your soul.As Rand preaches, the meaning of life is integrity. Living without compromise. To live a life filled with joy and pride in yourself, made possible by being free of mental conflicts. To know, not merely hope, that your mistakes were honest mistakes. To live with the knowledge that you are the best you can be, while striving to be better. To be a joy and comfort to the people you love. To give generously of your time, wealth, and love simply for the joy of doing so. To be a person who has changed the world for the better when you have gone. That's what Atlas Shrugged is really all about. All ofthe other themes, even Communism vs Capitalism are peripheral supporting themes. It is precisely because the fundamental issues are so basic and primary, that the implications are simultaneously universal--applying to all aspects of life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First introduced to this book over 20 years ago, at the ripe old age of 25, I've gone back and reread it every 2 or 3 years.Is the politically correct, liberally biased, social commentary of the political leadership and elite media making you crazy?

I read it in under a week, as I couldn't put it down.The premise of the book is the answer to the question of \\"What would happen if the producers of the world, the intellectuals, the people holding the country on their shoulders, simply went on strike?\\" What if Atlas, holding the world on his shoulders while the world cursed him simply got sick of being abused and shrugged the planet off?Although the book will certainly make you more of a libertarian, I certainly do not endorse all of Rand's philosophy. She does deride religion unnecessarily, I believe, linking Christianity and Communism as if they are inseparable, when in reality they are closer to being exclusive. This book, however, will enlighten any patriot who wishes to be aware of the buzzwords the looters of today will use.The characters are startlingly dynamic, and much is spoken in riddles. The plot is bizarre, but shockingly realistic, especially at the beginning. The story is all too real until we visit Atlantis, and then it becomes more like fiction.Some of the greatest parts are Hank Rearden's trial and Fransisco d'Aconia's argument against the statement that money is the root of all evil.This book is a must read for any intellectual, regardless of political views. Read with your mind, and be open to changing your views about big business, the dollar, and property rights. Don't accept everything, don't believe that there is no middle ground, but DONT burn the book. It needs to be read before the real Atlases of the world start Shrugging."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Fourteen years after \\"The Fountainhead\\", objectivist pioneer Ayn Rand wrote an even bigger epic novel that would end up being her most definitive book on her polarizing philosophies. She again wraps her perspective in a powerful, often melodramatic character-driven story, this time on a more sweeping landscape and with a pervasive mystery suspense element. It's a fulsome story that dares the reader to envision an intellectual revolution where the great thinkers disappear to avoid the complete destruction of their spirits. Rand populates this fanciful world with her trademark Baroque-style characters beginning with her beautiful protagonist, Dagny Taggart, a young railroad VP driven to run Taggart Transcontinental as she fends off the looters. She is surrounded by a bevy of conflicted men - great steel industrialist Hank Rearden who creates an alloy that renders steel and aluminum obsolete and whose ruthlessness marks the way for his own self-destruction; flamboyant Francisco D'Anconia who converts himself from an innovative copper mining baron to a hedonistic playboy; failed philosopher Ragnar Danneskjold who becomes a pirate stealing for the rich; and self-sacrificing composer Richard Halley.Through the fray comes the pivotal character of John Galt, who actually does not appear until about two-thirds into the dense story. As the brilliant mind behind an automobile engine that will convert atmospheric static electricity into motor power, he witnesses his invention lie dormant under the ignorant leadership of the factory's owners. Galt masterminds the strike of the world's great minds, and gradually, the greatest thinkers and most ingenious engineers find their way to Atlantis, the hidden valley where they can escape the persecution of the bureaucrats exploiting them. Their absence means that the industrialists lose their social and economic leverage and fall prey to each others' machinations until they lose control completely. It is only at this point of desperation that the philosophers become accepted as honorable citizens worthy of respect. Told with Rand's familiar verbose writing style intact, it's an audacious, often compelling story that carries far more plot convolutions than necessary to carry through on the author's convictions.At 1,080 pages, the book could have realistically used the hand of an equally strong-minded editor who would have seen through the repetitive nature of Rand's didacticism. Still, the story is arresting, and Rand makes it clear that the highest goal in life is one's own productive achievement, that individual rights must be upheld over any form of collectivism, whether social or political in basis. Whereas in \\"The Fountainhead\\", she focuses her philosophical application to the somewhat rarefied world of architecture, here she takes a much more grandiose look where the ideas of independence and personal liberty have even greater ramifications. At the same time, there is no denying that the world Rand paints is palpable and more relevant than ever as CEOs today are reading the book to justify their positions of self-interest from a moral as well as economic perspective. Even at its most basic level, the book is about deciding what's important in life, i.e., the choice between self-reliance and dependence, and going as far as one can to fight for it. Rand succeeds in bringing vivid life to these arguments in a most eminently entertaining way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most people cover the philosophical side of the book and who should and shouldn't read it. To those of you who find a \\"who is John Galt\\" editorial review completely useless, here's some insight into what you will find.This book takes the concept of social responsibility to an extreme, painting a world where the social elite strangle off (tax away) all productive activities in the name of equity and social good. \\"From each by their ability, to each by their need\\" becomes the horror that any economist could predict, where the incentive to need is greater then the incentive to show ability (and people behave accordingly). Most people will not believe that a world could ever reach this extreme, but I believe the book fairly illustrates what would happen if it did occur and in so doing teaches several valuable lessons.While I enjoyed the book and largely agree with the conclusions, I am concerned about the extreme to which the philosophy is taken. Rather then address several seemingly critical questions, Rand uses the emotional pitch of the moment to paint a variety of moral questions with a single, negative brush. I don't believe this is any more even handed then those who give the book a poor rating on equally political grounds.I'll cite one example for the sake of argument. At one point in the book, a character in the book raises the question of whether omission (the failure to act to save live) is the same as commission (the act of causing death). The book doesn't even stop to explain the position it takes, that omission is not murder. Our society seems to feel that the failure to feed a starving man (omission) is morally equivalent to murder. At the same time, as you move progressively further from this proximate cause, you slide down a slippery slope until failing to stop overeating or other risky behaviors might be similarly classified. Do I agree with the position the book takes? Yes. Do I think the book does a good job of communicating it? No.The last point that must be noted is that the book is full of long monologues, ending in one that ran 50 pages in my copy. If you haven't caught on to the message by this point, it might all be compelling. I found it repetitive and boring and want people to understand what they're getting into.In the end, I gave the book a 4 because the philosophy is excellent and compelling even if it is long winded and not particularly even handed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is an absorbing read. The beginning premise is simple. What would happen if the great economic drivers of society simply dropped out from frustration with those who continually seek to handicap them and help themselves to their wealth through redistribution and regulation?The great industrialists of America begin vanishing without a trace. All have been visited by a shadowy figure prior to their disappearance. Meanwhile, the female railroad tycoon Dagny Taggert is battling to save her own company and keep as many of her high-achieving peers in the game as she can. The plot is fascinating. The characters gain your interest.There is only reason why I give this book four stars rather than five. After clipping along for 900 pages, a major climax of the story is reached as a key character reaches for a microphone to broadcast to the nation. Exciting, yes? It is, at least until you realize the same character is going to give a speech that goes on for about 100 pages and delivers Rand's philosophy in excruciating detail. There's no need. She has made these same points very well through the story.Regardless of Rand's occasional heavy-handedness and failure to trust the reader to learn the lessons she is trying to teach, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a major book and should be read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand captures what could be a possible paradise of capitalism. The ideals of the characters are far beyond selfish but backed by a nature of a reason to be selfish. Followed by her strong passionate toward the love of two people totally void of religion or need. Love to Rand isn't that of need and isn't that of want, it is a gift that must be given. All in all a GREAT book, that may be taken as extreme but if taken lightly the past and future of the United States is written within these pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An amazing book written based on the practical yet innovative ideas of Rand. I had read Anthem, and this book is a lot more interesting, both in plot and philosophical implications. I had just taken a macroeconomics course, and I believe knowing a little about basic economic theories enhances the book. It was hard to stop reading, because you want to know what happens to the characters, and at the same time you flinch because of the quasi-communistic and self-destructive ideas of the society. The reason why I didn't give this book the full 5 stars is because while an incredible book, it is really long, and kind of unnecessarily so. Rand uses long monologues to repeatedly hammer her ideas into your head in case you didn't get it the first several times. But a good book just the same, check it out."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I agree with those people, such as John, David, and Stephen, who realize that this book is a truly noble effort. I can say with all my heart that this is THE best book I have ever read. It is a sparkling jewel in the rock pile of philosophical literature. To the narrow-minded, this is a book about a railroad. To the deeper people, it is abook about man as he should be. In The Fountainhead, there was Howard Roark as an example. In Atlas Shrugged, there is John Galt, and also 2 or 3 other people who stand out as the ideal for all mankind. There is not enough one can say about this book. If Ayn Rand was taught in high school or college, the human condition would be very different. I salute you, the people who truly understand this book and share Ayn's ideal for mankind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every so often the reviews on this book fail to describe the book itself. Too bad, it's a great book whose theme is the role of intelligence in society. What happens when society gets &quot;dumb and dumber,&quot; when reason is attacked, and morons take over? Industrial society falls apart. This book anticipates the exact condition of America today. Look at public schools, the Jerry Springer-types, and astroloy. AR's view of selfishness is novel. Unlike most people who have no conception of peaceful selfishness, Ayn Rand showed that this overlooked virtue is the essence of human progress and a peaceful civilization. When people forget that virtue, if they uphold sacrifice, the mind gets sacrificed, and then violent human sacrifice is unleashed. Isn't that the battle at work in the story--and in the world today? The inspiration of this book is that the good wins over the evil, peaceful selfishness wins over violent human sacrifice. Isn't such a victory what we all need to live? Well, that is the battle of capitalism over socialism, of reason over the irrational, the self-destructive, the parasitical. Too bad Bill Gates doesn't care about philosophy; he could use it to his advantage---as John Galt, the story's main protagonist, did to his."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"there are 50 CDs in this package.

The loss of all productive individuals from a society that penalizes them for their success and productivity.Subsequently,a system failure leaving the politicians and their corrupt cronies to deal with problems they haven't the intelligence to solve.For a tale who's notes are dated 1944, Ayn Rand must have had a crystal ball.Or.... maybe she grew up in a similar circumstance in a European country.An introduction to critical thinking that should be required reading in schools. But not by force, Ha, Ha .Second best book I have ever read, From someone who loves to read and learn."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Outside forces interfere with business to devastating effect. Businesses are asked (read forced) to share their profits and markets to equalize the playing field. This inevitably leads to apathy, corruption, lack of leadership, unreliability, and uneven work share. In a shorter time than one might imagine, infrastructure and production are irreversibly ruined. Meanwhile, the best and brightest go-getters are disappearing without a trace.People still like and need money, but the world is turned upside-down as non-producers (looters) manipulate the markets and the public's definition of value. Industrialists and workers struggle out their short term on the hamster wheel until they one by one are worn out and financially finished.At times I disliked and found unrealistic, the one-dimensional cardboard characters. One can practically hear the twinkle of light off the pearly white teeth of the heroes of our tale. The villainous looters are a dark, brooding pack of numbskulls. Conveniently lacking were society's safeguards and refuges such as the police, the church, military, government. There was no mention of a stock market, share holders, trade unions, international trade organizations or allies.However, I liked this book and would recommend it because it is relevant and prescient. It is thought-provoking, well-written and interesting.

I'm just a dude with a big brain. With that said, read this review.I read Rand because of its &quot;reader's choice&quot; number one spot in the top 100 list of all time. I thought, &quot;Science fiction, AND on the top 100 list? I can't go wrong!&quot;Gag.The book starts off okay. That's because you haven't heard the same thing over and over again. About half way through the book I was wondering when the aliens were going to show up -- either on the good guy's side or the bad guy's side. It didn't matter which side they showed upon IT WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE SENSE of the odd way everyone in this book acts.The mystery in the beginning of the book is decent. There are some moments when I enkjoyed the book. But--WHERE WAS THE PRESIDENT? She never once mentions a president who would be in somewhat charge of our nation! Especially in the 40's or 50's or 20's or whenever this book is supposed to happen.HERE IS MY BIGGEST TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS BOOK.1) The longest da mn diatribes you have ever read. One lasted for like FIFTY PAGES!! NO ONE talks this long and this thoughfilled. No one can hold that much philosophy in their heads and manage it so effortlessly!2) The heroes of the book were basically a bunch of quitters. They all hid out until the end. When, if they saw what was going to happen before it happened, they could have gotten into a number of key political offices (apparently not the office of the president because there is no such animal in this story) and ran their enemies out. I mean, they are a bunch of smart guys. But no. Our heroes decide to go and hide out in the mountains. Wow, I'm impressed they gave up. They are my heroes.Why was this considered the best book of the past century?Someone tell me please."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Here's a summary of the book: Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad.The author's look at capitalism is at first interesting, but it quickly gets old after she beats the same concept over your head in a very pompous manner.

This book could have been EASILY edited to half the number of pages and lose nothing.You might like the book if you find the next paragraph exciting...Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad.

The characters are abhorrent. And if you don't tire of the way they are always described as having \\"a hint of a smile\\" you will breakdown midway through the zillionth repetition of her dogma. But you can look forward to the 100 page John Galt diatribe...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is too long (Kurt Vonnegut took only a few pages to make the same points in his excellent short story, \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"), totally unoriginal, and is little more than an overly-elaborated version of Rand's much better novel, _The Fountainhead_.Jules Verne's Captain Nemo (_20,000 Leagues under the Sea_) is the obvious model for John Galt, and, to a degree, Galt's friend Ragnar. Nemo was the original anarchist scientist who led a strike against the world. Nemo invented a submarine; Galt invented an engine that would run for a long time on only a drop of fuel. Nemo attacked warships; Ragnar attacks foreign aid ships. Both Nemo and Galt had secret operation bases. The only differences between Verne's Nemo and Rand's Galt is Verne cast the character as the villian. Also, Verne was a better writer; when he wrote _20,000 Leagues under the Sea_, he was breaking new ground._Atlas Shrugged_ is also not the first time Rand did something like this, either. Her novella, _Anthem_, is little more than a rewrite of the Russian dystopian novel, _We_, by Yevgeny Zamyatin (in the long run, all Rand did was give the story a happier ending).Nearly every idea Rand had was originally someone else's -- compare her writings to those of her fellow Russian Mikhail Bakunin (who spent time in prison for acting like an Ayn Rand hero), Max Stirner, Ragnar Redbeard (for whom Galt's friend Ragnar may have been named), and Robert Heinlein, and you'll see what I mean. That they were good ideas doesn't change that. Rand certainly was right about totalitarianism, collectivism, and altruism being evil, but she wasn't the first to say these things, nor did she say them best. For good libertarian fiction, stick to Robert Heinlein and L. Neil Smith."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is amazing that all the people that gripe about this book do not understand that all the characters in this book are flawed and that these characters are not John Galt. These reviewers are stating example after example that actions of the various flawed characters in the book are expressions of Ayn Rand philosophy. How wrong they are. John Galt is the only expression of Ayn Rand's philosophy shown in this book.What you do see in this book is that constantly some office or group's voice (Mouch, etc...) is saying what one person has accomplished cannot be allowed to happen soley for that person's profit while some less fortunate group suffers. This is the corrupt nature of many government offices that Ayn shows over and over again. Tariffs are a great example of tipping the tables in some one person, company, or country's favor that should not receive it. Favoritism is the placing of incompetent people in offices. How much ineptness do we see on a professional level every day that we simply accept? What we see daily is \\"yes\\" men that get the votes, fail and apologize with sincerity. Unfair practices such as those listed above create enemies by the thousands. These type of people create the Franciscos that secretly want to bring them down and the Hanks that think they control their own destinies while working with them.If you cannot see the realities of this book being played out in daily life you have never attended a large company's board meeting or were unknowingly wearing blinders while there. You do not understand Wal-Mart and the emminent domain of personal property that now occurs for society's need as approved by the new righteous Supreme Court we had \\"unbiased and fairly\\" appointed.There is some one character in Atlas Shrugged that each of us can identify with. Which one are you? In the review of this book it is amazing how many of the 1's attack the people that rate it a 5 and how few of the 5's attack the ones that rate it a 1. Food for free-thought! I rated this review a 1 just to have the other 1's read it as I believe they would think it was from \\"one of their own.\\"True Ayn Rand is wordy. If you can open your mind then the length of the read will not matter over the content.

The lengthy read is intended to teach and short one is not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Well, kids, John Galt was a character in a silly old book, written by a woman who was a notorious crackpot. Few take her seriously today but a few benighted reactionaries and a lot of high-school students who have never read another book but believe themselves to be misunderstood geniuses. (Oh, and Alan Greenspan.) No kids, pay John Galt no mind. Seriously though, I've read Atlas Shrugged, and it depresses me to hear praise showered upon it. That people consider it literature, with its wooden prose and cardboard characters, shows that they know nothing of literature. That people consider its pernicious ideas sound shows that they are anything but &quot;objective.&quot; The world simply does not work the way Ms. Rand's cultists believe it does.

They looked at me like I had just thrown up all over the floor. No one who has anything to do with academia takes crap like Atlas Shrugged seriously, and if you asked them to belt out a list of philosophers, Ayn Rand might make the top 1000. Anyway, Rand does an... alright job of synthesizing some broad ideas, but another thing that bothers me is that it's not very good writing. It's not awful... it's just mediocre, and trudging through over a thousand pages took it out of me something fierce, like having to read 3 da vinci codes, only, you know, less action-packed.Anyway, don't delude yourselves into thinking Ayn Rand is a philosopher, because she's not.

She leaves out everyone else and focuses only on the best, the greatest, the most wonderful. It is unrealistic.The novel is also a very hard read. It's very preachy and pedantic. It goes on for pages upon pages of speech, not dialog. The characters are mere caricatures of what people in a magazine look like - flat and glossy. They have no depth of soul, no inner demons to struggle with, no darkness. They are not human as they lack malice, greed, lust, sloth, or all the darkness that lies in everyone's hearts.I honestly thought that because Rand and I share a political belief system (libertarianism) that I would love the pion to it.

The only reason I bothered to finish the book was that I had invested so much time slogging through the frustrating and whining prose that I felt obligated to finish the read, which was the greatest disappointment of all. I write this because I was appalled to see Ayn Rand's name on a list of authors of \\"related works\\" while browsing the writings of Bertrand Russell.

It has many flaws--not the least of which is John Galt's annoyingly redundant radio address towards the end.I will neither criticize Ms. Rand nor will I elevate her to a gilded pedestal. She had an interesting philosophy and the idea of selfishness as a virtue has some merit. Most rational decisions have some basis in selfishness. For all except life-and-death decisions to be anything else is basically to make those decisions random. Yikes!The novel is not terrible, but yes, it is redundant. And it does not take into account how the Objectivist society would handle parent/child relationships or people who are in some way sick or disabled. However, really look at what this book tells the individual--to make rational choices and to not rely on anyone else for success or happiness. Maybe objectivism wouldn't make a good society overall, but if every individual followed the spirit of objectivism--pride, rational thought, self-reliance--it would be a pretty good society. If nothing else, Jerry Springer would run out of show material.Objectivism does not condone selfishness to the point of [evilness] and ... scandals. That's forgetting a key aspect of Ms. Rand's philosophy which is to strive for success through being the best possible individual (obviously, this would not include stealing).Read the book, but accept it for what it shoud be...a good guide for how people should handle themselves but not for how we should all handle each other.

I've heard so many references to Ayn Rand's masterpiece over the years and, as a devout capitalist, I wanted to read what many consider (including the Wall Street Journal) the greatest argument for capitalism ever written. Atlas Shrugged lived up to the hype!While the story is compelling and the case presented for capitalism is fantastic, the foundation upon which Rand builds her case is disturbing as a Christian. Rand makes sure that the reader understands that humanism is the only true religion and that the achievements of man are the only thing worthy of our worship. Religion, according to Rand, is the proverbial millstone around the neck of humanity tying mankind to a false and perverse view of reality thus preventing man from dreaming for and reaching new heights.While I highly recommend the book as a classical read - especially if one is looking for an argument against socialism - I must caution readers to think critically about all that Rand is writing and to examine for themselves the claims she makes against religion in general and Christianity in particular."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was lucky to get ahold to Rand's works before I knew much about her philsophy, so I first read this book from a literary standpoint and later applied the philosophy. Being a self-proclaimed corporate hippy, had I known about Objectivism before reading her works I would probably be yet another person to shun any philosophy that supports a pure Capitalist society. Fortunately for me, I didn't miss out on this book due to a pre-conceived bias.To dissect the title as means of explaining the book, Atlas, in the greek myth, had the burden of the entire world on his shoulders. Should Atlas shrug the world off his shoulders, the world would crumble in despair. Such a scenario is exactly what Rand tries to describe: the book revolves around the hypothetical situation of what the world would be like should all the inventors, movers, great thinkers of the world be removed one by one. Some, however, do not shrug off the world without a fight. Thus begins the story of a stubborn, brilliant and calculating VP of a railroad company by the name of Dagney Taggart. As society (taken place in the 1950's) moves towards socialism, Dagney must fight harder to keep the railroad alive amidst tightening (and corrupt) legislation. As the pockets of congressmen and corrupt businessmen deepens with an increasing stronghold on her company, she finds her support found in other like-minded thinkers and businessmen vanishing in the night. To where they've gone is the mystery that unfolds as the book progresses.The plot is engaging enough, but it's Rand's character analysis is impressive. Those who appear to be heartless, selfish work-a-holics are applauded and admired by section 2 of 'Atlas.' Similarly, those who are advocates of charity and socialism are viewed as corrupt, ignorant leeches. Basically, notions of good and evil are drawn sharply enough, but precisely who is evil and why is what is so deliciously surprising.To criticize the book, one of the more interesting perspectives of Rand is how she portrays love between characters. For being an advocate of individual pursuit, love does not exist in the standard definition of self-sacrifice. For Rand, to love based on self-sacrifice would be suicide of the soul. Instead, love is based not on a certain je-ne-sais-quois, but of pure, raw talent and tangible ambition. Love, like every measured reward, is to be earned, not given. Some, myself included, question the validity of such a belief.From a feminist standpoint, I admire greatly Dagney Taggart since Rand portrays a woman as a strong, capable character. For being written in the 1950's, seeing a woman in such a light is rare. Conversely, however,Dagney surrenders herself entirely to the man she loves, claiming herself a reward to those she deems worthy. Sadly, men are not expected to reciprocate in the same way and the gender differences are perpetuated (albeit unintentionally).From an environmentalist standpoint: Ayn Rand sees everything as a resource to further mankind and to fuel man's limitless ambition. As such, trees are for timber. Granite is for buildings. Earth, at large, is seen as one large resource at the disposal of mankind. While I agree with her belief that humans are unique in their ability to invent and create, I cannot accept the same paradigm of nature being a tool for humans to wield and use according to their will which Rand alliterates several times.From a philosophy standpoint: at the core of Rand's philosophy, objectivism, lies the advocacy of pure capitalism. In this age of increasing health care costs, scandals, and a further gap between the rich and the poor, it's no surprise that many are quick to shun a philosophy that supports big business and those running them. What is largely missed by those who disagree with Objectivism is the full picture of what Rand advocates. Those who read her works understand that while yes, laissez-faire is favorable, big business must also be run by those with morals and ethics. Big business and lobbyists should not coincide, and yet those so critical of Objectivism seem to intertwine business and government when critiquing the philosophy. Should they read Atlas they might understand Rand's aversion to the two intervening with one another. As previous readers suggest, I strongly advise everyone who criticizes Objectivism to first read 'Atlas' or 'The Fountainhead' for a complete picture of her philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I listened to the abridged Atlas Shrugged on audio CD after it had been very highly recommended to me by somebody who read the book years ago. Even though it was written a long time ago it remains relevant today, particularly here in the UK. The negativity and helplessness of the world in Atlas Shrugged is something I see lots of around me. However, the philosophy that uncontrolled capitalism is the only way forward is far too simplistic. As long as people listening to Atlas Shrugged use it as a starting point rather than thinking it is the be-all and end-all then I might recommend people to listen, subject to one big caveat - even in abridged form it is FAR, FAR too long. The whole thing could have been a fifth of its length without loss of meaning. The long speech towards the end needs to be cut further. The person who recommended Atlas Shrugged to me said that section was painful to read. Listening on audio CD wasn't much different - I phased out during that section."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a must read for all the leaders of the world. It is the ultimate example of a world without balance that demonstrates what would occur on Earth if those of us who strive to produce decide to let the looters control us. This is a crucial stepping stone for all the would-be leaders of the world.In that same manner, I must advice you to be very objective in reading it. Those who do not hold a high level of self-esteem will adopt this as their world! This is not so! Our world contains productive people who will not let their world convert into this void. You must remember this is a fantasy/novel book, to be taken as such. In essence it is an exageration of the truth.Any man who is leading their life at this moment with the upmost desire to progress, to reach their goals, to become a symbol of productivity and an example to others by clear leardership and a will to better the world they see for the sake of man, but with the knowledge to understand that through example and educated selfishness is the only way to reach it, then you understand my take on this novel.Enjoy it, learn from it, but don't stake your life as such."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The novel is absurd, in the form of stripping arguments to their bones and exposing the underlying assumptions. A brilliant absurdity. Yes, the philosophy (what is the &quot;phylosophy&quot; discussed below... a pastry?) has a simplistic tone, but that is what ideas look like when explained clearly; think of mathematical elegance. This is a novel of Utopian striving, a type of work that is easy to criticize for necessary simplifications.However, the underlying structure of the ideas supporting the work have not been meaningfully refuted in the reviews below. Rand's tenet is that mankind reaches its fullest potential when working toward its own personal interests. The more that the state interferes with that work, the less mankind works toward that potential. Thus taxes that do not transparently serve the interests of the broad population, are widely viewed as confiscatory and lead to declines in work. Productivity measures in socialist societies prove this again and again. Not only does Germany have persistent unemployment that nearly doubles that of the US, their &quot;disability&quot; rate equals their unemployment rate.Is there a perfect capitalist? No, but I trust an imperfect capitalist far more than I would trust an ideal socialist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"No ordinary methods of review can possibly describe the purpose of this novel. I choose to write this review while I am still immersed in the text, only because I fear that if I attempt to write about it after I am finished with it, I will lose the impression of the force that this novel exerts on my mind with every moment of each passing day. While reading this novel, I continually struggle with a small voice in the back of my head that tells me I am missing something. There are sentences in the book that are burned into my mind, and there are ideas that are so eloquently expressed that they name some unknown desire that has been driving me for years. There are characters in this novel that I love with a love that Ayn Rand puts into words. There are also characters that I despise, and she names that feeling of disgust again and again. Yet while I want to understand these characters, I struggle with other concepts. The best characters are driven and focused, and sometimes they are so driven that it seems they have forgotten compassion. They have not only forgotten compassion, but they hate the notion of it. I struggle with this. There are plenty of ugly characters that use compassion as a guise for doing cowardly things, but the strongest characters are self-motivated and have no desire to hide anything about themselves, including their desire to succeed. Yet I cannot tell if it is my own feeling or a socially imposed feeling that makes me wonder if there is any evil in being selfish. There is something that Ayn Rand is getting at here, and I won't name it. You (the reader of this review) must read the book for yourself and try to name it. But it comes down to the fact that there is something noble about doing honest work for your own desire. For me, this is one of those books that makes me think about things that I always think about, yet it twists them into something unrecognizable that I cannot ignore. Everyone should read this book. It is a dense and challenging novel, and this is exactly why I recommend that everyone read it. The way you respond to the novel will tell you a lot about yourself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read a ton of reviews people have written on this book.

Anyway, I also have been playing Bioshock which has a backstory lifted right out of the valley where the truly create people settled. The thing with Bioshock is that it takes place 10 years after the founding of the \\"Perfect\\" society based on laissez faire capitalism. In a society based on pure capitalism with no regard for the moral implications of the pursuit of profits things are not going at all well.Rand is facinating - she really has some interesting ideas that make you understand that we all owe a great debt to the most creative and productive. If a country is to be great the government cannot drown them in regulations and taxes. Conversely a government should not create a greater incentive to not work than to work. That said, Rand takes this to an illogical extreme and frankly the writing and characterizations are poor. Characters are good or evil and mostly cardboard thick. She also does not have a real working understanding of how business really works as she has her lead characters making decisions without cost benefit analysis. You'll also wanna take her approach to sex with a grain of salt.I gave this three stars cause I think there's enough in here that it's worth reading and adding to your knowledge. I can't give it more cause I think too many people accept the good with the bad and end up with a non-workable philosophy.

Be educated, there's still time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Objectivism, like most philosophies that can be described in a sentence or two, is an oversimplification of reality. Rand sees a world populated by a few builders and the rest looters. This is not to say that her theme is false--it's only true part of the time and for isolated circumstances. One need only read as far as Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath to find a literary rebuttal, validated all the more by the fact that his book is based on real people/places/events from America's dustbowl 30s rather than Rand's ficticious dystopia. California had its own version of builders in the form of truck farmers and orchardists--both labor-intensive endeavors. And although they were builders in their own right, they were also looters, worst of all, they were looters of the downtrodden, the displaced farmers of the dustbowl.Rand wrote \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" in 1957--eighteen years after \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" At first I wondered if her work was only a diatribe of her close encounter with the Russian Revolution of her formative years. Many of the events she contrived for 'Atlas' had a familiar ring to life under Lenin's Bolsheviks. Then I began to wonder if she wrote it in answer to Steinbeck, a way of saying his masterpiece ignored an important other side of the coin.Another profound rebuttal can be found in Daniel Quinn's telepathic gorilla, \\"Ishmael.\\" Quinn, or rather Ishmael, grouped both the builders and the looters into a single class that he called takers. Consider the crowning achievement of Rand's star builders, Dagny and Rearden, the John Galt Line. Look at the habitat destruction caused by all those mine tailings, the CO2 added to the atmosphere from Rearden's steel mills, the erosion caused by setting rail lines in pristine mountain passes. It would seem that Rand's hero-builders are also looters.Rand's thinking is anachronistic, like the steel and rail industries she extols. Even in 1957 she must have foreseen that America was in the process of molting off its rustbelt industries. I will give her credit for focusing on the innovativeness of Rearden Metal and of the weird engine that draws static electricity from the air. She is right to point that out as a distinctly American virtue. Only an American society could have come up with a concept like blue jeans. However, her motives seem increasingly misplaced as the global population increases. She would have all heroes motivated by nothing more than greed--to make a buck. We need to do more than just make a buck today. We need to create a society that can prosper in the absence of population growth, one that can be better husbands of the planet.Rand 'heroizes' the kind of people that I currently cannot stand. I'm 57 now. When I was in my 30s, I admired them and strove to be like them. I must have been insufferable. I am now trying to be like one of the people she can't stand--the writers/artists that were invited to Lillian Rearden's party, perhaps not as phony. However, I'm probably no less insufferable.--Ejner Fulsang, author of A Destiny of Fools, Aarhus Publishing"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ok, so apparently you guys aren't getting it.

But I finished the book and was glad I did. An enlightening read for anyone considering putting it in their shopping cart. Not a page turner, in my opinion, but well worth your while"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book bothered me from the moment I picked it up many years ago. Why? Many reasons. It's poorly written, in a simplistic, abrasive style. The characters are just NOT believable. Ms. Rand's personal hangups and peculiarities percolate every page. It's repetitive. The narrative - what narrative? Philosophy? Only an ignorant American could call it one. A great business book? Are you kidding me? The author is a failed Hollywood writer. And speaking of the author - have you ever seen an interview with her? Abrasive like her prose, and spoke with a terrible accent. /sarcMy point is made. Your Berkeley literature professor will hate this book and have good reasons to do so, in a technical sense. So why is this book so important? Why do so many people keep reading and discussing it, 55 years after its publication? Who is John Galt?He is VALIDATION and he is HOPE. Validation comes as you realize that what you have always suspected deep inside may indeed be the case, disturbing as it might be. Hope comes as you read about the death of a corrupt order and the rebirth of something new and pure. Hope comes from the picture of humanity shaking off the chains of oppression, as the Moses figure leads it out of the darkness and into the light.Atlas Shrugged appears to be a book, but it isn't. It's a political and religious pamphlet, the relevance of which grows with every passing year, as we watch the accelerating process of systemic rot. Ms. Rand didn't live to witness the liberation she anticipated. We can pray and hope that the current generation will."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Being that this is a review, and not a long-winded critique, I would first address the central premise of this novel, stated by John Galt, which essentially praises the virtues of selfishness, and the evils of what Rand considers altruism. The Websters Dictionary defines altruisim as unselfish concern for the welfare of others. I don't see how someone who considers the welfare of others, as being evil. Perhaps what is meant refers to people who claim to be altruists but use and manipulate others to their own advantage. This would make more sense. Although I do consider self-respect as healthy, arrogance and greed, in the manner of an Enron executive (to cite one of many examples), has proved detrimental to the society that we all live in. And what if we didn't have the SEC? Skilling and company would have gotten away with it.Rand loves to criticize what she calls \\"the second-handers.\\" Yet, her idea of nobel selfishness is taken from Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. She further borrows from Nietzsche, yet with none of his originality or depth. Aristotle is another author whom she borrows from. So much for originality.Moreover, Hank Rearden of Rearden Steel, is one of the main characters in the book, and the government and others (whom Rand refers to as \\"mouchers\\") do all they can to try and thwart his efforts toward success. Ask yourselves this: Has anyone ever tried to stop Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, just to name a few, through government regulations or anything of the kind? Were Hank Rearden to create his product in our world, no one would stop him, anymore than anyone had tried to stop Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. Such inventors are neither despised nor shun by the world. In fact, quite the opposite. Rand's philosophy was more applicable to Stalinist Russia than the United States.Rand, and the Republican Party, ultimately envision a society much like mid-Victorian England, when government interference was unheard of, the marketplace was king, and private philanthrophy was tolerated. Notice that I wrote \\"tolerated.\\" Rand has written that those who want to help the poor shall not be stopped. Unlike Neitzsche, who envisioned a \\"superman\\" who used his brillance and cunning to lord over others, Rand clearly does not believe that that one must live at the expense of others, and this is very much to her credit -- although she shows no concern for the exploitation of labor.Rand continually mentions what she calls \\"parasites, cheats, leaches, etc., but who are the true parasites? How about the ultra, super, mega-rich CEO with his 54 credit M.B.A. who gets government bail-out money, and ships jobs overseas where there are no labor rights -- or civil rights for that matter -- and gets ultra-cheap labor? How, again, is that not exploitive? Are not such companies the true parasites with their opportunistic agenda?And thus the Republican chant of \\"you are not owed free health care, you are not owed a living, come to the forground as detrimental to laissez faire capitalism. But we don't owe the well to do free labor either, and the working class are neither useable peonage nor disposable chattel. As taxpayers who do pay their taxes, and don't have cunning attornies seeking loopholes, we, the living, are neither obligated to live for the sake of a company or any other entity. I certainly don't think we are getting undeserved handouts, epsecially when the per capita income rises for the well to do, and the working-class income remains stagnant -- for those who even have a job.I know of no one who wants a handout, and the unselfish concern and devotion one is required to exhibit toward the company one works for (as companies demand selfless, slavish devotion, no unions, yet send jobs overseas when it is to their convenience) -- is that not altruism on the worker's part? The working class also work for the profit motive. Does Rand imply that only the well to do have the right to be selfish? Does the wealth, privilege, and power of the rich justify wage slavery? Well, the Republicans do considered the well to do as being oppressed -- if only by those who have the courage to stand disagree with them.As an example of how this addresses our current society, consider the \\"Occupy Wall Street\\" movement. A typical platitude of Gingrich (and most, if not all, of the illiberal Republicans) is \\"Why don't they get a bath and get a job?\\" Well, smirking arrogance has certainly never benefited humanity. And to take a bath, one must first have a job -- even when the unemployment is so high -- in order to afford even soap. If the working class are not paid a liveable wage, how then can the Gross Domestic Product be stimulated? -- by eliminating minimum wage and shipping jobs overseas?If the educated are drowning in debt due to student loans, and Wall Street and the mega-rich live tax free, in fact bailed out by the taxpayers, should one just shut up and not dare say anything negative about this? How can this be considered freedom? We also are rationally selfish, therefore, freedom of the mind is the right to disagree; our country was founded upon these principles. Wrote Nietzsche, \\"Freedom is the will to be responsible to ourselves.\\"Is the \\"Occupy Wall Street\\" movement looking for free handouts? Do we as taxpayers owe the fatcats on Wall Street a free bailout? If we pay taxes, shouldn't they? How about the 30 corporations that didn't pay taxes last year? How about the CEO of General Electric who receives billions in tax returns? And these are the folks who Republicans believe are repressed! Should the working class be thankful to slave for their jobs, pay taxes, yet through legal cunning and legerdemain, a percentage of the well to do live tax free?The Republicans will tolerate no dissagreement with their philosophy. And yet, if someone is sitting peacefully on the ground to make their social statement, should they be pepper sprayed? Wrote Rand, \\"The initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral. Force and mind are opposites.\\" According to the Republicans, anyone who doesn't agree with Republican dogma should just shut up, and they deeply long for the days when there was no minimum wage, no Social Security, no unemployment compensation -- in short when people stood in soup lines, and lived in \\"Shanty Towns.\\" But Lincoln once wrote, \\"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.\\"Rand extoles the virtues of the great industrialists, who are certainly at top of the food chain, and she seems to imply that they are the great, modern-day versions of Atlas. The supermen versus hoi polloi. And this is how our modern iliberal Republicans view themselves, and those who possess the greatest wealth. So, those who are wealthy and in power deserve it due to their much vaunted superiority. Therefore, they are wealthy, and they deserve it; we are poor and we deserve it. This is a main problem with Rand's philosophy. I can certainly agree with most of what she writes, but the wealthy are certainly not oppressed and do not face the hobson's choice that the working class often does. So, as radical individuals, who are not \\"second-handers,\\" we collectively agree that Ayn Rand is the spokesperson for absolute truth. All who disagree with her a parasites, worthless bacteria, or what ever ad hominem arguement you wish to individually employee. As long as you don't disagree with Rand, you are an independent radical individual.Rand also wrote, \\"What is great about man is not his reverence for a god, but the reverence that is due to a god.\\" I don't know about other readers, but I live for myself, not to worship those who clandestinely pull the strings in congress, i.e., rich industrialists, CEOs etc. I would add that wisdom does not bow to unbrideled arrogance.To me, much of her philosophy smacks of a caste system: one-upmanship. But the control for ages has been to rescue liberty from the grasp of executive power, and this would include Rand's supermen, or CEOs as we now call them.Who is John Galt? I am not sure he would align himself with any political party. Also, I wonder if Galt, as a genius scientist, created a race of superman (and women) more intelligent with greater-than-human aptitude than Galt possesses, what would be the result? What if these supermen wanted to create a new society without the inferior humans? Rand loved employing ad hominem arguements against anyone who dared to disagree with her -- as do most Republicans with their childish name calling. How would the superman that Galt created deal with her?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As much as The Fountainhead was a stunning, original piece of literature, Atlas Shrugged falls flat in comparison. It is overly long and extremely repetitive in hammering home the same basic concepts without adding anything substantial in the process. Let's not even get into the preposterousness of the basic plot of the book itself: an attempt at secession by the world's greatest minds to recreate their own perfect society from scratch. Never mind the fact that with what we now know about Mendelian genetics, a couple like John Galt and Dagny Taggart could have kids and... have them turn out to be a couple of Wesley Mouchs and Jim Taggarts.Also, Rand's writing style in this book hasn't aged well. It could be seen as quiant and dated, or in many cases, simply corny and outdated.If Ayn Rand would have you know her perfect world, Galt's Gulch would be populated by nothing but chain-smoking, tall, thin, angular, beautiful Aryan egotists. So which topflight secessionist doctor would take care of all their eventual cases of lung cancer? Anecdotally, many of the smartest people I've met have often been short, pudgy and unattractive... while some of the tall, beautiful people Rand seemed to worship turned out to be real boneheads. There aren't many of them, but the true intellectual elite come in all kinds shapes, sizes and colors.Also, I find it interesting that the protagonist Dagny Taggart beds ALL the leading men in ascending order of importance... and they all work it out happily in the end. I find it completely implausible that these three great men (D'Ancona, Reardon, and Galt) would all fall madly in love with a woman who thinks and acts... just like a man. If history has taught us anything, it's that the world's great statesmen and industrialists usually marry women for their beauty and fertility, not necessarily their minds.As an unabashed stand-in for Rand's own view of herself, Dagny Taggart's actions and the endless romantic mind games that she goes through with the three men only reflect the fact that Rand herself was in an open marriage... an open marriage that she basically imposed upon her cuckolded, resentful husband... and sought to rationalize and legitimize it by including it clumsily in her work.None of the concepts of Rand's pseudo-philosophical \\"objectivism\\" are furthered in this book. You could read the Fountainhead and get all that you will ever get out of Rand out of that book. What Atlas Shrugged has done is spawn almost an entire generation of egomaniacs who pretended to understand her works and identify themselves with her superhuman protagonists, only to find that people are human and have weaknesses. They sought to live up to Rand's Superhuman ideal, only to find themselves fallible, but still with the massive ego. In fact, the sheer MASS of overinflated egotism in this book made it painful to read at times.We all know now that you can't have a society with all Chiefs and no Indians. We also now know that though Ayn Rand/Dagny Taggart may find nothing more beautiful than a smokestack billowing greenhouse gases, the Earth's environment is indeed finite and limited and not just another resource to be exploited by man in the name of the almighty $$. Rand tried to elevate her worship of Capitalism-- and thus her concept of \\"Objectivism\\"-- to a form of philosophy or religion, but seemed to not grasp the fundamental limitations of it to as merely for only human political and socialogical ends. I found particularly specious and laughable her attempt to somehow attribute Capitalistic motivations behind Richard Halley's classical musical compositions... as if every superior human endeavour, including artistic ones, could be attributed to Capitalism.Just read The Fountainhead. It's so superior to this book in every way, and it is written so much more succinctly. Rand seemed to be able to identify with superhuman men, she should've hired one to edit this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged twice at different times in my life...I loved it then and love it now.

Greed, selfishness, and egotism are praised and guilt, sacrifice, and pain are denounced. We are taught to never live our lives for anyone else, nor expect others to live their lives for us. The world belongs to those who take it. Yet there was an issue in this novel that was very difficult to battle with. If the world cheats you out of what you fully deserve, what your mind has created, and what your hands have molded, should you in fact leave the world? Should you leave your creation behind and give up on mandkind? The story's main character battles with this issue for quite some time. The main question of this novel boils down to what would you tell him if you saw Atlas, the carrier of the world, struggling so hard to carry the weight of the earth and yet the harder it stuggled the more the world bore heavily down upon his shoulders....You would tell him to shrug. You would tell him not to care about the world anymore; to leave the place where he is unwanted. This was an excellent book with many life lessons intertwined in a simplistic plot. If I had any criticism to offer it would be that a lot of superflous, repetitive paragraphs were inserted in the novel to bulk it up. I felt the novel could be shortened by about 200 pages. I also felt the ending to be anti-climaxal. I expected this exuberant feeling at the end; a feeling of success and contentment but all I felt was a distant lonliness and sadness.

So you decide whither you want to read it or not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I treasure Rand's illumination of human dignity, the worthiness of work, creativity and intellect, even though she fails to adequately support what seems (to this amateur) to be a naive philosophy. In the former she unwittingly gives glory to the Creator and Lord of those things, while she derides the only foundation of what she worships.On the literary merits I won't comment, other than to say the reviewers below have done an excellent job. This is the only Rand I have read so far."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I found it to be somewhat of a diatribe preaching to type A workaholics.

I would recommend Atlas Shrugged to anyone. But the print in this particular edition is very small and strains my eyes. Get another edition with larger print for comfort in reading this very good book and very long book!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First off, I want to tell people who are liberals that Ayn Rand specifically says that she doesn't take sides in politics. People that are liberals are very different from people that are objectivists. Secondly, Rand's theory is very idealistic and would only happen in her version of utopia. Nevertheless, she uses reason and logic for the main focal points of objectivism.Atlas Shrugged is a book about how man can triumph over the basic tenets of society and challenge the different beliefs. I am 18 years old and read this book just this year. This book helped me understand Rand's theory of Objectivism better even though it was fiction. I feel that she chose her characters very well and used many symbols to spread her message.John Galt is an excellent character that brings many of the other free thinkers and takes them to his own utopia. His symbol is a dollar sign, which many people think is very egotistical. Rand wants to show that it isn't bad to think differently and not agree with traditional views. The story is a little slow at the beginning, but picks up once she sets the setting and the plot.There are two ways to read Atlas Shrugged: You can just read the book while knowing nothing about Ayn Rand or objectivism, or you can research objectivism before you read the book and then have a better understanding of it. Many people interpret objectivism wrongly and give it a bad image because they don't understand the main views of it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I find it amusing that most of the people that I know who cherish this book also consider themselves Christians. The central message of this book is just the opposite of &quot;Love Thy Neighbor.&quot; If you are already very selfish and in need of a long, Russian-style novel to justify it to yourself, this is your book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I cannot have read the same book as the reviewers who are giving it fouror five star ratings. Life changing? Oh, come now! These same ideas are inevery corner nowadays. To hear these same conclusions, one might listen to aboutan hour of conservative talk radio and about thirty minutes of NPR andbe through with it. Else, one can devote days or weeks to this insufferableharangue.The characters in this novel are all unnatural, unendearing, uninspiring andridiculous. After the first two hundred pages or so, I couldn't take it anymore andwent into hyperskim mode. Even then it was torture to get through. Objectivism bedamned; all of the major characters are deranged. The heroine, as much as I cheeredfor her at the start, is one of the biggest empty skirts of any novel I've ever read.I hate to say this, but the author must have had some seriously depraved relationships in her life.If you're considering reading this book and you've got one hell of a lot of time towaste, then knock yourself out. Otherwise, I would avoid this one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand lived a tough life, there's no doubt about that. She suffered through the Russian Revolution and somehow survived in America and managed to make a semi-successful career as a writer. All of that aside, her writing reaches average at best. Her dialogue and character descriptions are so out-right and blatant and the philosophy she bases around reason and creative thought contradicts itself with her dogmatic forcefulness. She herself scolded any of her followers for questioning her. This book has a place and a time, appropriate for teenagers finding their way through adolescence. Otherwise, it is a drawn-out work of average merit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you intend to read this book for the joy of literature, by all means, do as you please. However, should you choose this book in search of some philosophical enlightenment reccomended by friends or mentors, I warn you - read with a panoptic gaze! Rand uses a series of tricks and machinations to seduce the reader into believing her opinions. Interestingly enough, to those who read more of her works, in &quot;Philosophy: Who Needs It?&quot; Rand claims that evil philosophers often use beautiful writing to convey their evil messages so that you subconsciously know them. Her writing represents the epitome of this claim! Her criticism of popular socialist movements are unfounded in that they make several false assumtions: 1. Socialism ALWAYS turns into a military and dictatorial authoritarian egalitarianism. 2. Socialism NEVER works. (see France, Britain, China although a bad example) 3. Socialism ALWAYS denies self-worth. The humorous part is that her solution (WARNING: some may think this part spoils the plot a little) is to topple such a regime by destroying it and all that support it! GREAT! The deaths of the socialists are AOK by her, because they're worthless people anyway! At the heart of her philosophy is an elimination of concern for others, and although she makes it seem glamourous, it is far from it. When the book was originally published, some people actually did what she advocates in Atlas Shrugged, society didn't crumble, and no regime was toppled. Her dream is a utopian vision with no light at the end of the tunnel beside the illusory one she paints with this book. Reading this book taught me to hate capitalism, objectivism, and all that she stands for. Read it to understand the arguments and fallacies that she utilizes in it. You will most likeley enjoy reading it, but when there is a philosophical passage, do not lose face. The book is a step backwards in social progress and only serves to reinforce the growing cult of fitness, strength, and regularity in those who follow it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is only good if you buy in to right-wing BS. For the rest of us, it is insufferable, long, and boring."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved this book when I was 19, immature and foolish. It's a political diatribe masquerading as Literature. There's a story in it, but it's mostly lecture. Rand was an upper class Russian whose family money and connections enabled her to escape to the West. She then wrote several novels of the most outlandish, backlash fiction that described her fantasy of aristocratic, dominant men and smart but submissive women operating in a naively imagined world of black and white values and evil government. In these stories, individualism is the only true value, elitism is justifiable, and money is the true measure of a mans worth. Men, not women, are the heroes of these stories, but they come with a token female who's accomplished enough to be worthy of them. The sex is violent, with rare, beautiful women who crave domination. Rand clearly loved men and knew how to appeal to them. Unfortunately, Rand's phobic, anti-government context resonates with some, hence the adoption of her most egregious novel as the Bible of U.S. anti-government cabals."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After many years of building a business from scratch, fighting the government to keep more of what I produce, and creating jobs for many people, I took time over the last few days and read Ryn's work.

It's uncanny that in 1957 Rand could have conceived a novel with the exact real scenario in today's economy but it's total right on target.The book starts slow because the reader needs to really get use to Rand's style and symbolism but keep plugging because after a short while you will recognize the underlining theme. Atlas Shrugged is a classic but oh so relevant for today.It doesn't mean that Rand's conclusion is the correct one, you decide."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am a fan of Ayn Rand and enjoy all her writings, so I am biased towards her works. With that said...Atlas Shrugged tells the story of the producers versus the takers. Through 1168 pages of small print, Rand gives example after example why the industrialists should be praised and not vilified. Rand also explains that all workers have value, if they are doing the best they can, at the jobs they can do.Atlas Shrugged also explains the mind set of the people that vilify the successful, the inventors, the creators.If you look at the U.S.A. right now, with the government bailing out companies, the new administration's desire to tax the rich and give to the rest, Atlas Shrugged discusses what happens when the producers are forced to shoulder more of the world.Atlas Shrugged is an amazing fictional story, based on a philosophy of reaching for greatness and being self-reliant, instead of looking to others for your well being."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is noted as saying she considers her interest in philosophy only as a tool to support her love of writing fiction. However, as Atlas Shrugged clearly exemplifies, Rand is a master of articulating her philosophy by means of her fiction.Atlas Shrugged provides a storyline that expresses Rand's vision of Objectivism so well that one need not have any formal outline of her values beyond the storyline to comprehend her philosophy. Ironically, the speech by Galt to the nation that defines the philosophy in full and seemingly was added to clarify Objectivism as a whole was hardly needed to convey the message as the plot was so well contrived that it accomplished the task with ease. Thus if Atlas Shrugged has a weakness, it is in Rand's seemingly lack of interest in brevity; however, the perpetual nature of the storyline easily diffuses this issue.Rand has the remarkable ability in this book to provide both eloquent expression of surroundings and emotion in conjunction with a plot line that builds and recesses to an eventual climax. Early on we are led to believe that we are in search of answers to questions that have not yet been fully formulated. This pursuit of truth is coordinated with the defining natures of her characters. The meaning of the disappearance of so many productive figures from society is nearly presented many times only to be taken away leaving the reader left yearning for more when those answers were abruptly thwarted (such as Francisco's meeting with Hank at the mills). This style of narrative provides an abundance of interest while establishing the mindset of Rand's philosophy.Much has been said regarding the manner in which Rand has expressed Objectivism in this book. Rand is often accused of creating a far too bipolar characterization of people, as well as an unrealistic mindset of the book's adversaries. Defense of her views is superfluous, as the philosophy either stands on its own merit or falters. However, Rand's use of lucid dialog and expression of character flaws to communicate her ideals, even while reaching to extremes, is clearly with the guided intent of making her point. We should also recall that Rand entered this world deep in the heart of the Soviet Union where such people of extreme socialistic views were not uncommon, perhaps suggesting the possibility that her characterizations are extreme only when viewed by those growing up in a \\"free\\" society.Rand presents a work of fiction that illustrates an atypical philosophy, not a commentary on human nature. While the manner may be close in nature, any critical thinking of this book will produce the obvious nature of the difference and come to the conclusion that Rand does an admirable job expressing her vision whether the philosophy is sound or not.I highly recommend reading Atlas Shrugged to those interested in undertaking any critical thinking. Rand presents a disciplined and unyielding philosophy that deserves both scrutiny and consideration. One has the added benefit of discovering Objectivism within the realm of an enjoyable fictional piece that includes mystery, romance, industry, and plenty of action. While there are many great philosophers whose work might rank higher in overall consideration, few among them would be as aptly capable of wrapping their position into a separate and pleasing storyline as Rand has bestowed with Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is great and the lecturer is very clear. However, I thought it was the complete novel, but this is the second part only and I have been having trouble to find part No. 1."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After hearing repeatedly for years and years about author Ayn Rand's work, centered mostly around Atlas Shrugged, I didn't quite believe the hype. For one thing, in such celebrated books, it usually takes two or three readings to gain an understanding of it's purpose let alone what the characters are talking about in a given scene (such as it is in Lord of the Rings).To my dismay towards myself, I was utterly wrong.Rand weaves an unbelievalbe tapestry of logic and common sense in a fictional story that actually describes her philosophy of Objectivism. In the very first chapter you learn so much about the dangers of socialism, communism, and the 'benefit of all at the expense of the one'. Much of society's ills today, related to socialism programs in the United States and abroad, are metaphorically represented in this book written so many years and years ago, to which Rand was obviously foretelling our unstable future. In just one chapter, written so long ago, our society today is summed up and it's not good, not good at all.Ayn Rand is a superb writer, matching complexity with describing simplicity. You then realize the story, as life itself, is not so complex at all, that its up to individuals and groups that make it that way. Never before have I ever related so closely to an author. I promise you, after one chapter, you will be hooked just as I have, but unlike scientology you won't join a cult."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"While I prefer \\"The Fountainhead\\" to \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" overall, this is the most pure embodiment of Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism ever penned, and it is perhaps the best anti-socialism novel ever written; it's certainly the best I've ever read. The book concerns itself with the travails of three great thinkers and industrialists, Dagny Taggart (railroad tycoon,) Hank Rearden (uber-metallurgist,) and Francisco d'Anconia (copper magnate, and general industrialist-at-large.) Ultimately they are united with other great thinkers by the mysterious John Galt, who typifies independent thinking capitalism. The overall philosophy here is very libertarian: keep government small and designed strictly for essentials, dramatically limit the welfare state, and allow free markets to be really free. Any type of government intervention (socialism, communism, fascism) is demonized in the objectivist manifesto.The actual world that the characters find themselves in is very bleak. Socialism has taken over the rest of the world, and is eating away progressively at America. The protagonists in the book are so principle-driven as to be almost unbelievable; nevertheless they are very compelling. The most likeable character is Dagny, and she presents a very well defined character study. Pages 193-206 shed more light on her character than any others, although her exhortation on page 815 to her sister-in-law, \\"first, above all, don't be afraid,\\" is perhaps the best single-line distillation of her ethos.The book does have some detractions. Much of the science in the book, while at the time was very futuristic, has not weathered the ages well and now comes across as amazingly bogus. This wouldn't be such an issue, but the book is very long (1069 pages) and a large portion of it is devoted to descriptions of technicalities. Additionally, the party line of objectivism is to embrace atheism, a philosophy that, interestingly, most conservatives and free market thinkers in America don't embrace now, and certainly didn't when the book was written.On a more structural note, in the third section of the book, John Galt gives an extremely long radio monologue (it lasts from page 923 to page 979 nonstop) about the dangers of going down the road to socialism. I actually agree with the bulk of his speech, but it is extremely long-winded and repetitive (I especially dislike Galt's repetitive use of the term \\"blank-out\\" in the speech,) and it could have been substantially shorter. Although it is the true essence of Rand's (Galt's) philosophy, it could have been distilled to a much less tedious passage. Having said that, the speech makes numerous wonderful points, my favorite of which is on page 926 when he says \\"To think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call 'human nature,' the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness.\\" The concept that man is free to think and decide the course of his life on his own is the key to this book, and I think this single sentence encapsulates the essence of the enormity of the book.The book has a very good synopsis of Ayn Rand and her philosophy in the \\"About the Author\\" section starting on page 1070, which will help her new readers better understand her viewpoints; likewise the introduction by Leonard Peikoff also includes many revealing insights about Rand, although it gives away several plot developments, so it's best to read last if you have never read the book before.There are certainly things I would change about this book; the length is excessive for one, much is repetitive, a feature that reinforces major points, but anyone intelligent enough to enjoy this book doesn't need that much reinforcement to understand her points. Overall, though, this is a great novel, an important book, and one that every free-thinker should read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have just finished reviewing another of Ayn Rand's books, THE FOUNTAINHEAD, and can only say how profoundly the meanings of these books have affected me.

There are indeed several long speeches made by characters that do interrupt the narrative. Additionally, I found it somewhat fantastic that every male protagonist fell hopelessly in love with the female protagonist based solely on her character and principals. However, and I've never said this about a book before, I personally found the faults were charming.It's also the most terrifying book I've read in 2012. There are eerie parallels. President Obama's \\"you didn't build that\\" remarks almost echo a speech made by one of the antagonists, making it wonderfully amusing for me to read the reviews about how \\"unbelievably evil and stupid\\" her \\"villains\\" are. The book is full of politicians using sweeping regulations to bypass congress, much like the FTC, EPA, and other non-elected governmental bodies do. The book does hold a mirror up to the American political process, though I will admit it is a somewhat warped mirror.What is saddening is that so many people read this book and reject her philosophy as wrong. I urge you, even if you disagree with her philosophy, please do not simply dismiss this book, because, I assure you, this is how many people today see the political machinations at work. And if you do not see it as truth than ask why so many do.

Ann Rand eloquently illustrates what happens to societies when socialism overruns common sense and individualism. She takes her readers into a step-by-step scenario of how socialistic ideals creep gradually into a democracy and chisel away at individual freedoms until seemingly reasonable people turn to violent measures to control society.If you value your individual freedoms and a free economy, if you want to protect the ideals of America's Founding Fathers, I suggest you read this book. Yes, it contains over 1,000 pages, but I found that I could not put this book down for too long. I cannot agree with the author on everything she stands for, but I feel she is right on with most of what she says.This book will make you stop and think about current government and liberal policies.

I have had my review below repeatedly down voted as \\"not helpful\\". I am eager to learn and do better, so if you are inclined to down vote this review, please take the time to post a brief comment about what is not helpful here, and I will then edit it to improve it. So far no one who has down voted me has ever said what they dislike in the below.So the review:This novel hardly needs a review to encourage someone to buy it, when you consider one point alone: It is over 50 years old and people still read it and enjoy it. It is a classic and nothing I can say can detract from that.But it is also a product of its time, espousing a philosophy that is only internally consistent if one makes rather more assumptions than the author admits to. The characters all speak with Ayn Rand's voice, in a manner that might be familiar to readers of Galileo perhaps, but not so much with readers of a good modern novel. The characters feel unreal. The whole setting is preposterously unreal, and here is a novel that would have been better set in an alternate universe of a science fiction writer, in the manner - say - of Philip Dick's \\"The Man in the High Castle\\". Perhaps that was her intent in fact, but she gives us no anchor into the world she is describing and the action of the novel dances across an empty stage.For anyone seeking rich characterizations, realistic interactions, or a sense of place in the narrative, you will be disappointed in this novel. The novel is merely the platform for Rand's polemic, and jumps from unbelievable to the preposterous without apology.This being said, it was still a jolly good read. The conflict in the novel is engrossing and draws you in quickly. The first time someone defeats a \\"looter government\\", you want to applaud. When Dagny (the protaganist) completes a railway line against all the odds you can feel her exhilieration - even if you wonder how she managed it! The concept of the plot is refreshingly original, and readers will want to finish the novel.Given its length though, finishing can be tricky - especially where it comes to a 90 page speech espousing Rand's epistemology. Some aspects of the plot were also tiring, and one wonders whether the book could have achieved its purpose whilst being edited a little. Ok, the 90 page speech was probably why she wrote the book - but perhaps Rand forgets the maxim here: \\"show don't tell\\"Ultimately though, the book's philosophy suffers for being the product of an age that does not exist any longer. Marxism is a target of Rand's polemic, but also social programmes that have clearly worked and brought tremendous benefit to the world (including the US), such as the Marshal plan. At the same time, she defends a world of producer industrialists that largely no longer exist now, and rather misses the point that invention in our modern world is hardly the preserve of big business (even if only businesses have the resources to patent their inventions). I could say more on this, but this is a review - not a critique, so I will stop!I give the book 4 stars despite all this criticism, because I do not regret having read it. I enjoyed it, I thought about it, I disagree with a good deal of it, but I do not regret it. Neither will you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The recent financial crisis and government action-heavy response have resulted in a resurgence of interest in Ayn Rand. Atlas Shrugged, with its focus on the economy and Rand's views on capitalism, is particularly applicable.Atlas Shrugged follows its protagonist, railroad executive Dagny Taggart, and other industrialists and entrepreneurs as they react to and struggle for success in business notwithstanding a government exerting more and more control over the economy and industry. The politicians do not do it alone; they are heavily assisted by rent-seeking crony capitalists and their lobbyists. This famously culminates in the entrepreneurs going on \\"strike.\\"Where Rand uses archetypes in The Fountainhead to explore her ideas about art and architecture, in Atlas Shrugged she uses science fiction tropes to explore her ideas about business and economics. Atlas Shrugged asks a big 'What If?' and runs with it. Unfortunately, like pretty much all science fiction set in the near-future, Atlas Shrugged has suffered from virtually all its assumptions and predictions around the big 'What If?' being wrong. Its biggest--the unsustainability of communism--was correct, but post-communist Russia is hardly paradise for entrepreneurs and capitalists.Rand's work shines when it stays character-driven and suffers when event-driven. The rescue attempt at the end of Atlas Shrugged is almost ludicrously bad. On the hand, the building of the John Galt Line and the tunnel disaster in Atlas Shrugged are masterful. Her prose is quite beautiful, if a bit on the ornate side. While her idealized protagonists (Galt) tend to be rather flat and dull, her less-than-perfect protagonists (Reardan) are much more interesting, and her antagonists can be downright terrifying (most of the crony capitalists, lobbyists, and politicians from Atlas Shrugged). For a female writer, Rand's female characters are curiously unsympathetic (although Dagny Taggart is far, far more sympathetic than Dominique Francon).Atlas Shrugged is a book about ideas, and I appreciate that. It is certainly preferable to reading actual philosophy tracts. The philosophy is not always well interwoven into the story, however, most famously in Galt's seventy page monologue near the end of the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The most disappointing part of this novel is, after having been forewarned, how close to the truth it has all become.

By encasing her philosophy of Objectivism in a fictional setting, Rand enables the reader to apply her ideals to a societal setting that is easily understood by the masses. This format creates reader empathy towards Rand's cause because her reader can easily sympathize with the heros' and heroines' struggles, while effectively provoking the hatred towards her intendeds. Even if the reader does not embrace her Objectivist's ideals, this is still an excellent book for those whose goal is to work for a purpose, strive for higher grounds, and whom do not compromise their integrity to the moment.

At first I was deeply dissapointed to have to read a 1000 page book, but once I started reading it, I could not stop. I personally do not agree with objectivism, but Ayn Rand, brings you into Dagny's life. You find yourself w/ relating to the characters and their struggles, and dreams . I have also read Anthem, by Ayn Rand, and find Atlas Shrugged her best work, by far. Atlas Shrugged is now a beloved book by me, and the rest of my english class. John Galt will live forever!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I love the story of the book. I happen to like Ayn Rand's philosophy, but even if you don't that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the book. Also, if you're not reading it for the philosophy, there's huge sections you can just skip -- you'll know them when you get to them.Other than liking the plot, my favorite thing about this book is Dagny Taggart, a main character, female, strong willed, intelligent and sexy. She is, in a word, cool."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this book 5 years ago-I've read it again twice (as well as The Fountainhead, Anthem and various Rand non-fiction) and each time I read it I know I am not mistaken in saying that Ayn Rand was a true genius. This book changed my life; it says everything I always felt and wanted to say but could never find the words to express. This book has it all: philosophy, politics, history, science, economics, ethics, psychology, passion and romance! However, not for the faint hearted (over 1,000 pages long), but if you've got the curiosity to find out who is John Galt and the intellectual capacity to understand what John Galt means to all of us you'll have no trouble finishing this novel. Passion + Intellect make this book POWERFUL in its message and an outstanding achievement!! It took my breath away-WOW!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My boyfriend asked me to read this novel before we started to go out. I loved it! I have read it 6 times since. John Galt's speech is finely written, but it is more for the unintellect because it says the same thing over and over again. Maybe Ayn Rand could have said the same thing she wanted in 20 pages instaed of the 70 page speech. I has changed my life though. I will never foget the meaning of the book. I have read many other Ayn Rand novels since. Atlas Shrugged was the first but not the last."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book as a 17 year old, and now, 25 years later am reading it as a 42 year old. At 17, the book was inspiring and motivating toward the potential for individual excellence. At 42, it is still a wonderful ride, in that it carries you along with it, making you want to keep reading. As a middle aged adult, it is not as inspiring nor as motivating as it was for an adolescent, but is still a fun read. The characters now seem to me to be less real, and there seem to be less differences between the male and female characters. I find myself more amused by the forced melodrama than at age 17, when it was perfectly attuned to adolescence. I would absolutely recommend this book to teenagers for inspiration and then suggest putting it on the shelf and letting it age for a quarter of a century; then revisit it. It is worth the wait."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The simplicity of the characters and plot is a stroke of genius.

The first time was 14 years ago before I was married, had children, or worked in the corporate world. I always claimed it to be my favorite book and here at age 40 it still is. When I was younger all my unique friends told me to read it but, I thought it would be as weird as them. I was wrong. I think it was even better the second time even if I did know what was going to happen."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is without a shadow of a doubt, the best book I've ever read. Even if you disagree with Rand's ideas - which is no easy task, as she explains them so well so as to make them utterly obvious - the story alone makes it a must-read.This book is filled with power and emotion that will stretch your mind and heart in ways they've never been stretched before. It will leave you in awe of the human mind and spirit with a new-found admiration for the brilliant minds throughout history who have carried mankind to new, greater heights. What a different place this world would be (for the better) if more people read this book. I seriously can't praise it enough.Be selfish and buy this book. It's the most rational thing you can do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My first encounter with Atlas Shrugged was when a friend passed me a very worn paperback that had been given to him by a friend. I imagine it had gone through the hands of several readers before my own. I was dubious when I first received the book, because I had always attributed the work to the stuffiness of a college literary class. I was pleased to find that I was wrong.Rand tells an enthralling, complex story as she incorporates her philosophy into the lives and tribulations of the characters she creates. Even though the 60 page dissertation can be cumbersome to read, it still remains a difficult novel to set aside. I read the book in just over a week's time, even though I don't get much time to enjoy novels due to my job. I simply could not put the novel down. Rand is excellent at making her reader think of the question: \\"What is next?\\" Dagney and the characters invoking positive change are very likeable; the pompous characters who believe in the status quo are as easy to root against as a silent movie villain.When I was finished with my paperback, hand-me-down copy of this phenomenal novel, I regrettably had to discard it due to the fact that several pages fell out after the many readings it had worked through before mine. The sheer size of the novel leaves paperback bindings straining- therefore, I was overjoyed to receive this particular hardbound edition as a gift this year. If you are thinking of buying this novel, it is well worth the price to receive years of enjoyment out of a hard bound edition."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I want to second what one reviewer said about the difficulty of getting into this book. It took me six months to read the first 150 pages - and I was at leisure at the time. Then, when I began a summer of intensive study of Mandarin Chinese, I picked it up again - just to have something else to read after 10 hours of language drill. I got hooked and read the next 500 pages in four evenings. I would sit out in the garden at International House (across from Grant's Tomb) and read until I could not see for the darkness. The sun would set and I wouldn't realize the light had gone until I started squinting. It is a roller coaster of a ride, and I strongly advise any thinking person in their mid-20s to read this. I pity those who casually dismiss this book for ideological reasons."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is rightly considered a classic of our age. It is a celebration of capitalism and rationality. If you are in business or know someone who is, if you've ever secretly thought that you're not worth what they're paying you, this should be required reading.It helps to remember that this book was written in the early 1950s when Communism and Socialism were on the rise and well before most people could see the inherent weaknesses of those social codes. Now that we've seen the world through the tax revolts of Scandinavian socialism, the Thatcher/Reagan years, the fall of the Soviet Union and the commercialization of China, it's easy to forget how many people were predicting the death of capitalism and individualism. History is proving that Rand was right. Individualism wins.All that said, this book is a hard work to get through. Rand frequently spends hours lecturing the reader on her philosophical point of view. I was particularly frustrated with the 50+ page \\"radio address\\" near the end of the book. I get it already. I got it three or four hundred pages ago.I also found the emotions of the characters to be very stilted - no shading or nuance to make them come alive. (And the sex scenes were just weird. Very dominance-obsessed.)On a philosophical note, I strongly agree with her that individual responsibility and individual rights trump collective rights. However, I believe she runs into trouble when you take her arguments to the logical extreme. Two points worth highlighting:Rand argues that all men are or should be rational 100% of the time. We know a great deal more about the mechanics of the mind (both biological and psychological) than was known when this novel was written. Not all men can be rational all the time. To ignore the non-rational levers on our behavior is to sacrifice half your arsenal and to leave yourself prey to those who can pull the levers better than you.Second, I am not so sure that we would be well served by jettisoning all the non-rational social constructs that evolved with our species and our culture. Rand argues that all value must be based on trade. I argue that certain examples of what we usually think of as altruism are in my own best interest - I will pay for public schooling of others to increase the chances that you will become a productive employee rather than a mugger who threatens my life. Rand would argue that I've just proven that altruism does not exist. I agree. My point, though, is that we evolved the social behavior of helping others long before anyone could articulate the cause-and-effect leading to my rational self-interest. What else would Rand argue against that has a rational basis which we just don't understand yet?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;This is the first line of Rand's masterpiece, and the question she devotes the next 1000+ pages to answering. But it is important to know what the question means in order to understand the answer. It does not simply mean &quot;Who is the man who is know by the name John Galt?&quot;Nearly everyone who asks the question in the book is a character without hope, who is searching for a reason why life has not lived up to his expectations. To these people, the question means &quot;Why is the world the way it is?&quot; They pick up the phrase without knowing its meaning because the tone it is asked in contains so much dispair. &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;=&quot;Why is the world crumbling around us?&quot;The world is crumbling because John Galt has destroyed it. He has not declared rebellion, or sabatoged its infrastructure. He has destroyed it by refusing to be its slave, and by convincing others like him to make the same refusal.Once Galt makes his appearance, and the most superficial answer to the question is settled, the question takes on a newer, more noble meaning. It means &quot;Who is this man who can do such a thing? What is there about him that gives him such strength?&quot; Eloquently put, &quot;John Galt is the man who loves his life.&quot; He is a man who defends that life on principle, never sacrificing a moment of his life or a portion of his mind to another. The world may enslave him, but he refuses to forge the chains for them; and without him and others like him, the world is powerless. They can not even torture him without his help.That is who John Galt is."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book when I was quite young, which I believe is an indication that this book is far from boring. From the implication in the title to the very last words...this book held my attention.I can understand the problems some may have with Ayn Rand's views but that is no reason to downplay the books value. There is great value in the fact that it leads you a path of thinking (even if you eventually decide that she is completely wrong). The characters may have seemed a bit two dimensional to some, but I thoroughly enjoyed the reading and (dare I say it!) related to the heroine. It is helpful to remember that this is not really a novel but a thinly veiled forum for Ayn Rand's philosophy.Specifically because I remember this book as having some valuable insight I plan to reread it (which is why I got to the reviews.) I was just a bit surprised at the amount of personal attacks on the author or maybe just the sheer ugliness displayed in some of the reviews. Even is she is a psychopath-which I seriously doubt-this book is a valuable read. A lot of our great thinkers-scientists, psychologists, artists and musicians were at one time or another considered (or actually were) crazy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Nearly 1100 pages long, Atlas Shrugged flows like a 100 page book. I found this great book by Ayn Rand to be an absolutely delightful read. In fact I couldn't put it down.After reading all of the sub 5 star reviews from people who obviously never read the book, I thought I would interject my own thoughts and subit a review.Although a book about economics, Atlas Shrugged i s written in the form of a novel. This nearly 1100 page classic expertly demonstrates why capitolism is the system most beneficial to all people, rich and poor alike; and how punishing those individuals who are responsible for creating wealth (through burdomsome taxation and government regulation) can bring the economy, and the entire country, to a standstill (take a look at what happened to the American economy after Clintons tax hike, the biggest tax hike in history)Atlas Shrugged is must reading for anyone who wants to uncover the truth about creating wealth and what forces can be used to slow down or impede that growth. Atlas Shrugged is a favorite book among the most financially successful people that I know.This 40+ year old classic by Ayn Rand is must reading for all entrepreneurs and wealth builders. Read it, use it and profit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;All you need to destroy Objectivism once and for all is a reasonable argument against it.&quot;Very well. Here are a few at random (by no means an exhaustive list):1. In epistemology, Rand regarded herself as having solved the &quot;problem of universals&quot; when, in fact, she never raised it. Universals, if they exist, are repeatable features of reality; _whether_ they exist is an irreducibly ontological question, not (as Rand thinks) an epistemological one. Rand fancied herself to have found a Third Way between nominalism and realism (&quot;Objectivism&quot;) solely because she identified &quot;universals&quot; with concepts (and abstractions) in the opening paragraphs of ITOE.2. In ethics, Rand built &quot;Objectivism&quot; on a foundation of pure _subjectivism_. Since her ethic _presumes_ that one has made a positive &quot;choice to live,&quot; Objectivism can give no guidance about whether to live or not, and all its ethical injunctions rest on an arbitrary decision about which, strictly speaking, Objectivism can give no guidance.Moreover, having dispensed with any ultimate, objective ethical standard, Rand tried to introduce one anyway by insisting that anyone who did _not_ put the Objectivist ethic into practice was quite literally subhuman, even subanimal. She arrives at this insane view by (very much against her own epistemological standards) identifying &quot;human&quot; with just _one_ attribute of human beings: namely, rationality (understood in her own highly inadequate way). To see how this view works out in practice, read pp. 1054-55 of ATLAS SHRUGGED, where Dagny Taggart quite unnecessarily shoots a guard who has &quot;proven&quot; himself to be less than an animal.3. In politics, Rand sapped all distinctive meaning from the moral concept of &quot;rights&quot; by making respect for rights depend solely on self-interest. That means that, in strict consistency, all Objectivism can say about Hitler's atrocities is that it's a shame he loused up his _own_ life so badly.Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for totalitarianism. The entire federalist system (including the Second Amendment) is supposed to _prevent_ just such a monopoly.I could go on, and sometimes I do ;-). But that will do for now."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This by far the best book I have read in all my 64 years, it should be compulsory reading for senior high school. The logical way that Ayn Rand reduces overt socialism to an unrealistic dream is exciting and compelling. The fall of the communist system was well foretold by this novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Second to the Bible, this is the most profound, impacting, and educational book I have ever read. This book is a Philosophy 101, Politics 101, Economics 101, Sociology 101, and Psychology 101. Some readers will not grasp or appreciate many of the concepts in the book, but those who are tired of incompetence, tired of being manipulated through guilt, tired of seeing people make decisions out of emotion rather than logic, and tired of paying for someone else's living will find this book fantastically liberating.This book is for the self-made-man (or woman) who must combat the bureaucracy of the world, the takers of freedom, and the incompetence and subsistence of its inhabitants in order to succeed.It is incredible that many of the arguments and scenarios portrayed in this 50-year old fiction could be read as everyday news today. It really makes you think twice about America's graduated income tax!This book has a permanent place in my home library, as I will be reading this one again!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is boring the pants off me. I don't really care about any of the characters (including the super-powerful, productive &quot;heroes&quot;)or their actions. Reading this book gives me the creepy feeling that it's some kind of Scientology-like cult manifesto. Is it just me?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is a regression from what was achieved in Rand's earlier fiction. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is suffused with some of the same fantasy elements that twist and turn this novel's plot -- paranoia, absurd villains, instant intimacy at first glance between heroes, irrefutable speeches, clever repartee at dress-up galas, formulaic humiliations for the enemies, etc. Nevertheless, \\"The Fountainhead\\" has a richer feel for people and develops a more solid fictional world. The characters are interesting and almost realistic -- call them two-and-a-half dimensional.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" lacks even these endearments -- the book is mainly filled with cartoon cut-outs. They might as well be talking to one another with speech balloons. I can't say for sure which is worse, the heroes who chatter back and forth repeating the *exact same philosophy without a single variation* (this, in spite of the author's supposed devotion to individualism), or the uniformly mealy-mouthed villains who have nothing whatsoever to do with their lives but attempt to destroy the heroes. You get two of these for the price of one in those scenes which pit a hero against a villain -- Rand devastates her opponents with clever turns of phrases that are the verbal equivalent of \\"Kapow!\\".What happened? Simply this: Rand ceased to understand human beings. Everything is (either good or bad) ideology to her, and the poor robots in the novel must spout it incessantly. Sex, music, money, marriage, cigarettes, love, religion, a good-tasting hamburger, a train wreck -- all is connected in a total system in her mind, all is reduced to \\"bare essentials\\", premises, syllogisms, conclusions. This black-and-white approach is the source of the gray drabness of the novel. Literature, Rand's first-born child, has been immolated on the altar of her intellectual system.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" culminates in the standard Rand piece de resistance, a speech which turns the plot on its ear by dumfounding all the foes with its unassailable logic. If witty put-downs are the fists (\\"punch lines\\") of the novel, The Speech is an atom bomb which, by its simple proclamation, obliterates all opposing thoughts in its blast zone (in \\"The Fountainhead\\", this zone is a courtroom; in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", by a plot trick, it is the whole world via radio). This is the \\"revenge\\" part of the fantasy -- Rand is smashing her ideological foes. Naturally, the stick-figure bad guys in the novel haven't got a chance after that, and they know instantly that they've been beaten by a master.The funny thing about a Rand novel is how every character agrees in the end with her *entire* philosophy. First, there are the good guys; of these there are a) child prodigies who always knew it from age nine and never lost sight of it, and b) ninety-nine percenters who aren't too sure if they agree with *all* of it at the novel's start and whose complete conversion to the Truth will be the story's only character development. Then there are the bad guys; those who either a) already know the Truth and are fighting it with all their being because they want to crush the heroes and make mankind their slave, or b) stupidly oppose the Truth while being secretly afraid of it because they know, deep down, that its really True after all. Finally, there is the Common Man who, once The Speech is proclaimed, has found voice for his inarticulate assent to the Truth at last; he expresses a simple gratitude for his enlightenment to the one(s) who delivered it to him. He cannot hope to match the achievements of the heroes, but his spirit is one with theirs -- they have provided him with a firm foundation for life to come.In this last group we find Rand's fans. These are the people who give copies of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to their teenage children in the feckless hope that it can serve as a substitute religion -- a guide to higher understanding and moral fortitude. Such is the fate of enclosed thought systems with ideals that lead nowhere. The parallel to Marxist-Leninism is most compelling -- Rand's overtly atheistic philosophy has become its own false god."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't believe in God but this book supposedly coming from a woman who valued reason and rationality above everything else is nothing but an insult to intelligence. It's neither literature, nor philosophy. Unfortunately the number of rave reviews that this book receives confirms my suspicion that literacy for masses may not be always a good thing. Did people really need to go through over 1000 pages of small print that are hammering down their throats the axiom that rich people are better than poor people? Did they have doubts that this book helped to dispel? I don't think A. Greenspan and other Rand \\"fans\\" among high-fliers ever saw this book as anything but pseudo-intellectual twaddle coming from a deranged graphomaniac, however they wouldn't be where they are if they missed to see the value of this book for keeping masses of semi-educated half-wits at bay - just as Roman Church once used the Bible and communists - the Manifesto. Beyond that the book is only good as a paperweight. If it was printed on toilet paper I would give it 2 stars for innovation."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There isn't much I can say about Atlas Shrugged that hasn't already been said. This novel is a brilliant piece if literary art. Ayn Rand's ability to articulate her philosophy in this novel is uncanny. This should be required reading in every high school in America."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the greatest novel that has ever been written. My reasons for this statement are as follows:-1. No other SINGLE novel covers an entire philosophic system as this novel does. Rand, while dramatizing her philosophy of Objectivism has dwelt with all important issues pertaining to human existence-metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, economics, art, sex, romantic love and so on. I know no other novel which integrates all these issues into a single plot-structure combining suspense and hard-core action (which is always integrated to an aspect of the overall philosophy).2. Some people say that Rand is not good in literary terms, while she is a perfect philosopher-whereas, it is as a writer that Rand has achieve perfection-while one may question some aspects of her philosophy.There isn't any other story, at least that I've read or heard of, like that of \\"A.S\\". It has an ingeniously contrived, perfect plot-structure-where every character and every event is indispensable to the plot and the meaning of the novel-all being tied together by the purpose the novelist wants to accomplish-all complementing and reinforcing each other.It is one of those few novels where EVERY word counts and contributes to the meaning of the novel and the plot (the other I know, with this particular virtue, is \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne-but which has a far less complex plot-structure than \\"A.S.\\").To achieve this exactitude, focus, concentration and purposefulness is evidence of the genius of the highest order.3. The level of this novel is, to use the same terms, of the highest order.It is a novel of epic proportions. It is a story is about the state of mankind itself. It offers a shocking view of what will happen to the world, in the future, if a particular code of moral values become the sole guide of human life. Further, it offers a radically new vision of the Ideal human society and what will make it possible.It is a novel of giants and monsters-not cheap mediocrities (or of-the-folks-next-door) - of life and death conflicts - not trivial concerns of mediocre people, like- how some hypocrite can't hook a girl for her wealth etc.4. It is a novel which celebrates the best in man. It exhorts man to achieve the highest he is capable of. It upholds the sanctity of human life and the supreme importance of achieving happiness in life.It condemns the use of force and fear in dealing with human beings.It proclaims that man is a heroic and an efficacious being; that evil is impotent and ultimately powerless before the Good; that the world is a place where ultimately the moral, the right, the good shall prevail.And above all, it dramatizes the importance of reason and intelligence in man's life.It also projects the image of the Ideal man, of the Perfect man in John Galt (the same attempt has been made by Dostoevsky in the character of Prince Myshkin in \\"The Idiot\\" and by Victor Hugo in that of Jean Valjean in \\"Les Miserables\\").It does not merely proclaim and show the above (and much more) but answers the question: WHY ? HOW? ( for eg. questions such as-how can man achieve happiness? What should be the proper foundation of relationships between men in society? what is moral or good, immoral or evil ?).You may or may not agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy. But the attempt of this review has been to step outside the specific philosophy and present the virtues of this novel on a broader, abstract level so that it can be compared to other great works of literature. (I can think only of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and \\"Les Miserables\\" as of equal status-in that both Dostoevsky and Hugo have presented their unique philosophic vision with a view to revolutionize human society, combining it with superlative original plot-structure, symbolism, suspense and other elements of a masterpiece-though they don't match \\"A.S.\\" in every respect).On that basis I shall say with full confidence: \\"\`Atlas Shrugged'? NIHIL ULTRA\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was the worst book I ever read. I found the one star reviews more thought provoking than the book itself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have several libertarian friends who recommended this book, and after several years I finally took the plunge. I consider myself a conservative free market capitalist, but not libertarian. Normally I leave the book reports to my kids, but after investing the time in this novel, I thought I'd leave a few thoughts. First, the book certainly makes a few good points about the consequences of government intervention and the potential outcomes from the sort of elitist oligarchy that the Obama administration is trying to implement. In some respects, reading it at this particular time in our American history may have made the book somewhat more powerful. Having said that, this book is hard to recommend for a couple of reasons.First, it is way too long. Personally, I believe this probably speaks more to Rand's inflated perception of the importance of her personal philosophy, than the need to tell an interesting story and make her points. Was Rand one of the great thinkers of her time (or ours)? I highly doubt it. Nevertheless, the end of the book contains information about her and her philosophy, as well as information on the \\"institute\\" formed to further the study of her thoughts. It's a free country, so these people can do whatever they please, but to me, her philosophy seems shallow and can be summed up as \\"selfish.\\" Dagny Taggart's final submission, \\"I swear by my life -- and my love of it -- that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine\\" sounds fine -- until you really consider it. To most of us who have children, it just sounds shallow, selfish, and contrived. When recently discussing the book with four friends who had read it (including two \\"card carrying\\" libertarians), all were willing to admit that by the time they got to Galt's soliloquy (or rant) it mattered so little that they skimmed it (at best) or skipped it altogether (it goes on for so many pages I lost count). Further, Rand's obvious disdain for religion and basic Christian morality (which isn't really worth discussing further), reinforces the shallow feeling for me.Second, for all Rand's foresight into the future, she imagines a world where most people still travel cross country by rail and listen to the radio for their primary entertainment, but where there also exists a motor that runs on air, holographic projections that make huge parts of geography \\"invisible\\" and a machine that destroys whole cities with sound waves. Usually I like my science fiction to have a bit more \\"consistency\\" in its development.In the end, the book certainly had some interesting parts, but it is such a mess in other ways that I struggle with whether it was a waste of my time. My recommendation is that if you find yourself bored while reading the book, don't be embarrassed to skip a few pages along the way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Best book on capitalism ever written.

Published in 1957, this classic tells a cautionary tale about an America run into the ground by an ever expanding government that chokes off business. Sound familiar?Rand was way ahead of her time. Read this and consider who you want to vote for in 2012!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand weaves a tale full of characters, situations and settings that personify and exemplify some of her deeply understood philosophy. Each city, each landscape is imbued with meaning and her sense of the world. Each conversation or characters inner dialogue is important towards getting her point across. There is much to applaud in Ayn Rand's novel. A return to reason, an attack on the dumbing down of society, a celebration of the mind, a destruction of relativism and a return to objectivity are all defended. I get the feeling that this book was created as a defense to some startling trends which were occurring when this book was written, some of which are still occurring today.Although from a literary perspective this was a thoroughly, encompassing novel, I did find a few shortcomings. Some of the dialogue was a bit wooden and some of the antagonists were created as straw-men. I can tell that the creation of her protagonists was a labor of love, but little time was spent on building up, equally interesting antagonists. The antagonists unrealistic statements include; a banker who was proud of giving money to those who were bad investments and took great pride in losing all his money (Page 289), a scientist who says that technological advancements are not fair to incompetent scientists (Page 330), professors who console mourning students by saying that because reality is only an illusion you can't know your son is dead (page 463), unrealistic directives designed by governmental bureaucrats to freeze time, train passengers who say that \\"the men of ability must be penalized to support the incompetent (Page 561), complaints that hiring qualified workers is unfair because then the weak would be dominating the strong (Page 903) and the constant absurd claim that the common view among society is that the mind doesn't exist. The governmental bureaucrats, scientists and the general public are painted with an extreme, unrealistic brush. Perhaps this was the author's point I couldn't tell. By painting her intellectual opponents with an extreme brush and taking events to an absurd extreme, it shines a spotlight on the weaker positions which they support. Perhaps, many of the positions that the antagonists express are not meant to be taken as ideas that are literally held by the sane majority.I found much of the discussion of the corruption in the business and corporate world to be spot-on. Taggart realizes that when bureaucrats talk about the \`public good', they really mean which individual member of the public bribed them to get on their good side. In this sense, one man Taggart, humorously becomes \`the public good. When the bureaucrats directive becomes equivalent to a law of nature, it is profoundly illustrated by the author. The author divides these corrupting governmental influences in to those whose acts of plunder were brought on by gluttony and those whose acts were brought on by a charity lust. It is easy for the reader to criticize the gluttony of bureaucrats getting rich off of absurd regulations but the authors criticism hits more deeply when she criticizes those heartfelt \`plunderers' who want to help out those less able at the expense of those who produce.I found her depictions of scientists and governmental scientists to be wholly inaccurate and absurdly wrong. The scientists are involved in bribery, in decrying any science that can make a profit and Mrs. Rand even had the audacity to say that governmental scientific inquiry is a contradiction in terms. Perhaps this was true in her day but today it rings completely hollow. Being a scientist myself, this seems like a critique from an outsider who has no idea what is going on.Some of her strongest criticism is aimed at cultural relativists who claim that there is no objective reality only cultural reality and at Christians who created the disgusting idea of original sin. As a brief aside, I find it astounding that so many conservatives who are followers of Ayn Rand are devout Christians. You cannot be a Christian and be a follower of Ayn Rand's philosophy. The destruction of the evil Christian \`morality' is some of her strongest critiques in this book and it is central to her philosophy. She uses some of her harshest words for the morality of original sin and the like.Although this idea of cultural relativism is discussed throughout the book, it is most strongly exemplified when the Wet Nurse or Mr. Non-Absolute lies dying and makes the statement that people believe that there are no values only social customs. I am one who believes like the author that there are certain values that are etched in stone as it were, and they are not only social customs. There are certain values that some cultures hold that are superior to others. But where Mrs. Rand misses the point is when the Wet Nurse criticizes those who say that man is only a \`collection of chemicals'. It seems to me that Ayn Rand the materialist, the mystic-basher and spiritualist stomper would agree with this idea that man is a collection of chemicals. Today in the science world, materialist is actually defined by this idea that man is a collection of chemicals, soulless, only lead by the workings of his neurons. I am confused why Mrs. Rand would criticize this idea. Her definition of materialist is most aptly put by Dr Akston on Page 729 and 730 when he says man must use his mind to discover his world and his values, create based on what he has found and he should be judged by his actions in the material world. There is no essence of goodness found in the weak, man must be judged according to that which can be measured. Recent findings in genetics and neurobiology, once again weaken her point. We are finding through twin studies that genetic and neurobiological determinants do play a role (often the majority) in the success and behavior of man. It is not simply a matter of the strong, through their own fruition, rising to the top. On top of this, recent findings in evolutionary biology have found that it is \`natural' for humanity to exhibit traits of altruism. This is most rationally described by the game theorists such as John Maynard Smith. In the scenarios with which we are presented as humans, we can often achieve our selfish goals by helping out those around us. These traits developed within tribes due to the fact that we are social primates but in this day and age our altruistic sphere has expanded as the philosopher Peter Singer so eloquently explains. I will be the first to combat the \`naturalistic fallacy' which says that what is natural is right. But the author stakes much of her claim on the objective circumstances with which we live and celebrates that like the wings of a bird, man should celebrate his natural gifts, his large mind and capacity to reason. It turns out that much of man's mind is devoted to reason and emotion. In fact, we are learning that you can't have reason without emotion. Other recent findings have made clear some of the cognitive biases that are a part of humanity. This makes the process of self-inquiry a little less trustworthy. Often our mind takes shortcuts and has heuristics that are irrational and serve to actually combat our own goals. For instance, everybody wants to have a happy, wealthy retirement. The best way to achieve that is to take the decisions of saving for retirement out of your hands and removing it from your paycheck. These cognitive biases shape us and in turn shape our society in negative ways. Public policies to combat these biases in social and economic realms will help us shape our own goals. These failings of humanity have the potential to topple us all, and Ayn Rand's rugged individual will be brought down to earth like the rest of us. A system where each man looks after his own self-interest only, will end up combatting his self-interest as the social structure around him is toppled by the failings of man. A governmental structure that doesn't overreach but makes up for these shortcomings will benefit the selfish individual."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Reading Atlas Shruggged added more value to my live than all the 20 years school education.Through school, I learned how to think and acquired &quot;a lot of knowledge&quot;. From Altas, I learned what life is about, what to live for and how to live. Since Atlas, I never had a moment of self doubt, indecision, or worries. All my enery is focused on consciously pursuing success and my own happiness.Atlas dared to show the good, evil, beautiful and ulgy of man. Rand did it clearly with logic, consistency and convinction.This world can be black, white, and most of the time grey. Rand was not concerned about the grey. She chose to demonstrate the black and white. By knowing the black and white, one has the tool to grasp the grey.one learns the 1+1=2 in maths, Newtons's law in physics. With these simplified &quot;black and white&quot;, the &quot;unreal&quot;, one goes as far as building cars, airplanes, computers, the &quot;grey&quot;, the &quot;real.&quot; In morden sciences, one studies the essentials, the comprehsibles, the fundamentals. They are &quot;unreal&quot; because one rarely sees them in real word. It is the study of these &quot;unreals&quot; that made modern science, engineering, and industry possible.&quot;Human is different!&quot;, &quot;Human is irrational!&quot;, &quot;Human life cannot be black and white!&quot; &quot;Life is all grey!&quot;, &quot;how can one ever know anything for sure!&quot;, &quot;Everything is relative!&quot;, If these are your choices, have you ever wondered why &quot;making decision is so hard&quot;, &quot;my life is so miserable&quot;, &quot;feel guilty to enjoy a good meal, to drive a new car&quot;, &quot;feel guilty to love someone&quot;, &quot;feel guilty being loved&quot;?Everbody gets what they want out of live.The wise ones are open for positive influences, they keep on learning, become wiser and wiser, live beter and better lives."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having read many books throughout my life, I have never yet encountered a book such as this, which has the unique point of view that I have failed to grasp from other books. The fact is, most people who write books tend to be mystical and with a tendency to see the world from their own point of view. This book is precious because one can see the motivations and point of view of a man of action. Needless to say, that includes (or could include) all of us; otherwise the book's message could not reach many. In its more than a thousand pages there is but practically all of Ayn Rand's philosophy intertwined with a story that is entertaining. Those are the bright points. The majority of the book however, expresses the point of view of the individualism, the man as an island. While there are very compelling reasons why one would live one's life, no man is an island. This is the fundamental truth that has been left off. This shows as well today in our inability to solve the problem of the environment as well as having the world a better (and safer) place to live. Also, the stiff characters claim to be the personification of what the human can achieve. But another thing left off, is that the human being can also reach heights of goodness according to the Christian ideals, without the need of guilt or shame. And this is, yes, hard to express, and hard to understand for a 'practical, realistic' person. But then, again, you can't argue in this regard with Ayn Rand, who will definitely not accept this point. I say, though (putting my little grain of sand) that to love is human too, and it is a feeling that can't be ignored. If you experienced it, then we can talk ;)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I notice that the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars. Anyone who would plow through this ponderous mess of a novel and still give it one star must be a masochist. But the 5 star reviwers don't surprise me. They are the type of people who desperatly want certainty in their lives. So did Ayn Rand, and she wanted it so much that she couldn't talk of anything else. I found the book interesting reading in parts but way way too long. Silly little John Galt should have been shipped off to a salt mine to sweat off his genius. Those who think it is the greatest book ever written (something many reviewers state) obviously need to broaden their reading, or perhaps get out in the world and do a bit of work. And as far as the parasites that Ayn talks about, bear in mind that Ayn Rand never produced so much as a homegrown tomato. Failed marriages due to her infidelity (trying to find her hero), debts she never paid, a standard of living she never earned. She never really worked to pay her way, unless you consider the income from some of the worst books ever written. It is probably not fair to get personal with Ayn but she really begs for it. The &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is actually a fair book and has everything &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; has with about 1/4 of the words."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"this book i found to be the most exquisite of all books i've read; most correct and very very well written.... it is one of the most eloquent examples of a philosophy. i think everyone should read it... Celestial!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just for the author's hammer-like ridicule of the dominant socialistic mindset of this epoch, this novel deserves at least four stars. Ayn Rand's biting, sarcastic humor carries the book. Those several reviewers who found Miss Rand humorless are too far gone in Left Wing La-La land to get the fun the author is having at the expense of socialism's intellectual pretensions. Atlas Shrugged has weaknesses, thus the conditional five stars. Almost all of her characters have one dimensional personalities. They're either wonderful and productive or evil and parasitical. The ninety page speech of John Galt is the height of egoism but to be expected of a woman who thought herself the greatest philosopher since Aristotle. Her philosphy has holes, too. Dagney's sluttiness is made a virtue, paralleling Ayn Rand's personal life around the time of Atlas Shrugged's release. I heartily agree with the reviewer who would not like a world without &quot;the likes of Mother Theresa&quot;. Most probably, Ayn Rand would consider Mother Theresa a sob sister. What would a Rand objectionist do for the retarded or the crippled or the orphaned- throw them out into the world to raise themselves like wolves? I share the puzzlement of some reviewers of the treatment of Eddie Willers at book's end. Even Francisco says that Willers shares the values of the heroes of Galt's Gulch if not the superman abilities of the Galt Gulchers. Perhaps Willers' demise is Rand's way of explaining the future for America's abused productive people- the looters will grind down the productive in the end. Lastly, I find laughable the labeling of Rand as a fascist by several reviewers. They ought to look up the word fascist in the dictionary and find that they are bigger fools than they realized."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A distinction should be made between Ayn Rand's philosophy and her novels. Her philosophy is a rehash of individualism, libertarianism and laissez-faire liberalism. Most people would agree with it, at least in part, though few would go to Ayn Rand's extreme of &quot;Everyone but me is expendable.&quot;Her novels, on the other hand, are garbage. The characters are cardboard cut-outs. Her plots are out of a comic book. As for style, Ayn Rand writes like Adolf Hitler on speed. We are continually subjected to long-winded rants saying the same thing over and over again. Come on, we got it the first time - and the second, and the hundredth. Ayn Rand has a very low opinion of your intelligence, why else would she keep on explaining as if to a moron. Of course, she cannot insult your intelligence if you have none in the first place.One of the strangest things is the contradiction between the Rand philosophy as advertised and as it appears in her books. For example:&quot;Man is a rational creature.&quot; / &quot;If you disagree with me I hate you.&quot;&quot;Everyone can be the hero of their own life.&quot; / &quot;There are a few heroes and all the rest are evil parasites.&quot;&quot;Don't expect other people to sacrifice themselves for you.&quot; / &quot;Six billion people will be sacrificed so that the Ubermensch can triumph.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is a bit long.

It lends itself, in fact, to being a wonderful film (if only some well-heeled producer had the nerve, and some powerful director had the vision). Nothing against Gary Cooper, but it would certainly overshadow \\"The Fountainhead\\" in how it would play on a big screen. It's just a bigger better story.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is perfect for a movie. Perhaps the director would choose to make it, literally, in a \\"period\\" setting from 1950, a sort of \\"what if...\\", or perhaps create some hybrid new dimension for the film, making it feel like a cross between \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" and \\"Dark City\\". The feel of a decaying world, falling apart, hanging on to the last vestiges of greatness from another time (and trying to grasp at any new invention that comes along, after the inventor proves that it works) could be done brilliantly, and very differently than in any other film.The end-of-the-world overtones make it easy to sell to today's audiences. We all love \\"Independence Day, and \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" for the special effects. We'd love the images of abandoned automobile factories and once-prosperous towns going back into the undergrowth, like the image Rand paints for us of Starksville, and of the \\"Comet\\" finally broken down out in the desert, literally stopped in its tracks.And, very importantly, the hard-hammering Objectivist message in the book could be toned down to allow the story and its interesting characters to shine through: tough intelligent woman who runs a transcontinental railroad, inventor of new super Metal, rich playboy who destoys his own corporation to keep anyone from benefiting from it...and all around them, the great secondary characters, like Wyatt (who developes and then burns his own oil fields), Eddie, the long-suffering administrator, and the ring of vulture-like relatives in Rearden's sweet blood-sucking family.I do wonder: who would they get to play John Galt? (Suggestions, anyone?) And who would be Dagney?As the climax builds, we could have great sci-fi effects (the crash and explosion in the Taggert Tunnel, the Xylephone weapon, going out of control, destoying the last railroad bridge over the Mississippi), and, finally, the lights of New York going out just as John Galt and his friends escape, flying away in an airplane, back to their haven in the secret valley in Colorado.Look: no matter WHAT you think about the rest of it, this is good fiction. I've read the darn book three times, always just for the story. I zip over the long preachy paragraphs, and the propoganda-style speeches. I mean, it's just FICTION...Why hasn't somebody made the movie? Done \\"right\\", it would certainly reopen the conversation, for good or ill, about Ayn Rand's philosophy, about her writings, and it would allow the creative talents in the film industry to give us another version of the story, with all the interesting dramatic possibilities.Step right up, folks. Any takers?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"That's a tall order to fill, but this book can do it. I already believed many (not all, though) of the things that Ayn Rand illustrates in this novel. But I had never been able to state them so clearly.Many of the things that had always seemed obviously \\"right\\" or \\"logical\\" are proven rigorously in this book.I'd also recommend Fountainhead, it is a harder read, with some really strange male/female relationship crap in it, but the philosophy is outstanding as well.To be sure, as a novel it is stuffy and hard to start, but the philosophy is well worth cracking through the outer crust to get to. I have dog-eared and highlighted pages like crazy in this book and refer back to them from time to time!Ayn Rand asks (and answers) questions like: If giving to the poor is good, then is being poor and taking from the wealthy \\"bad?\\" What happens when everyone receives according to their NEED rather than their PRODUCTIVITY? Why does the government make SO MANY things illegal? Hint: control.No matter what your political belief system, you should read this book. If you agree, you will still find new ideas and different ways of looking at what you believe. If you disagree, you will be inspired to counter the claims made in the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There seems to be a lot of concern about the Kindle edition of Atlas Shrugged and typos, even to the point of mania. Having recently purchased the Kindle edition of Atlas Shrugged (Centennial Edition) -- June 2012 -- let me assure you that the text has apparently been cleaned up since its initial debut in electronic format. The only typos that I have noted are the asterisks (\\"* *\\") that separate sections within chapters. In this case occasionally extra pixels around the asterisks are turned on... for whatever reason. It is not a deal breaker, and in no way affects the text. (Did you know the word asterisk is Greek for \\"asteriskos\\" which means little star ?)I do have the paperback Centennial Edition of Atlas Shrugged (published by Signet), and the Kindle page numbers track to the paperback 100%. It is very impressive.And now the issue of cost... Yes, $12.99 is a bit expensive for electronic books... But the Kindle price is the same as the Nook price. The paperback cost at Amazon is $16.47, and the Mass Market edition is $9.99 (it does not look like you can buy a new hardbound copy these days, but previously it cost somewhere around $45.00.) You can get a cheeper used copy to be sure, and it is free at your local public library. So why buy the Kindle version? For all the reasons you like other Kindle books: the book is compact (Atlas Shrugged is a BIG book, and even the paperback versions are bulky), you can adjust the text size (because of the size of the book, printed versions tend have very small print, especially the Mass Market versions), built in dictionary (Dagny has a very good vocabulary, and it is easy to look up unfamiliar, 1957 terms), and so on.So... if you have a Kindle, and you would like to read Atlas Shrugged, stop worrying over the extra cost (even if you feel it is twice what you should pay) just buy it, and enjoy the book. Stop worrying over the typos, the current edition has made the required corrections... just buy it, and enjoy the book. And IF you are still that concerned about the price, then do yourself a favor and borrow the hardback version from your local library.Oh, did I mention... Atlas Shrugged is a VERY good book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Unless someone else posts before I finish, this will be the 2,513th Amazon review of Atlas Shrugged. The first question that might come to mind is: Why? What could I possibly say about this book that hasn't been said hundreds of times already? Rather than yet another \\"here's what the book is about\\" essay, I'll make the attempt by discussing instead the book itself; what it is and is not, why it continues to be relevant and influential over 50 years after its publication, and offer up a reason or two to read it. Or, perhaps, to avoid it.Atlas Shrugged is: An epic science fiction novel. I kid you not. It is, in fact, hard SF, set in a near-future dystopia (relative to publication; I'm guessing 1960) with sociopolitics and technology that are plausible extrapolations of then-current knowledge. If you're not a science fiction fan don't let this put you off; the gosh-wow stuff enables the story without being the story. If you are, approaching the book in this way makes it especially interesting.Atlas Shrugged is not: A particularly good novel per se. It may, in fact, be the single worst-written work of major Western literature. Its shortcomings in this regard have been discussed in detail elsewhere, many times. Suffice it to say here that:- Much of this book is mind-numbingly dense and verbose. It could have been less than half its 1200-page length without losing a thing. (Somehow I suspect that Ayn Rand didn't suffer editors gladly.)- Even the heroes are one-dimensional, rather unlikeable people - a very bad thing in a consciously didactic novel.- Rand spent a few years in Hollywood before writing Atlas Shrugged and, unfortunately, it shows; the book frequently can't decide whether it wants to be a novel, a textbook, or a screenplay treatment, and at times tries to be all three at once with downright surreal results.- The sex scenes are _horrible_.Sum of topic: if you're looking for a War and Peace or a Ulysses, this ain't it.Atlas Shrugged is: A book with a message. Boy, does it have a message. Rand intended this novel to introduce her philosophy of Objectivism to the masses, and that purpose saturates each and every page. John Galt's speech in particular is no less than forty pages of pure exposition; \\"Objectivism For Dummies.\\" It's interesting, but very dry and ponderous, almost impossible to get through in one sitting.Atlas Shrugged is not: Nearly as effective at getting that message across as it could have been. Rule One of didacticism is to keep the reader so engrossed in the story that you won't notice the educational part. In this case, the continual, unabashed lecturing throughout the book comes at the expense of what could have been a much more exciting, fast-paced story... which, ironically, would have done a much better job of putting Rand's message across.So. If Atlas Shrugged is such an overblown, barely-readable mess, why bother with it? Because, for all its flaws:Atlas Shrugged is: Simply the most compelling, dramatic and effective refutation of Marxism/Socialism ever to be put into print. After reading this book, you may or may not buy into Rand's philosophy. Objectivism has its flaws, and in my opinion Rand doesn't quite make the case for the superiority of her quasi-libertarian Utopia. You will, however, harbor absolutely no doubt that a coercively altruistic society, whether the hardcore \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" or the watered-down variety favored by entirely too many American politicians (of _both_ major parties) does not and cannot work. Rand utterly demolishes the foundation underlying Marxism and its variants, and does so brilliantly.She does this in a manner that is not only brilliant, but frighteningly relevant. I first encountered Atlas Shrugged in high school, in the midst of studying the New Deal and Eisenhower's warnings about the \\"military/industrial complex,\\" and witnessing the turmoil being caused by Nixon's and, later, Ford's ham-fisted attempts to \\"stabilize\\" the economy. In this light, the first half of Atlas Shrugged, with its alternate-history America gradually and all-too-plausibly collapsing into hidebound, poverty-stricken tyranny, rang eerily prophetic. Nixon's wage and price controls were unsettling echoes of Rand's \\"Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog Rule\\" and \\"Equalization of Opportunity Bill.\\"This, I think, is part of the novel's enduring popularity; this cautionary tale still rings true over a half-century later. After reading Atlas Shrugged, you will never again be able to listen to a President of the United States lecture on the need for \\"shared sacrifice\\" without recalling the chilling tale of the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company. You will never again be able to listen to a Congressman defying logic and simple arithmetic to claim that \\"taxing the rich\\" will wipe out a trillion-dollar federal deficit without hearing echoes of James Taggart's irrational hubris: \\"It will work! It has to work! We WANT it to work!\\" The book remains popular because its warning, sadly, remains all too relevant.This, I think, is also part of the reason for the incredible amount of hatred that has been heaped upon this book. Rand pulled no punches in her assertion that freedom is a moral as well as a socioeconomic imperative, practically defining \\"evil\\" as (governmental) compulsion by force. (One of the more relevant life-lessons I took away from Atlas Shrugged: s/he who seeks to compel my actions \\"for my own good\\" never, ever has MY own good in mind.) Those who wield political power - or would like to - understandably have a problem with this. What enrages them about Atlas Shrugged in particular is that it defends Rand's assertion, and does so very effectively. Also, on that subject...Atlas Shrugged is not: The celebration of fascist corporate greed that so many people make it out to be. Granted, Rand's rather unsympathetic heroes play right into this viewpoint. But, it's wrong. Atlas Shrugged's protagonists are selfish, yes; they work hard to enrich their lives and their families' lives, and make it clear that this is where their priorities are. As Rand detailed in later non-fiction works, there is nothing wrong with this. Who does not want to live just a little better than they did yesterday? Who does not want their children to live better lives than they themselves did? The problem here is semantic: most people (or so it seems) view \\"selfishness\\" and \\"greed\\" as synonyms. Not so - \\"greed\\" is _pathological_ selfishness, and Taggart, Rearden, et al show no signs of this disease. They expect to _create_ wealth, to earn every penny they make; they are invariably honest in their dealings even when it's to their disadvantage; they are consistently sympathetic and supportive of workers at all levels, most definitely including their own employees. They do, in fact, show no small amount of pride in enabling thousands of people to earn a good living. Greedy? Hardly. At the same time...Atlas Shrugged is: Relentlessly, unswervingly contemptuous of they who would enrich themselves without giving value in return: the \\"idle rich\\", robber-baron financiers (I suspect that Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden would take a dim view of real-world Wall Street ca. 2008) and especially those who claim the \\"right\\" to simply take wealth by force to redistribute to the \\"less fortunate\\", which invariably include their political cronies and their own bank accounts. Again, this understandably draws ire from politicians, \\"progressives\\", and those in general who feel they are entitled to wield power over others' lives and earnings. Atlas Shrugged declares otherwise, and drives the point home with a sledgehammer.I wouldn't call Atlas Shrugged \\"life changing\\" as so many people have, but it is definitely enlightening (as are many of Rand's other works), and therefore well worth reading. Five stars for the unique story and the message, minus one for the mediocre writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a must read for all Americans.

As with The Fountainhead, the book is a good read and philosophically challenging, though occasionally overly repetitive.The novel follows several characters as they seek to survive in a world that is slowly self-destructing under the weight and incompetence of the \\"parasites\\" of the world. Dagny Taggart, Francisco D'Anconia and Hank Rearden represent Rand's heroes--egotistical, brilliant, creative, hard-working geniuses who struggle to keep their industrial empires alive as the rest of the world collapses around them. Rand follows these characters as they seek to discover how and why their world is being destroyed. To their surprise and to the surprise of the reader, there is a grand purpose behind this destruction--a grand purpose that ultimately seeks to destroy the world and rid it of the \\"parasites\\" so it can be rebuilt anew by people such as Taggart, D'Anconia and Rearden (saying any more risks ruining the surprise).On the literary level, this book is a pretty enjoyable read and Rand does a good job holding the reader's interest. Her characters are well developed and the plot is intriguing and surprising. The length is daunting and probably could have been shorter in places--there is an infamous 56 page rant that takes the cake as the longest soliloquy in literary history.At the deeper level, Atlas Shrugged is a more complete description of Rand's objectivist philosophy--a philosophy first spelled out in The Fountainhead. Objectivism exalts the supremacy of man and holds egoism, capitalism and objective reality as its virtues. Unfortunately, in places, the novel beats the reader over the head with the philosophy (e.g. in the aforementioned 56 page soliloquy). The philosophical presentation is more complete than in The Fountainhead but occasionally at the expense of the book's literary presentation.Opinions on Rand's works are clouded by vehement philosophical and political beliefs. Ultimately, Atlas Shrugged is a good book regardless of whether you abhor or adore the objectivist philosophy. I highly recommend reading the shorter and subtler The Fountainhead first--readers that enjoy The Fountainhead will enjoy Atlas Shrugged while those who have had their fill with The Fountainhead will probably find Atlas Shrugged repetitive and unpleasant. In the end, reading Rand's work is always engaging and intellectually challenging."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The good: When I read \\"The Fountainhead\\", I remember feeling as strongly about Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peater Keating and Ellsworth Toohey as I ever did for Mulder, Scully, Kryceck and the CSM. Similarly, I was as intrigued by the mystery of the disappearing businessmen in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as I ever was by any X-File case. However, whereas Chris Charter achieved all what he achieved in a TV show meant to be entertaining, Ayn Rand managed to do it in books aspiring to change our view of the world. That is no small feat.The bad: After the mystery of the disappearing businessmen was solved, Atlas Shrugged dragged along, repeating the same message for hundreds of pages. That could had been averted, making for a much better novel (because of that, I think that \\"We the Living\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" are far superior).The Warning: This book should come with a label: \\"Reading of this book without supervision might push you to join the Republican Party\\". ...So, new readers, I recommend this book entirely, but don't forget what it is: (1) a work of fiction and (2) the showcase of ONE person's philosophical and political views (although admittedly, a very special person).Our philosophical and political opinions can be influenced but should never be based in one book, no matter how good or convincing it might seem. Especially if such book is based on a world that is more than half a century old."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Originally published in 1957. This book is fiction. The author has some farily unrealistic views of the world. Her prime weapon is her Objectivist thoughts as far as what is better for society. The story is great and I love the characters and I routed for the good guys and dispisedthe bad guys. But her world is so devoid of reality as to fall more into the fantasy area than simple fiction. There are no children, no old, no sick, no discrimination, in short no human qualities to her world. It is a great read. But I think that Ms. Rand wanted to use the book as a venue to espouse her theory of pure self-determination. She equates collective responsibility as evil and the selfish persuit of wealth and power for the sake of the persuit as the purist good. Hitler would have loved her. Overall on a scale of 1 to 10 the book gts a 9 because it is such a ripping read. I would hate to think what an impressionable mind, not grounded in reality, would make of Rand's theory? Some current members of congress come to mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I placed this order on the 5th and I got the book on the 8th. It was amazing!! The book was as advertised.

It certainly presents a good argument for the importance of those who own businesses and employ people. Some will use it as an argument for less government control, which may have been Ayn Rand's point, and probably was to some extent, but to understand this, I feel you should look at her and how she grew up.Lots of people have read this book, which I think is a good reason to read it yourself. You'll understand \\"Who is John Galt?\\" and also what they are talking about, if nothing else. There are also some great lessons within it though, you just have to cut through a lot of unnecessary words. :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book arrived within the time range allotted for shipping, and in great condition.

That said ,she shows us how one government edict begets another bringing us down the slippery slope towards tyranny and poverty.

That said, I can't recommend this book more highly if you think you can finish it. I am more than satisfied with my purchase. Definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In my opinion, there is no praise lofty enough to describe Atlas Shrugged. It is a masterpiece. It is a must read. It may be the most important novel ever written. Yet, have always hesitated to recommend Atlas Shrugged. Recently, I decided to give hard copies to all of my nieces and nephews in their upper teens, and I wrote the following caveats for them. I share these caveats for potential readers, and for readers who have read a few chapters and not been able to get farther. Rand is worth getting to know, and that means looking past the few flaws.1) The very explicit, in-your-face, pro-business and anti-religious themes are off-putting, probably even offensive, to most first-time readers. Most readers probably do not get past the first chapter or two, and I cannot blame them. If you read a little farther, you will realize that Rand is a champion of the independent creative mind, whether teachers, lawyers, statesmen, businessmen, industrialists, or artists--anyone of any profession who contributes. Businessmen are the most denigrated such individuals in our society--and, as such, are Rand's premier example. The businessmen whom you dislike are the same ones Rand would have disliked.Many scenes strike even the experienced reader as over-the-top hyperbole--as absurd extremes, which (you will object) do not illuminate day-to-day reality. And yet, according to the experience of everyone I've spoken to who has read the book, as you read the book, within a week you will find a passage which you thought was offensively ridiculous, repeated in the CBS Evening News or printed as a serious article in Time magazine. If it takes you a month to read the book, and you pay attention to the \\"news\\" at the same time, you will have numerous such experiences. That is, what seems absurd in the novel, will actually happen in the real world, while you are reading the book. Honest. Considering that Atlas Shrugged was first published in the 1950s, Rand's ability to predict current news is rather remarkable.Even so, it helps to think of Atlas Shrugged as a grand allegory, like Gulliver's Travels, Alice in Wonderland, or the Divine Comedy, which superficially appear to be absurd. These allegories were written with the purpose of illuminating the absurdity of reality. We all want to believe that absurd ideas cannot have any effect on us, simply because they are absurd. So, we dismiss absurd ideas, and therefore quickly forget them. We fail to recognize that many of the absurdities popularized by intellectuals, politicians, etc. are intended seriously, have real goals, and have real effects. We do not wish to believe that most of our fellow citizens are fools, so we fail to recognize how many absurd ideas are widely believed. Numerous outright hoaxes are believed by the majority of people in this country. Indeed, probably 10% of the average TV newscast is devoted to hoaxes--presented as serious news. In short, Rand is a mirror which reflects reality TOO accurately--or at least more clearly than we are used to, and comfortable with. If you wish to understand reality, and the \\"meaning of life\\" you need such eyes.Some of the nonsense Rand rails against is so absurd, that bothering to argue against it will strike you as an unnecessary waste of your time and an insult to your intelligence. However, most of the absurdities which Rand attacks are cyclic--periodically revived, made popular, then forgotten (like any fad). What seems too absurd to waste time on refuting today will re-emerge as a \\"new\\" fad within the next few years, and will be taken seriously by the media, etc.. In the mid-1990s, for about six months, the journals, news magazines, papers, and talk shows were dominated by discussions about the positive value of dishonest and the high \\"morality\\" of pathological liars. Honest! The insane proposition that \\"tools condition the mind\\" (apparently popular when Rand was writing Atlas Shrugged) is rarely heard these days, but very well could re-emerge as the next \\"intellectual\\" fad.2) I suspect that many readers are put off by the \\"romantic\\" plot in Atlas Shrugged. In my judgement, Rand (like many intelligent, ambitious women) was afraid of love. While she unrelentingly preaches against self-delusion, Rand herself was seriously self-deluded about the nature of love, in many ways and on many levels. Rand manages to accurately describe intense romantic passion--at least as experienced by some people (or imagined by young women), but fails in her descriptions of real love. Rand's romantic plot is clearly that of a young woman. Dagny (the main character, a woman, Rand's alter ego) is quick to abandon extraordinarily admirable men, each hopelessly in love with her (and whom she is described as passionately loving), for the next guy in a long line. And none of the guys are the slightest bit upset when abruptly dumped. That is not love. That is not even friendship..Early in the book, Dagny and a lover engage in a romantic relationship which borders on the sado-masochistic--without any actual physical abuse. I imagine that this offends many first-time readers who quit the book then-and-there. Rand's purpose is to describe the flawed attitudes of the male character, for the purpose of describing the cause. However, if you read a little farther, and you will see their relationship evolve and become gentler, as he sheds various self-delusions, and learns the real meaning of love.Even so, in later scenes, Rand continues to use the word \\"pain\\" and similar verbiage, when she means \\"intense desire\\". I suspect that many readers will find this objectionable, as do I. For example, Dagny expresses her \\"love\\" by describing her desire to cause her lover pain. If Rand used such words and scenes only when essential to the plot, and in a limited context, I would have no serious objection, but she is too consistent in describing romance in terms of pain and combat. Clearly this terminology reflects of Rand's own fear of love. In conclusion, Rand's idea of love and romance is pathetic--but you do not read Atlas Shrugged for the love plot.3) You read Atlas Shrugged for the philosophy--for insights into life and reality which will \\"blow your mind\\". Honest. Unfortunately, it is easy to conclude that Rand's vision or philosophy is incompatible with love and faith--the most important things in most reader's lives. Rand barely touches on these themes, and what she does say and imply is flawed or grossly inadequate. After reading Atlas Shrugged, you will not have answers to all of your questions regarding love and faith--but you will be equipped to find the answers. Rand, at least, supplies the philosophical tools for your own exploration of these themes. Moreover, your own beliefs are far more valuable, more secure, more reliable, and more comfort, than beliefs you adopt merely because they were taught to you, or because they are what Rand's characters did or believed. Like most of the important things in life, the answers are very simple, but are not easily expressed in slogans or simple statements. Then too, even if you have every answer to every question nailed down--applying the answers in real life is rarely easy.Rand's characters make many statements to which I strongly object, as will you. When I taught at a major university, I found that making outrageous statements is an effective rhetorical technique. After a long discussion, I would concede that my students' objections were valid, and we would \\"agree\\" to a better statement of the issue. I suspect that I actually learned this technique from reading Rand. Remember also that the statements are those of characters, and it would be unrealistic if every character expressed exactly the same opinions, or expressed herself/himself perfectly in every statement. Feel free to object and \\"argue\\" with Rand's characters--you will grow in the process.Some stains are so stubborn that a harsh cleanser is required. Some common ideas in our culture--which interfere with your happiness and your ability to be the best you can be--are very deep, very stubborn, stains, and for these, Atlas Shrugged is a harsh cleanser. Reading some sections may be uncomfortable. Read Atlas Shrugged, or listen to the audio version skeptically, but openly--and your life will be transformed, forever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a captivating novel. The greatest \\"shortcoming\\" is that the book is over 50 years old. The heroine is the vice-president of a major railroad company, and most of the plot revolves around her desperate efforts to keep the railroad going. In the 21st century, when the age of railroads is long past, this is certainly dated. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged, although contemporary when written, takes on the feel of a grand masterful allegory perhaps like Dante, Chaucer, or Swift. It is just as much \\"fun\\" as Alice in Wonderland or Gulliver's Travels--and just as serious as the Divine Comedy. Yet, if you listen to a hour of local and national news on TV every evening while reading the book--half of the stories will sound as though they were lifted from the book--so timelessness and universal is Rand's story.This will probably be the most important book (to you) that you read in your lifetime.What is it about? It is often described as \\"Capitalism versus Communism\\", or \\"altruism vs selfishness\\"--but both descriptions seriously miss the point. What this book is really about is much more fundamental. It is about the nature of good and evil, and beyond that, the very meaning of life.\\"But I'm a good person, so what value is this book to me?\\"--you may ask. Answer: You have certainly noticed that adult \\"morality\\" is full of all kinds of exceptions and contradictions. The truth is, the world of \\"morality\\" we adults have constructed is a sham, a fraud. It is no more than \\"social convention\\"--which is to say, \\"what we all more-or-less agree to\\"--and actually, despite all the \\"moral\\" justification, has absolutely nothing to do with morality or right-and-wrong, and often little to do with common sense.Still, the question remains, \\"Why isn't simply accepting the current 'social norms' good enough?\\" \\"Go along to get along.\\" Answer: To put it bluntly, the greatest evil the world has ever seen has been done by folks \\"accepting community norms\\" who thought they were doing good, or at least who could justify their actions as being \\"socially acceptable\\".The truth is, you will be quite surprised when you learn the true nature of evil. Until you have read Atlas Shrugged, evil will remain a hazy mist floating just off your line of vision, which you don't look straight at, because you don't WANT it to exist. After reading Atlas Shrugged, evil snaps into sharp focus--and like a bully confronted--ceases to be a fear, and just becomes something distasteful to avoid.As Rand richly illustrates: Just as eating too much fat can clog up your arteries, thinking \\"too much fat\\" can damage with your mental health. Some mental illness is physiological. But most mental illness is caused by unresolved internal contradictions--caused, for example, by refusing to look at evil because you PREFER to believe that it does not exist. Reality is. You do NOT have the option of living in your own private version of reality. Nevertheless, many, perhaps most, people live lives built on thier own complex lies. That turns smart people crazy, and stupid people mean and crazy.How do you avoid \\"unresolved internal contradictions\\"? By knowing the difference between right and wrong, and never, ever, allowing a rotten board to be used in the construction of your mental house. The problem is the old \\"slippery slope\\". Lie to yourself just once, no matter how trivial the lie, and the next one will be easier. Before long, you realize that you can justify ANYTHING--and with the blessings of the popular culture. And before you know it, you've lost your soul.As Rand preaches, the meaning of life is integrity. Living without compromise. To live a life filled with joy and pride in yourself, made possible by being free of mental conflicts. To know, not merely hope, that your mistakes were honest mistakes. To live with the knowledge that you are the best you can be, while striving to be better. To be a joy and comfort to the people you love. To give generously of your time, wealth, and love simply for the joy of doing so. To be a person who has changed the world for the better when you have gone. That's what Atlas Shrugged is really all about. All ofthe other themes, even Communism vs Capitalism are peripheral supporting themes. It is precisely because the fundamental issues are so basic and primary, that the implications are simultaneously universal--applying to all aspects of life.The greatest real flaw in Atlas Shrugged is that Rand herself does not quite understand how her philosophy applies to inter-personal relationships. All of the heros in the story are flawed characters, because Rand's characters are based on herself, and are flawed because Rand herself was flawed. That is, Rand had such a horrible youth that her ability to love and trust was damaged. In her own flawed vision, she has largely substituted hero worship for love. Rand's heros are real heros to be admired, but not role models to emulate.You will also find many things with which you will want to disagree, but in your heart, you will know that Rand is right. How you resolve these conflicts will be the most important decision you will make in your entire life. If you choose the truth, simply because it is the truth, then you are on the way to a life of good mental health. If you reject the truth because you PREFER a different vision or interpretation of reality--then you have already begun to lie to yourself, and you will probably have an unhappy life and be a miserable person to live with."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is a daunting work, so I'll be forgiven that it took me 10 years to read it completely, but having finished it, I am sorry I didn't complete it sooner. The ideas espoused in Ayn Rand's monumental work are important and should be examined by everyone in a free society (I was excited to hear about the film based on this book being produced soon). There are drawbacks, but no other work out there achieves the same goals as does 'Shrugged' and that alone makes it a must-read.Through the author's story of the man who stopped the engine of the world, we are exposed to the lives of high society in a near-future (from the 1950s), including a steel producer, a rail tycoon, and writers, politicians, and all significant players in the country. In Rand's Tolstoy-esque social gatherings and strictly Rand-esque business dealings, we are shown a despicable side of mankind, which we all, no doubt have witnessed, and led easily to be repulsed by it. We are then taken on a journey with the protagonist Dagne Taggart to fight the deterioration of free society and economic liberty for the sake of the public good.This book will challenge many commonly-held beliefs, the most prominent being that the public good should be a goal when considering individual production. Her Objectivist philosophy was fine-tuned by the time she wrote this and it is evident throughout.Unfortunately, for a novel, the characters are a little flat, with just a few changes in perspective, which makes the reading somewhat predictable. Also, Rand's idea of romantic love is a bizarre mix of masochism and contradiction and the reader may have a hard time relating.Despite these flaws, this book remains a timeless masterpiece and a monument to human intellect and individuality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What is it with fans of Ayn Rand?

To me, although wordy at times, this book is a goldmine of character development at it's best. Every character, even the minor characters, have a immense amount of depth to them that most authors have a hard time achieving with their lead characters, not even mentioning the minor characters. This book makes you think, the syntax is amazing. Not to mention, it's full of great quotes. The only part of the book that I found taxing was the 20 page (if not more) speech, but if you've understood the book up to that point, you really don't need to read it. I think everyone should read this book at least once, it's an eye-opening experience."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are a couple threads that seem to run through most of the negative reviews of this book. One is that it's too long. The second is, the characters aren't like real people. The third is, it's unrealistic.I don't disagree with any of these points, but I'm giving it a positive review anyway. The one thing that people need to realize before reading this book, is that, obviously, it is more of a statement of a philsophy than a novel per se (a philosophy that she repeatedly hammers into your brain without mercy). The characters and the world of the novel are just allegorical embodiments of the elements of Rand's philosophy, which is, without a doubt, &quot;extreme.&quot;Like any extreme philosophy, Rand's work inspires both adulation and hatred, with not much in between. The same is true of people like Marx. Personally, I don't think she got it 100% right. But I did find a lot of value in the book, not only in what I agreed with, but in thinking about what I disagreed with and why. Whatever your opinions, Rand forces you to be reflective, and, if you disagree with her, to seriously consider your reasons why. That, to me, is the mark of a great work of philosophy. And yes, it could have certainly been improved upon with some judicious editing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A is A. If your like me, your at this point going, well that's nice, i think i could have figure that out for myself, well could you?We live in a world where feelings over power logic, we live in a world of glorified medocrity, and we live in a world where our \\"greatest minds\\" question whether or not they exist. Everyday, someone somwhere is jumping of a building thinking, what's the point of all this? Why did i bother to get up this morning....I've been that person. I didn't try jumping off a building, but from personal experience there's many other ways of trying to end your life. Reading this book was like a slap in the face. It was someone screaming at me: \\"What are you thinking?! of course there's a reason to live, are you perfect?\\"There's so many messages conveyed in this book, almost all of which i agree with. One of the main ideas is that there is always going to be something left to do in this world, you just have to do it. There is always a manner in which you can make things better, more efficient, more profitable, happier. You are never going to run out of things to do, unless you let someone else do them for you, which by the way, leads me to another of \\"messages\\".You don't rely on other people. We can all sit around on our asses, lamenting our world, or we can go out and be sucessful. We can beg from the people around us, be looters, or we can try and make the money, honestly, for ourselves. We are taught from a very early age to \\"feel sorry\\" for those less, fortunate and to \\"give\\" to them. Our society endorses pity towards those who've made mistakes: Achoholics Anonymous, Drug Rehab, Anger managment. To quote directly, we have no pity for the pain of the innocent. We give millions each year to people through welfare, what are we doing? We're making them dependent on doing nothing, we're encouraging a world in which people settle for relying totally on others and never making progress of their own.Yet another message adressed at great length in the book is the fundamental merit of capitalism. In the dog eat dog world of business, there is no \\"but that's not fair, he has more then i do!\\" Ayn Rand asks you to think, for a second, what the world would be like if every man aimed to have a monopoly, and did it honestly. People would constantly be forced to improve their product, and hence there would be constant progress. Even should one person gain completel control of ann industry, it would not render the rest of that world jobless, because no man can operate a whole enterprise by himself. He needs the men turning the bellows, sitting at the desk, or choosing a spot to drill. There is always a place for others expertise, and they will continue to profit from his need of their help.A last thing that Ayn Rand point out is our societies disturbing tendency to worship the medicore. No body wants to see someone better then they are, but Atlas Shrugged asks: why? Can we not appreciate that someone has more talent or innovation than we do. Something to think about...So, there we go with a few paragraph explanation of an over 1000 page book. Saying that i suggest you read it is an understatment. At risk of sounding corny, this book changed my life. While it showed me many of the harsh realities and the worship the underserving in this world, it showed me that until this world is perfect, there is no reason not to be in it...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I did not give the book 5 stars because it is way too long. I read it slowly - a hundred pages, then I would put it down for a week and digest what I had read.Most of the criticisms written in these reviews miss the mark on two fronts. Some find the ideas in it reprehensible - although the book does a pretty good job of elucidating the motives of those who despise it. The second most common criticism is that the characters are too shallow.I believe the book, as a vehicle for a worldview, is quite an accomplishment and is EXTREMELY foresighted - not regarding technology but regarding the nature of public discourse. It is a \\"Games people play\\" for the independent mind. It is like reading the playbook for those who would reach their hand into your pocket and call you evil for pushing it away. I felt like I was reading the editorial page of the NYT when James Taggart was speaking.Rand wrote the book in the spirit of the middle-age Everyman play. The characters are archetypes, and not intended to be realistic. They are tools she uses to show the points she is trying to make.I think the philosophical objections people have to the book rest on a very shallow and childish interpretation of what Rand advocates. The book is probably too disturbing for someone who has never had to support themself, or has lived predominantly in academia. In sum, the book says do unto others as you would have done to you. The looters in the book fall victim because the movers begin giving back what they have always gotten."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book will change the way you think.

It looked like it was printed in 8 point font, and even at that the book was so large that my wrists were getting sore from the strain of holding the book in the light so I could read the small print. It is a BIG book.So, I downloaded the Kindle Edition for my iPhone. Now I am enjoying reading this story very much. It goes with me everywhere; I can read it whenever I have a few minutes to spare, or laying in bed all night long if I wish.$18.99 for the electronic edition seems high to me.

It is a hymn to unfettered human intelligence.It is also the most spiritually rich work of literature I have ever read. A lot of people are turning to it now because of its prescience, but its description of political control and economic collapse are not what's most important (Rand herself, far from aiming at being a prophetess, regarded as one of the novel's strengths the fact that it wasn't even particularly realistic but rather her most fully Romantic work). In an interview with the author of one of the recent biographies of Ayn Rand, Jon Stewart winkingly referred to her novels being filled with lots of \\"dirty, dirty sex.\\" Those are, in fact, the best scenes. Francisco and Dagny learning together about the wonderful pleasure their bodies can give them the summer after she begins her first job on the railroad as night operator of the Rockdale station; her affair with Rearden beginning at Ellis Wyatt's house after their first run on the John Galt line; and, of course, the encounter in the underground tunnels of the Taggart terminal...it simply doesn't get any better than that. Sure, Rand was prescient---because she identified clearly what certain principles would mean in practice, principles which are now being implemented. But she was much more concerned with what might be and ought to be.Of the four versions of which I am aware, this edition of the audiobook version of the novel is easily the best.

The men of intelligence who run the world are under attack from the anti-capitalist collectivists who use not their intelligence but their anti-greed morality and coercive force (through government) to drain the brains of the former. One by one, they mysteriously disappear, never to be heard from again...until one intelligent woman refuses to give in to the madness of either the anti-capitalists or the genius capitalists. Rand's hero, who's determined to turn around the failing railroad company left in the inept hands of her fat cat brother, becomes increasingly determined to get to the bottom of these mysterious disappearances. Along the way, she discovers where all the men of integrity are disappearing to, falls in love to two of them, battles Washington fat cats and their incompetent regulators and inspires all her underling workers of integrity.Rand has the reader respect the achievements and intelligence existing in the capitalist system and the unintelligence of those who simply seek to enjoy its benefits and offer nothing on the table but complaints and legal-based cures that undermine the very fuel of that system. She deflates collectivist ethics and turns it on its head, making selfishness the very heart of virtue. And she makes happiness inextricably bound to active thought and productive life. Capitalism, for her, realizes all this, which is why she takes up its defense. Indeed, this book is the bible for free market capitalists everywhere.While it makes for an interesting novel and insightful exploration of political and moral ideas, there are several limitations to Rand's framework. The capitalism she has in mind is the ideal that never really existed. The ills of the capitalist/corporate model are completely ignored. She therefore doesn't have to address them and can maintain the white/black, good/bad, capitalist/collectivist simplicity characteristic of her thought. She also ignores the productive aspects of government--which brings us public education, technological innovations like the computer, the internet, public works projects etc. For her, government economic intervention is again an unconditional evil. But the greatest shortcoming is the book's ending. After John Galt's masterful speech that sums up her philosophy, we have a James Bondish rescue finale that, for me at least, was anti-climactic.Nevertheless, the novel is a great read, enormously insightful and strikingly similar to what we are witnessing today in Washington.

I was initially worried that I had not received the complete unabridged audio book because many of the reviews on this item say that other buyers received a 40 CD set. After having been assured by the seller that I purchased the complete audio book, I'm fine with only having the 3 CDs, which are easier to carry around than 40! I've jumped around listening to the tracks, and it seems to be the complete book, which I assume is unabridged. There are 40 or so \\"chapters\\" and each are about an hour long.However, the CDs were delivered in 2 flimsy plastic CD cases, with no colorful box and I couldn't help feeling slightly ripped off for an item that costs about $300.

Communication was timely."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, and recent events have caused me to reread this novel. It is amazing how timely this book is - with the recent developments in politics and culture. Some criticize Ayn Rand for her characterizations and dialogue, but I think these people miss the point. Her novels are not natural at all, that was never her intention, and yet the final product is more real, perceptive, and relevant than almost anything else written in the post-War era. Even if you don't agree with all of her ideas, this novel should be read for its staggering intellectual and artistic achievement: this book reads like a mass-market thriller and yet the complexity of the ideas behind it is far above the heads of the so-called \\"intellectuals\\" who dismiss Rand (for whom she has a few choice words in the novel itself). From oil to politics to sex to philosophy -- this book is unique and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The hardest part of reviewing this book is breaking it down into catagories as to not give the book as a whole the rating deserved by only single aspect of the book. These catagories help:StoryThe story of Atlas Shrugged is excellent. It is about a group of industrialists struggling to maintain their businesses in the face of a government which is looking to socialize. It contains some love story elements, some action, some suspence, and some brief humor. It is an intersting story and will keep you entertained.Philosophy/MoralRand's philosophy is one of extreme individual expression. Happiness comes from the ability to maximize one's potential in terms of productivity. The moral is that some can produce, while others cannot or will not produce. Those who do not are leeches living off those who do.Politics/EconomicsRand uses the story to build a strong case for laissez faire capitalism by showing the downward tendency of socialism. When wealth is taken \\"from each according to his ability to each according to his need\\", the tendency is to need rather than be able. She also shows the self serving tendency of the people put in charge of regulating the economy, and the violating nature of depriving an entrepreneur of his or her production.CriticismRand's work can be seen as highly materialistic. The way she portrays characters is as either all good or all bad, which does not accurately portray life. Rand is very harsh and intolerant of any view other than her own, and comes across as such.PraiseThe demonstration of the digressive tendency of socialism is excellent. The book was entertaining and thought provoking.All in all I really like this book. I highly recommend it as a window into socialist policy played out.If you like it or dislike it, it is best to describe which catagory your criticism falls into, as not to dismiss or praise the book entirely."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book has it's good points in that it points out the connections that must exist between risk and reward, hard work and economic reward. It points out the dangers of apathy, mediocrity, wealth-redistribution and removing rewards by trying to \\"play fair.\\" It is interesting to see these themes, but they aren't necessarily anything new to anyone who is familiar with economic history and economic theory.Despite the good elements, Ayn Rand is obviously dogmatic and a \\"True Believer.\\" Her philosophy makes some sense based on her background and having horrible experiences in a communist society when she was young. It also makes sense that she was fighting the Keynesian economic theories of the mid-20th century which had a \\"do the right thing\\" flavor and often suggested that government and other entities should heavily plan and interfere with business and economic activities that were better left to business or individuals to take initiative with. These interferences are still going on.It all makes sense up to a point, but she pushes things pretty far. You have to wonder how she would address issues such as child labor, tenements, dirty and tainted food supplies, children getting dosed from lead-lined dirt from car exhaust (because lead was cheap and profitable for these heroic titans of industry in the real world 20th century). Many of these things seemed to be ignored and *shrugged* away when she conjures up a wistfulness for some kind of imaginary golden age before government \\"interfered\\" with any of the possible interests of business. And of course her special \\"true\\" kind of business acts selfishly (but selfish is really good cause it benefits everyone always) and ambition and selfishness always are the real drivers of better things for everyone.She constructs an allegory in which those that are driven and ambitious are the heroes, and everyone around them is mediocre and conspires to bring them down because they want things to be mediocre, are wishy washy, or are jealous (often in very unrealistic and nonsensical ways). She has good points about incentives and living ambitiously, but the world she constructs feels like a cartoon straw-man argument in which she represents anything that doesn't agree with her viewpoint simplistically (the easier to knock down).The writing is long, meandering and sometimes indulgent and the characters don't come off as particularly real, but mostly as interesting plot devices without a lot of emotional reality or complexity.While there is a good amount to like and respect about Rand's thinking, there is also a lot to be consider carefully and take with a grain of salt, rather than believing all her assertions unquestioningly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you like an action novel with adult-size, believable heroes living in the same world you do and, at the same time, the kind of book that'll make you re-think every idea you've ever heard or lived your life by, you'll love Atlas Shrugged..In it, you'll meet Dagny Taggart, a woman who runs a continental railroad against the resistance of her incompetent and politically-connected brother. You'll meet Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian D'Anconia, the latest heir to a world-wide copper empire, which he blows up, appearing to become a worthless playboy for a reason you can't guess for 2/3 of the novel. You'll meet Hank Reardon, the archetypical example of the American self-made industrialist, who invents a new kind of metal, stronger and lighter than steel. When you first meet him, he is unable to understand why, not only his country, but his family does not value his creativity and productiveness. He learns why over the course of the novel. The world you live in is the world he lives in, a world in which there are two opposite moral systems in deep conflict. In Atlas Shrugged, you'll meet Ragnar Danneskjold, a modern-day, high-seas pirate who hijacks American relief ships carrying cargo to the failed People's Socialist Paradises around the world. He sells the cargo for gold, which he uses to reimburse people's income tax to them.The main character? Him you don't meet until 2/3 of the way into the novel. And when you do, you'll have several emotional reactions, one of which is to laugh your head off, because you'll realize that the author has laid clues about this character from the first sentence all the way through. He is the character who has let loose a plot in the world of the novel that makes it clear what the moral conflict is in the world and how it affects your life today, where you live.This story will make you angry, make you cry, fill you with uplifting feelings, and cause you to say, \\"I've thought things like this before.\\" You'll see the world around you differently, You'll understand the people around you differently. You'll see yourself differently.The author is Ayn Rand, a woman whose life was adventurous as the novels she wrote. If you like Atlas, you'll like all the rest of her books.Now, the recommendation of Atlas Shrugged does come with a warning. Though English was not Ayn Rand's first language, it is written in the purest, most crystal-clear English you have ever read. It will draw you along page after page and it is 1,000 pages. So, you are well-advised to eat, drink and sleep between sections of chapters.There are two kinds of people who have read Atlas Shrugged. There are those who hate it and would love to gnash teeth on its author. Then, there are those, like me, who will say, \\"It changed my life.\\"Several years ago, the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club did a survey among the nation's readers, asking, \\"What book has most influenced your life?\\" The number one book was the Bible. Number two was Atlas Shrugged.Ayn Rand is the thinker who champions you every time you spend time alone with your own mind, doing your own thinking about what you are experiencing in life. And, if you are a businessperson, hers is the only voice on planet Earth that gives a moral defense of your activity in society as a businessperson.If you love your life on Earth, you'll find Atlas Shrugged is the most inspiring novel ever written."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The paperback of this book has been in my possession for almost 10 years compliment of a very good (and deep) friend.

I want to recommend this to anyone who is concerned about where this world is going. It has some very practical application and really has affected me on a very personal level. Take the time to read this book! It is well worth it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved this book when I first read it at age 12. I thought it actually said something important. Then I reread it early in college and, while I still thought it actually said something, I no longer felt it was something important. Now, I realize that it says nothing and can hardly bring myself to suffer through the bad dialogue and longwinded speeches that these cartoon characters make. Come on! Just for example, the speech about smoking - holding a cigarette is having the fire of Prometheus at one's finger tips? Now that is rich. Holding the cigarette is having one's nicotine delivery system at the tip of one's fingers and paying the tobacco companies a good portion of one's living wage so that they can slowly kill you. Now that is the real meaning of Ayn Rand's much praised virtue of selfishness.The 'philosophy' of Objectivism that is supposed to inform the plot of this book is essentially an oversimplification of Aristotle and just about 2000 out of date. We can't understand the world we live in nor our best place in it if we pretend that issues are as two dimensional and arbitrary as are presented in Ayn Rand's thesis. It just ain't so. The world is VERY complex and the human psyche equally so. Words - especially easy categorizations (which Rand loves) - are more likely to distort, rather than reveal, the truth.Everyone wants certainty. Maybe this explains the appeal of these books. It can't be artistry. Ayn Rand is not a master of language, nor a creator of really human characters, nor a great thinker. But she sure seems sure of what she is sure of. Maybe for most folks that is enough."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you take a lifeguard class at the local YMCA pool, the first rule they teach you is, don't go under with a drowning man. If a person is determined to drown (and some are), then there is nothing noble in letting the victim take you down with him.Your YMCA instructor will say: \\"Kick him in the groin if necessary, but do whatever it takes to get free, and ensure your own survival -- so you can go on to live YOUR life (and, not coincidentally, save more lives of other potential drowning victims on other days).\\"If you can understand the supreme morality of this rule, then you can appreciate Ayn Rand. I believe her influence on today's commonly-accepted political assumptions, concepts and language has been underrated. Rand came to America from Soviet Russia just in time for the rise of the Popular Front and the worship of collectivism to become the jargon of the day. The very belief in individualism, much less the value of it, was being undermined (for an example of this in pop culture of the day, see the old Spencer Tracy film \\"A Guy Named Joe\\" where it's explained that nobody EVER achieves anything on his own; each of us had help every single second of the way).Confronted with this groupthink, Rand realized that America had a unique political philosophy, that of individualism. But she also realized that (beyond the outdated 19th century rhetoric of the \\"self-made man\\") America in the '30s and '40s had no stock language or popular concepts to explain or express that philosophy to itself. Accordingly, she saw this unarticulated political philosophy in danger of disappearing, and foresaw that America's greatness would go with it.Like de Tocqueville, she made it her mission in life to explain America to itself, but in this case with a decided prescriptive bent. Intellectuals like to cite F.A. Hayek's 1944 book \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" as the seminal work that explains how collectivist government and social structures can lead to a loss of freedom and national vitality. But Ayn Rand's books have sold in the millions (her two main works usually are in Amazon's top 500 best sellers). Unlike Hayek's thought, her ideas were expressed with a popular propagandists's vulgar touch, had a much broader and deeper influence. Polls consistently show that Americans name \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as the second most influential book in their lives, right after the Bible.Admittedly, Rand is a problematic writer because of (among other things) her dogmatic, extreme way of expressing her views; and because of her contrarian delight in redefining traditionally negative words like \\"selfish\\" and \\"egoist\\" in positive terms. Where Rand says \\"egoist\\" we today would say \\"inner-directed\\" or \\"having intellectual and spiritual integrity\\" and so on. Where Rand says \\"selfish\\" we would say \\"not co-dependent\\" or \\"healthy self-assertion\\" or \\"taking proper care of ourselves\\" etc.Rand over-idealizes free market economics as part of her dogmatic reaction against the worship of statism and planned economies that dominated mid-20th century political thought in the USA, Europe, and USSR.Rand's efforts to portray her ideal of the free man or woman of inner-directed values can seem, paradoxically, like quasi-fascist idolatry of the Neitzchean Superman who worships nothing but his own strength. I don't think that's at all what Rand intended (I believe her heroes were iconoclastic creative geniuses like Edison, Frank Lloyd Wright, etc), but some readers take it that way.Finally, if you believe that an artist should be judged not just by their work but by their private lives, then you'll be dismayed that Rand's marriage, sex life, and friendships were all disasters to varying degrees.Despite these problems, I believe Rand is still very much worth reading today. She explains (and, in her novels, she dramatizes) how there can be a noble idealism of loyalty to the self, and how there can be an admirable morality of competitive meritocracy. She explains/dramatizes why these value systems are equally deserving of respect (if not more) as the ethics of self-denigration, self-negation, self-hate, and self-\\"sacrifice\\" that we still hear preached so often today."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand escaped from poverty and authoritatarian rule in Communist Russia to finally settle in America. Her background would have had a great deal of influence on her philosophy of 'objectivism'. In objectivism a man does what makes him happy and if he contributes to others his reward is commensurate with his contribution. He is not responsible for supporting other people financially or emotionally and should not be punished or made to feel guilty for not giving away all his money, time, effort if he decides not to do so. Ayn Rand believes that in socialism (ethos - each man contributes as per his ability and receives as per his need) encourages parasitism as people realise that they can receive more by proving that they are pathetic and needy. In time they lose self respect and transfer the burden of their well being onto the remaining people who want to work and contribute. These people of ability shoulder a greater and greater burden till eventually they reach the point of snapping and decide either to conform or to rebel against the system that systematically victimises them.Atlas was of course the Greek god who held up the heavens to prevent them falling on the people below. It was a physically exhausting, thankless task and Ayn Rand in this novel explores what would happen to the world if Atlas got fed up. What would happen if Atlas shrugged?The beginning of the novel starts with a nice touch of mystery as people are becoming aware of an ominous nameless darkness that is enveloping America. Good hard working capable people are becoming harder and harder to find. Famous inventors, businessmen, musicians are vanishing. Getting things done has become an uphill struggle and increasing government interference and increasing nepotism and socialism in the upper class and a sense of entitlement and unionism in the lower classes is putting a break on progress as well as a degradation in moral values. Nobody wants to work and yet everyone feels entitled to rewards. People are beginning to ask \\"Who is John Galt?\\" a frightening phrase that has become common parlance and that everybody feels holds the answer to the problems that they are facing but nobody really knows how they know this or even where the phrase comes from. The way this builds up initially is quite suspenseful and pretty well done.Dagny (VP of a rail company) and Rearden (inventor of Rearden steel) are the capable no nonsense people who are trying to get things done but find themselves increasingly unable to as America falls apart at the seams. Finally the riddle is solved - the most capable people in America are going on strike. Led by a man named John Galt they have decided that they are no longer going to support everyone else and have built a Utopian village where they are waiting for the world to fall apart without them. They plan to go back to 'real life' only once the world realises that it has a morally bankrupt system of ethics that cannot work and they cannot endlessly victimise the rich, the talented and the capable and force them to support everyone else endlesly.Dagny then has to make the choice - does she give up on her railroad and join the ranks of the John Galt brigade or does it mean too much for her to watch disintegrating as incompetents run it into the ground.That then is the basic outline of the book which is promising. However it is way too long (a little like this review perhaps) and worse repetitive to a degree that you can skip a hundred pages and not really miss anything you haven't already read. There is a 60 page soliloquoy at the end which could have been summarised to half a page with no loss of content (no exaggeration).The characters are deliberately (hopefully) exaggerated to caricature levels to make the point so if it's Vikram Seth realism that you're looking for then this is not the book for you.And as for the philosophy - it makes an eloquent and passionate appeal for not being guilty about being successful or for being who you are. It also starkly highlights a reality that I've become more and more aware of after working for a big company - the number of people who are parasitic, who believe that the world owes them a living and who will dodge responsibility and accountability in order to just get by doing the minimum they can.Obviously the philosophy is taken to the extreme - I don't believe it takes into account things like market failures like pollution, inequitable access to education, the starving debt ridden poor who don't have the tools to drag themselves out even through hard work, etc. Also from a community point of view the philosophy that 'I am not responible for anyone who believes they are dependent on me' doesn't take into account that children are financially and emotionally dependent and arguably should be supported on a 'need based' system of morality rather than the amount they 'contribute' to society. Neither Ayn Rand nor any of the characters in her stories have children. None of the 'heroes' in her stories would help out a friend in need unless they were certain their 'investment' would be paid back with interest because they would believe that charity disables.Overall this is a passionately written book (to the point of fundamentalism) and is pretty thought provoking whether you agree with the points or not. (The writing style is not the point in this book. The point is the ideology).Overall I would have given this book 5 stars if if had been 200 pages because it would have been a smashing read. However ultimately I'm giving it 3 stars because it stretches the point to 1087 pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read books that advocate collectivism, socialism, \\"progressive\\" policies.... and I must admit that I did not \\"enjoy\\" them. I understood them, found a couple to be interesting, but I do not care for the philosophies they advocate. If you are a modern day liberal or moderate you will not enjoy Ayn Rand's work. She doesn't allow for any middle ground. I am sure Atlas Shrugged will frustrate you to no end. It is as simple as that. If you believe that no individual, or government, should have the right to take from one individual to give to another...you will agree with Rand.The question the story addresses is, what would happen to the world if the main producers of the world went on strike? Rand chose to answer the question as a means to explain her philosphy. She goes into great detail to describe how the producers in society are treated by the unproductive, or less productive members of society, and why the producers eventually give up. Page after page go into describing the psychology of the main characters and there are frequent passages that could be described as lectures.This paragragh addresses some of the comments I read in reviews before I decided to read Atlas Shrugged. I can see how some people would feel insulted by some of the language Rand uses when talking about the James Taggarts of the world, but it is better to read the book and disagree with it, rather than choosing to never read it. As for preaching \\"hate\\", I did not get that feeling from the book. If anything, it seems to me that Rand preached indifference to those characters that always tried to stake a claim to others. Here is my guess at Rand's philosophy in practice.....if a bum on the street had asked Rand for money, my guess is that she would have politely answered \\"no\\" or ignored the bum and continued on her way. I don't think she would have felt pity or anger for the bum, simply because the bum made a series of decisions that placed him in that position. To put it another way, why should the bum get her sympathy? His position is just. But, he would not be the target of her anger either. Unless he declared some \\"right\\" to that which SHE had earned, his presence created no hardships on her life and happiness.My last comment is an expression of my opinion on our national policies. Rand was a student of history and economics. You can tell by the way she works in so many fine examples of poor government policy, \\"misplaced good intentions\\". History is littered with them. It is hard to believe that she wrote this book over 50 years ago, yet our nation has gone further down the path toward a \\"People's State\\" than it was when she wrote the book. As Milton Friedman wrote...there is no free lunch...so why do we continue to try to give out free lunches?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book caught my eye because of its immense size and interesting cover. I thought to my self this would be a good book to read, knowing nothing about the author, or the contents of the book, going only on the gut feeling I had that this was an intellectually good book.The readers finds them self in an epic time of industrialization, but towards the end of the process. Trains are still the primary mode of transportation, and industrial titans run the country. Ayn Rand takes license with the environment of the story: it is most like an America in the 1920s with the technological innovations of the 50s.The book, philosophical message aside, is an enthralling action adventure story with twists turns after every seeming resolution. The heros and villains are gigantic, towering, representing the extreme of their evil. Rand paints such a vivid picture that as I was reading through the book I found my personality and worldview actually shifting as the book delves deep and deep into the philosophical mean it hopes to permit.Rands philosophy &Ograve;Objectivism&Oacute; seems extreme to critics because one of the main tenants is that selfishness is the ultimate virtue. At first I was critical of the philosophy but I would challenge anyone to read this lengthy (1200 pages) and not at least respect Ayn Rands ideas."},{"Title":"Tell Me How Long the Trains Been Gone","review":"Does it sound trite in cold print to say that a book changed your life? In college in the 1970s, a friend suggested this novel to me, and it was my first exposure to James Baldwin. For the first time in my life, I felt I was reading about *me*. Baldwin's gift in writing about how people try to find dignity and self-worth in a world not of their own choosing is breathtaking and heartfelt. Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider will feel great empathy with Baldwin's work. In Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone, Baldwin focuses on the shifting relationships between a small group of people trying to work out who they are and how they can be true to themselves in an environment that's often uncaring. Over and over I was struck by the amount of raw experience Baldwin poured onto each page, and the amount of pain that must have been behind each sentence. As the years have gone by, I've also found that you can reread Baldwin at different stages of your life and see something different each time.Baldwin may be better known for his essays than his fiction, but I've always found his fiction more powerful. This novel, and Just Above My Head, are two of the most beautiful works I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tell Me How Long the Trains Been Gone","review":"If Giovanni's Room is an unresolved love story between two men, Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone puts its protagonist in the center of social spotlight where ideals of ethnics, politics, and sex force him to put on a mask. Leo Proudhammer, a 39-years-old black man, suffers from a heart attack at the height of his theatrical career, forcing him to abort all ongoing performance and rehearsal. As he hovers between life and death, James Baldwin delineates a tapestry of human life that is terrifyingly vulnerable - through the meticulous choices that have rendered him enviously famous in theater, through the racial and gay covering that have split him into multiple identities.There exists something edgy and cruel about a childhood riddled with braving the Harlem streets. Proudhammer often found him in the spotlight of eyes: eyes of children who outjocked him, eyes of the white cops toward whom he felt a rush of murderous hatred, and the tell-tale eyes of the older folks who suspected of his sexuality. The prose sustains a tincture of anguish, a tinge of paranoid, of being black in a society that at times seems poised on the brink of unstoppable racial war owing the ludicrous demands to cover stereotype associated with both race and sexuality.The theatrical industry which Proudhammer desires throws him further in disguises. Ironically it is through the many disguises he wears that he comes to term with his means. Instead of fleeing from the truth, he is approaching the reality. Disguises in a sense help make the truth a quantity with which he can live. In the juggling selves, Proudhammer retains loyalty to a white woman and a young black man. At first he might be most intimidated by his color for he does not appear to know that he is colored. He is met with people's baleful exasperation as if he is possessed by some evil spirit. Then he begins to be intimidated (and confronted), far more grievously, by the fact of his sexuality. He is gripped with the realization that he has never, in the sexual context, arrived at an understanding of being bisexual or gay.Written during a time in which racism and assimilation to white norms are horrifyingly rife, Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone brings to vivid view a man struggling to become himself through identities of a black man, a bisexual man, and an artist. Various occasions demand him to cover one of more of these identities in order to fit in. The novel pieces together moments of a man's life that teach one the price of human connection. Trapped in the wrong time, at the wrong place, and with the wrong ambitions trapped in the wrong skin, Proudhammer's perseverance earns him a reward that redeems and justifies all that pain, stigma, and bewilderment he once experienced."},{"Title":"Tell Me How Long the Trains Been Gone","review":"This is another of James Baldwin's literary triumphs. Here he weaves the deepest hopes, sorrows, fears and desires of the human condition into an unforgettable tapestry. The story centers around an actor named Leo Proudhammer and the choices he made in his life, the results that followed and the people he shared his life with. Here we read about Leo as a youngster growing up in Harlem, his struggles as a young man trying to break into showbiz amidst a multitude of obstacles and his successful rise to stardom. This is a very poignant and tender but, powerful and gripping story that will hold your attention.

I also find it useful to do so here as well in reviewing \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone\\":\\"Okay, the average black male kid on the average ghetto city block today knows, and knows without blinking, and knows from some seemingly unspoken source deep within his genetic structure that the cards are stacked against him.

The average Latino male kid on the average barrio city block pretty much knows that same thing, again usually on some bogus drug charge. And nowadays young black and Latina women are getting that same message coded into their psyches.\\"And that sums up the message behind almost all of Baldwin's' best work, at least the message that will last and that should be etched in the memory of every fighter for social justice.Now I have been, as is my wont when I get \\"hooked\\" on some writer, on something of a James Baldwin tear of late, reading or re-reading everything I can get my hands on. At the time of this review I have already looked at \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\", the play \\"Blues For Mr. Charlie\\", and \\"If Beale Street Could Talk. Frankly, those works, caught my attention more so that this work of \\"black uplift\\". Although it is well-written and powerful in spots it did not remind me why I was crazy to read everything that Baldwin wrote when I was a kid.Why? Well, while I could definitely relate to the main character, Leo's, struggle to make a career for himself in the very white theater of his day and I could also sympathize with his struggle against the ingrained racism that he faced in daily life, even when he was successful, there was just a little too much self-satisfaction to move me into his direction. I will say that Baldwin's use, as on previous occasions, of the two-tier past and present interspersed literary format to tell Leo's early story (and his brother Caleb's and his white paramour Barbara's as well) and his current ill-health induced dilemma makes the novel move better than expected when I started reading the book.That said, Baldwin is at his best when he creates situations where his characters have to confront the hard, hard reality of up-front racism in American. Little scenes like \\"being black\\" while in small town New Jersey, being black while in big time Broadway, and being black while dealing with a white (female) lover bring home the point nicely. And of those racial nodal points the strongest is when Baldwin has the bi-sexual Leo's male paramour, Black Christopher, who represents the \\"new\\" post- civil rights movement young black draws just the right historical parallel to the Jewish experience in World War II when he states, in effect- we will not go sheepishly into the concentration camps that the whites have ready for us when things get too hot. Powerful stuff. To bad it got buried in a story line that in the end has Leo traipsing off to Europe and not worthy of such insights."},{"Title":"Tell Me How Long the Trains Been Gone","review":"... could ever have confounded happiness with this rage. Yet, the scene we entered had been tirelessly reproduced, in stale and meticulous, absolutely libelous detail, in countless musical comedies and innumerable pork-chop-in-the-sky films: the nigger, moving in uncanny time to the music, hips, hands, and feet working, all flashing teeth and eyes, without a care in the world.\\"Yes, the rage is still there, captured so authentically by Baldwin, the spokesman for those marginalized by the larger white, heterosexual society. The stereotype that was promoted, as indicated in the above paragraph, for so many years, of the \\"happy darkie,\\" has disappeared from mainstream American society, in the course of some 50 years. I first read Baldwin over 40 years ago, starting with \\"Another Country,\\" then going on to \\"Go Tell It on The Mountain\\" and \\"The Fire Next Time.\\" Some of the other reviewers did not believe this book was of the same caliber as the others. I demur. The anger and anguish of the dispossessed leaps out, as in the other novels, but with each there are different facets, which make Baldwin so much more than a \\"one novel\\" author.The book starts with the heart attack of a (very!) youthful and successful black American actor, Leo Proudhammer, at the age of 39. In short order, it is apparent that his lover is a white woman, Barbara, in an age when this was still somewhat \\"edgy.\\" Through flashbacks Baldwin describes an upbringing in Harlem, with the poverty, and the \\"emasculation\\" of a father who cannot provide for his family, and the loss of his older brother Caleb to jail as he associated with \\"the wrong crowd.\\" The white police make more than just a cameo appearance, always a looming and threatening presence. And there is the detailing of another \\"edgy\\" crowd, the theater people, where \\"mixed\\" liaisons are largely acceptable, even the homosexual ones with \\"Black Christopher.\\"Baldwin also transcends the issues related to \\"America's dilemma,\\" to use Gunner Myrdal's phrase, and addresses those of the human condition. Consider insights into the medical profession with: \\"Hi, there, sleepy-head!\\" she cried cheerfully--with that really unnerving cheerfulness of nurses; one dare not speculate on what awful knowledge the cheerfulness hides-- (p66) or of fame: \\"People who achieve any eminence whatever are driven to do so; and there is always something terribly vulnerable about such people. They very soon discover that their eminence makes of them an incitement and a target--it does not cause them to be loved. They are trapped on their hill. They cannot come down.\\" (p 444) And then there is the possibly extremely prophetic: \\"We were the only colored people there. I had worked in the kitchen, not a hundred years ago; outside were the millions of starving--Chinese\\".....\\" This groaning board was a heavy weight on the backs of many millions, whose groaning was not heard. Beneath this table, deep in the bowels of the earth, as far away as China... an energy moved and gathered and it would , one day, overturn this table...\\" (p 477). And stop buying our T-bills, for example?Baldwin eventually gave up on America, and sought solace in France. His final resting place is high on the hills overlooking the Mediterranean, in St. Paul de Vence. He did not live long enough to hear the new President of the United States speak in his inaugural address of one who might have been refused a seat at a lunch counter now taking the oath of office for the highest position in the land. For those who did not live through the period of these 50 years, and for those who did, Baldwin remains as vital a read as ever. And although the stereotypes about Blacks have largely disappeared from polite discourse, they certainly have been replaced by those concerning Muslims, much to the same end, of distancing \\"us\\" from \\"them.\\" I suspect Baldwin would have been equally appalled at this transformation."},{"Title":"Tell Me How Long the Trains Been Gone","review":"I am a firm believer that any writer worthy of the ink expended in the pursuit of his creative genius should be able to hook a reader into his story within the first one hundred pages of the novel. I'm disappointed to say that this novel by Baldwin falls far short of my expectations of good writing and specifically my expectations of him. In most novels, the author uses the story as a means to make a point. Throughout the first hundred pages of this novel I couldn't help but feel that Baldwin was writing, instead, to prove a point. This would be understandable had the novel been written during the early years of Baldwin's career. During that period publishers showed little interest in the talents of Black writers. Relegating their work as inferior in comparison to that of white authors. However, this novel was published well into Baldwin's career, yet it appears to me that Baldwin is writing more so to prove his ability to write, than to tell a compelling story. The novel's pace is labored with the use of excessive language, creating complex sentence structures that distract from the rhythm of the story. The characters (at least those introduced in the first hundred pages of the book) are lifeless, uninteresting. If a writer can not establish a relationship with the reader through his characters within the first hundred pages why should the reader invest any more of his time?My experience with some of Baldwin's previous works, specifically, Giovanni's Room and The Fire Next Time, was phenomenal. Although Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone falls short of my expectations, my overall experience of Baldwin's work thus far leaves no doubt that in my mind that he was an exceptional writer, worthy of all the acclaim bestowed him. For this reason, I'll continue to read his work, fiction and non-fiction, knowing that with all his greatness, he too like the rest of us, experienced times when he was not at his best."},{"Title":"Passion for Hire (Lovegram Historical Romance)","review":"Ok, ok, ok, I don't think my stomach can stand any more of Alsobrook's very funny novels.

I read it cover to cover before my husband and I cruised last year. I felt like I already had a jump start when we boarded our boat. I liked reading about all of the boats and that was how we decided on the cruise we took. The chapters were divided so you could pick the ones that contained information that was vital to you. We are going on yet another cruise with our children so I went back and reread the Chapter that is about cruising with kids. I would recommend this book to anyone even thinking about taking a cruise vacation."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Cruise Vacations, Second Edition","review":"This book is too big and covers too little that the average first- or multiple-time cruiser wants or needs to know.Much of the information -- particularly about ships -- is time-sensitive and outdated. This may be corrected in the next edition, but will probably by out-dated by the time the new and improved version &quot;ships&quot;.It's hard to figure out why &quot;Cruise Lingo Word-Find&quot; ... one of those puzzles where you draw lines around particular terms, was worth a page in the book. Many of the 446 pages are what might be called, kindly, &quot;filler.&quot;The set-in about meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous was particularly grating. Any member of AA knows that &quot;Friends of Bill W&quot; is the buzz term to be found in the ship's newspaper or anywhere else members might meet.The tips on tipping are quite off-base. The idea of tipping one-half to either a room steward or a waiter for a child makes no sense. Anyone with children knows that they're more trouble than the average adult ... and they do take up a seat in the dining room ... and probably want to order from a kids' menu. Tipping half for more work?Further, the author states that the tip exceptions are &quot;ritzy Seabourne and Radisson&quot; then goes on to say that a cruiser OUGHT to tip on Radisson?This book would have benefitted from a good copy editor and a first-class fact-checker, to say nothing of an expert in design.Overall, this is not a well-researched or well-presented book.There are a few good bits of information included, but paying for the book might put the buyer in the &quot;Idiot&quot; class."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Cruise Vacations, Second Edition","review":"This is an amazing find.

If anything, Human Croquet is even better. A tighter narrative, a closer grasp upon the characters in her book, and an incredible wit and talent for characterisation have combined to greatly improve upon Atkinson's style. Behind the Scenes was an awesome debut. Human Croquet is a marvellous book. I fell instantly in love with the characters, even the ones you aren't really sure you're supposed to like, but do anyway (Aunt Vinny is an absolute black delight.). It explores realities and dreamlands, plays around with our expectations and thoughts, and eventually everything falls into place. You MUST re-read this book at least three times. It's the only way you will ever realise just what a superlative work of art it is - complex, deep, and very, very clever....I have just discovered that Kate Atkinson's next book is out in June! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!Anyway... there is so much I could say about this book - it is a devastatingly devious whodunnit, that you don't even realise is a whodunnit until you realise it IS one; it is a extremely funny, barbed and ironic book; it is a character driven piece as well as a plot-driven piece. It is one of my top 10 books of all time. The only other book I can think of that comes even close to Kate Atkinson's style in this book is Jostein Gaarder's &quot;The Solitaire Mystery&quot;"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I bought this book after reading Behind the Scenes at the Museum. I really like Kate Atkinsons writing style.This is a story of much complexity and I couldn't put it down. The story is about a 16 year old girl, Isobel Fairfax and her story is sad, humorous, disturbing and compelling. I was transfixed with genius of the writing. You are taken through the past and present and are never sure what is real and what is not but before the book ends you quickly drawn to the reality of it all.Finding the truth of what happened to Eliza, Isobels mother, is especially interesting. This book also goes into the world of all the people involved with Isobel. A lot going on here.It is in much the same style as Fall on Your Knees, by Ann-Marie Macdonald.Didn't give it 5 stars because I could have probably done without the Shakespeare part, but it was really a gread read!!!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Kate Atkinson has a quite unusual and creative style of writing. If you like very linear,unambiguous fiction, she is definitely not for you but if you are up for a challenging and extraordinary read, check this, her second novel, out. It's hard to describe &quot;Human Croquet&quot; without sounding unbearably pretentious or giving away too much of the plot. Simply put,&quot;Human Croquet&quot; is the story of Isobel Fairfax, a teenager growing up in northern England in the early 1960s -- but the book goes far beyond the traditional coming-of-age story, with its time-bending, imaginative plot. History is intermingled with the present, dreams with reality, and alternate realities are at war with what's actually happening in Isobel's life. The characters are vivid and real, the writing is funny and witty and fresh, and Isobel's story and voice grip you from the beginning. Thoroughly enjoyable, and well worth the trip."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Wow! This novel is incredible. I started it after dinner, and it was so good I stayed up all night to finish it - I literally couldn't put it down. This novel is witty and charming, and Atkinson gets everything right - Isobel's search for the truth about her mother, her infatuation with Malcolm Lovat...Trust me, you will love this novel. Atkinson's first novel, &quot;Behind the Scenes at the Museum,&quot; is also wonderful. Read them both!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I found myself overwhelmed by this story and atmosphere in which it was told. Every now and then I had to just stop reading and absorb the newest information. Kate Atkinson's writing is multidimensional and stunning, as she interwove times, people, and plots so that they were overlaid upon each other...yet not. I am amazed that anyone can write like this. Now I will have to re-read the book to understand what was \\"really\\" happening. And I cannot see the final pages as an ending with \\"too much reality\\" because I'm asking myself 'is that how it really ended?' or how Isobel wanted it to end?"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Atkinson is an extremely witty and clever author. Every page (often every paragraph or sentence) contains something to wonder at, to laugh at, to be surprised at. I am a sucker for time travel novels and this had every appearance of being one -- but then it wasn't quite that at all. The ending left me a bit less satisfied than the first nine-tenths, but even so, I read it all hungrily and will read more of this literary author's work. I especially liked, as I usually do, that things don't always turn out happy and that people are mixed -- both good and something far different. Even if you ignore the larger themes about time and how our world operates, you can enjoy the story every page of the way."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I started reading Human Croquet with a great sense of excitement (after all, I haven't read a good book since Behind the Scenes at the Museum). And Kate Atkinson certainly didn't disappoint me.Once more, she manages to play with dream and reality, past, present and future in an extraordinary exercise of style. The easiness with which she describes people, places and times as if she had the ability to cut out a slice of time for you is remarkable indeed.But above all, she manages to bring to life yet another truly great character. Isobel Fairfax is sensible, generous, she has a wonderful sense of humour and this amazing sense of reality whilst travelling through the magical depths of time. Although different from Ruby Lennox in Behind the Scenes at the Museum, Isobel displays the same essential characteristic; both are extremely lovable. Kate Atkinson makes you think with them, feel with them, and suddenly Ruby and Isobel become your friends.Ruby is a precious stone, Isobel is a beautiful pearl; Kate Atkinson has the gift of a jeweller to turn raw material into a magical sparkle of life. I can't wait for her next masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Although Shakespeare's play is never referenced, the symbolism of the Forest of Arden in As You Like It (where identity is a game and relationships are as mutable as time) is clear in this witty, wise, confusing, magically realistic novel that reminds one of Mervin Peake's Gormenghast trilogy and of Jane Eyre simultaneously. This is without a doubt one of the best books I've read this year, for the story, the characters, and Atkinson's marvelously fluid writing style. If I sound like I'm trying to write a literary assessment of the book, it's because it extends into so many areas and dimensions, successfully and in an entertaining way."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"This was one of the strangest books I've ever read and believe me,I read alot. 16 year old Isobel of Arden,England expriences a series of strange occurances surrounding herself and her dysfunctional family. The action goes back and forth,hence the title. As you continue reading you see why but I won't give away the ending(of course). Atkinson writes beautifully and really pulls you in with her words. Her characters are fully realized as well,human beings that are both ordinary and unusual at the same time. Not an \\"easy\\" read at times but well worth the effort.."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Kate Atkinson has done what no other author (that I have read) has been able to do: capture a dream on paper. Human Crouquet flows so effortlessly from one storyline to the next that the reader can actually sit down with it for an hour, or a day, and escape into someone else's dreams. It seems as though all the other reviewers prefered Atkinson's first book, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, to this one, but I can easily say that Human Crouquet is the best book ever written, in my opinion, and I can't wait for Kate Atkinson to write another one"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Since this book is labeled as mainstream, it was quite a surprise to realize that Kate Atkinson plays with reality and time much the same way as the sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. This can be most clearly seen in the later half of the book, which consists solely of several dreamlike episodes... and in the end the reader can't be certain, what really happened.But. Then, just when you think Atkinson really made it, she spoils everything by explaining very sensibly and accurately all about the later events in the characters' lives. This destroys the magic and makes me think that mainstream writers shouldn't play with topics as difficult as these. Why did Atkinson feel she had to put her story back to the earth? A big mistake, I say. Without the last pages this would've been a great novel. Now I can't give more than 3 stars."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I came upon &quot;Human Croquet&quot; after reading Atkinson's first novel, &quot;Behind the Scenes...&quot; and quite frankly I do have to admit I preferred the first. Having a debut novel established on such solid ground would, I presume hold a challenging task for any given author when undertaking the writing and publication of a follow-up, and Atkinson herself is no exception. There are less characters in &quot;Human Croquet&quot; yet too often the plot and its events are far too complicated and confusing for the reader, as often you get completely confused with what has actually happened or what is merely the result of Isobel (the protagonist's) imagination. We see the object of Isobel's affection, Malcom Lovatt, die three times and in the closure of the novel we are given the events of his life story in just a few lines. The novel is seemingly full of bizarre contradictions and in summary the novel seems to lack the originality and freshness of its predecessor. What we can expect of &quot;Emotionally Weird&quot; certainly leaves a lot to be desired. A substantial effort."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"As in Behind the Scenes at the Museum, Kate Atkinson offers the reader brilliant and beautiful, wonderful writing with a few characters that are a bit too one-dimensional. I thought as I read this novel that it raised fascinating questions about the nature of time itself; unfortunately, I was wrong. As in Behind the Scenes, in this otherwise excellent book, Kate Atkins goes for a cheap B-movie \\"surprise\\" ending, an ending I am amazed any editor wouldn't insist on her rewriting. It's a shame that this gifted writer can't end her novels better. I loved both books until the last few chapters."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Although I normally enjoy Kate Atkinson's books, I didn't like this one. It goes back and forth between dreams and reality and it is hard to tell which is which. I didn't even finish reading the book, although, I must admit, I did read the last chapter."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Set in the 1960's in the town of Lythe in England, the tale focuses around a girl, Isobel, at the time of her 16th birthday. However, the story travels throughout history at this location, venturing back and forth as pieces of the puzzle of Isobel's past are unveiled. Isobel has found that she slips in time, seeing past events that are all somehow connected to her life. Her mother left their family while she was young, and as we find out, their father abandoned Isobel and her brother Charlie not long after, leaving them in the care of his mother and sister, until finally returning with a new wife. It is clear that the Fairfax family is in decline, and a history shows how they have fallen over time. It is clear that in addition to her family, some of her neighbors also have dark secrets. The truths once discovered are ugly and at times sad, and are mixed with Isobel maturing into a young lady along with some of the conventional horrors of the teenage years, particularly when she relives a particularly traumatic day, each time with a different ending. This book crosses genres, with elements of science fiction (time travel), mystery/suspense, history, and a coming of age story. There is also an underlying theme of Shakespeare and the Forest of Arden. This was an unusual and complex tale with an intriguing approach to storytelling."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I loved Emotionally Weird, which was the first novel I read by her, so I decided to check out the novels she wrote before it. Human Croquet sounded interesting and weird so I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. While it took me about eighty pages to really start getting into it (Isobel's first-person narration was a bit off-putting at first), I'm glad I kept reading. The past sections (written in third-person) were very good and as weirder and weirder occurrences started happening to Isobel, I liked her sections better as well. Overall, while I liked Emotionally Weird more, Human Croquet is still a worthwhile read, especially if you're in the mood for something a little different. I'm looking forward to getting hold of her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, sometime in the future.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Behind the Scenes at the Museumhas sat on my shelves for months;now that I see how wonderful thisauthor is, I must read it, too.\\"How can I trust reality when the phenomenal world appears to be playing tricks on me at every turn?\\" Eliza tells us.And, indeed, it does.

I liked Emotionally Weird very much, though, and look forward to her other books."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Human Croquet is a great summer vacation read. The story is a contemporary Alice in Wonderland, where nonsense reigns and the only rule is that rules don't apply.

This magically written and initially captivating story about a young girl and her eccentric family turns into a jumbled mess of confused ramblings in the last third of the book. The book seemed to stop in midsentence with an affected summary attached on for explanation. I had absolutely no clue what was going on and what's more I do not think the author did either."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Human Croquet introduces a variety of charactors both from the past and present. There is a sense of mystery throughout the book concerning Eliza's disappearance. The ending was totally unexpected and completely stunned me. This novel demands your attention from the start and retains it constantly.

A great book for those who don't have a lot of time to read; it keeps you hooked."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I just can't stop read it! Isobel's live is so piercing and unbelievable that it's still a pleasure to leap from one page to another even if it's not the first time..."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Kate Atkinson knows how to write a great book. Having read virtually thousands of novels during my seventeen years, I've grown increasingly frustrated with the &quot;formula&quot; writers who all sound exactly the same. Luckily, Ms. Atkinson has dared to break the mold. In this sparkling story, we are led through the fascinating mind of Isobel Fairfax, are introduced to her dysfunctional but enjoyable family, and an array of very human characters. The characters here are a little exaggerated, but Atkinson uses such brilliant imagery in her descriptions that we can easily forgive her. At the heart of the story is the mystery of Eliza, Isobel's mother, who disappeared years ago. Strange, inexplicable fluctuations in time slowly reveal more of the story behind the mystery as we are led into the past and through several different realities of the future. Following the time jumps can be confusing, but the patient reader will be rewarded in the end. I am a very critical reader, and I loved this book- so go read it!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"The bits of this book narrated by 16 year old Isobel are terrific, I recommended it to all my friends who read &quot;The Tooth Fairy&quot; (I still haven't gotten my copy of that back it's so popular!). The humor, the rather forgiving cynicism, the detached outlook of a teenage outcast whose life has been in upheaval since she can remember, are all top-notch. Best yet, the kid is a voracious reader and her narratives are spiced with literary allusions and inside jokes. When her life starts to take on even more oddness -- dopplegangers, impossible mementos from her missing mother, momentary slips into other periods in time, she handles these aberrations with the same resigned humor.The only reason I don't give this book a five is that the narrative is too choppy and the plot threads too many. Maybe I just lack the subtlety and intelligence to see how all the bits fit together, but overall I wished she'd stayed with Isobel and let her tell her story in her own voice. Caveat emptor, also, it's a funny book but it's very dark, the teenage girl directly experiences or indirectly suffers the results of every sort of human abuse: rape, murder, incest, spouses killing each other, mother's abandoning children, men beating wives, adults beating children, you name it.I'm really looking forward to reading other works by Atkinson, and I guess that's the highest praise."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I found this book extremely difficult to read because of the constant time shifts. I expected complex plots from Kate Atkinson but usually it all makes sense in the end and one can appreciate the journey. However, in this book, parts of the story remain unclear at the end. None of the characters really seem to matter. Moreover, it is never entertaining enough to warrant the time spent trying to work it all out."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"It is always a bit scary to try a second novel when the first one was so overwhelmingly wonderful, but Human Croquet is another special novel by Atkinson. It is funny like Behind the Scenes at the Museum, but in quite a different way. The tragedy is more apparent here and accompanies you like a perfume through the book. The way Atkinson plays with time throws you totally off balance and makes you look at your perceptions and interpretations of the story in a very different way.I love it when I can submerse myself in a novel to that extent as if I am diving underwater and all day to day sensations are blotted out. All in all it is a wonderful book which makes you long for her next novel!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I bought Human Croquet after reading Started Early, Took My Dog by the same author, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Human Croquet does not feature her private eye Jackson Brodie, and is therefore of a very different character, missing the action and suspense of a whodunnit. But it affords a, sometimes heart-rending, insight into the thoughts and feelings of a young girl and into the genteel - and not so genteel - lives of the English countryside. Also, it is richly endowed with Atkinson's mordant, sometimes slightly malicious humour. What makes the book different is the juggling with time and space. Isobel, the main character, travels back in time (involuntarily!) at the most unexpected moments, much to her and our shock and surprise."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I read this book for a graduate class in postmodern fiction and absolutely loved it. The story is humorous, unexpected, and compelling. I connected with the characters and the story so easily that the book was almost impossible to put down. Atkinson is wonderfully talented and I can't wait to get started on her other novels."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"The writer who conceived of this book must have a tortuous mind. 'Human Croquet' is a wild, magical ride, and I found that the only way to read it was to jump on and go through to the end. I was a little disappointed in the easy way out (those who have read it will know), but found it the only flaw. If you enjoyed 'Sexing the Cherry' (Jeanette Winterson), you will love this book."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"A captivating and bewildering-in-a-good-way beach read. I couldn't stop thinking about the book after I'd finished.... The title is very apropos to the plot. And though, with all the time-jumping and flights of fantasy going on, I am still a little confused as to what *really* went on, I don't think reality is necessarily the point.Good show."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"Kate Atkinson has the potential to be a great story teller. The plot of this book was unique and interesting and I liked how she brought it all together near the end. The story had many areas that just dragged on and on and on. She spent extreme amounts of time focusing on insignificant details. There was one section of the book (about 50 pages) that was execeptional and I wanted to continue reading. If she could keep the momentum going throughout the book I would definitely be a fan."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I really liked \\"Case Histories\\" and was quite excited about starting this one. I am not the type of reader that only likes linear, neat storylines. Far from it. In fact, I like the challenge of a non-traditional novel, but this one didn't work for me. I liked parts of it quite a bit. Atkinson's sense of humor is really funny. Some of the dream sequences were interesting and well-developed. But, as a whole, the book just didn't work for me. I felt like it's unfinished and in real need of some editing, particularly all the run-ons and comma splices. As an English teacher, these really annoyed me, and made me want to bring out my grading pen! But, it's really the shifting narrators that bothered me. I don't think the story came together in any logical way. So, I can't say I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"This book was lovely -- beautiful descriptions, fascinating characters and plot, and an intriguing first chapter that hooked me instantly.

It was time well spent!"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I loved the way the reader gradually finds out more about the characters until the end. Every chapter added a new suprise that made me say, &quot;Oh my GOSH!&quot;. The time changes from Past to Present to Future also is enjoyable"},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"The plot of this book wasn't what grabbed me. It was the way the main character Isobel thought things out. How the author worded things in a very thoughtful and unique way. Plus the story went through the total subconcious of this girl. What went on in her mind. I don't think many people could pull this off, but she did, brilliantly."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I have read most of Kate Atkinson's books, but this is by far the best. It is a little different genre than her other books. Her writing is so superb.

Did that just happen?&#34; I highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"This author is extremely talented--her Jackson Brodie novels are gripping and her other works are noteworthy.

Her work is daring and inspires me to write more imaginatively myself."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"As Tartan Noir goes, this is awfully good, and also awfully Noir.The pleasure with Kate Atkinson is characters that leap off the page. Notonly do you know them, you want to know them, and keep knowing them longafter the story ends, even though they have enough dramas going on in theirlives for a few dozen Coronation Streets.The setting - Edinburgh, the lowlands of Scotland, sometimes northern England,is equally vivid, foggy, gloomy and sometimes menacing (does the sun NEVER comeout over there?)Kate Atkinson is a terrific writer, smart and sometimes wickedly funny but...warning: You don't read her stuff when you want cheering up."},{"Title":"Human Croquet","review":"My only problem with Kate Atkinson's books is that there are not enough of them! Her plots and characters are rich, complicated, and dare I say, as messy as life.

In fact, what makes Maz interesting to read is she is a story teller at heart.She tells her own story of coming to know stone skulls and her experiences with them which leads to the stories of other people and meditation techniques that have come through, like the Sacred Seven.Maz also gives recommendations on how to choose a stone, how to cleanse and dedicate it, and how to incorporate stone skulls onto our every day life.I would describe this book as inspired."},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"Marion has done it - plain and simple. Her words are clear, filled with loving admiration and knowledge for her subjects - contemporary carved stone skulls. There are books and countless websites about the ancient and old skulls, but there has been so little shared about the new skulls... until now. Marion covers ths subject very well - sharing good basic information and a lot of personal experiences and stories that help the reader connect with and understand the magic and mystery of the stone skulls. All too often contemporary skulls are dismissed in comparison to the ancient skulls, but those of us that have worked with the contemporary skulls recognize their power and presence. It's nice to see this recognitioned mirrored to us through Marion's work. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about contemporary stone skulls. If I could have given the work 10 stars, I would have without reservation."},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"For anyone intrigued by crystal skulls and wanting to work with one, this book is a must have. While there are a number of books out there talking about the ancient crystal skulls, this is the only book to talk about contemporary crystal skulls.The author speaks about the experiences of some current skull keepers and about her own skulls. But what really makes this book valuable is the section on working with your contemporary crystal skull. As most of us will never even see an ancient skull, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"This book filled a big gap for me.I have been fascinated by crystal skulls for quite a few years.That lead me to become the keeper of many contemporary and some not so contemporary skulls.Marion's book is full of invaluable advice on how to care for them, dedicate them to the Highest Good,communicate with them, let them help you with your healing work and spiritual development and so much more.Her Love for these special crystal companions shines through every word.I am very grateful to Marion for sharing her knowledge and experience."},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"Marion has finally written the book the crystal skull community has needed for so long. There are lots of books out there on the ancient crystal skulls, but a book on how to work with the contemporary crystal skulls was very much needed.

Thank you Marion for writing this book!"},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"marions book on crystal skulls is a wonderful book to help intoduce you into this facinating subject. she gives real life experiences and practical advice for learning to tune into and understand your crystal skulls. really loved and enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"I have been working with crystal skulls for two years now. During that time, I've read a lot of books, many of them excellent, but primarily with strong emphasis on the ancient skulls. Marion has done a wonderful job introducing readers to the amazing contributions of contemporary skulls. She shares information about selecting, cleansing, dedicating, becoming acquainted and working with skulls that come into one's keeping. I recommend this book for anyone who is curious about this crystal skull phenomenon. An excellent introduction for new keepers, and a great resource for those of us who have been working with contemporary skulls for years. I wish this book had been available a few years back when I started my own crystal skull journey!"},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"This book is unique among all books on crystal skulls inasmuch that it actually spends much of its time detailing the uses of modern skulls among healers and skull enthusiasts. This book begins with vignettes telling the tales of Maz's personal skulls and then moves on to well-known crystal skull enthusiasts/custodians/etc and their personal experiences.The latter half of the book presents information regarding communicating with crystal skulls, how to attune to them, cleanse them, use them in healing, build special gridworks from them, and numerous other wonderful techniques for inviting crystal skull energy into our lives.Additionally, their are appendices with contact information for those people mentioned in the book and reputable sources for high quality skulls.Overall, this is a wonderful companion to any crystal skull, ancient or otherwise!"},{"Title":"Crystal Skulls: Emissaries of Healing and Sacred Wisdom","review":"This book is very informative and gives a good background on crystal skulls.

I really liked my boyfriend, so I needed something to help me with the various confusing feelings I had about the relationship. I have been dating my divorced man for about three years now. In the beginning I consulted this book A LOT and it still gets pulled out every once and again when a new problem crops up and I feel vulnerable. Being a never married, childless 30-something, I found my divorced man's children (4!) and ex the hardest to deal with. This book helped me realize my feelings are okay and normal and also how to deal with them. A great reference guide for anyone dating a divorced person."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"Finally there's a soul out there who understands what i'm going through and can help me to see the light at the end of the tunnel. i've been on the verge of breaking up with my own fabulous/impossible divorced man but now, finally armed with the real scoop and the necessary tools, i'm hanging in there and slowly starting to soar.ladies, if you think you might need this book, then trust me, you do. i highly reccomend this to you."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"A great book for unmarried women dating a divorced man. Very insightful and really dished out the truth, not easy to take. I found myself throwing this book across the room at times, only to pick it back up and re-read and highlight selections. A must for an woman considering marrying a man with &quot;baggage&quot;."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I initially purchased this book when I found myself engaged to a divorced man complete with a six year old son. At the time I flipped through the book hoping to find some glimpse of what I was getting myself into, but truthfully it was too soon for me to have known what I was getting out of the deal.A year and half later, just after my first wedding anniversary, my husband pulled this book out of our book box and smiled as he passed it too me like a funny memory. I decided to flip through briefly for memory's sake and then suddenly found myself reading the entire thing from cover to cover a second time around. Eureka! This was exactly what I needed. Something real, something light, yet something powerful. Something that acknowledged every fear and stab of pain and guilt and complete rage I have experienced since my marriage to a divorced man. This book gave me that moment of hope that I needed to feel like all of my anger and resentment and sense of despare wasn't the result of some mental breakdown, and that I wasn't broken.Although the author's writing style might not be for everyone, it worked wonders for me. A book that focuses on the lighter side rather then the morbid process of dealing with someone elses divorce baggage. This had the right amount of business and pleasure.This book didn't make any of my problems go away but it certainly got me to lighten up and get a grip on my circumstances and give my husband a little more benefit of the doubt."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"Fram's book addresses many of the challenges women face when they marry a divorced man, including his guilt and residual divorce pain, his children, his ex, money, and bringing a new child into the marriage. Fram's take is humorous and geared more toward women who have jobs and have not had children yet. She takes a \\"modern\\" view that encourages women to tolerate less baloney than other books I've read on this subject. For these reasons, this book is worth reading and decent overall.However, Fram's book takes a \\"shotgun\\" approach to her material, talking about each topic somewhat randomly. She makes some good points, but they are lost in a sea of long paragraphs. In addition, though she provides some valuable advice, there isn't enough of it, and she doesn't go into much depth on most topics. And her case examples are a little weak, using the same 2 people over and over again.Overall, this book gives a woman marrying a divorced man the ability to identify with others in her position and the comfort of knowing her feelings are natural. But it doesn't thoroughly address the problems these women face, or provide enough advice on how to deal with them."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I found this book to be terrible. Seeing that Fram was the editor of both Seventeen and Cosmo, it's no wonder that this book read like a shi**y magazine article. Fram spends most of the book trying to convince her readers that Divorced Men are helpless and need a woman's touch to \\"save\\" them, and that \\"the X\\" is a manipulative monster who is out to get the reader and detroy lives.There is nothing in this book for those of us whom wish to build healthy relationships - not just with our boyfriends, but with their ex-wifes as well. To quote \\"Rare is the FateMate who is blessed with an X she actually likes. In fact, it occurs with woefully so few FateMates that it's not worth my time or ink to write on this subject any further.\\" Two sentences later, the chapter continues with \\"don't delude yourself, his X inherently hates you.\\"How is this book healthy, productive, or supportive in any constructive way?"},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"This book is a must for any woman over thirty who has not yet found her man. It's wise, funny, informative and written in a clear and comprehensive way.Not only does it tell you the in's and out's of dating and wedding a divorced man, it gives vital information to help you meet the many challanges along the way.I laughed, I cried, I loved it. I'm giving it to all my friends who still haven't been able to close the deal, or are completely sure they want to."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I've already married my divorced man and I wish I had read this before I took the plunge. I can't stress ENOUGH that marrying a divorced man with children, a crazy ex wife and alimony payments is a big freaking deal and that a woman needs to be smart and prepared. That said, this book will help prepapre you for some of the seemingly unbelievable scenarios you will face. I recommend it as a starting point for a woman in the early blissful days of a relationship. You'll need the perspective before you let yourself be taken away by the \\" love will help us through this!\\" stage. This book is an easy breesy but eyeopening read. Even now after being married and in the thick of things, I find it helpful!"},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I could not imagine a more honest and insightful (not to mention entertaining)book on the subject.

I am feel closer to him as a result. In fact, I am even considering getting my boyfriend a copy so he can learn about what he is going through and what I have to put up with!Thank you!"},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I found there was some useful advice in this book on understanding what goes through a divorced mans head when dating. It has helped me relate to my own boyfriend better. However, Fram uses the same 2 women as examples in the book who are dating divorced men with similar situations. It would have been nice to include an example of a man who has joint-custody (that is, 50/50) since it is on the rise as well as one who only has custody for 6-8 weeks over the summer."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"i've been going thru quite a difficult time with my own divorced guy, as have many of my girlfriends, and this book really helped me see that there is a possibility to make things work. or if not, to dump the guy...which i see now i needed permission to do. thanks leslie, i feel now i have choice in the matter.jean"},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"This book's name might be its worst enemy. A better name would be, \\"Successfully Dating a Divorced Man.\\" The title sounds trite, condescending to career women, and over traditional. Review: For a career-oriented woman who has not had children, dating a divorced man with kids was a huge adjustment. Luckily, I come from a family with a lot of children involved, so I was not at a total loss. However, I'd never had to \\"share\\" my man with ANYONE, and what could prepare one for THAT? It's a tough pill to swallow despite anyone's best and most mature efforts! Further, dating a very masculine man after I was married for 19 years to a \\"metrosexual\\" type .... Even tho I *thought* I knew men, and what they wanted (and had done VERY VERY WELL so far in my handling of this new relationship), the book still offered some VERY VALUABLE POINTERS on things I had missed out on.... and what this lady provides filled in the blanks closed the gap in what I was missing. Her advice helped us to have the best and most STRESS FREE relationship we could have! It is obvious that this book has changed my reactions to things that would have formerly resulted in a fight, or at least a heated discussion. Several times reading it, I was struck by the author's words... that had ALSO been previously been said to me by my WONDERFUL Divorced B.F. (!) Since reading it (very quickly, cover to cover), I have found my relationship with my divorced B.F. has gone to the next level. It's freed us up to GROW as a couple.... As woman, while we don't always like what we must do in these circumstances, the truth is, when we are involved with a divorced man, we are also involved with his entire family, including \\"the (often undermining and meddlesome) one who came before\\" us, and the \\"Mama Drama\\" land mines that lie therein. As she says, only a very emotionally mature woman could handle this set of circumstances. And tho some here are offended by her \\"take a backseat\\" and \\"put him and his kids first all the time\\" approach, I have found her words to ring so true - AT FIRST .... Yes! At first, it's all about HIM HIM HIM (and his kids, and sometimes his Ex. and even sometimes, his Ex's parents and siblings who may also try to interfere), but over time - as he heals and assuming you chose a truly good human being as your divorced man - then his TRUE and UNWOUNDED self will begin to shine thru. In short, if you can withstand the man and love him for who he is, and if you treat him right and don't elicit flashbacks, then you WILL get your DIAMOND at the end of your \\"rough\\" and hopefully, feel confident enjoying better times with his children, as well! So glad I took time to read it (and highlight the heck out of it!)."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"This came in a set and I found it useless. It became a donated book. There was not enough thought put into it."},{"Title":"How to Marry a Divorced Man","review":"I purchased this book, along with many others on the topic, including \\"Dating the Divorced Man.\\" This book was fantastic and the best I've read on the topic!

My boyfriend even made a comment this morning that he didn't know why I had changed but that he loved the changes in me and loves me even more. :) I would call that a success. I am happier and more at peace with my relationship and my concerns with dating a divorced man than ever before.I mentioned that I had also recently purchased and read \\"Dating the Divorced Man.\\" I wish I would have read HTMADM first! I was so disappointed and discouraged after reading \\"Dating a Divorced Man.\\" It made me question my relationship more than ever, focus on the negatives, and fight with my loving divorced man. I threw that book in the trash as soon as I finished reading it. HTMADM was the complete opposite! Thank you so much for writing this book! It provided me with the insight and advice I was desperately seeking.I am not getting married to my divorced man anytime soon nor am I looking to. I am, however, happily living with him. Even if you are not planning on getting married in the near future, actually, especially if you are not planning on getting married in the near future, read this book.

I started learning more by reading many about divorced men. This book certainly explained some struggles of the divorced men and helped you be more understanding to him but it is a bit too encouraging the woman to put effort in some part of the books...this part is making me uneasy because I believe that men, divorced or not, want to please woman and feel that it's him who wins the woman, not the woman wins him. The biggest turn off or pressure to them is that the woman is doing more than he does.This book is also written for those single women with no children.

However, it's heavy reading and a bit dated so many time I'll have to read through a paragraph multiple times in order to get the intended meaning of it. This is made worse by the fact that the OCR software that was used to scan in the book is imperfect... so many times it's difficult to tell if Locke is just expressing something in a way that is confusing to me, or if it's confusing because one of the words is wrong, or both."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Microsoft Active Server Pages 3 (Teach Yourself (IDG))","review":"It's very obvious this book is written by a staff. In attempting to hold your hand from the very most basic concept of a web page, to a fully database enabled ASP site (in 500 pages??), this book passes over nearly every necessary piece of information you could need. If you already know HTML, then half of this book is already worthless to you. And the authors of this book can't seem to decide whether they perfer HTML to XML, or VBScript to JScript. Examples of all of the above are scattered throughout the book, and leave you wondering which one you should know. Not to mention the &quot;article style&quot; format of this book, where each concept is intrduced and concluded in a 2 page block (whether the concept has been fully explored or not, they're gonna fit it into two pages), and right when you think you're going in one direction with ASP, they come in with an article about XML, and you're scratching your head again. My advice: if you know HTML, and you want to really learn how to program Active Server Pages, and not just scratch the surface, get a book on VBScript (not JScript) with more depth and less breadth."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Microsoft Active Server Pages 3 (Teach Yourself (IDG))","review":"Anyone who has experience with HTML, XML, JScript, or VBScript, should avoid this book. The first half is introductions to the above languages with very little or no ASP. Most examples are suitable and others a poorly done and leave too much to the imagination.The slow pace seems to assume the authors expect the reader to have no programming or webpage development background at all, however some of the examples seem so vague in places it would be difficult for a beginner to piece it all together.I don't recommend this book to anyone who is learning ASP or any other mentioned language. While the book does baby step the reader towards more complicated work, I believe it doesn't cover the fundamentals it mentions fully. I suggest reading books on HTML, then CSS, and then ASP. With those three, anyone would be able to make a spiffy looking website with tons of features."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Microsoft Active Server Pages 3 (Teach Yourself (IDG))","review":"The book on a whole was very informative. I learned quite a bit about ASP from reading it. The authors spend a lot of time towards the beginning of the book on XML and I'm not really sure what the connection between the two are. It almost seems like they should've written a separate book on XML rather than including it with this one. Also, I found quite a few typos throughout the book in the text and some of the code examples. Luckily I'm familiar enough with html that I was able to catch them, but for a beginner the errors could be really confusing."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Microsoft Active Server Pages 3 (Teach Yourself (IDG))","review":"The books was very helpful in my programming.

She spends every night helping her listeners find or strengthen their own true loves. Just as she is about to find her own happy-ever-after, life intervenes with the cancellation of her wedding.

Williamson's Annotated Key to Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew, which is what it says it is! It is available on Amazon."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"Lambdin's book is not bad - it is more pedagogical and suitable for self-study than most of the old traditional hebrew texts such as Weingreen and Davidson. However for someone using the book for self-study purposes and not taking a Hebrew course concurrently it may be difficult to jump start your language study with Lambdin: the introductory chapter on sounds and spelling is not well written and may have the effect of discouraging the student from further reading. But beyond that the book is fairly easy to digest.My only other concern is with the paperback edition. The print of the Hebrew letters and points is small. Have a look at a copy before you order. This may not seem significant as you read this review but once you start studying from it you may have regrets."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"Of the grammar books I have used in learning classical Hebrew, this was the most useful. The text is clear and complicated grammar is introduced both logically ad usefully. Adapted biblical passages are used as reading material after each chapter for most of the book. Don't worry about the reviewer's insistence that poetical language isn't covered - except for archaic poetry, the grammar is the same. One proviso, tho' - I didn't give the book 5 stars because it has no key. The University of Sheffield in the UK publish a key, H.G.M. Williamson's &quot;Annotated Key to Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew&quot;, ISBN 1 85075 065 3 (about $25). Together, they beat anything else."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This was the text specified by my Intro. to Biblical Hebrew professor 2 years ago . I thought it was an excellent book. Our prof. discouraged us from using Lambdin's transliterations as a crutch--we began by memorizing the Hebrew alphabet. Each chapter is organized around a theme (or two), and gives you a manageable amount of vocabulary and paradigms to memorize. Two semesters were not quite enough time to finish the whole book, but we came close. The chapters have plenty of exercises and simplified Biblical passages to translate, plus our prof. supplemented these with translation exercises from the actual Hebrew Bible. It also has English-to-Hebrew excercises, which really have little value for reading the Hebrew Bible. With any foreign language book, typographical errors can be a real nuisance. I am happy to report that typos in this book are few to non-existent. I am not as happy about the recent price increase, but perhaps this is indicative of how well-accepted this book has become at universities where Hebrew is taught. Are there better books for self-study? Perhaps--I can speak only for this one. But Lambdin is very straightforward and if you work hard at the memorization part, this book will put you well on your way to reading the Hebrew Bible."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"'An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew' uses complex terminology and the explanations are very detailed and techincal. It thus serves as a good reference volume of basic Biblical Hebrew grammar for someone who becomes deeply involved with the language, but it doesn't serve as a useful introduction. That doesn't mean it's a bad book, it just means that it really doesn't conform to its own title.Some reviewers have commented that the transliterated text is a hindrance, but I would disagree. I found the transliteration useful for understanding what kind of phonetic changes occur in certain phonetic environments. But I should note that I already knew the Hebrew script thoroughly before I had ever looked at this textbook. The transliteration is useful if you don't rely on it to read, and simply use it for word analysis.The book follows an deductive method of starting with basic grammar and gradually moving into more complex structures, building a solid grammar base that helped me gain a deeper understanding of the Hebrew language in all of its historical incarnations. Basically, if you love Hebrew as I do and want to read the Mishna and Ha'aretz newspaper as much as the Bible, then you would benefit from the comprehensive and detailed nature of this text. If, however, you just want to get on with reading the Bible, then an inductive grammar such as 'Biblical Hebrew' by Kittel, Hoffer, and Wright would be a better choice. It was through the userfriendly and always relevant Kittle text that I gained an excitement for reading Biblical Hebrew that I never would have gotten had I started with the Lambdin text."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is the best textbook for introduction to Biblical Hebrew (BH). I own half a dozen other BH textbooks and have reviewed at least as many other books all intended for the introductory BH course. An Lambdin's book is by far my favorite.The book's content, structure of lessons, coverage of syntax and grammar are great. This is structured around a first year college course for BH, with introduction, 55 lessons and a few appendices. Each lesson is well structured covering grammatical principles and rules, vocabulary and exercises (and later on also with reading passages). I especially like its thorough coverage, discussion and examples of the syntactical rules such as narrative sequences, clauses, conditional sentences and idioms. These are covered in more depth than just about any other textbook.TEXTBOOK vs. REFERENCE GRAMMARI've said is elsewhere, but I feel the need to bring this point up after reading some other reviews. This work is a textbook, not a reference grammar. These are two different types of works serving different purposes. Textbook are structured around lessons and are intended to teach basics aspects of BH, such as grammar, vocabulary and syntax. They typically have a reference section at the back, but that is not intended to be an exhaustive reference. Reference grammars are intended for this purpose -- they, on the other hand are not intended to be used as textbook and aren't structured in a lesson format. All too often people confuse the two and are upset when a book does not meet their expectations. So for the records, this book is an introductory textbook.COMPARING WITH OTHER TEXTBOOKSA couple of notes on how this compares with other textbooks. The introduction may be a bit confusing as it is trying to explain Biblical Hebrew (BH) without using Hebrew characters -- it uses only linguistic transliterations without ever making the mapping between them and Hebrew characters, whether consonants or vowels. For someone who's using the book in a classroom setting it's probably okay as one has a chance to discuss it with a teacher. But I would think it would be a challenge for someone using the book for self study. In either case, you can do a bit of research and do the mapping yourself by checking out another book. Although there some folks who really like linguistics and are comfortable with transliterations, so if you're one of them you'll especially love this book.Unlike Seow's textbook all examples are made up, not taken from an actual text. With that said, they are structured in such a way as to illustrate the example using the vocabulary learned so far. I don't feel that this is a problem, but am just adding this for the pundit.The verbs (one of the most challenging things about BH) are introduced in a pretty natural manner, starting with active participles in lesson 4 and moving on to the perfect in lesson 9. Lambdin spends the next 6 lessons dealing with variations of the QAL perfect. The imperfect is introduces in lesson 22, followed by lessons on the imperative, jussive, cohortative, infinitives, etc. with all their variations such as gutturals, I-Yodh, etc. Other stems, namely Niphal is not introduced until lesson 37, or technically the second semester. This is different than how Ross for example, introduces verbs. Ross introduces all basic verbs, QAL, Niphal, Piel, etc. for the regular verb and then deals with all the variations later. There really isn't a right or wrong approach, there will be people preferring either approach. Again, I'm adding this for completeness.The vocabulary words do not include frequency of occurrence in the BH text as some other textbooks do. For me, this is not an issue. In fact I believe that including frequencies is a distraction and can often work to the student's detriment leading him or her to focus on the words with highest frequencies. As I said in another review, knowing the most frequently occurring words does not translate into being able to read the text. Just about every verse in the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) will include words that you won't find anywhere near the top of the frequency list. So to me, including frequencies in an introductory textbook is a distraction. There are other tools that cover frequencies, if you're interested go to my profile and see my Guide to Biblical Hebrew for more info.The summaries and verb tables at the back of the book, the appendices are not structured and presented in the best way. Just about any other BH textbook (Seow, Weingreen, LaSor, Ross, Van Pelt/Pratico,...) does a much better job at that. However, you can pick up any of the books I just listed and photocopy tables for your reference.SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONWhile the introduction would be much clearer with Hebrew vowels spelled out and few of the appendices could have been presented in a better way, the book as a whole is a great resource. In fact I did take one star off because of these two items, but that should not dissuade anyone from checking this book out. As I state in the previous paragraphs, these items can be supplemented either with the help of a teacher in a classroom setting or with a bit of research for the self-student. But the lessons and their content and structure easily make up for these shortcomings and I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Alternatively, you will find other books that have pretty charts and tables, but are hard to follow."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is a good grammar and vocabulary and the passages chosen are a good start on the Scriptures. The weak point is that for those struggling with the Hebrew letters, it is NOT helpful to put the English transliteration in between the Hebrew words and the English translation: A future reprint of this book should set the type so that it is possible to cover up all the English tranliterations with a single piece of paper and practice the page. Also, a future printing should consider using the interlinear format for example translations: that way more advanced exercises can be demonstrated using the interlinears than the students could read on their own."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"Together with Kittel and Hoffer's Biblical Hebrew, Lambdin's grammar has helped me the most in learning Biblical Hebrew. In a way, Lambdin's book, though written in the conventional deductive method, seems to surpass Kittel's in having more depth to its treatment of the language without sacrificing clarity.I'm only midway through the book but among the features I like most are: the lessons are concise, the transliterations aid in pronunciation, the exercises are plentiful and aid retention well(I used to think made-up sentences and English to Hebrew exercises are only bothersome academic exercises,but not after this book), idiomatic constructions are given when needed (I have now come to understand nuances of verb plus preposition constructions, among other things), and syntactical considerations are given early.The only drawback is the price. I also wish the font sizes for the Hebrew texts were bigger for easier reading. I have the hardcover version and I can imagine how much smaller the fonts would be in the paperback version given its physical dimensions, as was complained by one reviewer here.I also have Kelley's grammar and the new book by Russell Fuller. Both are good and Kelley's is cheap, but save your money for this.Kittel's is a good first book, but go ahead and read Lambdin's grammar as a next step. It goes beyond Kittel yet remains accessible and compulsively readable to a self-learner. That's coming from one who's learning Hebrew on his own as a hobby. I don't have Williamson's Annotated Key yet though I am almost sure it will be an additional aid. But the Annotated Key seems overpriced."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"The best Hebrew grammar book for new learners is Andrew Bartelt's Fundamental Biblical Hebrew. Lambdin's book is definitely not it. In fact, I rate Weingreen's Classical Hebrew Grammar and Page Kelley's Classical Hebrew way over Lambdin's. Lambdin's text is confusing and frustrating. I say that as someone who started off by teaching myself Hebrew -- Weingreen was excellent, and Kelley supplemented where Weingreen fell short. I do have the Lambdin text, but gave it up in frustration. The one text that organizes and clarifies in a way that neither Lambdin, Weingreen, nor Kelley does, is Bartelt's. That's the text for the Hebrew neophyte, either with a teacher or a self-starter."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This book was one of the required grammar books for two semesters of my undergraduate degree. The book is very academic, not one of those watered-down grammars for bible study groups. This book was the required text at Harvard for many years; It may still be though I am not sure. The learning approach is old-school: read, memorize, and translate. I like that. There is no CD or DVD, no internet website with an online workbook. I really thought the information was direct, and in plenty.With that said, I will say that the layout, or formating is sub-par (a golf term which should mean that it is great). The tables are unattractive and a bit hard on the eyes. The index needs to be revamped as well. Were this book to be updated for aesthetic appeal, I would have given it 5 stars. Notwithstanding, you would do well to buy this book, and put in the hours it takes to learn Hebrew."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is a detailed Biblical Hebrew grammar for the serious student. I am teaching myself Biblical Hebrew on the side and am finding it tough going in places. What would help me is a top down framework for the book. In a university, this needed structure is possibly provided by the professor. The book feels like a detailed listing of all rules and exceptions. Perhaps that is exactly what a grammar is; but, it can be a challenging way for some of us to learn a language. Nevertheless, other than Gesenius' older work, this seems to be the grammar to use.As for the physical softcover book, it is outstanding. It is printed on high quality, bright paper with a folio binding. The printing accurately captures the Hebrew pointing which is the downfall of some books. For those of you who are on a budget, this UK edition is far less expensive than the US edition(s). While it is softcover, it feels like it will bear up to many years of heavy use.For comparison, I am a layperson who has familiarity with Modern Israeli Hebrew and several years of linguistics study."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},W={key:1};function O(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(e(!0),t(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),f(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const E=d(x,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-50fe8d19"]]),M=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/63.md","filePath":"quotesmag/63.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/63.md"},z=Object.assign(B,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{M as __pageData,z as default};
