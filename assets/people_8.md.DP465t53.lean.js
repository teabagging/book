The novel is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who tries to come to terms with the realities of the Third World."},{"Title":"Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English","review":"The skill with which Ken paints his characters, using very few words, and fewer adjectives is unsurpassed"},{"Title":"Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English","review":"Ever since I took Charles Larson's class, The African Writer, I have been completely intrigued by Ken Saro-Wiwa. I presented multiple projects depicting the horrendous execution of this activist/author as the most severe example of the precarious situation in which African writers are forced to live and work. However, only recently did I realize that I never actually read a work by this influential author. For this reason, I sought out Sozaboy: A novel in rotten English. To put it simply, I was blown away by the creative innovation, timelessness, and critical content of the novel. Ken Saro-Wiwa is a man that should be studied for not only the significance of his death, but the accomplishments of his life.The plot follows a young man named Mene, who is eventually only known as Sozaboy, living in a small, rural village in Nigeria while tensions begin to build and suggest an upcoming war. The seemingly petty events of Mene's life, like his obsession with Agnes, the beautiful Lagos girl, eventually transform to create a heart-wrenching war novel. While growing up in his village of Dukana, Mene becomes an apprentice driver when his mom decides this to be the most lucrative career path for him, since she can no longer pay his school fees. His limited education is reflected in the mixture of pidgin English, corrupted English and \\"occasional flashes of good, even idiomatic English\\" that is used to narrate the novel, which Saro-Wiwa dubbed \\"rotten English\\" (iii). Although the narration can be, at times, difficult to follow, it is generally easy enough to figure out with the help of context clues and the glossary in the back of the book. Nonetheless, Saro-Wiwa succeeds in narrating an unbelievably eloquent novel, while criticizing the many facets of war. The language is absolutely innovative and allows for a very raw understanding of the events taking place. Above all else, simply reading the novel had a very artful air to it.It is never specified when this war is taking place during Nigerian history, but many speculate it to surround the events of the Biafran War. There are various clues scattered throughout the novel that suggest this possibility, such as the difficulty of determining who is the Enemy, the vast exile to refugee camps, and the intense famine from which the majority of the population suffered. I spent the majority of my time while reading this book attempting to figure out what war Saro-Wiwa was discussing. However, upon finishing the book, I realized that this is only a minor detail that is of really no great importance to the general purpose of the novel, which is to condemn war. Despite the fact that it is a very Nigerian novel at heart, with its use of \\"rotten English,\\" it clearly appeals to the universality of war, making the time period in Nigerian history an irrelevant discussion point. This extroverted novel is situated ambiguously so that all readers can understand war in the context that Saro-Wiwa frames.Specifically, Mene's transformation from Mene to Sozaboy does not demonstrate his identity; instead it indicates his absolute lack of understanding regarding what it means to be a soldier and to be in war. Various instances throughout the novel, Sozaboy attempts to understand \\"Why are we fighting?\\" and the phrase \\"war is war\\" (90). He is never able to determine who is the real Enemy, when he has seen both sides of the war commit such great atrocities. Saro-Wiwa succeeds in his war criticism by portraying this arbitrary nature by which death and suffering is brought about during war and how war as a whole can never be truly justified because there is no such thing as a \\"good side.\\"Sozaboy decides to become a soldier because of the taunting from the World War II veteran in his village and his love interest's desire to be with a man that can protect her. He wishes to impress all the residents of Dukana by returning with his uniform, gun, and some medals, but the truth of war taught him, \\"now if anybody say anything about war or even fight, I will just run and run and run and run and run\\" (181). The innovative language and strong social/political commentary within Sozaboy makes it a masterpiece of our time."},{"Title":"Convenient Bridegroom (Society Weddings) (Harlequin Presents)","review":"This book had promise hence the 1 Star. There really isn't anything to dislike about the book but neither is there anything to like.Let's start with the lack of any real conflict. There's a couple that is supposedly getting married for convenience. They're on equal footing socially, financially, and physically so one begs to ask the question, why go through with the wedding when neither really have to- why not wait for love?Well, the author makes us believe that the h is \\"secretly\\" in love with the H but then, what are his motives?Apparently their parents are great friends and the marriage would join two forces. Yet, there's absolutely no pressure from either party or any inclination that both the h and H are not free to find true love- in fact the H was windowed by a true love- supposedly.No real conflict and I say no real conflict because there is indeed a lady in the background- completely harmless- who provides some false evidence which was easily enough to disapprove and some false accusations of infidelity that she whispers in the h's ears. Nothing, I think, that would cause so much distress that would cause her to love/hate the H and be completely indecisive and sad throughout the book thereby creating \\"conflict\\" in the relationship. I mean, she supposedly knows its not a love match, he promises her his fidelity, she's never had reason not to trust him and they supposedly have an amazing sex life. What is her problem?Because there was no real reason for them to be mad at each other, and because they were both semi-likable- they were lots of repetitive, unnecessary actions throughout the book as typical with a HB book. She went to the shower, she showered, she wen to the closet, she chose a black dress... (paraphrasing)Also, I found that he correctly read the myriad of facial expressions that he correctly interpreted- one being love- but he never really did anything about it. 90% of the book basically went through their daily lives with her being upset at him for some stupid- very stupid- reason that wouldn't fly in the real world. Yes, I know this is fiction but there must be something I can relate to in order to get lost in the fairytale.While it is possible to complete the book- I found myself waiting for something to happen- waiting for the book to become exciting- it didn't."},{"Title":"Convenient Bridegroom (Society Weddings) (Harlequin Presents)","review":"A Convenient Bridegroom by Helen BianchinHarlequin Presents # 2067 - December 1999Society Weddings seriesThe company formed by two Italian immigrant families, Benini-Santangelo was a major name in the Sydney building industry. It was only fitting that a marriage between Giuseppe Benini's daughter, Aysha to Luigi Santagelo's son, Carlo should take place. Aysha wasn't kidding herself, she knew her upcoming wedding to Carlo would mark a marriage of convenience. Though she's loved Carlo all of her life, when he married Bianca, he'd broken her heart. Bianca had been the love of his life, and Aysha knew that with her death, died Carlo's ability to love another. But their relationship was one formed on friendship, respect, affection and sexual chemistry. Surely things would be okay, or so Aysha thought until the witch Nina started to sow seeds that she was Carlo's mistress and would always be.This is not like any Presents I've read. I think many readers would find it too tame, in that the intense confrontations usually in the line are down played to show how hard Aysha is trying to hide her true feelings for Carlo. Only to Carlo, Aysha is transparent, and he easily sees how deeply she is hurt by the lies told by Nina. Carlo is a strong character who shows little emotion, but we get glimpses of his caring throughout the book, and of course his deep love at the HEA.

I discovered it after having purchased the newer 1999 \\"Insider's French: Beyond the Dictionary\\" by the same couple. Written primarily in dictionary format with the alphabetization on the French which may render it difficult for those searching for an English equivalent without some previous knowledge of usage, this slim volume published in 1980 provides an arbitrary compendium of words and phrases that if studied and utilized can help those with an already firm footing in French grammar and vocabulary to advance with greater ease in understanding and communicating the genuine spoken language.Some slang, clich&eacute;s and idioms are included, but this is primarily a book about everyday usage that will enrich your command of the language in general. For example, the entry for \\"arriver\\" provides the literal sense, \\"to arrive\\" or \\"to come\\" but also includes the idea of \\"to happen\\" as in \\"il m'est arrive un drle de truc en allant au bureau\\", meaning \\"A funny thing happened to me on the way to the office.\\" While \\"Je n'arrange pas &agrave; fermer les volets\\" translates as \\"I cannot manage to get the shutters closed\\", \\"Qu'est-ce qui vous arrive?\\" signifies \\"What's happened?' or \\"What's the matter?\\" In addition, when someone rings your doorbell, you might say in English, \\"I'm coming.\\" The French, however, do not say \\"je viens,\\" but, \\"j'arrive.\\" Additional words derived from the initially defined word are included. Here, 'arriviste' connotes an ambitious person unconcerned about his/her unscrupulous determination to climb the social ladder. \\"L'arrivisme\\" defines the science surrounding this lifestyle perspective. \\"Arriv&eacute;e\\" at a railroad or airport means \\"arrivals,\\" while \\"un arrivage\\" is \\"a delivery of vegetables, fruit or fish.\\" The expressions used in sentences provide greater hands-on comprehension.Admirably, anything considerably vulgar is so labeled ensuring that no undesirable language will be utilized by those who have no experience in this realm and wish to avoid the social crippling faux pas.Separate word and phrase lists ranging from\\" Banking\\", \\"False Friends\\", \\"Courtesy,\\" \\"Franglais,\\" \\"Genders,\\" \\"Telling the Time,\\" \\"Numbers,\\" \\"Informal French,\\" \\"Housing,\\" \\"Household,\\" \\"Post Office,\\" \\"Entertainment,\\" \\"Telephone,\\" to \\"Cars\\" provide a more intense look at particular everyday situations. The authors provide a cross-reference in English which points to a corresponding word in French but alas, does not include dictionary page numbers.Bottom line: This is perhaps the only colloquial text necessary to further expand your already vocabulary and grammar rich knowledge of the French language.

Women in the workplace have long been told that we can't compete effectively because of the games (meaning tea parties instead of competitive sports) we played as girls. But, guess what? Sally Helgesen shows that the world based on hierarchies is spinning out of control...and the games we girls played (which hinged on relationships)turn out to be exactly the right games, giving women the unusual strength our world needs to evolve in a powerful new direction.The rules have changed and women already know them. Not only does this book boost all women's self-esteem, but it also charges us to realize our responsibility to the world in which we live: &quot;...feminine principles are entering the public realm because we can no longer afford to restrict them to the domestic sphere, nor allow a public culture obsessed with Warrior values to control human destiny if we are to survive.&quot; [p.255]How true."},{"Title":"The Female Advantage: Women's Ways of Leadership","review":"You may have read this book in 1990, when it first came out, as I did. It's worth another look now, if only for chapter 9 - Reconciling the Efficient and the Humane. In the 90's, some of us speculated that the future of leadership would come from the skills women have posessed for generations. As we look for ways to integrate the human element back into the workplace, as we read books on Emotional Intelligence and Resonant Leadership, it's time to acknowledge Helgesen's foresight. What did she tell us we needed back then? She started with an ambience that represented a different set of values. Next, listening, followed by collaborative negotiation. She foresaw what she terms the end of the warrior age.Helgesen's interviews are as interesting today - and as fresh - as they were when the book was first published. We may have heard this message a few times by now, but I don't think it will ever get old."},{"Title":"The Female Advantage: Women's Ways of Leadership","review":"Too often, as women, we abandon, dismiss, or deny our feminine wisdom. We distract ourselves and lose sight of our own innate wise feminine approaches to leadership. It's put on the back shelf as we compete, produce, and succeed from our dynamic masculine assets. Then we are less effective, depleted and confused. We begin to doubt ourselves. Yet some part of us knows, and longs to intensify the sustaining flow and effectiveness of our innate feminine nature.Sally Helgesen takes apart the self limiting beliefs that constrained women from the natural power of their leadership and, even more importantly, shows that women leaders, who lead from their feminine approaches make smarter decisions and build better businesses. They experience a greater sense of personal power so that they are spending their time on what matters the most to them. When we connect our wisdom, our leadership, and our feminine approaches we are the kind of leader the world needs today.The world has change and organizations who want to continue their success need to change. Women in leadership bring a different approach to being a leader. Wise feminine leadership is an underutilized and critically needed resource for today's growing company. As Sally says on p. 225, \\"The ability to model and persuade is of particular importance in an organization where authority is not imposed from the top down in hierarchical fashion. In a web structure, where talent is nurtured and encouraged rather than commanded, and a variety of interconnections exist, influence and persuasion take the place of giving orders...Compassion, empathy, inspiration, and direction - all aspects of nurturance - are connective values....\\"Will we lose the competitive advantage as we amplify our feminine approaches? Sally Helgesen makes a solid case - the answer is No."},{"Title":"The Female Advantage: Women's Ways of Leadership","review":"Helgesen cautions us in 1990 that \\"Feminine values are entering the public realm because we can no longer afford to restrict them to the private domestic sphere, nor allow a public culture obsessed with Warrior values to control human destiny if we are to survive.\\" Indeed, nearly two decades later Warrior values have brought the world to greater peril than ever before in our history. She prescribed not the end of Warrior values but rather the blending of them with feminine values for healing the conditions Warrior values have fostered, in other words, balance. For the primary values, the metavalues of humankind are shared by mature leaders of both sexes. They are what they have always been, Truth, Beauty and Goodness. How can this work? When male warrior values tends toward arrogance, Truth reminds him of his limitations.

Because what really takes to succeed lies in our in our thinking and our basic behavior al differences from men.

These diverse group of women are put under the microscope in her book in order to not just define what a female leader is but also the advantages of being a female leader.Helgesen points out that women have distinguishing qualities that she calls \`feminine principles' that allow them to be better managers and responsible leaders. These feminine principles reflect our culture's basic presumption about differences between how men and women act and establishment of these principles in the public sector results would result in a more enriched life. She challenges the hierarchial structure of the corporate world by presenting female perspective by offering a web construct where direct communication and free flowing of ideas are encouraged and relationships are valued.Her writing is loosely structured filled with inquisitive remarks.

Robinson, Ph.D., has revised and updated his 1980 classic, Biblical Preaching (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic). The 2001 version, still subtitled, The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages, takes into account a changed culture and audience which now thinks \\"with pictures in their heads\\" (10). In his preface to the second edition, Professor Robinson admits he sees \\"some matters more clearly now than I did two decades ago\\" (10) (who does not?). Therefore, even though his thesis remains the same--\\"sermons must deal with ideas or they deal with nothing\\" (10)--Robinson's second edition is a conscious effort to improve on the clarity of his writing and the gender- sensitivity of his pronouns. The result is a methodical, highly readable homily on the art and--dare I say it--science of the development and delivery of the conscience-stirring, biblically-based, expository sermon.In ten chapters and two appendices Professor Robinson takes his readers on a guided tour of the well-done expository sermon. He begins by expounding on the premise behind preaching, then takes us step-by-step from a message's genesis in the Bible through its various developmental stages, ending with the preacher's delivery of the carefully crafted homily in the pulpit. The final two chapters of Biblical Preaching discuss the elements of style and delivery absolutely essential to achieving the biblical expositor's ultimate goal--the edification of his audience. For a work designed to serve as a how-to manual on an important aspect of a professional discipline, the language is surprisingly crisp and accessible, free of the eye-glazing, esoteric jargon usually cluttering textbooks, evincing an avuncular warmth reminiscent of a savvy old pro's soft-spoken advice to a struggling rookie.No one's preaching will be hurt by reading this brother's outstanding book."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"Should hermeneutics and exposition deal strictly with our study patterns, or should it pervade our teaching and preaching as well? Examples of good study habits derailed by poor methods of conveyance to the masses litter the history of theology. Correctly conveying the messages in Scripture is tantamount for any servant of God. This not only pertains to preachers, but to every Christian as we are all teachers in some form or fashion. Biblical Preaching takes the process of hermeneutics through Scriptural exegesis to successful conveyance of God's Word in the pulpit or classroom environment.Dr. Haddon W. Robinson's background is an illustrious list of evangelical authorship, teaching and leadership.Dr. Haddon first appeals to the passionate side of pastors by convincing them of the dire need for expository preaching. Then he lays out a 10 step plan for creating a flexible and applicable Biblically based sermon. In the last 2 chapters, he gives tips on increasing credibility and attention while speaking.Biblical Preaching is a blessing for all to enjoy and has a wealth of information regarding the key to conveying God's Word- expositional preaching.

He presents a ten-step process of sermon preparation in his typically precise style. No word is wasted. In many respects numerous other books on preaching are building on this one, trying to offer some clarification or slight adjustment. That is certainly not true of all, but of many.The emphasis throughout is on preaching a thoroughly Biblical message, through effective communication, in a way that is entirely relevant to the specific contemporary audience. The \\"Big Idea\\" is central to the philosophy and the procedure of preaching. So the ten steps move from understanding the text to the point of an accurate and clearly defined exegetical idea, through the process of developing the homiletical idea with clear purpose, to the practical matters of sermon shape and effective content. Although there are other books that deal in detail with issues of delivery, Robinson's brief section on delivery is helpfully succinct.I think it is fair to say that anyone interested in the subject of preaching should have this book. Robinson's combination of Biblical commitment, expertise in communication theory, and renown as a teacher of preaching, effectively blend to make this a very effective book. The book does not deal with everything as fully as one might like, for example it would be nice to have more examples and demonstration of Biblical exegesis.

Even at the time of it's original publication, Robinson recognized a trend moving away from the importance of the sermon in the life of the church. Despite this trend, he states that, \\"no one who takes the Bible seriously should count preaching out\\" (19).In light of this conviction, Robinson begins by presenting a case for expository preaching, defining this as:\\"the communication of a biblical concept, derived from and transmitted through a historical, grammatical, and literary study of a passage in its context, which the Holy Spirit first applies to the personality and experience of the preacher, then through the preacher, applies to the hearers\\" (21).Within the first few chapters, the reader quickly dicerns that Robinson is significantly less interested in the actual words of the text, but is rather infatuated instead with concepts and ideas. He infers as much early in the first chapter, writing, \\"Some conservative preachers have been led astray by their doctrine of inspiration,\\" which results in an overemphasis in the words, which, \\"are stupid things until linked with other words to convey meaning\\" (23). Robinson prefers sermons that convey a Biblical idea or concept derived from the text of Scripture, rather than sermons that teach the text itself. (This objection will be further developed in the following section.)His entire approach to the preparation and delivery of a sermon is built upon the notion of a central idea or concept. Once the preacher secures a text to preach from, they are to discover the central concept of the text through study. Robinson teaches the major components of the text in terms of subject-complement. A subject is, \\"the complete, definite answer to the question, \`What am I talking about?'\\" (41). The complement, \\"completes the subject by answering the question, \`What am I saying about what I am talking about?'\\" (41). This construction presents a complete idea, and each supporting point provides a sub-point for the preacher's outline.With an outline in place, Robinson recommends that preachers either prepare a thorough manuscript for each sermon, or in the least write out the introduction, conclusion, and transitions between major sermon points. Robinson is emphatic, however, that preachers should not read these manuscripts. The purpose of manuscripting is to force the preacher to think through these pivotal moments in the sermon, searching for the ideal turn of phrase, rather than preaching disjointedly from an outline (185-186).CritiqueAs noted at the onset, Robinson's application of the doctrine of inspiration leaves much to be desired by those who value the words of Scripture. Robinson, himself, appears to waffle throughout the book, attesting to the authority of the Scriptures, then denying the importance of the very words breathed-out by the Holy Spirit. He goes so far as to state, \\"While an orthodox doctrine of inspiration may be a necessary plank in the evangelical platform on biblical authority, this sometimes gets in the way of expository preaching\\" (23). One can only pray that the casual manner in which Robinson treats the Scripture in his approach to preaching should be avoided by his students and readers.Another point of concern arose in the preface to the second addition, where he writes, \\"I've also changed my language to reflect my theology. God doesn't distribute his gifts by gender\\" (10). While his statement is true enough on the surface, the context in which he makes it can only mean that he has abandoned the conservative, Biblical teaching that preaching is the responsibility of qualified men as taught in 1 Timothy 2-3. However, this actually follows his earlier reasoning, for he clearly believes preachers should be qualified, but abandons the words of the text in search for the specific qualifications themselves.Finally, one must note the audience that Robinson envisions for his students as they preach. For Robinson's purposes, they are dull, uneducated, and disinterested in God's Words or actions on behalf of fallen humanity. Therefore, the preacher must avoid using examples from Scripture to illustrate a biblical concept for fear that it they would not be understood by the congregation (155), and to always preach in such a way as to \\"secure some moral action,\\" (107) rather than declare to them what God has done on their behalf. The reader is left to ponder how different this book may have been written were Robinson to anticipate his students' congregations to actually be regenerate.Robinson's book on expository preaching, titled, Biblical Preaching, fails to deliver on either point. Upon further examination, it teaches preaching that is neither biblical, nor expository."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"I was supposed to get the book for a preaching class held by my church because as the youth pastor, I am expected to preach in front of the church.

The introduction of the Big Idea and the necessary steps in sermon preparation are fundamental in the life of anyone serious about exegeting the biblical text in a effective manner. While reading the portion on \\"The Road from Text to Sermon,\\" I am reminded of a number of necessary steps required in constructing a careful, yet compelling message. Robinson's counsel to be prepared to anticipate the questions of the audience is often overlooked in the development of a sermon and yet this step establishes credibility between the speaker and audience. The argument is often made that the pastor doesn't understand how people live in the \\"real\\" world. Unfortunately, this perception is often validated in the careless presentation of material devoid of the day-to-day challenges of people in their attempt to apply these truths. The pastor must wrestle with the issues of the day and recognize the complexity of those who live in the concrete jungles of society, or the backwoods of civilization with varying cultures. The pastor must identify with the body to which he serves.As part of this process, Robinson encourages the speaker to ask developmental questions of the text which helps develop a sound context in which to speak. At the same time, it is important to ask questions on behalf of the audience that might be anticipated in response to their particular concerns, and considerations. The ultimate goal of all of this is to relate the biblical truths, often seen in the far-away, and long-ago, to life in the here-and-now.I think that the impact of this writing is one that seeks to assist the speaker in building significant structure and purpose into the sermon in a meaningful and constructive manner with confidence that the end-result will be one of help to the listener.Overall, this is a preachers handbook to be used often and methodically for those aspiring life-long learners who recognize that the task of preaching is worthy of our best."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"Our pastor taught from this book.

Robinson himself is very gifted with words and his own sermons are very engaging. His advice is useful to anyone, but it seems to me that the style of preaching which he advocates ultimately depends for its success on the preacher having very high literacy, comprehension and communication skills.As someone who has sat through many expository sermons in which the preacher has taken a Bible passage and made nothing of it, I am not sure about Robinson's advice that sermons should be expository. I agree that all sermons should be on a theme contained in the Bible, because any theme not contained in the Bible is not part of God's revelation. However, the preaching examples in the New Testament are not expository in the sense of flowing from a single Bible passage.I do agree with Robinson's advice that a sermon should be based on a single idea. If it is not possible to say what the idea communicated by a sermon is, then it is unlikely that the listeners will remember it. Although it makes some old-fashioned ecclesial assumptions, the book contains lots of handy hints for constructing sermons and making them memorable. Besides that, it is well written and affordable."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"There are many good preaching textbooks worth purchasing, but this one is the best because it is written in simple language with clear and easy steps to take.Robinson states that \\"Expository preaching is the communication of a biblical concept derived from and transmitted through a historical, grammatical, and literary study of a passage in its context, which the Holy Spirit first applies to the personality and experience of the preacher, then through the preacher, applies to the hearers (21).\\"But Robinson goes on to say that expository preaching at its core is more of a philosophy than a method. Whether or not a person may be called an expositor depends on how he or she would answer this question: \\"Do you, as a preacher, endeavor to bend your thought to the Scriptures, or do you use the Scriptures to support your thought?\\"20He says we must through study discover the central idea (the big idea) of the text. He counsels that in order to do this, we must select the text, study the text, and determine the exegetical idea of the text (p.51-70). He understands that there will be times (Easter, Christmas, special occasions) when we will need to present topical sermons, but more often than not, the text does not say what we wish it to say, and we have to make sure that the thought of the Scripture shapes the way we present the topic.He then talks about submitting the exegetical idea of the passage to three developmental questions: What does this mean?\\" \\"Is it true,\\" and What difference does it make?\\" 79-96. \\"Is it true\\" seems rather rhetorical. After all, evangelical Christian believers will certainly say \\"Yes, this is true.\\" Don Sunukjian rephrases the three developmental questions this way: \\"Do we buy it?\\" p. 87. Romans 8:28 says \\"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him?\\" A person could be thinking \\"My son is dying from leukemia. I have a hard time buying the idea that God might be using this for good. What good could come from my little boy's suffering?\\"After running the central idea of the text through the three developmental questions, Robinson urges the rewriting of the exegetical big idea in a memorable timeless way. Then the minister must determine the purpose of the sermon, or what he or she would like the parishioners to do as a result of hearing this sermon.Then the minister must decide how this idea should be handled to accomplish the sermon's purpose. Perhaps there is an idea to be explained, or a proposition to be proved, a principle to be applied, or a subject to be completed, or a story to be told. 107-125. Having decided how the central idea of the sermon should be expounded, then the outline can be written.Then expositors can fill in the outline with anecdotes, quotations, illustrations. After this, the introduction and conclusion may be formed, followed by the manuscripting of the outline.There is a helpful conclusion about style. He discusses vocal clarity and gestures and preaching without notes. This is a great book and if I could only have one book on how to preach, this is the one I would choose. Donald Sunukjian and Bryan Chappell and Ramesh Richard have great textbooks, too, and they have areas in their books where they refine and sharpen some of the things that Robinson posits.

The first meal, a breakfast, I sat down at the only occupied table in the dining hall, and he happened to be one of those seated. I had never met the man, so I did not know who he was until later. But the entire meal, I was amazed by how warm, welcoming, and interesting he was.When I approached his book on preaching, I was excited to learn from a man for whom I'd already developed a great respect. Rather than learning from someone who has made a living of teaching others to speak, I was able to learn from someone who has made a living of knowing Christ and sharing Him with others.This book is thorough in its discussion of both sermon preparation and sermon delivery. Study methods and techniques are outlined, sermon styles are offered and critiqued, and numerous valuable suggestions fill the pages. Then, Dr. Robinson discusses the delivery of the sermon, what he notes as an oft-overlooked component. There, he covers the organization of thoughts, the speed and volume of speech, and even nonverbal communication.I recommend this book to anyone who teaches or preaches the Word of God.

Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages. Second Edition. Grand Rapids: Baker Academics, 2001.Summary of PurposeRobinson's first edition of Biblical Preaching (Baker, 1980) stands as one of the seminal volumes on the subject. This second edition revised and updated that earlier work. Robinson began by lamenting the paucity of true expository preaching and defined what constitutes authentic expository preaching. \\"Expository preaching is the communication of a biblical concept, derived from and transmitted through a historical, grammatical and literary study of a passage in its context which the Holy Spirit first applies to the personality and experience of the preacher, then through him to his hearers\\" (20). Most of the book is devoted to developing Robinson's ten-step approach toward expository sermon development. The final chapters address the mechanics of sermon delivery.Robinson declared that many so-called expository sermons are neither expository nor sermons. His thesis contends that authentic expository sermons must focus on presenting the \\"big idea\\" of a specific biblical passage. True expository sermons must draw their subjects from the main idea of the text itself. The preacher must state the big idea in terms of a subject and a complement. The main points of the sermon serve to develop and support that subject as limited by the complement. He insisted that preachers do not deliver sermons; they deliver messages from God as revealed in the Scriptures. The message must first be true to the text, accurately exegeted, interpreted in light of the modern culture, and delivered with passion and persuasiveness. The book is replete with examples, illustrations, and practical advise from a trusted sage.Analysis of StrengthsRobinson's writing style reflected his approach to preaching--lucid, vivid, and meaningful. He can express an ocean of thought in a drop of language. Novice readers will not be intimidated. Seasoned professionals will find the book a refreshing reminder of their sacred task.Robinson's thesis stands as the true strength of the book: the preacher must discover the meaning within a given text and present that message in clear contemporary language. He is right when he opined that many preachers are guilty of preaching three or four ideas in one message rather than one idea shaped and supported by the major points. \\"A sermon should be a bullet, not buckshot\\" (35). Robinson does a fine job of helping the reader think through how a subject is determined and framed. The practice exercises are priceless.Robinson possesses a high view of the task of preaching and of preachers. The preacher stands in the gap between heaven and earth seeking to convey eternal, life-changing truths. Robinson urged readers to be faithful to the text. Preachers deliver God's message, not their own. God is speaking through the Bible. He warned readers that when preachers fail to preach the Scriptures, they abandoned their authority.Robinson's ten stages in the development of expository messages provide readers with a systematized approach to sermon preparation. As one would expect, Robinson instructed readers to begin with the text. However, step six can prove exceptionally helpful to many: determine the sermon's purpose. Often the purpose of expository messages is ill defined. Preachers assume that the purpose of the sermon is to present and explain the text assuming the Holy Spirit would provide the individual application. Robinson cautioned that the preachers must answer the question, So what? If the preacher does not know what he or she hopes to accomplish with the message, neither will the listeners.Some readers will appreciate Robinson acknowledging that not every Scripture passage has homiletic value for a particular congregation (54). Those preachers who preach systematically through books of the Bible should not feel they have to preach a particular passage meant for another people or another day.Analysis of WeaknessesThree factors could make this good book even better. First, the book could use more explanation on how to do proper exegesis. Robinson urged readers to study commentaries, grammars, lexicons, and other aids. However, this reviewer would have liked a few pages of \\"show and tell.\\" Perhaps the lack of authentic expository sermons lies in the lack of competent exegetical skills. The text can never mean what it never could have meant. I would have gladly traded a few pages on dress and appearance for a more detailed analysis of quality exegesis. I would have appreciated more information on how to move from an exegetical outline, to a didactic outline, then to a homiletic outline.Second, Robinson insisted that preachers must artfully choose their words. He gave examples from poets, presidents, and other preachers. He insisted that a well-turned phrase creates vivid imagery the audience would appreciate. I do not doubt an audience would desire picturesque speech, but I would not want a listener to fixate on a skillful turn of a phrase and miss the point. When reading a book, a reader can pause, appreciate the beauty of the language, and then move on. In spoken communication, a distracted mind is a lost mind. Robinson provided several stirring examples of vivid word usage, however many of the examples were meant for printed publication, not just a single Sunday morning delivery. Words should never stand in the way of understanding--even good words.Third, Robinson updated his earlier work to reflect several cultural and technological changes that were unknown twenty-five years ago, such as women preachers and the widespread use of computers. However, he missed an opportunity to address the effect of postmodernism on how listeners understand truth. While it is inspiring that Robinson embraces a high view of Scripture, many church attendees are skeptical of authoritative truth claims. Robinson urged his readers to ask three developmental questions of the text, one of which is, \\"Is it true?\\" (80). The postmodern person cares less about truth and more about relevance. Such pragmatism presents a challenge for preachers who proclaim, \\"Thus saith the Lord.\\"Application and ImplicationsBiblical Preaching is an outstanding primer on the preaching task. It stands along side of Brown, Clinard, and Northcutt's classic Steps to the Sermon. There is little unusable material in Robinson's book. Biblical Preaching is a wonderful tool for the novice and seasoned preacher. Robinson's thesis continues to remain valid into the twenty-first century. The Bible is same book and contains the same message preached two thousand years. As such, it can turn this modern world upside down as well. It can also serve as a corrective to poor theology.For example, some leaders of the emerging church movement have devalued the role of preaching in worship. These Generation X preachers have forsaken sermons for narrative \\"talks.\\" The pulpit is replace by a stool. These preachers sheepishly proclaim that they struggle along the same path of understanding as do the listeners. These preachers do not want to appear superior. Propositional truth claims are eschewed. There is no clear word from the Lord.Reformation Christianity stands upon the declaration, sola scriptura. Spiritual transformation occurs when a person encounters God. People encounter God in and through the Scriptures. Expository preaching unwraps God's message preserved in the Bible, clears away the cultural clutter, introduces listeners to life-transforming truths, and provides a medium through which people can encounter the Divine.Robinson affirms the centrality of the spoken word to reveal the living Word. God has spoken and he continues to speak through the Scriptures. The Christian church has no other source for moral, ethical, or theological authority. Expository preaching, properly done, functions to bridge the gap between the temporal and the eternal. Robinson's book helps that purpose. Robinson's insistence on relevant application will help ensure that an expository message does not devolve into an academic lecture. The revised edition will ensure its continued use in seminaries and Bible colleges for years to come."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"I was required to read this book for a seminary class and thoroughly enjoyed the title!

Robinson gives good and effective pointers on how to formulate sermons, do exegesis, and to speak behind the pulpit (or capturing the congregation's attention). Another good aspect about the book is that it is written from an explicitly evangelical perspective.

It adds features which make it even more valuable--updated illustrations, expanded sections (especially helpful is the expanded chapter on narrative preaching), and suggested reading.Not only is the book better, the times are worse. Biblical preaching that relates truth to life is more needful now than ever. Far too many pulpits are overreacting or \\"mis-reacting\\" to post-modernism and Generation X.

Robinson declares that in the act of preaching God himself is speaking through the pastor. Thus, as preachers of the Word, we have a tremendous responsibility to be faithful to it. Robinson's thesis is that this faithfulness is best found in expository preaching. He states that expository preaching is more than a philosophy than a method. Does the preacher bend his or her own thought to the Word, or does the Word bend to the preacher's thought? Although Robinson believes that preaching is an art, he rightly states that there is a methodology behind the art that almost anyone can master. So, step-by-step, he leads us through the process of putting together the sermon.Robinson finds the strength of an expository sermon is that it proclaims the Word. If we do not preach the Word, we abandon authority. The Bible is great literature that demands a response; thus, we are to preach ideas, not word definitions. Robinson lifts us up above the Bible lecture sermon to preaching to demand a response to the living God. The final chapters on delivery, dress and appearance were great. Too many books on preaching ignore these important considerations.The book was such and eye-opener, I found it very difficult to find fault with it. I will take issue with his criticism of the use of a manuscript. It did not take into account that such great speakers as Bill Hybels uses a manuscript in the pulpit.Every preacher should own and read this book."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"I've written a dozen books and thousands of sermons.

So says Dr. Haddon Robinson as he offers this second edition of this classic volume known as Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages. Though first published in 1980, this work is still a staple in homiletics departments and pastors' studies across the world.Robinson received his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois and serves as the Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Prior to this position, he served as president and professor of homiletics at Denver Seminary after teaching homiletics at Dallas Theological Seminary for nineteen years.SummaryChapter One, entitled \\"The Case for Expository Preaching,\\" Robinson begins by saying, \\"This is a book about expository preaching, but it may have been written for a depressed market.\\" In this chapter, Robinson shows the lack of regard for expository preaching in evangelical circles, then outlines the church's need for this manner of preaching and exactly what expository preaching is. Chapter Two, entitled \\"What's the Big Idea?\\" displays the importance of an expositor to mine out one main concept or idea. He defines an idea as something which \\"enables us to see what was previously unclear\\" (39). He also notes that \\"an idea begins in the mind when things ordinarily separated come together to form unity that either did not exist before or was not recognized previously\\" (39).In Chapter Three, entitled \\"Tools of the Trade,\\" Robinson introduces three stages in preparing expository sermons: \\"choosing the passage to be preached\\" (53), studying the passage and gathering the notes (58), then proceeding to \\"relate the parts to each other to determine the exegetical idea and its development\\" (66). Chapter Four, entitled \\"The Road from Text to Sermon,\\" includes stage four which is \\"analyzing the exegetical idea\\" (75).In Chapter Five, entitled \\"The Arrow and the Target,\\" Robinson covers stages five and six in the development of expository preaching: \\"Formulating the Homiletical Idea\\" in which he encourages preachers to state their exegetical idea in \\"the most exact, memorable sentence possible\\" (103); and determining the purpose for the sermon. \\"A purpose differs from a sermon idea, therefore, in the same way that a target differs from the arrow; as taking a trip differs from studying a map; as baking a pie differs from reading a recipe\\" (107).In Chapter Six, entitled, \\"The Shapes Sermons Take,\\" Robinson helps the preacher decide how to accomplish the purpose of the sermon as well as outlining the sermon (stages seven and eight, respectively). Chapter Seven addresses filling in the sermon outline and, as Robinson states in his title, \\"making dry bones live\\" (139). Chapter Eight has the provocative title, \\"Start with a Band and Quit All Over,\\" which deals with the preparation of introductions and conclusions.Chapter Nine, entitled, \\"The Dress of Thought,\\" Robinson notes, \\"Gift or not, we must use words, and the only question is whether we will use them poorly or well\\" (184). He helps the preacher in areas such as transitions, clarity of thought, developing a personal style, and the use of metaphors. The last chapter, \\"How to Preach So People Will Listen,\\" deals with the delivery of the sermon itself. Robinson says that sermons \\"live only when they are preached. A sermon ineptly delivered arrives stillborn\\" (201).Critical AnalysisWith engaging writing and timely humor, Robinson seeks to communicate one prominent theme: \\"expository preaching is the communication of a biblical concept\\" (35). Even though one would be more persuaded by his thoughts had he served more in the preaching ministry of a local church (he served at Dallas Youth for Christ from 1952-55, then as Associate Pastor at the First Baptist Church of Medford, Oregon from 1956-19581), his principles of preparing and preaching expository sermons are tremendous and will serve the Church of Jesus Christ and his ministers very well indeed.One of the strengths of this work is its pastoral nature. Preachers are not called to be lecturers and are not simply called to preach the Word of God. Preachers are called to preach the Word of God to God's people. Robinson rightly observes that \\"we must preach to a world addressed by the TV commentator, the newspaper columnist, and the playwright\\" (29). In the Preface to the Second Edition, Robinson notes how the culture has changed since 1980 when this work was first published. \\"Television and the computer have influenced the ways we learn and think. Narrative preaching has come into vogue and reflects the reality that listeners in a television culture think with pictures in their heads\\" (10). While he may go too far in giving room for narrative preaching, he rightly assesses 21st century culture. This culture is the world in which the expositor preaches. So not only does Robinson note that \\"as shepherds, we relate to the hurts, cries, and fears of our flocks,\\" we must also understand the external issues to which our people are exposed every hour of every day.Along with this area of pastoral ministry in connection with preaching, Robinson also gives more room to the role and responsibility of the listener. He notes:Expositors may be respected for their exegetical abilities and their diligent preparation, but these qualities do not transform any of them into a Protestant pope who speaks ex cathedra. Listeners also have a responsibility to match the sermon to the biblical text. As Henry David Thoreau wrote, \\"It takes two to speak the truth -- one to speak, and another to hear.\\" ... If a congregation is to grow, it must share the struggle (24).Robinson notes that the average listener in the pew hopes you will answer this one question: \\"So what? What difference does it make\\" (86)? Before this question is in the congregants' hearts, this question must be answered in the study as he asks, \\"Exactly what is the biblical writer talking about (66)?\\" The shared struggle starts with the preacher in the study as he wrestles with God to find out his intended meaning.Another strength in this work is the engaging humor Robinson employs in this volume. While many would consider reading a book on expositional preaching boring (even some preachers may feel this way!), Robinson's use of humor helps hook the reader in order that the reader may approach this material with ease. This example, though mentioned earlier, stands as a great example of opening up the very first chapter with humor: \\"This is a book about preaching, but it may have been written for a depressed market\\" (17). In the preface to the first edition, he makes this observation:If I can claim any qualification, it is this: I am a good listener. During two decades in the classroom I have evaluated nearly six thousand student sermons. My friends marvel that after listening to hundreds of fledgling preachers stumble through their first sermons, I am not an atheist (14).In another example after he acknowledges his debt to all who have influenced his thinking on expositional preaching, he closes the paragraph by noting, \\"Since all of these and others influenced me deeply, it is only fair that for weaknesses in this volume they should shoulder a large share of the blame\\" (15)! This brand of humor disarms the critic and relaxes those who initially approach the topic of expository preaching with any misgivings or fears.One weakness is a quote located in the Preface to the Second Edition about his view of women ministers, a view which has changed since his first edition in 1980. He notes:I've also changed my language to reflect my theology. God doesn't distribute gifts by gender. Both women and men have the ability and the responsibility to communicate God's Word. I have always believed that, but the language in my first book reflected a distinct male bias. . . . In this revision I hope I have demonstrated the fruits of my repentance (10).Robinson's theology is on display when, in an explanation of how our outlines should have development, he plays the part of a listener who asks of the preacher, \\"What evidence does she have for that statement\\" (140)? Here again he opens the door for us to peer into his theological framework which allows for women ministers. If Robinson had titled this book, \\"Biblical Teaching,\\" then the reader would understand the necessity for this revision. Many men and women in our churches teach, but the New Testament sets parameters on who teaches whom and where (1 Corinthians 14:33-35, 1 Timothy 2:11-13). For twenty-seven years however, this book has borne the title, \\"Biblical Preaching.\\" When Robinson notes that the theology he has is \\"my theology,\\" this reviewer is troubled by the use of the \`my.' For someone who claims to look to authorial intent, the description of his views seems too self-centered. This reviewer believes that his theology has strayed in this area from Scripture.ConclusionRobinson excels in bringing a topic which many would deem dry and gives it life by coupling his extensive homiletical and hermeneutical knowledge with picturesque wit. Aside from the one weakness mentioned above, this book is a must-read for every pastor and aspiring preacher of the Gospel."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"This is an excellent resource and reference for any woman or man who is being prepared for the pulpit ministry.

The work represents the sum total of the traditional methods of homiletics and does it in a manner that will resonate with many expository preachers. For the most part, the work introduces little new information, but certainly does an excellent job repackaging the material for the modern expositor. Some of the new topics include the concept of a inductive message, which is still quite new for most preachers in conservative circles. Another helpful item in this work is its structure. The structure of the entire book is designed to give the expositor a number of stages to mark the progression from the text to the sermon. As a helpful secondary source, I would also recommend Bryan Chapell'sChrist-Centered Preaching: Redeeming the Expository Sermon."},{"Title":"Biblical Preaching: The Development and Delivery of Expository Messages","review":"Biblical Preaching is an excellent overall book on preaching, with heavy emphasis on the expository style. Robinson is a master preacher, and his lucid style and logical thinking is very evident in his writing. This is probably one of the best texts available for expository preachers. The first chapter is important, making a strong case for the value of expository preaching (which is vital, as the book really only covers this approach. Following chapters highlight the need to have a single main point (supported or reinforced by sub-points) rather than a 7-bullet message, and talks about how to approach the Scripture in coming up with a sermon. Thankfully Robinson does discuss the need to consider your audience, the various valid shapes that sermons can take - even discussing inductive and semi-inductive approaches. The book concludes with a chapter on how to preach so people will listen along with some appendices that include solid example sermons.Robinson shows a good understanding of contemporary culture, discussing very thoughtfully the issue of gender in preaching, the cultural changes that affect how our listeners perceive our sermons, and taking a fairly broad understanding of what it means to be expository. The emphasis on having one main point in order to maximize the chance of life transformation (rather than conveying a lot of information) was a key takeaway from the book.

Many books have been written on elders in recent years - Alexander Strauch's Biblical Eldership and Gene Getz' Elders and Leaders being among the best - but the unique contribution of Newton's book is its grounding in baptistic church polity. Newton explores the implementation of elders in Baptist churches, not Brethren or Bible churches (the respective denominational backgrounds of Strauch and Getz). For pastors in Baptist churches, this will make Elders in Congregational Life an excellent and especially helpful companion to these other two helpful studies.Newton divides his book into three parts. Part one, \\"Why Elders?\\" begins by answering \\"Why Baptist Elders Is Not an Oxymoron\\" (chapter one). The author here explores elder plurality in both American and English Baptist history, with numerous brief quotations from historic Baptist confessions and church leaders. His conclusion is the same as John Piper's whom he quotes: \\"The least we can say from this historical survey of Baptist Confessions is that it is false to say that the eldership is unbaptistic. On the contrary, the eldership is more baptistic than its absence, and its disappearance is a modern phenomenon that parallels other developments in doctrine that make its disappearance questionable at best.\\"Chapter two, \\"Elders in the New Testament\\", covers ground that will be familiar to students of Scripture, especially those who have read other books on elders. The three biblical terms applied to elders (presbuteros, episkopos, poimen) are discussed in their Scriptural contexts. A case is made for the plurality of elders. And the duties and responsibilities of elders are described under the fourfold list of doctrine, discipline, direction, and distinction in modeling the Christian life.The third chapter addresses \\"Character and Congregationalism,\\" giving special emphasis to the biblical qualifications for elders, the need for both elders and deacons, and how a plural eldership should function within a congregational church.Part two, \\"Three Key Biblical Texts\\", is more expository and sermonic in nature with three chapters which deal with Acts 20:17-31 (Chapter Four: \\"A Model for Our Times), Hebrews 13:17-19 (Chapter Five: \\"Elders and Congregation in Concert\\"), and 1 Peter 5:1-1-5 (Chapter Six: \\"Spiritual Leaders for God's Flock\\"). The chapters not only teach the biblical basis for eldership, but also apply biblical exhortations to both pastors/elders and congregations. A key paragraph from chapter six, which summarizes well the Baptist/congregational view of eldership presented in this book, reads: \\"We [the church Newton pastors] differ from our friends in the Presbyterian General Assembly and Bible Churches who put final authority in the hands of the local session of elders or submit to a presbytery outside of the local church. In contract, the final authority on matters of our church life resides in the congregation. But the functioning of a purely congregational system is both unwieldy and lacking biblical support. Instead, the establishment of a body of elders to serve in day-to-day leadership in spiritual matters, serving at the pleasure of the congregation, enables us to maintain both the traditional distinctive of congregational life and the clearly biblical structure of elders\\" (97).Part three of the book, \\"From Theory to Practice,\\" is especially valuable in providing practical and tangible steps for transitioning a more \\"traditional\\" church polity to eldership. Chapter seven, \\"Thinking About Transition to Eldership,\\" begins the discussion with appropriate cautions about transitioning and then spotlights three churches as case studies in which this transition has been made: First Baptist Church of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, under the leadership of Jeff Noblit, Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington D. C., under the leadership of Mark Dever, and Newton's own church in Memphis.Chapter eight then asks \\"Can it Be Done?\\" answering with a resounding yes - and then showing the way. The transitioning process is broken down into three phases: the evaluation phase, the presentation phase, and the implementation phase. Each of these phases is then broken down into smaller steps. During the evaluation phase, the pastor must assess (the current leadership and polity of the church), study (the Scriptures - with a leadership group), probe (give members of this team assignments, don't just spoon-feed), and summarize (the group's conclusions for the whole church). Then comes the presentation phase, which will involve exposition (of Scripture to the entire congregation, with careful and patient teaching on the biblical basis for eldership), discussion (with the members of the congregation, giving them ample opportunity to both comprehend and buy into the vision for change), and heavy emphasis on qualifications. Finally, the implementation phase is reached, involving prayer, screening of potential candidates, ordaining elders to service, involving those elders in leadership, and reviewing the biblical teaching on elders on an annual basis.Finally, chapter nine, \\"Putting It All Together\\", addresses the nitty-gritty concerns of how the elders' authority works, what role the \\"senior pastor\\" has, the concept of \\"ruling\\" elders, the question of church staff members as elders, the relationship between elders and deacons, the conducting of elders' meetings and congregational meetings, and elders' terms of service and dismissal. The final pages of the book acknowledge that some readers will not be persuaded that the view of eldership presented in this book is correct. And a helpful exhortation is joined with that acknowledgement: \\"Whatever type of leadership structure you embrace, by all means determine to raise the standards for leaders to match the biblical requirements. Failure of leaders to meet those requirements is the greatest deficiency in church leadership!\\" (153) Adding to the book's usefulness is a foreword by Mark Dever, thorough notes and documentation of the sources used in the book, a two page bibliography for further reading on elders (with numerous links to on-line resources), a Scripture index, and a subject index.As a pastor who is in the midst of leading a Baptist church through the transition to the kind of Baptistic and congregational eldership as described in this book, I found Newton's book helpful and encouraging. His exegesis of Scripture is solid, and much in line with some of the other resources already available. But especially valuable are his reflections on how to make the transition from a more traditional form to eldership. He is honest enough to acknowledge the challenges he and his own church faced, which give the book a flavor of realism often missing from books on church leadership that present neatly packaged plug-in-and-play models that are much easier to sell than implement. But best of all, Newton's presentation is really nothing more than clear biblical instruction."},{"Title":"Elders in Congregational Life: Rediscovering the Biblical Model for Church Leadership","review":"Elders in Congregational Life is a must read for any pastor or concerned lay person who is in a protestant church thinking about church government.

It will be particularly beneficial to anyone from a Baptist church tradition. The author effectively demonstrates that not only is church leadership by a plurality of elders compatible with Baptist beliefs and church practices, but that it's a significant component of Baptist history and heritage. He also describes the sometimes fierce resistance to this form of church leadership in Baptist churches, with some people being more concerned with remaining \\"Baptist\\" than being biblical.Along the way, he ably explains much of the New Testament role of the church elders. He shares some of his own story and how he came to change his viewpoint on these issues. He makes some very good points in his presentation. I especially appreciated his observation that, in Acts, Luke assumed--but didn't command--the planting of churches; in a similar way, he assumed--but didn't command--the appointment of elders. The author rightly warns against simply reading back into Scripture our current church practices.There are a few things in this book with which I would disagree. Newton assumes a distinct role for a senior pastor, but doesn't establish (biblically or otherwise) why this should be so. In his defense, he does show the senior pastor to be in submission to the elders, and his description of the ministry of church elders does show them to be active, pastoral leaders. And he's clear about the consequences and unfairness of expecting one pastor to wear every hat in the ministry of the church. Still, in my opinion retaining a distinct (and biblically unwarranted) role of senior pastor will serve to undermine a truly biblical church eldership. I also believe the author misconstrues the ministry role that Timothy filled while in Ephesus.The author's discussion of congregationalism is intriguing. As is true now of many pastors and leaders from congregational traditions, Newton doesn't support a purely democratic form of congregationalism. Instead he advocates a modified congregationalism. Many who are wary of traditional congregationalism will welcome statements such as (page 142): \\"Shepherds do not normally offer suggestions to sheep!\\" He brings out the real need for leaders to lead and for congregations to follow. On the other hand, he sees the congregation as being not only involved in reaching consensus, but as of having a final authority. And, while he's not dogmatic about this, he still tries to find in Scripture a possible election of elders by the congregation (unsuccessfully, in my opinion).As I said, this book will be most helpful for those currently in a Baptist church context, and especially for Baptist churches contemplating a transition to an elder-led church model. If you're thinking of making such a move, this book contains invaluable wisdom, and I would strongly encourage you to read it carefully. Of course, as the author points out, the place to begin is not with any supplemental book or study guide, but with Scripture itself. A real strength of this book is that it continually directs the reader's attention back to the pertinent biblical passages. I hope this book is widely read, and that it spurs readers to study these scriptural principles for themselves."},{"Title":"Elders in Congregational Life: Rediscovering the Biblical Model for Church Leadership","review":"An important look at the Biblical model of a plurility of elders within the contest of a congregational government. Often missed and seldom faithfully followed today. Complete with some practical how-to suggestions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elders in Congregational Life: Rediscovering the Biblical Model for Church Leadership","review":"Mark Dever is a man of passion for the truth of Scripture. His book 9 MARKS OF A HEALTHY CHURCH is well worth reading for every disciple of Jesus. His website www.9marks.org is a great resource for churches that desire to be Spirit-led instead of market-driven as many churches in the United States are today. This book will aid in that search as well.The book explores what the Bible says about leadership in the book of Acts and the New Testament epistles. Dever shows how the early church was elder led rather than the Western model of one single pastor (Senior Pastor, Lead Pastor, etc.) leading the Church. Dever shows how this model best fits into Scripture and further will better serve the Church and help safeguard the Church from becoming a one-man show.The positives of this book are that Dever is passionate that every teaching be based on the Word of God (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1). He rightly believes that the Bible must guide us into how God wants His Church to be set up. He further stays true to the Bible in regard to the role of elders (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9). He correctly shows that the Apostles established the churches around the Lordship of Jesus as the Head of the Church (Colossians 1:15-20) and that the elders were to be simply one of the brethren and not over the brethren (1 Peter 5:1-5).The only negative I have of the book is that while the book focused on the biblical role of elders, it failed to show that the modern pastorate has no basis in Scripture. Elders were the pastors (Acts 20:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Peter 5:1-4). There was no division between the two roles that I see in the New Testament. Further, Dever should have built a strong case that the modern pastorate robs God of His glory with its titles and positions of power rather than biblical leadership that reflects servanthood and humility like our King (Matthew 20:20-28; John 13:1-17; Philippians 2:1-11).Overall this is a solid book on church leadership and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Jim Wideman's book titled, Children's Ministry Leadership the you-can-do-it guide, does not leave the reader empty handed. He covers the typical roles of leadership that one may find in other books. However, Wideman shares with us characteristics of being an authentic leader. This list was insightful and challenging to the reader. This went past characteristics of a leader, but person aspects of being a leader. This was a great eye opener for those wanting to be a leader. These characteristics are important for a person to become a leader.The book moves away from characteristics of leaders-to being a leader and diving into specific topics. These topics range from time management, goals/priorities, integrity, delegation and the list goes on to difficult issues for leaders. The chapter about integrity is one that sticks out to me. He talks about integrity with morals, being lazy, that we are to be self-sufficient, and temptation to leave your calling/church. This chapter is excellent because often times people skip over integrity. This is one of the characteristics that is assumed, or looked over because it is obvious. So the fact Jim Wideman digs deeper into integrity is great.Other highlights of Jim Wineman were pushing the readers to have their own training program, problems can be good, solve problems and in keeping yourself motivated. All these tough topics are wrestled with, but Jim ties in the characteristics he talked about earlier. That is where Jim Wineman truly makes his points stick with readers. Instead of leaving readers wondering how are these points he making to be practical, well he tells you. There are different points introduced to the specific chapter, but the overall characteristics of being a leader were talked about.The last few chapters are incredible in Jim Wineman's book also are encouraging for readers in wanting to be great leaders. We will make mistakes and mess up. However, where we go from there is up to us. Whether we try the same thing again or change and do something different. He shares experiences of how he has failed countless times and shared that with people. This is always encouraging, because this makes the book seem more human. We can talk about ideals, lists of characteristics of leaders, and how to deal with certain aspects of being a leader. The author can hide behind this knowledge of his, but instead shares his experiences of how he got there.In conclusion, this paper is incredible for people wondering about leadership. Don't buy tons of leadership books get this one. This book as so much information that will leave readers digesting much. There are concepts in here that are not revolutionary or stuff some haven't heard before. But without including these into the bigger picture of being a leader this book wouldn't have been complete. This book also has many attributes of leadership that can be carried over to any other area of ministry. This book is incredible and definitely a great place to start."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Great book. It's a simple read. Practical and user friendly. Filled with transferable concepts that any leader can build into him or herself and then transfer to others.I wish I had this my freshman year of children's ministry."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"This is the BEST leadership book I've read -- especially for anyone in a staff position. Excellent, practical information for any staff position -- not just for children's ministry. This is a MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Overall I thought that this book was very helpful. It is the first time that I have read a book about how to \\"do\\" children's ministry. I think that this book does more than show us how to \\"do\\" children's ministry but also hows us how to be and live out our lives as leaders in the children's ministry field. Honestly, it was a bit overwhelming as there is a lot of information squeezed into this little book. He truly explains how to be a great leader in children's ministry. He first explains how to become a leader, and then the things you need to do after that, like knowing when to say no, living out what you teach in your personal life, delegating jobs to volunteers, managing time, problem solving and staying motivated. One of my favorite chapters of this book was chapter 3. He talkes in this chapter about being an example in our personal lives. I think that this is a huge point to make in children's ministries. The children look up to you so much, and if they learn that you are not living your life Monday through Saturday like you do on Sunday morning, their trust levels will begin to deteriorate. Children are very impressionable and living that way would only confuse them. Though, like Wideman explains in this chapter, if we live out our lives like we should be, we will be a great explain in our church and personal lives. Some ways that Wideman suggests doing that is to be problem solvers, show initiative, manage time, take rists, and grow spiritually. If we do all of those things for God's glory, kids will start to see how they are supposed to live their lives as well. One point he makes in this chapter is that leaders are lifelong learners. Even though we are leading, we should also constantly be learning as we go as well. If we are not learning and growing spiritually on our own, how are we going to lead others to do that in their life as well. There was so much information in this book that some of it seems like it would be common sense, but in reality, some of these things, like decision making and delegating to volunteers, can be really hard things to do and to do in an appropriate way. WIdeman goes into detail of how to do those things, while maintaining the respect as a children's pastor and still having a successful children's ministry. He also discusses the importance of family and alone time with family as a children's pastor. I really think that if you took this book one step at a time, that it would really be a great to help to people in the children's ministry fields. This was a very educational book and I look forward to putting some of his techniques to work in my future career."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to understand better how children's ministry works and how to effectively lead children's ministry, which is exactly what it says it will do. Unfortunately, I found it to be a very basic book on leadership with some minor applications to children's ministry worked in. Since I already understand the principles of leadership on a basic level at least, this book was not helpful to me at all.His advice also tended to be common sense, like how to schedule your time, to respect the authority of the senior pastor, and to spend time with your family. For example: Instead of talking about specifics to children's ministry like which aspects of the program should be given the most time, how to split time between various departments, or how to develop curriculum, he talked about planning ahead, preparing, evaluating your time, and using volunteers to do things you can't. I don't need to pay $15 and spend a couple hours learning those things. I need guidance for children's ministry, and I just didn't get it.There were a lot of lists and he is very organized. If you feel that you don't understand leadership or don't have leadership experience, this book might be helpful, though there are much better ones on the market. If you know a bit about leadership and want to learn to apply that to children's ministry, don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is a step by step guide to help improve your ministry. Jim Wideman is honest and comical. It will help you see where you need to improve, but also encourage you when you are already doing what needs to be done. Excellent book highly recommend to anyone in children's ministry."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"In reading the book Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide by Jim Wideman, I think that it is a useful book that anyone in leadership should have on their bookshelf. I know it says Children's Ministry, but Wideman has some very great ideas in dealing with leadership that can be applied to any leadership position anywhere. It can also just be applied to your life without being in ministry. There are many topics that the book talks about like time management, maintaining your integrity, and the whole book is full of great information. I could talk about so much more information.When talking about the topic of time management in leadership, it is something that leaders or anyone for that matter should have as one of the main roles in their life. Wideman gives us four ways to help us manage our time. The first one is plan your time. This one is really important because this way you can turn everything you have to do in on time and not go nuts with having so much to do. Also if you have a family this will help you be able to plan work and family around each other and not have to miss anything. The second on is to prepare. This is where if you are a list kind of person you can make a list each day so that you can make sure to get things done and know what is coming up next. If you are not a list person then make sure that you can know what is coming up so you can manage your time. The third one is evaluate how you are spending your time and this is a great tool to use so you know the areas that you are spending way too much time in and the areas that you need to put more time in. In doing this you can see if there is an area where you can delegate your work so that you can spend more time in the area that needs more of your time. This final point is use the time of others. This is really what delegation is all about. The thing is people cannot do everything on their own. They need other people to come in and help them out. This way other people can come along side and help you out. Another great topic about the book is the fact that if you need help with delegating then there is a chapter just for you in this book, which is called delegation.The next topic that I want to talk about is maintaining your integrity. This is another great one to have because if you keep your integrity you can have the trust and respect of the people who are volunteering for you or if you are not in ministry then your co-workers. Another thing in keeping your integrity is to be true to yourself and not be a two faced person. Doing this will also bring the trust and respect of the people around you. In this chapter of the book Wideman give examples of temptations that will hurt your integrity.These are just some of the examples of why this book is a great book to have for anyone really who has a leadership position in their life. I know that in my life I am not really going into Children's Ministry per say, but I would really make sure to keep this book so I can learn to be a better leader in whatever God wants me to do. I would recommend this book for anyone going in to Children's Ministry or any kind of leadership."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Children's Ministry Leadership by Jim Wideman is a great resource for any leaders. I found Wideman's different attributes of a leader to be very helpful to me even though I am not called to children's ministry. I read very carefully through the traits of a successful leader and thought hard about myself. I think that Wideman offers an excellent view of what a leader needs to do in order to be successful. I really appreciate his insights. I especially liked that he included things that are difficult. Many leaders struggle with the idea of being unpopular but Wideman is quick to say that a good leader will be unpopular at times. That is something that I really need to hear, because I often struggle with wanting everyone in my ministry setting to like me.Another helpful suggestion that I saw throughout Wideman's writing is the need for leaders to have a support structure. Wideman talks about being in contact with those above a leader and being accountable to them. He also encourages building a team of helpers that the leader empowers and shepherds. I appreciated his comment that programs will change year to year, but people will not. Infesting in people is crucial to successful ministry. I personally struggle with delegating tasks and thinking that I need to be in the working of every minor detail. It is almost as Jim Wideman is writing directly to me when he talks about delegating tasks to helpers and managing time appropriately.Wideman talks at length about volunteers because it is an important part of ministry. A ministry without a volunteer base, especially a children's ministry, will be unsuccessful. One of the most important things I learned from Wideman is that a leader needs to pinpoint exactly what help they need. There is truth in the statement that people will be less likely to volunteer if they do not know what they are volunteering for. I have seen many ministries just call for help from anyone and everyone without outlining the actual duties that will be expected. I believe that when it comes to recruiting volunteers it is very important to be up front and direct. Wideman points out that volunteers who know their role can make better decisions. They are certainly better equipped for their role because they will know exactly what is expected. I think it is very important that Wideman focuses not only on the leader, but also on the leadership team or volunteer base. He is recognizing that a successful children's ministry does not just hang on the leader.Children's Ministry Leadership is an excellent resource for children's ministers. It outlines in a very practical way what it means to be a leader in any role. Wideman goes on to give specific details about how to successfully leader people with particular emphasis on growing as an individual and empowering others. I believe that Wideman captures what it is to lead by focusing on building up self and others rather than talking at length about specific programs or plans that may or may not work in different contexts. The leadership traits and suggestions that Wideman outlines are not specific to one context. I highly recommend Children's Ministry Leadership to anyone who is seeking to hone their leadership skills."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Leadership is never an easy avenue to embark on, especially when it comes to being in charge of a children's ministries program. There are so many things a person can learn when studying ministry in how to prepare for going into the work field, and yet it seems that when they get there very little of all that \\"book learning\\" helps. Practicality and experience seem to be the best kinds of teachers, which is why Jim Wideman's book \\"Children's Ministry Leadership\\" is such a great read. It combines book knowledge with the practical experience that go hand-in-hand when dealing with ministry towards children.One aspect that I love about this book is that it has the ability to transcend from simply dealing with children's ministry to nearly all aspects of ministry. It gives practical advice and step-by-step instructions for how to work in a ministry setting and make it both an effective tool for the children and a lasting impact on their lives. I noticed while reading Wideman's points that many of the tips he was giving out could also be directed at teens, young adults, and the general church population and still have the same kind of positive impact it would have on children. But that is only one part of the book I find wonderful.Another part of the book I really liked was the way Wideman explained leadership with service. This was a point he kept referring back to time and time again, because it is so incredibly important for someone in a leadership position. Leaders are called to serve the people under them, not to rule over them demanding the people to do their bidding. Pastors and leaders are put into those positions so that the people under them might learn and develop into Godly people, which requires a great amount of service.Along with the idea of service is leadership still requires following. It's funny how as leaders people seem to think they finally have it, so they don't need to listen to others anymore. Yet Wideman reminds us that even in leadership positions we still need to have people of wisdom and accountability that we look to in times of trouble. Leaders are still people, who make mistakes, get frustrated, and don't have all the answers. This is perhaps my favorite thing that Wideman points out: leaders still need guidance and help even when placed above the congregation as the leader of the people.So Jim Wideman gives us a practical, down-to-earth guide at how leadership with children can be both a blessing yet a challenging experience as well. He by no means sugar coats what ministry and leadership is like, laying out for the reader the reality that the world brings upon us. Yet Wideman shows hope and promise blended with a passion for reaching young ones in the name of Christ that anyone, pastor, layperson, or parent, can grab a hold of and being making an impact in the lives of little ones around them."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It-Guide by Jim Wideman is a great book. I absolutely loved reading this book. It is written in a way that you feel like you are discussing children's ministry with Jim in a little coffee shop, while drinking your specialty coffee drink. Because it feels this way it was a very easy read, but it had such good content. The title of this book says a lot about it, it is a you can do it guide to leadership in children's ministry, but it is also how to do it guide and most importantly how to balance your time in ministry and your time with your family.This book is a you can do it guide and not a how to do it because this book is about you becoming a great leader in children's ministry. I how to do it guide makes it sound easy, like if you do these three steps you will become a great leader. But that is not how it works. One of the main things that Jim says you need to be to be a leader is organized. Now not all people are natural organizers, in fact Jim acknowledges in the book that he is not natural organizer, but he has learned to become an organized person so that he can be a leader. This is why this book is a you can do it guide; it is meant to encourage you, because it is up to you to have the motivation and the want to be a leader.This book is mostly geared to how to be a leader in a large church with lots of children and lots of volunteers, and even paid workers, but there are some great things in it that can be applied to smaller churches. Jim is big on leaders should mentor and train their volunteers. Jim has to have classes for training and can only mentor his leaders, but those in smaller churches have more opportunities for closer training and hands on mentoring.Balancing family and ministry is also a big part of this book, and I think that what he has to say about balancing ministry and family can apply to more than just those whose ministry is with children. Everyone has many different roles in life and those roles need to be prioritized from most important to least important. Man or woman of God needs to be first on that list, and then spouse and parent, if you have children, and then needs to be your role as a leader in ministry. Jim asks a great question in this book about what is the point of having a great, successful, healthy ministry if you don't have the same in your own home. Your home is your first place of ministry, not the church.This is a fantastic book! It is easy to read with lots of information about not only how to be a great leader in children's ministry but also, and I think more importantly, how to balance family and ministry. I am very glad that this book is in my library and I look forward to being able to apply a lot of the things I learned from Jim Wideman in this book to my own ministry and my own life."},{"Title":"Children's Ministry Leadership: The You-Can-Do-It Guide","review":"Children's Ministry Leadership is a very helpful resource for someone going into children's ministry like myself. One of the previous reviews mentions it as a good idea for a textbook, and as a senior in Children's ministry after four years of learning as a children's ministry intern I have to agree, this is a very helpful book. Jim Wideman is a very easy to understand author who writes with simple organization and colorful illustrations that even the busiest reader can get drawn into. He talks about how to become a leader in children's ministry, because he claims leadership is learned and not inherited. He says, \\"The fact is that anyone can become a leader- if that person really wants to be a leader.\\" This book gives the reader a chance to understand how to do so, and how to succeed in ministry as a leader, regardless of their natural tendencies or leadership styles. The author even talks about his own lack of organization at the beginning of his ministry, which is something some of us in ministry struggle with. He explains how he succeeded in ministry in ways nobody else would have expected. It is encouraging to know that it is possible. The way that Wideman talks about his own experiences helps to keep the reader engaged and interested, and he provides mountains of practical solutions for dealing with things that come up when trying to lead others in children's ministry.As a future leader in children's ministry this book has been invaluable for me. Like Wideman says he used to, I struggle with organization. Seeing that I am not alone, and learning how another person with similar struggles has not only succeeded but thrived in the same calling which I have given my life toward gave me a tremendous amount of hope and excitement for what is to come. I am definitely going to keep this book on my shelf and recommend it to anyone I know who is doubting themselves or unsure of what it means to be a leader in children's ministry. I plan to re-read it whenever I'm looking for ways to improve my way of leadership, or even just examples of some things that will work in ministry. Wideman brings some new and some old concepts of leadership and ministry to this book and blends them in such a way that one can understand them, and learn from his experiences. The perspective he gives is very refreshing and encouraging.I hope that if you are looking into children's ministry for the first time, or looking for ways to improve your leadership, you take the little bit of time and money to read this book. It will pay off for you, I am sure of it."},{"Title":"Paradise Poisoned: Learning About Conflict, Terrorism and Development from Sri Lanka's Civil Wars","review":"John Richardson's *Paradise Poisoned* is far and away the most comprehensive study of civil violence in Sri Lanka ever undertaken. In its narrative sweep, mastery of detail, conceptual acuity and analytic range, it will never be surpassed. Indeed, no other study of civil violence anywhere rivals Richardson's in these several respects.For those of us who have seen Sri Lanka from the inside, Richardson's large claim is beyond challenge: the country's descent into violence had no single overriding cause. Richardson assembled vast amounts of data (helpfully displayed in innumerable graphs and tables) on every conceivable contributing cause. His background in the analysis of dynamic systems gave him the best imaginable tools for mapping tangled developments over many decades. His conclusions are always compelling, strikingly so when he catalogs the beneficiaries of violent conflict.One by one, the ten imperatives Richardson puts forward for preventing civil violence in developing societies may seem like common sense. His exhaustive, fully integrated study of the Sri Lankan experience massively substantiates every one of them. Taken together and taken seriously, they are represent our best chance for a better, safer world.Nicholas OnufProfessor EmeritusFlorida International University"},{"Title":"Paradise Poisoned: Learning About Conflict, Terrorism and Development from Sri Lanka's Civil Wars","review":"John Richardson's *Paradise Poisoned* is an important, timely, and groundbreaking book. The product of more than 18 years of work, it is a carefully researched account of Sri Lanka's fall from a beautiful island paradise and international development \\"success story\\", to a headline-grabbing example of a nation torn apart by terrorism and deadly civil conflict.Drawing both on an innovative methodology and his long-standing work in the fields of international development and conflict, Professor Richardson demonstrates how Sri Lanka's tragic story clearly exposes a world-wide issue that has long been hiding in plain sight--that international development programs, conflict, and terrorism are intimately linked, and often in very negative ways. This is obviously a highly important and policy-relevant finding that is rarely discussed or analyzed in a rigorous manner--the only other book I can recall is Peter Uvin's work on Rwanda (Aiding Violence, 1998). Other important authors, like Mary Anderson (Do No Harm, 1999) offer valuable advice to practitioners on how to reduce conflict in the field, but Richardson and Uvin's more structural analyses expose how contemporary international development policies, put in place by well-meaning leaders and the international community, can be a factor that leads to deadly conflict in the first place.The book has many lessons, but for me the most important is this profound critique of contemporary development wisdom, and Richardson's carefully documented case study makes it impossible to ignore his findings, or write them off as a simplistic superficial analysis based on preconceived conclusions. Quite the contrary, Richardson's approach is highly sophisticated, and his innovative systems methodology enables him to clarify how deadly conflict arises not from a single cause, but from a complex interaction of a number of critical factors that, acting together, help to explain the fall of Sri Lanka from apparent success to disastrous failure.The practical policy lessons to be drawn are many, and reach well beyond the Sri Lanka case. Perhaps the most important lesson is that development policies need to be examined with an additional lens that clarifies the ways in which well-intended programs can exacerbate this complex set of factors that undo the development goals and lead to violent and persistent conflict and terrorism. Professor Richardson's useful book goes a long way in this direction by pointing out some of the most critical reference points for this new perspective. It is essential reading, both as a cautionary tale, and as an important source for anyone concerned with discovering specific ways to improve international development policy and reduce global violence.Steven Arnold, University of Washington (formerly Director, International Development Program, American University)"},{"Title":"Paradise Poisoned: Learning About Conflict, Terrorism and Development from Sri Lanka's Civil Wars","review":"Although at times I found this book to be a little repetitive, the premises posed ring true, I can't help but continue thinking about them.

I found myself often considering the arguments posed in this book and feeling that they were validated by my own experiences there.Now a few years later, post-war, I again find myself thinking of this book as I follow the conflicts in Egypt.

While North avoids suggesting that Neolithic Europe was unified in religious thinking, he points out areas of commonality. Some form of ancestor worship, he contends, led to sophisticated insight of the heavens across Europe. Over the centuries this knowledge went from star sightings to the recording of positions of the sun and moon at significant times. The evidence for this thesis lies in the burial sites, banks and ditches, wooden and stone monuments dating back nearly seven thousand years.With firm conviction, illustrated by numerous graphic images, North demonstrates how early burial sites acted to mark stellar risings. Neolithic burials took place in a variety of sites: gallery graves, passage graves and dolmens, among others. The prevailing final step was the practice of covering the site with a mound of stones and earth. This could result in long barrows, mounds or other structures, but the one thing they had in common was to elevate the top above the surrounding horizon. Using the surrounding ditch remaining from relocating the soil and rock, observers could note certain stars appearing over an &quot;artificial horizon.&quot; North postulates a possible shift in focus from ancestors and stars to gods or spirits associated with the sun and moon. This &quot;advance&quot; in thinking resulted in stone monuments like Stonehenge in Britain and sites in Western Europe.In tracing the growth of religious thinking and its manifestations in Neolithic Europe, North sees consistency without unity. What he does stress is the advanced thinking that must have been taking place during passing years. Wood and stone circles were positioned with uncanny accuracy to perform their tasks. He provides reconstruction drawings of many of the sites to display the limited fields of view they allowed. Peering along the post alignments, only a brief glimpse of rising or setting sun was available to the observer. Lintels, whether wood or stone, were designed to cut down on glare during sunrise or sunset observations. The graphics illustrating these points require careful study, but are rewarding for that.Some of his contentions seem implausible. He uniformly places observers of stellar risings in ditches. If these were religious leaders, this would seem a diminution of priestly status not seen elsewhere. North has gone to considerable effort to demonstrate just how complex the sites are and what that says about the motivation and abilities of Neolithic peoples. How much of this effort is his, and how much derived from others is difficult to assess. There are frequent references to various authors in the text, but no direct citations. His &quot;Bibliography&quot; is by chapters and too vague to pursue sources without excessive toil. The appendices, on carbon dating, astronomical issues and geographical positioning are helpful, particularly if you have the maths. Overall, this is a useful book, even if it must be read with a sense of caution.

Therefore, although some do consider it unbelievable, the basis of it is entirely true. The way that the author slowly brings out the character of Harvey Birch is wonderful. He creates numerous sub plots that make the story very interesting. The only weakness is the fact that the author was rushed into stopping the story abruptly. As a result, one hears no more about many important characters until the very end when some are fleetingly mentioned. The ending is so strong, however, that this fault isn't as glaring as it would have been."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"In his second novel, James Fenimore Cooper forces readers into the minds and mentalities of his characters, while practically bringing the readers to the scene with his excellent writing ability. Both of these things help to establish the basic ideas in the novel and make it easier to understand.The story takes place during the heart of the American Revolution in 1780 on the neutral ground of Westchester County, New York. Harvey Birch is an American spy wrongly suspected by Patriots to be a spy for the British. Harvey meets a family named the Whartons, who are torn apart by the war. Throughout the story, Harvey helps the family by trying to save Henry Wharton, a British Spy, while he himself has to evade both the Continental Army and American guerrillas. In the end, George Washington offers the spy a reward, but Harvey refuses because he was motivated by his love for his country, and not by money.Though it may seem unbelievable, the basis for the story of The Spy is actually true. There are even real characters, including General George Washington. The plot was very complex, growing thicker and thicker, containing many subplots which enhanced the entertainment value of the book. There were some very significant ideas in this novel, such as the elder Wharton's neutrality during the war which held his family together. There were also some confusing events, including Harvey Birch's sudden change of mind while handing his pardon note to Major Dunwoodie. Another puzzling aspect of the story was how the Continental Army still suspected Birch to be a spy for the British even after seeing all his pro-patriot actions. This book would be great for historians, history teachers, or war fanatics, but Cooper's sophisticated language would be more difficult for high school students."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"THE SPY appeared in December of 1821, 189 years ago as I write this. Why in the world would anyone want to read a novel written nearly two centuries ago? First of all, I submit that the age of a book is pretty much immaterial. Until one has read it, a book is always new to each of its readers. Secondly, THE SPY is very simply an intriguing story, which brings us to one of the two reasons that I thoroughly enjoy it:The story line of the book is as interesting as that of any modern spy novel, probably better in fact. Take this mysterious peddler, Harvey Birch. He is widely believed to be a spy for the British, but where do his loyalties truly lie? What real identity underlies Harper, the stranger driven to the Whartons' home by the storm? Beyond the mysteries lie other fascinating plot threads, for even in the midst of war love exists, both true as in the case of Major Dunwoodie and false as in the person of the British Colonel Wellmere.Beyond its gripping story line, I also found THE SPY most enjoyable reading for what I'll call its educational aspects. Although it is a novel and therefore fictional, I believe it does rather accurately bring out aspects of the American Revolution that are often ignored in American history classes. As happened again eighty-four years later in the War Between the States, the Revolution saw many families whose members were divided in their loyalties. Not all of the colonists were in favor of American independence by any means. Many remained loyal to King George, while many others strove to maintain neutrality in the hope of preserving their property from confiscation or destruction by either side. All of these sundry positions find expression through various characters in THE SPY.Another aspect of the Revolution of which I was hitherto unaware was the existence of irregular armed groups that roamed the countryside amidst the lawlessness of war, ostensibly supporting one side or the other but often more self-serving than anything else. Neither the Skinners (supposedly supporters of the revolutionaries) nor the Cowboys and Refugees (supporters of British loyalists) were particularly trustworthy or observant of any \\"rules of war,\\" pillaging and burning at their own whims. As with probably any war, things were not quite as neat and orderly as history textbooks make them appear. Bits of historical reality such as this leave the reader not only entertained but also a little bit wiser of our nation's beginnings.To balance the review, I must add a couple of characteristics of Cooper's writing that were a bit distracting, although neither can be called a weakness given the stylistic and social conventions of the time. Early 19th Century writers were not as direct and concise as are modern authors, and the use of rather stilted phrases in lieu of precise nouns was an expected norm. Hence, instead of the single word \\"doctor,\\" we find \\"disciple of Aesculapius\\" and such like. More distracting, though quite explicable in light of evolving social norms, are the descriptions and actions of the female characters, who exemplify the now-outmoded traits of the \\"weakness of their sex\\" and are controlled by conventions of \\"propriety\\" that the contemporary reader now finds ludicrous. I mention these not to dissuade anyone from reading THE SPY but merely to prepare one to encounter them.All in all, the novel remains as intriguing and captivating as at any time in its 189 year existence, and I heartily recommend it to any reader interested in a fresh, and probably very realistic, view of the American Revolution as well as anyone who just enjoys a good, adventurous mystery story."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"Cooper's second novel and first important book is filled with things that aren't what they seem to be: people in disguise, others claiming things about themselves that aren't true, laws that appear to be unfair, unpatriotic patriots, etc. Set during the Revolutionary War in a sort of no-man's land (Cooper calls it the \\"neutral ground\\") north of New York City, where both patriots and English sympathizers intermingle and are more likely to be out for themselves than supportive of either side, the story centers around Harvey Birch, thought by all to be a British spy, but who is actually just the opposite: he's spying for George Washington, who appears in disguise as Mr. Harper. Washington is staying with Henry Wharton, a British sympathizer. Wharton has two daughters who provide the \\"love interest\\" of the novel (one is about to marry Colonel Wellmere, who, it's discovered just in time, is already married). Wharton's son, who is about to be hanged as a British spy, is \\"allowed\\" to escape by Washington as a favor to Wharton for his hospitality. Cooper's theme is moral ambiguity in the face of unfolding events, though individual characters do make clear decisions based on their beliefs, most of which have nothing to do with the war. Birch in particular acts with unflinching honor in spite of what most think of him. Although the novel at times can feel stiff, Cooper's story is animated and well- dramatized. Not as good as any of the Leatherstocking tales or some of his sea novels, but better than quite a number of his other books."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"THE SPY, America's first historical novel, is set in late 1780. It plays out in New York's Westchester County, \\"the neutral ground\\" between the British forces occupying Manhattan and the American rebels further up the Hudson River. It is not long after the capture and execution under order of General George Washington of out-of-uniform British officer Major John Andre. It is a tough time to be a spy -- for either side.The novel has two principal characters: an American double-agent and his handler.The former is Harvey Birch, a wandering peddler, suspected far and wide of being a British agent. He lives in Westchester County with his ancient father, John Birch, and their housekeeper. American forces have arrested him more than once, but he has escaped, perhaps under command influence. He is under a death warrant, if caught by the Americans.The latter lead character calls himself Mr. Harper. He is tall and has the upper classes about him though he does not wear a wig. Harper looks about fifty.We meet Harper in THE SPY'S first sentence: \\"It was near the close of the year 1780, that a solitary traveller was seen pursuing his way through one of the numerous little valleys of West-Chester.\\" He is dressed as a civilian and sits astride on a mighty horse. He takes shelter from a raging storm in \\"The Locusts,\\" country home of Mr. Wharton, a man somewhat older than Harper. Wharton is wealthy, pro-British, but a political trimmer who hopes (for the sake of not losing his extensive holdings) to seem at least politically neutral to the Americans, in case they ultimately win.There are also two Wharton daughters on hand that evening. A son, Henry, a British officer based in Manhattan, visits his family in disguise carrying a forged pass from George Washington. The peddler Harvey Birch arrives with goods to tempt the ladies. One of the daughters is pro-American and is in love with handsome Major Dunwoodie of the Virginia forces. The older girl loves a rascally British Colonel, whom she does not know to be an intending bigamist.All the elements of the novel are in place that evening. The characters go on with their lives, harried by two irregular armed forces: pro-British Cow-Boys and pro-American Skinners.The story is about the American revolutionary patriotism of Birch and Harper. Over time we learn Harper's real identity and see his national reputation grow until by the time of the War of 1812 when he is dead and gone, he almost equals the gods. Harvey Birch is equally the American patriot but is, by contrast with Harper, condemned forever to hide his true identity as a loyal American who only betrayed to the British what Harper ordered him to reveal.When the ancient Harvey Birch falls after being drawn into a fight against the British near Niagara Falls on July 25, 1814, he had just made the acquaintance of two young American officers. One is Captain Wharton Dunwoodie, son of the pro-American Wharton daughter of 1780. Harvey recalls her to her son as \\"an angel.\\" Harvey's corpse is found after the fight by Captain Dunwoodie. A bullet had pierced a tin container under Birch's clothing en route to his heart. In the case is an aging testament from none less than George Washington to \\"Harvey Birch ... for many years a faithful and unrequited servant of his country. Though man does not, may God reward him for his conduct!\\" (Ch. xxxv)There is a view among scholars that celibate or childless heroes of Fenimore Cooper stand outside, even above time. They beget no sons to bind their generation to the next. George Washington and Harvey Birch were two such men. History, however goes forward dialectically through the marriage of the slave-holding Virginian Dunwoodie to the daughter of a wavering New York Tory. Their son, Captain Wharton Dunwoodie, representing, America's unique future, is the first to learn the patriotic truth about a master spy who had long before done much to make his parents' wedding possible.This review offers a little bit about THE SPY's beginning and end. There is much, much more in between, including other characters, black and white, whom you will enjoy meeting. And you may also find yourself asking more than once: \\"Just who is this mysterious Mr. Harper?\\" -OOO-"},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"As an English teacher, I have had trouble over the years finding a novel that could be classified as a classic--or even a well-done movie--about the American Revolution. Cooper's *The Spy* can go some distance toward filling that gap, but it is perhaps the characterization of Caesar, the slave, that has made the book undesirable in today's classroom. Certainly it shows condescension toward Africans, but there is also a great conversation in the book regarding the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom while holding slaves, and Caesar becomes central to the plot more than once in this story. The novel shows how, as in the Civil War, families were divided, enemies mingled, and rowdies loyal to no one wreaked havoc in the countryside. The use of disguise and/or deception is key in this novel: I can count 8 off the top of my head. Things are not what they seem, which, of course, is Cooper's main point as he labors to enshrine the memory of those who allowed themselves to be hated by their American neighbors in order to aid the American cause. Cooper's characterization is not as strong in this novel as what he later achieved with Natty Bumppo, but *The Spy* fills the gap of the missing classic of the Revolutionary period in American literature and should not be left simply to gather dust."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"Some of my ancestors lived in the area that this book describes. They defended their property and fought against the British army and cattle thieves (\\"cowboys\\"). Reading this book helped me picture how it must have been for them at that delicate time in our country's history. The story is entertaining even if the plot is somewhat straightforward."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) has been called the American Sir Walter Scott. Like Scott he wrote of his native land. In his great Leatherstocking Tales and in this early novel he explores life in the early American nation.The Spy deals with the exciting and sad life of Harvey Birch a pedlar living in Westchester County New York during the Revolutionary War. This was a neutral area in which a civil war was in progress between Loyalists favoring Great Britain and the colonists fighting to create the United States of America. Harvey was a spy for Washington though he was widely thought to be a Loyalist agent spying on Washington's beleagured army. There are several times in the novel when the reader believes Birch will be hanged. Due to his skill in disguise and quick talking he always escapes.The major focus is on the Wharton family. The father favors the English remaining loyal to George III. His oldest daughter Sarah falls in love with an bigamy minded British officer named Wellmere. It is discovered that he has a wife and family back home in England. Sarah becomes mentally ill when she learns this shattering news on the eve of her wedding. Wharton's youngest daughter Frances is in love with Colonel Dunwoodie an officer in the American army Henry Wharton the only son is a British officer who is saved from being hanged as a spy by the exertions of Henry Birch. The book is filled with disguises as spying goes on in this battleground of blood and death. Cooper includes a few battle scenes. The book ends with Harvey Birch being shot to death during the battle of Lundy Lane in the War of 1812. Until a note from George Washington is discovered on Birch's body he had been thought to be a British agent. Instead, Cooper celebrates the patriotism of Birch. The best scene occurs when Birch refuses to accept money for his efforts from the hand of George Washington. Washington appears in the novel as \\"Harper\\" who visits the Wharton family as the novel begins with his exciting flight for freedom from the British finding safe haven in the comfortable home of the Wharton family.Cooper is much mailnged for his ridiculous plotting, fabulous escapes and stilted sytle. Despite these faults this is a good book worthy of being read and enjoyed. Cooper was our first great American novelist who is deserving of being read. His romance novels of a distant time and place are part of our American literary tradition."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"The is here adventure enough and romance for all.A visit home to see the family turns badfor a British Captain of Infantry.A peddler ans a gentleman stranger are what the plot turns on.Here are \\"Cowboys\\" as mounted British soldiers before the moderncowboy was thought of.Here are spies and daring escapes in the middle of raging war.All this takes in rural 1780's New York.It isn't as good or as bad as some of Cooper's writing,but it is well told with some surprises along the way."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"This was Cooper's second novel and his first success (his first novel, \\"Precaution\\" is still in print but little read, deservedly, by all accounts). America wanted its own Walter Scott, its own in-house novelist, and at the same time it was busy mythologizing the Revolution. So Cooper and \\"The Spy\\" were opportune. He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism. Also, he was not yet into his stride as a storyteller and so, for example, conflicts are resolved too soon and sub-plots remain undeveloped.Although \\"The Spy\\" was inspired by ('Based on' is too strong a characterization) events surrounding the Major Andre affair, the connection is tenuous, and even though real historical characters, including a most implausible George Washington, make an appearance, the historical accuracy is slight. It is a version of events that the American public wanted to hear. Probably it still is. In fact, Mel Gibson will probably one day expunge all vestiges of authenticity from it and turn it into a movie.It is interesting to note the discussion on slavery that takes place between the British and American protagonists, and also the author's treatment of the black characters. Written between the Revolution and the Civil War, it reflects the attitudes of its time.If you do decide to read it, I recommend the Penguin edition, as it has a very good introduction."},{"Title":"The Spy","review":"For the bulk of the novel, Fennimore Cooper seems to spin his literary wheels attempting to develop depth into his characters. Failing miserably, the plot quickens and the novel becomes more entertaining, although hardly believable. The ultimate reason for the danger in the book becomes rather silly, but still there is some redeaming quality to the novel. This was basically Fennimore Cooper's first attempt at an American novel and so some tolerance is warrented. I shall try the next book, The Pioneers, in time."},{"Title":"San Diegan","review":"Barry Berndes SAN DIEGAN has got to be one of the best bargainsaround.

In my opinion, you won't find a better book about San Diego than this! END"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"First let me say, I know Venice, I love Venice, I speak Italian, I know Venetians, I know all about the story concerning the fire at La Fenice, as I have read Italian newspaper articles on the subject, (including those from the local newspaper, il Gazzettino-which the author quotes in his book). Also like the author, my favorite apartment in Cannaregio was no more than about a 3 minute walk from the author's apartment in Cannaregio. That said, I was looking forward to reading a book about La Fenice and the city I love so well, BUT, after growing more dismayed upon tediously getting through the first half (and skimming the last part of it) I have only this to say: If THIS is what constitutes good writing, a \\"fascinating, interesting read\\" and a best-seller in this country, then the standards in this country are very, very very low indeed!Berendt has written a book that is totally devoid of any kind of real storytelling, instead, I got the distinct impression that he was a reporter, staying with American ex-pats and hanging out in the English-speaking \\"demi-monde\\" of Venice, a very insignficant minority in this ancient city, getting THEIR view on things, making THEIR role in the affairs of Venice seem MUCH greater than they ever could be, and then trying to write a story about something that would have been a far more interesting read as a magazine article, (of which a hundred more talented writers could have made far more interesting!)It's as if Berendt already knows that his storyline is thin, and because he is not a talented writer of prose, he fills the book with uninteresting and irrelevant \\"filler\\" material-overly long descriptions of facts that add nothing to the story whatsoever, but are simply words on additional pages that one has to wade through, without any literary \\"reward\\" for doing so.This is not the Venice I know, and one should never get the impression that this book represents anything like what you will find there-the quotable quotes from the Venetians in the book notwithstanding-really, you can skim through this and find that there is no real story there-the burning of La Fenice may be interesting to a limited number of people who love and know Italy, (and or think this might be a good travel book about this storied city) but outside of that group, Berendt does not have any real storytelling gift-he's just writing a boring narrative of the notes he's managed to take while given access to people simply because they know he's a famous author and they wind up giving him \\"quotable quotes\\" so that they can wind up in his book. I say, save your money on this one, and rent a travel DVD on Venice-you'll get FAR more enjoyment and a much greater sense of authenticity about this unique lagoon city!One more thing: Berendt could have added an interesting afterword that people who DO read this book would like to know I think: The very charismatic mayor/philosopher of Venice, Massimo Cacciari, (strangely underwritten in this book) who was charged and acquitted of negligence in the burning of La Fenice, and who stepped down in the year 2000 from his post, suddenly decided to again run for mayor this past spring. Why? Because Felice Casson, the very prosecutor who charged him, was the leading mayoral candidate.In a thrilling run-off election, Massimo Cacciari beat his former adversary, the prosecutor, to again become the mayor of Venice in April 2005, by something like 1,500 votes. Now THAT is what you call revenge."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Berendt's writing style is engaging as always, but the book is so unfocussed that it is more confusing than readable. Instead of concentrating on a single crime/scandal, and then spiraling outwards from that (which he did remarkably well in his first book), this book bounces around between several notorious deeds spread across large expanses of time, and all of them are chronicled to wildly varying degrees -- and some have questionable \\"conclusions\\" and some are just abandoned in the middle of the book and never mentioned or concluded in any fashion."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I absolutely loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil so I was rushing to pick this up when I heard it was coming out. It's a great book but very different to his first (Midnight ..) Again, there are some very interesting characters, both books are about trials and both so well written. I hope he doesn't take 10 or more years to write another. Reading about the city of Venice really made me want to go and visit (just like I want to still visit Savanah) but I love his descriptions and style of writing in general, and this will have you hooked from beginning to end.

Most British newspaper reviews seriously panned the book, as did many US papers (those not pretending this was another Garden variety book).No story: There was no mystery about the Fenice fire, except why it took Venice 8 years to rebuild it. The Rylands story, while true, cannot be of interest except to Venetians and Guggenheim management in New York, and the internecine squabble at Save Venice, a \\"preposterousky snobbish\\" group according to Jan Morris, concerns unimportant internal politics about a group of which most Venetians have never heard. It's an inchoate mess.Writing: All conversations are structured exactly alike. There is a false tone to all of them. To me it suggests that Berendt's claim to the Italian language is suspect or at least magnified and that the conversations reported are reconstructions from an interpreter's notes.Gossip: Yes, gossip can be fun if you know and dislike the people, but an entire book relating Venice goings on cannot possibly be of interest to the wider book buying public outside of Venice.The book gives no sense of the real Venice, good and bad.There are lots of similar junky books written by visitors to Venice, like Mr. Berendt, and all those books have disappeared, a fate this one deserves.Fitzpatrick, H"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"After reading Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, I couldn't wait to get my hands on his next book!

Upon seeing that Berendt had finally come out with another work, I immediately asked for The City of Falling Angels for Christmas. I just finished the book yesterday and I've had it since December. (Very unusual for me, I typically read a great book in a matter of days). The problem, I think, was the incoherent story, which really failed to take a continuous path, kept introducing new characters, and really seemed more like a history lesson than giving me the very real yet juicy sense of place that I got from reading about Savannah in Midnight. I kept wanting the book to pick one character or storyline and stick to it (I thought several were potentially fascinating on their own), but chapter after chapter, I found myself reading about another obscure vignette that seemed to take the focus off of what I thought the book was going to be about (the fire at the Fenice).If this had been a library book, I would have returned it without getting to the end.

His predecessors, he claims, used Venice as a backdrop for the misadventures of travelers, and never explored the experiences of either the native Venetians or the city's long-term foreign residents.Using the 1996 dramatic burning of the Fenice opera house and its protractedly delayed rebuilding and reopening as both brackets and running narrative thread, Berendt delves into stories of Venetian-style betrayal with an attitude of dark humor and wide-eyed observation. A few of these address Venetians, but the most researched and vividly told are the three tales of Anglophones expatriates gone awry. Berendt quotes Henry James' letter to one of these, Ariana Curtis, in reference to Robert Browning's unfortunately-named son Pen (alas for the offspring of writers), who also resided in Venice: \\"There seems but one way of being sane in this queer world, but there are many ways of being mad!\\"Personally, as another erstwhile American living in an equally odd if completely different expatriate/immigrant milieu, the fallen Anglos of \\"Fallen Angels\\" ring quite familiar: how the crossing of cultural boundaries, the shifting of personal contexts, the removal of original social constraints can bring out the very worst in people.The first of Berendt's case studies is the Curtis family, American-Venetian aristocracy whose fifth generation self-destructed over monetary squabbles. The second, and saddest, is that of the Reynolds, an American couple who manipulated their way first into control of Peggy Guggenheim's Venice collection before insinuating into the graces of Ezra Pound's elderly and addled mistress, the musician Olga Rudge, whose estate they also tried somewhat successfully to seize. Finally, Berendt details the politics behind the implosion of the American foundation, Save Venice.The book is interesting more for these histories than for the Venice evocations, with their delineations of Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century Europe's and America's cultural figures and movements. Educational for those of us not so familiar with them, and replete with juicy gossip for more knowledgeable readers.The Venetian characters are there, as well, intermingling with the assorted sordid relocated Anglos plus with their own dodgy epics. Feuding glassblower family the Segusos, tragic poet Mario Stefani, and the Fenice arson suspects all are skimmed by the spotlight - yet less brightly than the foreigners, showing less dimension.Regardless of that shortcoming, \\"Falling Angels\\" is a involving portrait of human nastiness in a beautiful but decaying place. I cannot attest to his depictions of Venice, not having been there, but accurate or not this tome allows me to feel as if I had."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt draws the reader in quickly, describing the night of the fire which destroyed Venice's prized opera house, La Fenice.

The new book fell from first place to last place on the NYT non-fiction list in just eight weeks, and that in the Christmas season.How come? Surely Venice is as interesting as Savannah, Georgia, not that Savannah lacks attractions. For one thing, Berendt never found the handle for \\"Angels,\\" never figured out how to weave the many strands of his story, from his chance discovery of the city's clandestine pigeon eradication program to its problems with the mafia, into a coherent narrative. What he ends up with seems more appropriate for an issue of, say \\"The New Yorker.\\" (Indeed, earlier in his career Berendt served as editor of \\"New York Magazine\\".)Start with the Talk of the Town, the short pieces that lead The New Yorker. Berendt's account of his short trip in Venice's oldest gondola, with uniformed gondoliers fore and aft, would make a splendid vignette. Ditto his account of a visit to Archimede Seguso's glass works where he observes the master create stunning vases. Begin the body of the magazine with his character sketches of Venice's glitterati and literati: Peggy Guggenhein for one of the former and Ezra Pound for one of the latter. He writes colorful portraits of both (and many others), although it is not clear that Berendt comes up with much that was not already well known. For example, the Guggenheim Collection garden where Ms. Guggenheim is buried with her pet dogs is a popular stop for American tourists. And the circuitous and controversy-plagued route by which Ezra Pound's papers ended up in the Yale University Library was well known by the time \\"Angels\\" appeared.Turn next to the occasional New Yorker feature, \\"Annals of Crime.\\" The backbone story line of \\"Angels\\" is the account of the fire that destroyed La Fenice, Venice's grand old opera house. Was the fire an accident? Or arson? The loss moved the people of Venice to grieve as deeply as the burning of Independence Hall would affect us. No sooner was La Fenice destroyed than the civic will to restore it set in motion the eight-year long project to do so. Out of the ashes arose many stories: the investigation to determine the cause of the fire; the influence pushing and pulling to determine who would win the restoration contract; the infighting for credit and opening night tickets among the cast of do-gooders who had a hand in the restoration.There's more, plenty for a cover to cover Venice issue of the magazine. But that, amply spiced with the delicious names he drops along the way, is what Berendt gives us in \\"Falling Angels.\\"End note. Thanks are due Jack and Lee Mortimer whose titles for their 1950's series of muckraking books, \\"Chicago Confidential,\\" \\"New York Confidential\\" and \\"Washington Confidential,\\" I borrowed for this review. By the way, Amazon currently lists new hard cover copies of \\"Angels\\" for $3.30 plus shipping."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If you have been to Venice, you will LOVE this book. You see yourself wandering the little streets and visiting the villas all over again. Great insight into the natives."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I found it hard to put this book down. It reads just like a compelling novel, complete with some fascinating characters. Lots of information about Venice, so it's like having a visit there. I might have wished for the section on Ezra Pound and his widow to be shorter, but even that was interesting. If you want to read two good books about Venice, try this one plus The World of Venice by Jan Morris, my all-time favorite Venice book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The book came recommended to me by another traveler, and because of an upcoming trip to Venice, I thought I'd get some help in better understanding the city on what would be my third visit. Instead, I found way too many profiles of Venetians who were either recognized celebrities or eccentrics. Frankly, half this many reports on people the author discovered would have been sufficient. After a while, it seemed Berendt was just trying to show off at being able to move among the locals. I would have preferred to read more about nonentities who make the unique city function."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is an enchanting set of observations about life in Venice at the turn of the millenium. Berendt wrote a brilliant story a few years ago about life in Savannah, and this book gives him another chance to spend time in an intentionally isolated community to chronicle their quirks and celebrate their uniqueness. He does a phenomenal job here, telling stories of high-society socialites, blue-collar electricians, lifelong scholars, artists who work in either glass or rat poison, and an unusual and lonely poet. The characters in the story really come alive as they allow Berendt behind their closed doors and onto their gondolas, and a reader will likely be tempted to plan a trip to Venice to meet them. As far as a structure, Berendt uses the fiery destruction of the Fenice opera house to guide his narrative, giving each character a chance to comment on the fire and what it means for Venice, and ending with a moving scene with everyone getting together once again at the scene of the fire. This book is informative and emotionally gripping, with textured heroes and villains slipping past each other for hundreds of pages, and I want to loan my copy to all of my friends."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I picked this book up somewhere as a vacation read without realizing it was nonfiction. I was a bit disappointed when I discovered this, but determined to read it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this nonfiction was an artful tale of events which occurred in Venice, ingeniously retold by the author. Berendt is a masterful storyteller, weaving his own observations of Venetians and real events into a complex tapestry of a city most outsiders aren't privy to. I thoroughly enjoyed Berendt's follow-up to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I read City of Falling Angels a few weeks before my wife and I took our first trip to Italy. I didn't have much time for detailed research about Venice, but I wanted to get a taste of the city's history and culture.I couldn't have found a more perfect book in Falling Angels. While Berendt's tale is ostensibly focused on the fire that burned down Venice's famous Fenice Opera House, the story turns quickly into multiple threads all orbiting around modern and historic Venice.Berendt lived in Venice and so can provide a peek into a Venetian's view of life and existence within this unique city, but he never becomes a true Venetian and so is able to retain objectivity and perspective.I visited Venice as a true tourist, but as someone who wanted to understand what Venice is really like (beyond its reputation as an Adult's Disney World), I felt that Falling Angels added wonderful flavor to my brief taste of the city.The book is well written, very readable and has a strong sense of drama throughout. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt, arrived in Venice in 1996 shortly after a fire had destroyed the city's famed Fenice Opera House. Berendt uses the symbolic fire, and the dubious circumstances surrounding it, as a jumping off point to explore the unique and strange world of Venetian culture. Berendt imbeds himself within high Venetian society, spending several years rubbing shoulders with the many wealthy American expatriates living in the city. In addition he spends time getting to know simple artisans, and the members of the intellectual community. What emerges from Berendt's narrative is a city cloaked in an enigma of deceit and duplicity. Venice is a city loosing ground to the rising sea water, all the while trying to prevent the loss of its identity to foreigners who; are paradoxically trying to \\"save the Venice\\".I enjoyed, The City of Falling Angels. Each chapter is a different vignette about life in this most unique city, ranging from the struggles of locals to hold on to their way of life and worrying about the future of their beloved city, to the absured scenes of Carnival. The book nicely weaves in the story of what becomes of the Fenice and what becomes an arson trial, into the larger story. The fire and arson are not so much a who - done - it, as much as a literary device becoming metaphor for the city itself.I have not read Berendt's more acclaimed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, so I don't have that to compare it to. However I picked up this book more as a sort of travel logue of Venice and found it to be a light read and good snap shot of the city."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Much in the style of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt has traveled to Venice and found the most unique and interesting people to write about. Once again, the book reads like fiction and the reader has to keep reminding himself that the events and people are real. It begins with the Fenice Opera House burning to the ground. Wild accusations abound as the Venitians try to ascertain whether the fire was accident or arson. Fingers are pointed at everyone including top level government officials. Amidst the fire investigation, there are parties, business deals, crimes, and even murder/suicides for the socialites to discuss and share their individual viewpoints. The writing makes the people and the city come alive with culture and fun. At times it is difficult to keep all of the characters straight, but overall an original insight into the city and it's people."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a lushly written love story to Venice. As someone who has been there in the dead of winter and experienced the confusion of streets, canals and bridges that Berendt writes about, I found it tremendously true to life.The characters that Berendt seeks out are nearly as amusing as the ones in \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good an Evil.\\" Especially amusing is the Dali-like artist who seems to revel in getting arrested. Yet, on a night in Carnavale, he can't get the policemen to take him in.There are many more like him, including a tragic poet who writes his suicide note all over town before hanging himself, a pair of Americans who square off to be the king of Venetian society, and a darling English/American couple who are never without an opinion about their adopted city.Unfortunately, the through-line that is the story of this book meanders too much to make this a riveting read. Although the book traces the fire at La Fenice Opera House and follows the investigation of whether this was arson or mere negligence, it goes off track too often. We never find out if the poor kids who were put in the slammer for arson really did do it, or were set up by rich and powerful agents. Most likely they were framed, but Berendt doesn't go to a lot of trouble to get to the bottom of the story, and this is where it falls down as a piece of journalism for me.It's lovely reading--and a must for Venice lovers--but essentially not captivating for those who want a point to it all."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS has it all. A mystery that needs to be solved, curious and eccentric characters and an odd sense of \\"been there done that.\\" Berendt basically uses the same method that was so successful in MIDNIGHT, and there is a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. But d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in and of itself does not have to be a bad thing. Berendt's style of investigation and reporting makes for an eminently readable book. The disastrous fire at the opera house in Venice is the starting point for Berendt's investigations and from there he finds a feuding family of glass blowers, an interesting take on extermination, and a look at the machinations of different people trying to gain, or regain, prestige, money or notoriety. Berendt's ability to encapsulate these diverse elements makes you forget that the central mystery pretty much becomes anticlimactic. THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS lacks the impact of GARDEN but Berendt's writing makes the trip to Venice worthwhile."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If you want to know what Venice is like, buy a Rick Steve's guide book or something, or better yet just go there for a few days. Having spent time in Venice, I can say that this book does a mediocre job at capturing the atmosphere. Perhaps it's not mediocre...perhaps it's simply twisted via the eyes of the writer. I'm not sure. Either way, this book feels like nothing more than name dropping and gossip. Few of the characters are particularly colorful. Most seem to be glib yet obviously less-than-fully-engaged Venetians (Venice is their humdrum life...you can almost sense them wondering \\"why is this silly American so interested in local gossip and a restoration project?\\", and he even irritated me as a reader on their behalf), as well as mind numbingly boring wealthy outsiders and transplants with waaaay too much time on their hands.In short, this book lacks direction, is gossipy in the worst way, and even worse the gossip is dry and pointless. It goes nowhere meaningful. It gives some background as to why many Venetians seem to roll their eyes at the mention of \\"Save Venice\\" and its ilk (which may well be doing more harm than good to Venice's future), but the tedium of the book is in no way worth it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I read a borrowed copy of this book. I enjoyed it so much I bought one and gave it to my surgeon son, who has no time to read, and insisted that he find the time to do so. He loved it also. Leave it to John Berendt to find the real characters that bring a city alive. He outdid himself with this one giving one of the most beautiful cities of the world a 'realness' that transcends the architecture and makes you realize that the history of a place comes from its people, really the ones who make it tick."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The Venetians hated it. Most critics hated it. I loved it! John Berendt's sophomore effort, The City of Falling Angels, is a great read. The reader gets to explore the back alleys--or canals--of Venice without having to make the trip or fight the tourists.The story begins with the author's arrival in the floating city three days after the famed Fenice Opera House is destroyed by fire in 1996. The night's events are pieced together by master glassblower Archimede Seguso's family that watches from their apartment window.Known as \\"The Wizard of Fire,\\" the 75-year-old Maestro Seguso would take to his workshop and recreate that awful night in more than a hundred intricately crafted glass vases that have yet to see the same light, years after the maestro's death, that the Fenice has enjoyed.The story chronicles the Fenice's history and rebirth and illuminates the politics, the pathos, and the pizzazz of Venice. The narrative takes many detours as it follows the eight-year restoration of the beloved opera house--such as the New York-based nonprofit Save Venice (which has its share of politics and backstabbing) and the American expatriates who have lived there.Palaces, paintings, and passion litter the story, which has a rough plot, but it is essentially about why the Fenice burned, who was responsible, and who should rebuild it.Like the winding canals, the story moves in many directions, sometimes hard to follow. Numerous characters share similar name spellings, leading to confusion. Many of the vignettes seem to have no relation to the Fenice--but ultimately do connect. My favorite is the love story of Ezra Pound and Olga Rudge, an illicit affair that lasted more than fifty years and resulted in an illegitimate daughter. Another favorite tells of the Curtises, seven generations of a family who once owned the Palazzo Barbaro and whose matriarch wore only white.Okay, so it wasn't Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil-- Berendt's first novel.Armchair Interviews says: Beredt took an extremely complex story, and in writing The City of Falling Angels, made it simple. Sort of."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Unlike a Point A to Point B expos&eacute; or novel, Mr. Berendt's latest book follows a serpentine path through an intriguing city, introducing the reader to the blue-blooded, the base-born, the brazen and the bizarre inhabitants of an enigmatic and complex city. At several points in this book, it is unclear where the author is going, but with such mesmerizing narration, the reader really doesn't care. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"As a resident of Georgia and an oft visitor to Savannah, it was likely that I would enjoy Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Much like the City of Falling Angels, it was filled with rich, flambouant characters that made Savannah come to life with charm and magic. Unfortunately, that's the end of superlatives for Mr. Berendt's new book. While there are many interesting characters in this book, there seems to be little to tie them to anything resembling a plot. And while many of these characters are mildly intriguing, the one unifying characteristic is a self-centered, egotistical undertone that reads more like the society magazine in any large U.S. city than remarkable writing. Certainly, most are rich, materialistic, and lack qualities that engage the typical reader.Having never been to Venice, I cannot tell you if this book qualifies as a good travel guide. Having little appreciation for Venician architecture or high society, I cannot tell you if this book serves any role as a society who's who, save to convince the reader that Berendt has indeed rubbed elbows with the upper crust of Italy and New York. But as a published writer and a voracious reader, I can tell you that The City of Falling Angels is a poor book. Although I'm now somewhat embarrased to admit it, the only reason I actually finished the book was to see if a plot ultimately materialized. It did not. Thankfully, I checked it out from the library... something I advise you not to do."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is no Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I found the book lacking a plot or specific story. It is an ok read but I felt letdown."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I really loved reading this book. I thought it was easy to follow but kept me guesing. I look foreward to the next book by Mr. Berendt."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Berendt has made an extremely readable book out of some Venetian shenanigans and doesn't hesitate to name names. I had hoped for more 'atmosphere' to balance the scandals but that is available in other books. There's a convincing sense of immediacy and vividness of the personalities, family feuds, social climbing, and rivalries which only an insider could judge as to accuracy (and they're not about to go on record) so we have yet another picture of Venice to add to our gallery--a good read but no substitute for a visit! Sean d'About Amen"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I should start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I visited the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston last summer at the time of the Gondola Days exhibit. I stepped off the street into a most nondescript building and landed in another place and time . . . Venice as it was in the 19th century. Thus my fascination with Venice began with Isabella Stewart Gardener herself, and led me to the many artists and writers of the era of the golden age of travel who spent time at Palazzo Barbaro, most particularly Henry James. (The Gardener Museum was modeled after Palazzo Barbaro owned by the Curtis family.) This past year I was completely immersed in Henry James as well as the works of contemporary authors, as I devoured nearly every written work I could find while simultaneously planning my first visit to Venezia.I was home for only a couple of months when I learned of Berendt's book The City of Falling Angels. My only disappointment was that it was not long enough. I was still yearning for more. This book introduced me to a part of Venice that I would otherwise have never known. I eagerly read every detail surrounding Palazzo Barbaro and the Curtis family, the Ezra Pound story with its parallels to The Aspern Papers, and was intrigued by Peggy Guggenheim's story as it played out in Venice, and so much more!I wanted to explain how I found my way to The City of Falling Angels hoping that knowing a little of my history and why I enjoyed the book would help others decide whether it would be of interest to them. The reviews of Falling Angels here on Amazon reminded me a great deal of the restaurant reviews I read on the bulletin boards while planning my trip. That is to say that the reviews themselves really mean little without knowing who is giving them."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I have been to Venice and I agree with John Berendt that the city holds interesting surprises for anyone who is willing to look beyond the trodden paths. I bought the book because I like novels that have a historical or real-world aspect and are not just pure fiction, but this book is not truly a novel. The plot is weak and the characters don't come across. Venice is beautifully described, but I had a hard time to read the book to the end."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Enough with the comparisons!

I recommend this to all that are truely in touch of their true spritual selfs."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"All Venice lovers will pick up this book as a must-read, but many will put it down with disappointment. The supposed theme is scandal and intrigue, beginning with the alleged arson at the opera house and trailing through a glass blower's family arguing about the business and a woman who is said to have tried to steal an archive and failed. None of it is very convincing; none of the accused have plausible motives; the sources seem random; some of the writing is piercingly shrill; and on the whole, who cares? For anyone interested in Venice, there are hundreds of books available, and this one ranks very near the bottom."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"My title says it all. Great writing. Clever dialogue. Nice descriptions of Venice. But there's no story in this book. Nothing to pull you forward other than a lukewarm \\"leitmotif\\" about the theater fire. Starkly different from \\"Midnight\\" because that book had a strong story that kept you turning pages -- with pleasure. When a movie bombs you tell friends, \\"Wait to see the DVD.\\" As for The City of Falling Angels, wait to check it out of the library."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"What a disappointment! Having pre-ordered this book months in advance, and waited keenly by the letterbox for it to arrive, I have to confess I was heartily disappointed. It lacks any recognizable plot and is wholly composed of uninteresting and fragmentary second-hand gossip.After waiting so long for a follow-up, I now wish Berendt had waited longer, and found something actually worth writing about. I understand he was under pressure from the publishers to produce something, and it certainly shows."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Brendt's \\"City of Falling Angels\\" is a MUST, MUST read - providing you appreciate Venezia - its wonderfully readable historic past along with its tourist-y, sinkin' in the lagoon present."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt paints another exquisite work of art. I hesitate to say a masterpiece because \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" continues to be his best book. But \\" The City of Falling Angels\\" is not even close to being some second rate effort by a worn out writer. Berendt's Venice is a wonderful textured canvas upon which he brushes and layers incredibly intriguing non-fiction characters. The stories of the Massimo Donadon and Mario Stefani are two of his finer tales of comedy and tragedy worthy of standing alone and there yet are so many more to fascinate the reader in this book. Berendt's obvious appreciation for and intimacy with Venice and the many connected to it by birth or self-adoption is very apparent and is a great example of book-length reporting that is increasingly absent today. The features of a map, glossary and other addendum reference material included in these pages are very considerate of readers' needs."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Having been one of the annoying tourists that swarm through St. Mark's and the Rialto, it was fascinating to gain an insider's perspective on a city that, at first, I had not found all that attractive. I thoroughly enjoyed the snapshots of the local color in Venice, particularly the Plant Man, whom I believe proves beyond dispute that fact can be stranger, and more entertaining, than fiction. A few of the snapshots overextend themselves, particularly the ones concerning the Curtises and Ezra Pound; however, Venice in the end won me over, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has any appreciation of history or culture."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like most of the people who has welcomed this new launch from Berendt considering the quality of his former work \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\", I started reading it with soaring expectations. Now that I have finished it, I can't say that he has disappointed me. It is true that it somewhat lacks the charm and the unsettling aura created by the first book that infiltrates the reader from page one, but it is still a very good non-fiction book which manages to be read as a competent novel.The book introduces the reader to some 50 real-world characters who currently reside in Venice and the quotidian life is depicted in a detailed fashion. It also reads as a travel book since most of the places of historical significance are mentioned with different contexts along with a nice map of the whole city which spans the inside of front cover and the adjacent page (the same map is replicated inside the back cover as well).The storyline is real as much as the characters are, and it is based on the 1996 fire which burned the Venice Opera House to the ground. The corresponding accounts of the international news agencies like CNN and Reuters are still available online, along with the resolution of the whodunit question. Even if you have read those before the book went to press, you might still find it as a nice thriller based on a real story."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I was looking forward to a great book about Venice, but it was such a disappointment. It was just chatter about nothing really important .... Gossip that didn;t really mean anything to the development of Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"As someone who has spent a fair amount of time in Venice, I was greatly distressed when the Fenice burned (I've stayed at the little hotel across the way and attended concerts at the theater). So I was eager to read Berendt's take on the fire and its aftermath. I agree with many other reviewers that the book is inconclusive, but I think that that's exactly his point -- it's typical of Venice that, in this as in so many other matters, there IS no definitive answer. The book meanders through a number of fascinating stories that are only tangentially related to the Fenice fire and the rebuilding of the hotel (the contentious internal politics within the Save Venice nonprofit, the tragic fate of the poet Stefani), but they give insight into the Venetian mind and way of operating; so when the investigation, and the bidding process for the rebuilding contract, take as many twists and turns as a Venetian alley, it's all part of a larger pattern. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to the city."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I hadn't read Berendt's prior book (Midnight in the Garden....) but rather pickedFalling Angels out of a mix of single books at a local bookstore because I love real stories about great cities and in this case it was about Venice. I've been to Venice a couple of times and hope to return. But that isn't why I picked this up. It's a good read about current history in a place where history - and tourism - dominates. The stories of the people trying to \\"save\\" Venice bring into focus that no City can be truly understood separate from the people who live there - while the people who live there don't always wish to understand that Venice also needs saving because of the people who live there."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"My family is originally from Venice, so my Mother and I both read City of Falling Angels with particular interest and we could not be more delighted. Each page is a gem of compelling prose and drama like only Berendt can deliver. Who would have thought he could have topped Midnight? This isn't a travel guide to Venice, it is a ticket to the true interior of the city's social elite and most entertaining (and, in some cases, despicable) characters. I'm buying copies for everyone on my Christmas list and I only hope I don't have to wait another decade for Berendt's next. This is a book that is highly entertaining, refreshingly literate and just plain fun to read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"It provided a good insight into Venice. Wish I had read it before we went. Places would have meant more."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I never progressed beyond the first CD. I had checked this book out from a local library and unfortunately lost it. I bought this copy to replace the library copy. It was considerably less expensive than paying the library for the lost audio book. The library also preferred this method since fines go into the general city fund, not directly to the library. They have a replacement and I saved money so, despite disliking the book, I gave it three stars."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I found it hard to get into but now am finding it hard to put down. Traveling to Italy and particularly Venice so wanted to get a feel for the city which this book does give you enough information for that. . Can't believe there are not cars there and the water is all around. Can't wait to get a feel of the city for myself in a few months."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Two may be a small sample size to make a fair generalization but I sense a pattern to Berendt's books. First, find a city with character, whether by accident or design. In very different ways and for vastly different reasons Savannah, GA and Venice both certainly fit that first requirement. Any place with character has its fair share of characters (of the human variety) and so, the second thing to do then, is to find them, talk to them and get to know their stories. For Berendt, a career writer and editor, that would be second nature. Finally, loosely weave the personalities and stories you find around some central event that is/was important to the city. In Savannah it was a murder and its aftermath. In Venice it was a murder (maybe?) of a different sort. Fire - negligence or arson the jury is still sort of out - was the form this murder took and the victim was La Fenice, Venice's opera house. Voila! you have an interesting mosaic of vignettes and profiles that makes for a charming & quirky book.Berendt pulled it off both times, I think. I have visited both cities more than once, but in both cases before reading his books about them. I think I would enjoy going back with his book in hand (disguised in my Kindle no one need ever know!) and scope out some of the locations he's mentioned. Then maybe one day I can write a following in his footsteps sort of book.Interestingly - and here I take off on a Berendt-esque tangent - one factoid the author didn't mention in his book or if he did I missed it, was the metaphoric significance of La Fenice's name. Fenice is Italian (unlike Venice which isn't but is rather the Anglicization of Venezia)... but I digress again. Fenice means phoenix, that legendary bird which dies by fire and is reborn time and again from its own ashes - and how apropos is that for this opera house which has been resurrected from it ashes more than once in its history?"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book was a great disappointment. Though the center of the book is supposed to be the burning of La Fenice, this narrative lacks a focus. There are many fascinating bits of information here but the book sometimes feels like an overly long magazine piece. For a real feeling of Venice read the crime novels of Donna Leon. The first in her series is \\"Death at La Fenice.\\""},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like many who fell under the spell of John Berendt's MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, I eagerly awaited his new work. But in my case this anticipation was tinged with fear. I have spent considerable time in Venice. I know the city: besides, so many brilliant men and women have already written about the world's most beautiful city and its denizens. Will Berendt say something new?The answer is yes. It was a joy not to be disappointed.I began reading THE CITY OF FALLEN ANGELS by laughing out loud at porn star Cicciolina's Lady Godiva performance and the subsequent trial (reading it in bed, I woke up my husband to read it aloud to him).But then I discovered that the real pornography, as Berendt tells it brilliantly, is the tale of the genteel fleecing of Ezra Pound's widow Olga Rudge by a devious and socially ambitious American.It is a further plus that Berendt can also be delicate and moving, as in his recounting of the life of Olga's daughter with Pound.Finally, the book deals with important issues. It explores and shows the real, subtle and ambiguous Italy-the Italy I've lived in for forty years and often find too hard to bother describing. I'm glad John Berendt did it for all of us. A simply wonderful book, a fine work of sophisticated writing."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I'm giving this one star because the electronic edition costs more than the paperback print edition. This is ridiculous as what does it really cost the publisher to sell an electronic edition of a book? I imagine it costs them nothing once it's converted. . ."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a marshmallow of a book. It offers up a mystery, which is not compelling, designed only to introduce a string of characters who offer up their weary view of modern Venice. Yet, the book is a fun read in the mold of the travel writing of Paul Theroux. Berendt's Venice is a city of \\"Falling Angels\\", this taken from sign in Harry's Bar warning customers that Angel statues on rooftops have been know to fall, so beware. I found Venice to be an historic Disneyland in my sole three day visit to Venice in 1998. It is most all things, beautiful, unique, crowded and overpowered by tourists by day, magical by night and quite and relaxed at sunrise. Berendt's focuses his narrative on the quite and relaxed side of Venice. He states this is because the residences live by the rhythm of the sea, not the wheel.Berendt moves to Venice in 1998 looking for a story (his next book) and he discovers the burning of the local Opera house which becomes his \\"hook\\". But it's only a \\"hook\\" which allows him to introduce us to a great cast of characters, a charming set of everyday heroes and rouges who have some interesting and enjoyable stories. Characters who live for Venice its art and architecture and those who use it for social status and personal gain.As a reader you can, if you like, sit in an easy chair next to a nice fire and transport yourself vicariously to these Venice neighborhoods. Not a compelling read, but a warm sentimental read with all the twists and turns human nature can provide. (Interesting to note that one of the facts you will learn is from the \\"Rat Man\\" who knows how to formulize rat poisons for world wide distribution. Another a sad and lonely poet who kills himself leaving behind several mystery will and controversy. And then there is the wonderful power struggle of the New York based \\"Save Venice\\" group. Not to forget the glass blower who witnesses the fire and creates magnificent new art works as a result.)I might add in closing that this book was recommended to me by a friend whom my wife and I visited Venice with in 1998. Otherwise I doubt I would have read it, since I really disliked Berendt's earlier book, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\"."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"How do you top a book like MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL?You spend 10 years looking for another project as compelling as the characters in Savannah, Georgia, even if it means traveling 1/2 way around the planet.I usually read a book a night, but not this time. I took one chapter each evening and savored each thread of Berendt's Venetian tapesty, never wanting the stories to end.How he can make disparate tales of a burned out opera house, an ancient glassblower, Peggy Guggenheim, Ezra Pound, some blood-sucking leeches, a gay poet and the Save Venice Foundation infighting come together is just another demonstration of his genuis for seeing how they all fit into the \\"big picture.\\"Kudos to Berendt.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I picked this book up hoping to bring back memories of my recent trip to Venice, Italy. On some levels it did and on a few it disappointed.John Berendt nicely delves into conflicts that have shaped Venice for the past 100 years. There are a lot of colorful and interesting characters in this book which make it an enjoyable read. There are however, a few speed bumps. While the influence of Ezra Pound on the literary community is unquestionable, the detail at which it is addressed is almost unbearable. The chapter it consumes drags on for 50 pages and explains nothing more than the rude deception exhibited by two American expatriates. I think this chapter should have been shortened and been more concise with its detail.Other than that I found that the book did help me remember one of my favorite European cities. The book is not a fast read since it is not plot driven. It is a string of events that are observed by an outsider of the commmunity. A nice read I would recommend to anyone interested in modern Venetian history."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book was a rare insight into the people of Venice. Berendt describes ancestoral history, architecture of many of the buildings, famous books written in Venice or that take place in Venice, and the politics of Venice. His narrative is fascinating, and the book reminded me in many ways of George Plimpton's Capote biography. I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"\\"Anyone who loves Venice, is a true Venetian... even a tourist, but only if the tourist stays long enough to appreciate the city.\\"So says Mario Stefani, one of the myriad of characters that populate John Berendt's latest book. If he is correct, then, John Berendt must be a true Venetian. Berednt spent years in \\"La Serenissima,\\" investigating the occurence of the fire that burned the Fenice theatre on January 29, 1996. His investigation takes him to a variety of places, exploring Venetian culture and history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.The book meanders; often one wonders, \\"what does Henry James have to do with the burning of the Fenice?\\" But the characters are intriguing. John Berendt has a gift for observing and describing people, and he does this to perfection in The City of Falling Angels.There are the two ex-presidents of the Save Venice Foundation, dedicated to the saving of Venice as well as a petty quarrel over the running of the foundation; a glassblower whose family has been in the business for centuries; the so-called Rat Man, who has invented a fool-proof recipe for killing rats; the First Family of American ex-patriots, the Cabots, who have been living in the same palazzo since the 1880s; electricians; politicians; mafiosi; lawyers; and many more.John Berendt interviewed scores of people, getting the story from several different viewpoints. Its difficult to realize, sometimes, that this is a work of nonfiction. All these people are (or were) real; Berendt proves that sometimes real people are more interesting than those who are created in the imagination."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt creates an intimate, and yet panoramic, view of Venice in his book \\"The City of Falling Angels.\\" Using his unique abilities as confidant, historian, gossip and investigator, Berendt again elucidates a culture full of intrigue, romance and outlandish schemes.Following the wisps of smoke from the burning Fenice Opera House, Berendt introduces us to a cast of characters so unique they might fit into the society of Savannah, Georgia. From the creators of beautiful glass works to the intricacies of Venice politics, Berendt blends a book both beautiful and grotesque, secretive and seductive.Americans are depicted as either lost in Venice (even while donating money for the upkeep of Venice's treasures) or as scoundrels, plotting behind the scenes to ingratiate themselves with money and power. Venetians, meanwhile, seem divided into three groups: the elite who do nothing but go to parties and mooch, hard-working artisans who create works of beauty, and the evil power brokers, working behind the scenes to rip off all the money.Readers who appreciate mystery will find enough surprises to captivate their imaginations. Art lovers will alternately sigh with love and moan with trepidation as Venice blithely takes its beauty for granted, claiming to know that some day, somehow, the art and the city will stay afloat.Larry Rochelle, Author of BLUE ICE, GULF GHOST, BOURBON AND BLISS, DUST DEVILS and DEATH AND DEVOTION."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"?When the Washington Post named The City of Falling Angels one of the 15 Best Books of 2005, I bought it and read it right away. I loved it, just as I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The writing is superb--smooth, and clear. The characters are bizarre and wonderful, and the story moves through all level of Venetian society, high and low.I got hooked from the very first chapter, which is about a spectacular fire that destroys the Fenice opera house and nearly takes the rest of Venice with it. You see the fire close up, through the eyes of the people who were there, in particular the master glassblower of Venice, Archimede Seguso by name, who watches the fire from his bedroom window (30 feet away from the blaze) and then goes to his glassworks the next day and turns out a series of beautiful bowls and vases based on the fire itself. This is typical of John Berendt's genius: his view of the fire is surely like no other reporter's. Somehow he finds this 87-year old glassblower, who's known in Venice as \\"The Wizard of Fire,\\" and by focusing on him, Berendt turns the Fenice fire into a uniquely Venetian symbol, almost an allegory.Then he moves on to the investigation of the fire (it turns out to have arson), to the wonderful Rat Man of Treviso, to the man of a dozen uniforms, to the Plant Man, the criminal investigation of the fire, the corruption, the backstabbing, the swindles and a mysterious death. Berendt takes you well beyond the beautiful facades of Venice into the private homes and lives of the people who live there.Just as he was in Midnight, Berendt is in this book too an urbane and ingratiating guide, one who knows how to ferret out memorable characters and meaningful stories (all of them real, apparently). And he is, as before, a hugely gifted story teller."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt has accomplished the impossible: he has made Venice duller than Savannah! As a matron in Midnight replied when asked if she traveled much: we Savanahians don't travel much, we have everything heah!Berendt has managed to make Savannah, its history, its excentric residents, its mores, much more interesting than the dull citizens of Venice and the American expatriates who populate it in order to save it from floods and historic neglect. The story of the fire is not as interesting as Jim Williams and his gay life of secret pleasures. Nor is the gay and erotic poet who is found hanged in Venice as interesting as Danny Hansford.When I had heard some years ago that Berendt was planning another novel about an old city I expected it to be Mobile or Charleston where he could perhaps have found another Savannah. He choose instead a European city, like any midwestern tourist with tennis shoes. This book is a bore and it took me over a month to get up enough energy to read it to the end.The conclusion: Berendt's stiking it rich with Savannah was entirely a fluke. I don't think there will be a third novel. It would already be discounted over 50%, now that the one on Venice can be bought for 40% less everywhere."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I spent many years in Venice in the past and know or have met many of the people mentioned in this book. Still, it seems Berendt wants to drop the names of all the \\"important\\" people he met. Also, there is no need for the lengthy, gossipy, and boring story of the initiatives to save Venice. The petty, petulant, catty, backbiting Americans involved in those initiatives are nothing short of disgusting - perhaps even controproducente to an otherwise worthy effort. The account of the Pound family's vicissitudes seems an invasion of their privacy. And the most unfortunate couple using the Guggenheim collection as their selfish social launching pad is disgusting. There is so much more to contemporary Venice than Berendt put into this lengthy and trashy volume of gossip. Would that he had limited himself to the events connected with the burning and reconstruction of La Fenice. There is nothing resembling an account of why the youth of the city - for want of employment opportunies - have to leave it. Those are other falling angels, not to mention the extremely high cost of living produced by all the logistical difficulties of supplying the Serenissima's daily needs!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" several years ago, so when I saw this book, I got pretty excited. It definitely met my expectations. Berendt does an excellent job of bringing Venice to life. I love his portrayal of all of the different types of people that make up a city like Venice. I also like the way he takes an event in a city - in this case, the burning of the Fenice in 1996 - and uses it as a backdrop of a larger story of the city as a whole.I also enjoyed Berendt's research into the Venice of Henry James, Ezra Pound, and Robert Browning, as well as the lines drawn in Venetian society between native and non-native residents. Overall, this was a really intersting story!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"In keeping with his exploration of Savannah in \\"Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil,\\" John Berendt sets his sights on the mysterious community of Venice.In a timeline bracketed by the destructive fire that destroys the Fenice Opera House and its eventual reconstruction, Berendt leads us into to the labyrinthine culture, characters and life that is Venice.Unlike the trial in \\"Midnight\\" the Fenice story is more of an excuse to begin and end the story of Venice than an engrossing item in and of itself. Berendt is at his best when he is exploring the side threads that arise, such as the glassblowing master Seguso family and the last years of Olga Rudge, the mistress of the great Ezra Pound. The threads are loosely connected as I mentioned and could almost be a series of short stories instead. Regardless they gave a depth and appreciation to the life of the city and its culture.The strength of \\"The City Of Falling Angels\\" is the ability of Berendt to bring these characters of Venice and the city itself to life. If you want to explore the characters of one of the world's most unique cities, by all means pick this book up."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt's The City Of Falling Angels also receives the author's own reading as it tells of a fire which destroys one of Verdi's opera houses in 1996. Arson might be the cause, and thus the author investigates the story to find the 'real Venice' behind a mask of riddles and images. Any with an interest in Venice will find The City Of Falling Angels absorbing - and it, too, includes an exclusive interview with the author as an audio bonus."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The true story of the Fenice cannot be told any better or convincingly. Having arrived in Venice the year the Fenice burned, I am aware of all the conflicting reports of the fire, the importance of the theater itself and of the obsfucation of facts that was promoted by authorities and the press. I could not put the book down as it gives a remarkably concise picture of Venice and the expatriate community that lives on the islands. This fascinating reading is very easy to relate to the mystic of Venice and makes one yearn to return."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Short and to the point--John Berendt is able to capture you from the first pages of this book to the point that you are unwilling to put it down...that is the mark of an excellent writer. He is also able to weave a captivating tale that blends aspects of history and mystery while enchantingly describing the city of Venice. Simply put this book presents a beautiful city, the tragic destruction of it's landmark opera house, and the subsequent arson trial in a way that only this author can do justice. What an excellent read!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Rather tedious reading. After an excellent beginning, I expected intrigue on the investigation of the fire. I finally quit reading and still do not know how the fire started."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I got this book because I liked Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. This book should have been titled \\"What I did on my vacation in Venice\\". I have a rule to give up on a book after 100 pages but I broke my own rule because I kept thinking the book was going somewhere. It wasn't. It was like Midnight in that it gave you lots of side events in Venice but in Midnight there was an overarching crime. There was an attempt in this book to make the burning of the Fenice Opera House a similar overarching theme but it really wasn't nearly as interesting. I should have given up after 100 pages............"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The City of Falling Angeles, by John Berendt, is a collection of impressions and interviews with the elite of Venice, loosely organized around the investigation into the fire that burned down Venice's opera house.Berendt talks with the investigators, lawyers, and suspects, as well as many other people who have an opinion on why the Fenice burned and who was behind it. Along the way, we learn what it is like to live in Venice today, and meet the elite, from Venetian royalty, to Murano glass artists, to the descendents of Byron and Pound, to the noveau-rich entrepreneur of rat poisons, and learn of the simmering feuds and jealousies between them.Though marketed as an investigation of the Fenice fire, the book is much more a leisurely stroll through the upper crust of Venice society. The personalities are interesting, the observations insightful, the writing smooth, and the book hard to put down.I highly recommend this book for anyone, and only wished I had read it before my short trip to Venice as it would have helped me appreciate the city."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A great read about Venice and its inhabitants and culture. The book is centered on the fire at the Fenice opera house in the 90's, but that is more or less for structure; it's about much more than the fire. This is a must read for anyone traveling to Venice!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"It's inevitable that readers of Midnight will have high expectations for Berendt's latest, and I, too, wanted to be charmed when I began Angels. Berendt failed to fire my interest in the first chapters, but I continued on and after plowing ahead found myself fully engrossed. I was rewarded for my perseverence.Berendt has managed to write vignettes that fall together in a theme of decadance amid beauty. Angels falling, indeed. An arrogant people resting on very old laurels, the world's most beautiful city requiring a league of wealthy New Yorkers for its preservation, and no particular thrust by its citizenry to rise up from the muck into which it's been sinking for centuries.There are juicy scandals. bits of glamor and frivolity, and sad glimpses of a city that is falling apart in more ways than the physical. The place is a fascinating mess. That's Venice: an agonizingly proud and crippled city held up only by its glorious past which remains in full evidence to its many visitors.Berendt makes a textual thread of the tale of the fire at the Fenice Theatre and the legal machinations to find blame, but it's more a book of short works that would stand alone. As such, it sits well with everyone's favorite works about Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a thorough, fascinating view into the world of Venice. If you've been there, it comes to life through the people and history Berendt describes. If not, still a great story filled with interesting characters."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The best part about \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" are the appendices at the back - a glossary of vocabulary words, a listing of people and places with descriptions. I wish I would have seen this when I started the book because it would have helped keep the many many many storylines straight.I thought the book would have been better if it either had fewer storylines and developed the story, or had as many as it did but added to the storyline. For example, the Murano glass family feud was mentioned, but did not tell more about the outcome until the second to last page.I am not a huge non-fiction reader, but since I was going to Italy, I thought this would be good. For that reason, I enjoyed the book. However, if I was just wanting to read about Venice, this was too gossipy and started a particular storyline and then dropped it, making you wonder whatever happened."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt has once again written an outstanding book about one of the most fascinating cities in the world, in this case Venice. The richly detailed writing makes you want to visit the city. It also provides an illuminating look at the strange Italian system of justice.As with his earlier Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Berendt provides the reader with a good sense of what kind of place the city is. This time, instead of a murder, the central narrative of the book is an opera house. Strange as it may sound, this actually holds the reader's interest.All in all, a most outstanding work."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I couldn't help but compare it to \\"Midnight\\" which is one of my favorite books. That may be unfair to this book, though, which is enjoyable in its own way. Two stories in this book stand out to me. First, the story of Olga Rudge, of which I was completely unaware. It was thoroughly fascinating to read about this woman and the battle over her letters to Ezra Pound. Now I want to read more about her. I also enjoyed the story of Palazzo Barbaro, a beautiful palazzo that I have photos of from my trip to Venice. The Curtis family story was very compelling. To be honest, I only skimmed the parts about the Fenice. It just didn't grip me."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I waited a long time for John Berendt to write another book. When I saw this book at the store I bought it immediately. It is such good reading that everytime I read a page I was upset that now that page was read and I was that much closer to being finished. I wish he would write many more of these true crime books. Two is not enough. Savannah is on my list of places to visit now and although I have been to Venice many times I am now looking forward to going again with a different insight."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Early in the book John Berendt restates what others have said before: everything worth writing about Venice has already been written. He decides to focus on the people of Venice instead. He has obviously spent a lot of time interviewing Venetian high society and going through newspaper accounts of recent events. Obviously a lot of effort went into this, but the result is a book packed with hearsay about the sordid little squabbles of rich and snobbish Venetians. I did not find any of this particularly interesting. Anachronistically, one vendor of potted plants also somehow made it into the book, albeit only for a few paragraphs. From the beginning the book sounded like an infomercial, but I like travel writing and would not have objected to this, because Venice is a fascinating city. I was put me off by the pervasive elitism and the focus on the super-rich. This is a book ABOUT socialites happy to spend several thousand dollars on a gala reception or an exclusive package tour, and on balance, it may be a book FOR them as well."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I recently picked up City of Falling Angels since I enjoyed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil so much. I was extremely disappointed. In fact, I went back and re-read Midnight to make sure it was as good as I originally thought it was (and, in fact, I enjoyed it more this time around). Maybe it's unfair to compare the two books, but this book probably wouldn't be getting so much acclaim and I wouldn't be reading it without Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (deservedly) paving the way to Berendt's notoriety.Part of Midnight's appeal was the covert (and sometimes overt) negative undertones of the city. The way you felt every story was exaggerated, but could have happened. When in the first couple of pages, one of the characters in Venice came right out and said Venetians lie all the time, I was taken aback. That right there destroyed the subtlety and the fine balance between frivolous and malicious.Plus the characters were just pretty boring, and Berendt's wonderful descriptions and anecdotes used in Midnight were MIA or couldn't save the characters. I don't have the book in front of me, and I can hardly remember any of the characters. They didn't seem to have the mischevious sparkle or quaint tarnish Savannah socialites had. I'm sure it must be hard to live up to the bar previously set by Midnight, but that's what happens when you write such a great book!City of Falling Angels seemed to play it safe. All of the characters were pretty middle-of-the-road. No one seemed especially heinous or very funny at all (though I did enjoy the desriptions of the Carnival costumes). This book, to me, was just sort of blah..."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Compared to his first book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, this book disappointed me. The story is totally lacking in tension and overall the tone and theme seem a bit pretentious to me, with all the talk of Venetian doges and wealthy ex-patriates living in palazzos. I found it difficult to enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Seems that is what John Berendt has proven to be. (Although Margaret MitchellGone with the Winddidn't do too badly writing only one book; nor Harper Lee!To Kill a Mockingbird)I really enjoyed Berendt's first,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Eviland hoped The City of Falling Angels would be as good. Unfortunately, his portrayal of the people of Venice isn't nearly as interesting as his of Savannah, and the book never takes off.Revisit Midnight - a much better use of your time!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"(I wrote this before I read Ramesh Gobal's review below. I guess I'm not alone in my displeasure.)I wanted to like this book. I'm going to Venice for the second time this September and was itching to get in the mood, learn about the Fenice fire. When I took it out of the library, the congenitally nice and modest librarian whispered, \\"It's gossipy.\\"Early on Berendt says he wants to stay in Venice to get to know the people who live there. Hopeful note, that. And I appreciated the description of the fire through eyes of locals. But as things moved along, it turned out most of the people he wrote about were aristocrats or nobility with long, complicated histories behind their current ownership of this palazzo, that museum, or the famous glass factory and such. His ease of access to these people puzzled me, making me wonder how he introduced himself to this succession of notaries that they so happily granted him interviews.I sadly got bored last night about halfway through and put it down. There wasn't enough in his interaction with these people or his feelings about them to make me care about them and keep me engaged. Felt more like dispassionate, well-researched name dropping. Or, I suppose you could call it gossip. For those who like this sort of thing, enjoy. It just didn't float my boat. Or gondola, as the case may be."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The format for MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL was so inventive that I looked forward to more of the same with this book, set in the environment that is uniquely Venice. Although many of the story lines were intriguing in and of themselves, it just did not come together for me, and on the whole I was disappointed. He is a good writer, so it was not a waste of time, but it isn't a book I feel I can recommend to others."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I mean, he really likes rich people. But the rich people he likes seem like a very dull, trivial, and empty headed lot: petty, gossipy, pretentious and conniving. I haven't finished the book--I'm deep in the section on Ezra pound's widow. But there's no sense of Ezra Pound's poetry in it, no sense of how Venice might have exerted an effect on the poetry; similarly, there's little or no sense of the magnitude of Pound's support for fascism or his antisemitism. You'd never really know what \\"fascism\\" is or was from this book, except that during WWII it seems to have inconvenienced some of the idle rich to the extent that they had to live in different houses. He seems to think Pound was important not because of the intellectual force of his poetry, or because of his treason, but because rich people think he's important.It's not only about rich people--there's a glassblower you kind of want to know more about. But the way he depicts his hosts, especially the midwestern American husband who has cultivated a fake British accent--is fawning. These people seem neither particularly intelligent nor particularly useful to the world, but he fawns on them, as far as I can tell because they have money and live in an old palace in Venice.Don't get me wrong--I've got nothing against rich people. I'd like to be rich. But if you've got nothing going on as a person than being rich, as so many of the people here seem to, then the just turns into a boring catalogue of the stuff they've got, which is mostly what we have here.He's a good writer, and it's a shame he's devoting himself to triviality"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The book is full of factual mistakes, wanton character assassination and sweeping generalizations but possibly because of these very reasons it is fairly entertaining.The best aspect for Venetians is the way John Berendt 'orientalizes' us by extrapolating general statements from the character of the mostly eccentric people whom he met while in the city. By reading this book you are left with the impression that aristocrats still count for something in Venice and that the expatriate community has a disproportionate saying in the way things are run. We are actually ruled, for better or for worse, by leftwing politicians and the Venetian professional bourgeoisie has very little in common with the few titled families still around.This said, the book is very well written even if it is definitely meandering. John Berendt is extremely good at characterization as he demonstrated in his previous work \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\". His choice of using real names, though, is deeply unjust. The people he slanders are left with no right of reply.I will be using it as a teaching tool so that my students will be able to understand directly what it means to be 'orientalized'. A process that is a lot easier to grasp when it is performed at your own expense as opposed to when it is carried out on faraway peoples."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Let's start with a disclaimer: I LOVE Venice. It is a beautiful, interesting, romantic city. If I could, I'd return to visit regularly. Berendt has done a wonderful job capturing the spirit of Venice and its people. While this book is nominally about the burning of the Fenice Opera House and the subsequent investigation and reconstruction, these events really just serve as framework around which a colorful exploration of the city in which it is built. The book is a series of chapter-long asides that delve into the colorful characters that inhabit Venice and make it such a interesting place. These asides weave these gossipy stories together with the vast history and iconic architecture of Venice to provide an amazingly intimate glimpse into the Venice that few tourists ever get to see. This is the next best thing to visiting Venice itself."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The premise of the book is good. But - Berendt fails to pull off the the connecting of rich characters around a central theme he did so successfully with Midnight. The book lacks continuity and lacks a beginning a middle and an end. One gets the impression that he took the template of Midnight and trys to fit Angels within the same format. He does not pull it off. The book is not quite a travel log, it's not quite a mystery and it fails to demonstrate investigative prowess. I was suspect of his ability to get the provincial Venitians to bare their souls to him. The book ends with a thud. If you start it and think it is worth sticking with against the hope that he pulls it all together with a climactic ending, you'll be disapponted ."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"After Berendt's \\"Midnight\\" I was looking forward to reading this book. After Berendt's \\"City\\" I will hesitate before picking up his next effort.The book started with great promise. Once again, Berendt found unique and eccentric characters in a unique and eccentric city. He centered those character portrayals around the burning of the opera house. His character portrayals are extremely good and, like so many times in \\"Midnight\\" out loud laughter was possible.However, after the first quarter to a third, Mr. Berendt seemed to have run out of eccentrics (with one exception near the end of the book) and the fire story lost all steam. From there on, the book turned into a Venetian gossip column that chronicled the rival factions in American philanthropic groups. There was little that was interesting. The characters were mundane and amazingly, the accounts of Venice were lackluster.I think the major shortfall was that Mr. Berendt tried to elicit the outrageousness that worked so well in \\"Midnight\\" from a cast of characters that just did not have it in them.Possibly, if a reader is a lover of Venice, this book would be recommended. Otherwise, it is just plain tedious."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a book on Venice like no other. Rather than writing about those people who pass through Venice, Berendt decides instead to write about those people - Venetians, and American expatriots - who reside there permanently. These full-time residents we are introduced to are not the sort the casual visitor might meet. Instead we allowed to mingle with Counts and Countesses, and with the ultra-rich, many of whom own beautiful palazzos facing the canals. Berendt manages to work his way into the lives of these people and uncover some interesting stories. Take for example the story of the Marchesa who fell into a window and had a piece of glass slice through her face. Sitting there with blood gushing out of a gaping wound on her face, she yells for someone to call... her plastic surgeon. There were stories of power struggles, social climbing, and the childish antics of some of the wealthy. We also meet artists, poets, architects and ordinary families.The thread that weaves all these personalities together is, of course, the fire at the Gran Teatro La Fenice. Berendt does a great job of following the investigation into the blaze - an investigation with all the twists and turns of a good detective novel. I never read \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" so I can't compare the two. All I can say is that this is a fascinating, well-crafted look at Venice. And it is unlike anything else you have ever read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I didn't expect \\"Falling Angels\\" to live up to \\"Midnight\\" and it didn't. I read \\"Midnight\\" in two days, I couldn't put it down. It took me over a week to read \\"Falling Angels\\" because so much of the book just drags. Some of the characters and their stories, such as the family of glass blowers, were wonderful. I would have loved to have seen pictures of some of the pieces of Murano glass depicting the La Fenice fire. But other parts were a waste - for example, there are a few encounters with one of the residents who has a collection of uniforms that he wears for various occasions. Berendt meets him a few times, and then he just disappears from the story.And all the drivel about Save Venice - what a waste! Venice is sinking, the canals are rising, and all of the artifacts are decaying, but neither the Italian government or the Venetian city officials seem to care about preserving Venice. So a bunch of rich Americans decide to pour money into the city, just so they can be invited to parties and have cocktails with minor European nobility and Venetian \\"aristocrats.\\" Makes me wonder how much any of those people give to feed the hungry in this country, save homeless animals, or help the people whose lives were devastated by hurricanes earlier this year. I volunteer with Golden Retriever rescue in Chicago, and we could sure use a percentage of the millions that Save Venice throws away in Venice.If you want to read about Venice, read one of Donna Leon's excellent mysteries set in the city. If you want to read some excellent nonfiction, read \\"Shadow Divers\\" by Robert Kurson."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Extaordinary trip through Venice (without an orange flag). Mr Berendt places the reader in the most fascinating places in Venice, and provides a serious look at some of its' most interesting residents. Not a \\"tell all\\" but a \\"tell\\". I liked this book so much I have read it twice. EFS"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Berendt's book has a lot of similarities to his previous one in which he finds a boutique town and brings out the quirky characters or characteristics of the town. Essentially, he stuck with what he does best and did not go in a new direction. Don't look for anything unpredictable here. The writing and editing are excellent, as usual, and this makes the reading worthwhile even though the book isn't as comical or dramatic as Midnight. It would be hard to write a book as good as Midnight. Falling Angels is different from Midnight in that the book covers a lot of complex conflicts between family, friends, and peers over property, legacies, and recognition.The book covers the lives of the upper class much more than Midnight. A reader not of this class may feel some hostility, alienation and distance from these people. It's a book for the palace and gardens set, Boston Blueblood expatriates, business barons, (North) Eastern Establishment, royalty, and lovers of upper class Northern authors such as Henry James. It's always nice to know how \\"the top five percent\\" lives.But Berendt's coverage of the Rat Man's stories about his business and how those crazy Greens don't want any of those filthy pigeons killed made me chuckle over its earthy humor.The story also contains a trial like Midnight, a \\"whodunit\\" in which no one ever quite finds out who did it. This time the crime is an Opera House arson and I didn't get wrapped up into as much as the murder trial in Midnight.The book has an older homosexual picking up cash-starved youths for sex which is a similar situation to the Midnight story. This time the community didn't seem to mind as much about the man's private activities because they let him teach their young men.The book reads slowly and is best read a little at a time; it's not as immediately gratifying as Midnight. It is different in that sense, and maybe not necessarily inferior.Berendt gives the reader the ambiance of Venice, which is subtle and Byzantine in its complexities, especially regarding its bureaucracies. They love to take bribes and don't get things done on time. The Yankees who want to save Venice's monuments and art can't understand why it takes so long to get things done and how you can't just aggressively and directly tell the Venetians what the yanks would like done with their donations. One discontented Venetian makes an amusing comment how foreigners always want to save Venice. Why can't they just come and have a good time? They never have the same reaction to Paris, saying they want to \\"save Paris\\".These Committees to Save Venice also have their troubles over class issues, splintering into the merely successful, the working rich, the non-working rich, and royalty. Some people come to the conclusion that it's rather uncouth to be rubbing elbows so closely with people who aren't their kind, meaning that they don't understand their culture. The lesser rich are seen as vulgar and pushy, and the non-working rich and royalty are seen as snobby, lazy, excessively demanding, and more interested in being seen at the party than actually helping the cause.Regarding the arson, some electricians are eventually convicted for the crime, but there is some suspicion that the mafia had hired them to burn it down, but there wasn't enough evidence to convict the mafia. As is often the case, it is usually the underlings who get convicted and the people giving the orders do not get convicted.Other shady characters were the young social climbers that befriend prominent older people that are in failing health. They will do anything for them, but they do eventually end up owning their estate after they die. This account of a woman cordially taking advantage of someone successful reminded me of the movie All About Eve. The woman was the leader in crime in Falling Angels.Venice has some democratic elements mixed in with its aristocratic ones. On the one hand, a socialite mentions that he hates democracy in an affable manner. On the other hand, a citizen comments that, to the Venetians, even the baker is part of the Venetian family, whereas his English parents regard him as merely the baker."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"It just didn't do it for me. Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading. But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story. He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.Good writing? Yes. Interesting characters? Somewhat. Compelling plot? No.Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers. Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with. Maybe he just tried too hard."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"When \\"The City of Angels\\" first hit the shelves, I picked up and did a brief run through, and concluded that it really wasn't a book I'd enjoy reading. Months later, I read a review of the book in the Times Literary Supplement and thought that even though that review was lukewarm, I'd give the book a go. One of the perks of working in a bookshop is that one is able to \\"borrow\\" books. And the conclusion I came to was that I'm lucky I have this book borrowing privilege. \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" isn't a bad book; unfortunately it isn't a stellar either, even though it had the necessary ingredients to have been a fairly good one. The problem is that the book lacks a coherent feel and structure. While John Berendt says that what he wants to do is write a book about Venetians -- what they think and feel -- what he mainly does is write about the rich, the aristocratic and the well known, with some American and British transplants thrown in. And sad to say, these vignettes while mildly interesting became a little too much for me after a while, especially since I felt that that these really didn't contribute to the coherence of the book. Part of the problem was that I got the sense that the book was really about La Fenice -- it's destruction, the criminal investigation, the rebuilding and the criminal trial of those responsible that followed. This was when the book really came alive for me. All the rest -- the feuding sons of the glassblower Archimede Seguso, the infighting amongst the Save Venice organisation, the Olga Rudge scandal, etc -- while mildly interesting contributed nothing to the smooth flow of the book. And whether John Berendt meant to do this or not, I came away with the feeling there were, perhaps too many American and British transplants in Venice. Also, there was a staged sketchiness to the writing, as if Berendt realised that what he was writing may not be the truth, that these Venetians he interviewed may have been using him for their own purposes. This staginess contributed to a feeling of artificiality that added to my confused feelings about \\"The City of Falling Angels;\\" because in spite of all it's fallings, I did feel compelled to read on and finish the book.Did Berendt bring Venice and the Venetians to life? Only if you believe that Venice consists of rich eccentrics -- now and then one gets an impression, a sentence of what many \\"other\\" Venetians may think and feel, but these were few and far between, like elusive whispers that fly with the wind. I never got the sense of Venice -- the aura of mystery, decadence and haunting, fey beauty that so many artists, authors and poets have celebrated. Berendt's Venice really could have been any city in Italy. What \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" did inspire, however, was the desire to reread James' \\"The Aspern Papers.\\" All in all, while I wouldn't spend the hardcover price for the book and while I'd advise either borrowing it from the library or else waiting for the paperback edition to come out, I did finish the book and found it interesting in spots. And because my expectations weren't high, my feelings of being letdown weren't that big either, so that I'd vote \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" as an average read of about 3 stars."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like everyone else who lined up to purchase THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS as soon as it was announced, I did so because I so loved John Berendt's winning debut book, MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. So the question begs, does this new book live up to expectations set by the first? The answer is that the new work is a highly pleasurable experience that rates a five on its own, and by the way, it has basic stylistic and journalistic techniques in common with MIDNIGHT. However,Venice and what Berendt finds to define it are not Savannah and what he found there. Venice and FALLING ANGELS have a tempo and mood all their own.As in MIDNIGHT, Berendt's arrival in Venice coincides with a notorious incident that may or may not be a crime but is pursued as such by the local prosecutor. The investigation into the 1996 conflagration that destroyed the city's pride, the Fenice Opera House, just as an extensive and expensive renovation was nearing completion, becomes the portal through which Berendt moves back and forth between the history that informs the contemporary city and culture, the natives and expatriates, and the social customs and government. In Berendt's Venice, the visitable past reaches back centuries, thanks to its architecture and legacies that influence contemporary life. There are stories of feuding families and inheritances dashed by estate laws. The lure of the expatriate life is limned in several generations' stories, with the presence of Henry James and Ezra Pound still palpable. One of Berendt's strengths is to point out that nothing is simple, that a situation or person can be viewed through many perspectives suggesting as many different conclusions, and Venice is a trove of ambiguities. The title was inspired by a sign near a crumbling building where figurines on the faade were unstable, \\"Beware of falling angels.\\" Juxtaposing \\"falling\\" with \\"angels\\" tells you everything you need to know about the ironies that abound.Venice is not slapstick like Savannah, though it has its eccentrics and comical characters. It is etched with more history and tragedy. The ever present and rising waters contrast with the gravity of ancient palaces and cathedrals, juxtaposing mortality with immortality. This book's central mystery is spun out at a languid pace and often takes a back seat to other stories. That's okay. I love all the stories Berendt divulges. He's an extraordinary storyteller and I only hope it won't be as long before he writes another book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I liked the book. I think it's important to get that out of the way...As you make your way through the story, it occurs to you that the author shares most of the not-so-likable elements of the American characters he's describing. It's clear that he used the pretext of a colorful book about Venetian high-society to gain the same level of access he derides Save Venice managers for seeking. Here's the rub - it's very hard to care in the slightest about Venetian high society, or the people who want access to it, including the author. It doesn't take long to regret funding the author's party circuit by purchasing the book.The author's first book was great because it connected the different strands of Savannah life with a very interesting story. Not so in this one. This is a good travel book. If you're planning to go to Venice, this is more interesting than reading Lonely Planet. That's about it though. If you buy this book expecting anything that approaches \\"Midnight\\", you will be very disappointed."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I greatly enjoyed midnight in the garden of good and evil and was therefore quite excited when I found out that he had another book out. Much like his first book this one takes one core story and mixes in quite a few different side stories, most in some way related to the original. The core story is about the burning and rebuilding of the Fenice, an opera house in Venice. Some of the side stories include the interpersonal and business problems of a glass making family that observes the fire and makes a line of glass objects in reflection of it. There is also an interesting side story about an incident similiar to that in the book \\"the aspern papers.\\"Overall I found the stories to be quite interesting and entertaining. The one complaint I have about the book is he makes it seem like practically no one lives in Venice except foreigners. Either he is too influenced by all of the expats that he is hanging out with or there is only a very small portion of Italians living in this Italian city! What few people he does mention are all quite wealthy and/or royalty. Therefore I kind of feel like he left out a very large part of the true character and life of Venice.Overall I found it an excellent read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"After Midnight in the Garden of good and evil, I picked this up with great anticipation.Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While in Midnight, Berendt gets you quickly into the mystery and quirkiness of all those deep US-south characters, he fails to do the same here with Venice.The plot revolves around the fire the La Fenice opera house in Venice, but much of his handling here comes across as little more than a travelogue of the city and history of the opera house itself. The main characters don't really come to life at any time.A shame, because Berendt is clearly a fine writer. Possibly if he'd had somewhat less than a twenty year gap between novels it would have helped. He then perhaps wouldn't have felt so inclined to lump every small fact on the reader, whether pertinent, exciting or not."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A somewhat different look at Venice and its people. A very many interesting characters are brought to life with Berendt's words, he does write well and even though some people and circumstances weren't as interesting as others and perhaps induced a little boredom it was still written in true Berendt fashion and I knew I wouldn't be bored for long before another interesting character popped up and said hello.I did learn quite a few things from this book, it is centred loosely around the Fenice burning down and the court case afterwards but along the way we delved into quite a lot of history of Venice and its inhabitants and I loved reading how as the water rises they just simply build up a bit higher so that there are actual houses and whatnot underneath the current Venice city, Napoleon's being one such house.It was a great non-touristy look at Venice, Berendt lived there for a while and started off in the \\"not tourist season\\" because he wanted to see the real Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Berendt's Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil. So, since I was planning a trip to Venice, I thought this would give me a background of modern Venice as seen from the eyes of an American. It did, and I've very glad I read it but I cannot rate it in the realm of his former work on Midnight. Let's face it, Berendt can get people to tell him things they'd never tell another stranger, that's one of his greatest gifts. But I didn't find I really cared about any of the characters. It may be because there were so many, he couldn't dig very deep on any of them. On the other hand, he refuses to comprise his work by creating fake characters that are a \\"compilation\\" of several people and I admire that he doesn't take that route, it would draw some events/interviews into question, as always happens with a compilation. Furthermore, if he had dug any deeper on these characters, the story would have had a much smaller scope, and I don't believe I would have walked away with quite the overview of Venice that I gained from the reading."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I felt it was a mix of a lot of different parts that didn't really come to a larger whole. The people and facts were intesting, but the whole time I'm reading it, I kept thinking, \\"what does this have to do with the storyline?\\" I thought that some of the characters talked about would do at least something in the end, but I was left with very brief explanations as to why they were even in the book to begin with. For anyone wanting to read this book, find it at a half price store and don't pay full price for it!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"With part of the main topic being Venice,I had hoped for more information about the city; instead of too much information about a very wide variety of characters very loosely related to the central idea.Good to fair is my best appraisal.The book started off well and seemed to promise more than it could deliver in the end.The first half was far better than the end.Comparing to Under The Tuscon Sun,The City of Falling Angels(both nonfiction) -falls quite a bit;unable to sustain real long term interest,with light weight characters who offer no real intrigue or development.The taste of Venice which the author offered was weak and without the texture I desired."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt takes his readers on a journey from Savannah, Georgia to Venice, Italy. Two cities, separated by thousands of miles, but are worlds apart. In some similarity, Venetians love to party much like Savannah residents. The Carnival and the masqerade must have been invented in Venice or popularized there. I have never visited Venice but would love too after reading this book. Berendt's Venice is a mixed bag of characters whether the openly homosexual poet who dies a mysterious death. Of course, the real story is about Fenice, Venice's surviving Opera house which was on fire a few days before the author's arrival. Of course, everybody who lives in Venice has a stake in the Opera house as well as Venice life. Characters like Peggy Guggenheim, Ezra Pound and his longtime mistress Olga Rudge, Jane and Phillip Rylands, and others paint a colorful life. In Venice, there are no cars so you have to walk or take a gondola in the canals that make Venice so popular and famous among tourists. Don't feed the pigeons except at St. Mark's Square because it's illegal. The food is sensational except I didn't read much about pizza, my personal favorite. Venetians love their Venice and the tourism dollars help but the governmental red tape in Italy can deter rebuilding the Fenice. Of course, there are Save Venice and Venetian Heritage foundations to help maintain Venice, it's beauty and cultural impact on high society. Who could imagine our world without the Venetian influence in our literature, dramas, and art? It's cultural impact remains higher than most European cities. As the author was there, Woody Allen married in Venice. The films like Portrait of a Lady by American Henry James and The Talented Mr. Ripley by American Patricia Highsmith filmed scenes there during his time. The world is a richer place with Venice in it and we are richer for knowing about it. I just wished that the author would consider placing photographs in the book. At least, he provided maps and pointed out popular spots in the book.This summer, my sister surprised us by taking us to Venice for the weekend. I couldn't imagine my surprise. Berendt's book does a lot of justice in bringing a city known for tourism into reality. Much like his Savannah book, this book really is about the Venetians (some who chose to come and stay while some were born into one of the most unique cities on earth). I wished that I brought this book with me on the trip though. La Fenice was rebuilt thankfully."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Again, Berendt writes a brilliant travelogue about Venice, exploring the local color like only he can. Investigating the fire at the Fenice Opera house, he journeys into the seamy side of Venetian government. A wonderful read if you like his work, or are just a fan of Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I have recently begun listening to the audio version of this book, and I'm not sure I will be able to make it through the entire 13 unabridged hours. This reader (Holter Graham) has a tedious, mannered reading style which becomes a distraction from the text.When he began the prologue, I was hoping this was a temporary affectation with some literary purpose. Unfortunately, it continues into the main narrative and, I fear, throughout the book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I was thrilled that John Berendt had written another nonfiction book loaded with fascinating characters. His other book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a wonderful read as well. As you dive into his books, at times you have to stop to remember that the characters are all REAL. The way he describes the people and places simply transports you into another world. I look forward to other such books from Mr. Berendt."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"In John Berendt's previous book, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" the deeply eccentric but earnest underclass of Savannah showed up a frivolous but slightly seedy upper-class; the lively transvestite Lady Chablis stole the book from the murdering socialite art dealer Jim Williams.In the 10 years since that book's enormous success, author John Berendt seems to have been wandering in the dessert looking for a way to replicate \\"Midnight.\\" In \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" he tries his darnedest to duplicate the plot almost exactly: for Savannah, substitute Venice, Italy. For the Lady Chablis, substitute the Venetian fellow who claims he has developed a revolutionary rat-poison which the authorities have conspired to suppress. For the murder of the art dealer's lover, substitute the possible arson of Venice's opera house, La Fenice. For the triviliaties of Savannah's upscale social life, substitute the petty politics of \\"Save Venice,\\" a fundraising organization of Americans who battle amongst themselves for the right to stand next to the minor nobility of Europe during grand balls.The result is not quite as entertaining as \\"Midnight,\\" nor is it the best portrait of Venice and Venetians around. Nevertheless, it's a fun-enough read: Berendt is still excellent at small character sketches even though the plot of the book is unfathomable or perhaps non-existent. Although there is no one in \\"Angels\\" half as entertaining as the efferverscent Lady Chablis, fans of Venice will still want to have a look."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I anxiously awaited this book because The Garden of Good & Evil was a blast and had such a wonderful flow. This one feels a little clumsier and contrived but since Venice is one of my favorite cities, it kept my interest. I'm giving it a four because I consider Berendt a fine writer but wish he had cooked up a jucier plot."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Dull, just couldn't get into caring about about a bunch of class conscience snobs. Loved Midnight."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I picked up this book in preperation for a trip to Venice. I thought I could get a feel for the city while enjoying an interesting story. Not so. The book does provide information on the history of Venice and the people, mostly writers and artists, who love the city but I hoped for more. I finished but only because I was skimming for tidbits about Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I have had to buy a new book as the original one was so tatty from being passed on and re-read. It is essential reading if you have never visited Venice and are planning to do so. Thoroughly entertaining, too."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I really wanted to like this book - although I have never been to Venice, I'm very interested in its architecture and history. And I had enjoyed Berendt's previous book. But I was sorely disappointed. This book is not about Venetian society - it's about a bunch of spoiled, catty, mean-spirited rich people and their petty squabbles and fights. I doubt whether anyone could be interested in people like the insufferable Rose Lauritzen and her fake-British husband, the predatory Jane Rylands, and the snobbish Larry Lovett. What do we care about their royalty friends and endless partying?Of the few people in the book who are not millionaries or socialites or both, most, like the poor deranged man who likes to dress up as a cop or a fireman, are described in condescending tones, giving the impression that they were included for picturesque effect or \\"color\\", but not because Berendt was really interested in them or their lives. Actually, the only people he seems keen on portraying are the aristocratic and successful.Even when his subjects' actions show them to be a really sordid bunch, Berendt seems to bask in the glow of their riches and titles. Of the aforementioned Rose Lauritzen, for example, he says: \\"She was a member of the British aristocracy. For centuries her family had lived in great manor houses and passed along such titles as Baron of Ashford, Lord Bury, and the Earl of Albemarle among the males. (...) Although Rose was entitled to be addressed as 'Lady Rose', her family background seemed a matter of indifference to her\\" (oh dear!, how sweet and gracious of her, Mr. Berendt!). You get the picture.Instead of reading about the social life and mores of contemporary Venetians, I ended up reading about a minority - about who had doges and popes among his ancestors, which upper-class Bostonian family bought which hundred-room palazzo, and who fought with who over precedence in a trust purportedly set up to \\"save Venice\\" but actually having more to do with masked balls and fawning on royalty. Not very interesting, really. Especially since most of these people talk and act like the archetypal rich jerks. Ordinary tourists, i.e. those who don't get invited to the palaces of Venetian aristocrats, and who are consistently subject to derogatory comment by Berendt, seem to be a lot less of a nuisance than these moneyed creeps.The book gets two stars for a few nice descriptions of the city and some information about Henry James and Ezra Pound (BTW, Berendt's editor should have told him that Claire Clairmont was not Mary Shelley's half-sister - she was her stepsister, Claire's mother being married to Mary's father. But then, as we already know, literary types are not the ones this book is most concerned with). Another good feature (for nobility and royalty fans) is that you can buy a used copy that's even cheaper than \\"Hello!\\" magazine."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Someone like John Berendt, former editor of New York magazine, reminds me of why I left Manhattan, with its small-mided delusional ego-centrism. He's an unskilled writer and thinker, with the soulful depth of a gossip columnist. Pick your favorite town or city, and imagine someone spinning the news-making personalities (University heads, retired CEO's, Mayors, developers, elites and gold-diggers) into a porttrait of your town, coated with a pretense of depth through literary references. You'd be incensed. Most people don't care about the trials of the rich and famous (maybe 10% of the population does, enough to keep books like this successful) -- they care about real stuff, like life, death, happiness, meaningful work, family etc. There's nothing important here. This is not Venice today, and the inhabitants of the city are right to ignore the book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I read \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" years ago and it became my ultimate favorite book and when I heard that John wrote another book-\\"The City of Falling Angels\\" I could not wait to read it. John has done it again and now I have two favorite books and someday I hope to travel to Savannah and Venice to experience these beautiful cities for myself. When John writes his books, you feel like you know these characters personally as if they were residents in your own neighborhood. A great book and I hope John has another story for us to read!!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If a book cannot grab me within the first 100 pages, then I have to stop. Not only that, but it was due at the library, and there is a waiting list (why?). I just have little time, and so many other books to read.I will say that what I did read was somewhat interesting, and the writing was good. I just wasn't that interested in the story - at least at 100+ pages. It must get better, but I wish that I was made to care earlier in the writing.Sorry if this wasn't very helpful, this review is more of my opinion than a critique."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"After a good many years of resistance due to its purported popularity and temptation due to its excellent cover, I finally yielded and read John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The overly simple sentences of the initial chapter nearly caused me to throw it aside, but I got past that and found an excellent story that ultimately left me as bemused as fascinated. The description of it as a \\"nonfiction novel\\" was obviously an oxymoron, but I didn't know what to make of it. Then I saw The City of Falling Angels at a bookshop, bought and read it, and realized what they both are--travelogues. In fact, I was moved to read Irving's Tales of the Alhambra for comparison, and they clearly share the same basic organization: a traveller [as distinguished from a tourist] sets out for and investigates a (figuratively or literally) insular place; there is a thread running through the narrative, and a concentration on local color.Compared to Irving's famous work, these two by Berendt are rather more stylistically complicated, with multiple subplots or digressions. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, being set in an American city, written by an American for an American audience, is the more powerful of the two because it conveys much by implication and reference; The City of Falling Angels is written by a foreigner for foreigners and must rely upon necessarily less powerful explicit descriptions of an unfamiliar place and its people. It nevertheless remains an excellent book; it leaves one somewhat perplexed and reflecting upon the vagaries, inconsistencies, and peculiarities of human character."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The book had a very promising start (up to page 31 in the paperback) where the first chapter ends. The chapter that describes the fire that destroyed the Fenice Opera House. Then the book bewitched and then bored me . . . in turns.The plot line of the FIRE weaves Loosely! through the book. So loosely in fact that it became an annoying distraction. I found myself skipping Magistrate Casson's criminal investigation of electricians and the MAFIA (A good thing Puzo didn't base THE GODFATHER on the Venetian Mafia because they come across as -- a bit flat.) Then there's that equally tiresome politics of SAVE VENICE--an organization that restores Venetian buildings. A big chunk of this book is devoted to their petty wars.But there are gems here too. The Plant Man -- a walking thicket of houseplants. The Rat Man, a rat poison entrepreneur. The Master Glassmaker, Archimede Seguso and the war between his sons. Ralph Curtis, owner & occupant of the Starship Barbaro -- actually a wing of the famous Palazzo Barbaro. To gain entry to his apartment, one has to put the big toe print of their right foot on an application. There's the mischief-making painter Ludovico with his bucket of red paint. The sad stories of Ezra Pound and Mario Stefani. Poetry and grafitti! Why are there no more cats in Venice? Why are there too many pigeons? Why is it hard to grow old in Venice? Why are there angels falling from the sky?These little jewels scattered throughout the book saved it. I give John Berendt-- 2 and a half stars for the charming eccentrics, a half star for the amusing humbug, and another half star for some Kleenex moments."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A very interesting account of the eccentricities of the people and place of Venice. Enjoyable for both those who have been there and those planning to go."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Though not at the level of the author's previous book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, I fail to understand why so many reviewers hated this book. It's an interesting read written in a breezy and very readable style. It's certainly not the Great American Novel, but I did enjoy reading about all the goofy people the author met during his time in Venice. The stuff about the burning of the Fenice Opera House seemed dull and tiresome by comparison. I wish the author had spent more time meeting people & having adventures than following the tiresome legal antics of some boring legalistas trying to make a name for themselves."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"As a person who doesn't have the opportunity to travel, for both physical and finanacial reasons, John Berendt's books are my favorite trips. It was so much fun going to Savannah in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I know that even if I could travel to Venice, my trip would never give me the entree to the people and places Mr. Berendt has patiently and over time managed to intorduce to us in The City of Falling Angels. I also love the glossary that acquaints us with the Italian words, the people and the places we meet and go to in the book. I know there are a lot of travle books out there, but this book includes an intriguing story and Mr. Berendt has a way of writing that takes us along with no bumps in the road."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A gossipy little piece about one of my favorite cities - and the tragedy of the burning of the Fenice and its rise from the ashes.

The condition of the book was true to the explanation on the website and very inexpensive for hardback. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I found this book to be interesting and ultimately disappointing. The book is a collection of stories/articles about Venice and people related to Venice. The stories are are interesting in themselves, however when strung together in book form they don't add up to something greater than the sum of the parts. In fact, several leave the reader waiting for a satisfying conclusion. On the positive side, the research is meticulous and the book is well written."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Okay, I tried for a month to get into this book, but finally just gave up and returned to the library. There's just no story there. It's as if the author was trying desperately to replicate his enormous success of \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\\" Although Venice is a fascinating place, descriptions of the scenery and ambiance can only go so far. The book starts off with a big fire in a legendary theater in Venice. But--it doesn't go much further. The people were boring and I found all those paragraphs of dialogue monotonous. It's rather weird how the author can turn up in a place--and a big dramatic event is happening. And everyone he meets is associated with the event. This is a book that I was really looking forward to reading but it's one that i simply couldn't generate any interest in. Sorry, John."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"was not sure how john berendt could top midnight in the garden of good and evil. in that book, he took the sleepy town of savannah and made it more interesting than we could have imagined. but venice, ah venice---- what city is more fantastic that venice? and while midnight's characters were on the fringe, even the sleepiest gondola driver in venice seems to have a deep, inner story. it is exactly that which berendt tapped--- every one of his characters is so richy layered that it seems they could only live in that sinking city. absolutely loved reading this book"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt has done it again.

A good non-fiction,written like fiction read.The people he described seemed very authentic."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The author tells the story of Venice in two ways--by relating the story of the burning and rebuilding of the Fenice, Venice's world-renown opera house, and by describing some colorful Venetians and American expatriates he met while living in Venice. I was taken aback by some of the people he described, many of whom I felt were self-serving, obnoxious, and pretentious. The worst of the lot were Larry Lovett and Dr. Bob Guthrie who may have been friends at one time but who used the charitable organization Save Venice in a quest for power and to spew venom at each other. I would much rather have learned about the simple folk who populate this most amazing city. Take me back to Savannah (and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil)!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Author John Berendt doesn't tell a story, so much as paint a portrait in The City of Falling Angels-appropriate, perhaps, since the American view of Venice is so colored by art and architecture. The reader gets a protrait of a Venice that is simultaneously cosmopolitan-the playground of nobility, titled and untitled-and provincial-Berendt's Venetians are often distrustful of outsiders, and frequently resentful of the millions of tourists who throng the city, bringing traffic, environmental decay-and money. Though it was once the seat of an empire, Venice today is as much a tourist town as Las Vegas or Orlando.Berendt interweaves several stories throughout a surpisingly quick 414-page read. The investigation and rebuilding following the catastrophic fire at the Fenice opera house is the book's main story, and the author does a great job of bringing several voices-and his own shrewd eye for controversy-into the mix. Along the way, the reader is introduced to a host of characters, from Venetian counts to ne'er-do-well subcontractors. And the reader sees, through Berendt's prism, the engimatic character of Venice. Count Girolamo Marcello tells the author, in the preface, that \\"everyone in Venice is acting...Venetians never tell the truth. We mean exactly the opposite of what we say.\\" Unravelling a mystery (was the Fenice fire arson, or just plain negligence) is a necessarily difficulty task in such a city. Marcello's quote makes you wonder, on every page, just what is real, and what is only a facade.There's some neat stuff on the inner workings of the Venetian social scene. If you go ga-ga over palaces, counts, and princesses, this will have you positively weak at the knees. If not, it's a not-so-offensive look at how the other half lives.On a related note, you might be surprised to know that, even though the city houses architectural and artistic treasures that seem removed from the grind of mundane politics and petty rivalries, the conservators of Venice's heritage are not at all disinterested in the power and perks that access to them-and the city's exclusive social set-can provide. The stories Berendt tells of machinations at the Guggenheim, and the travails of Ezra Pound's lifelong mistress, Olga Rudge, are both fascinating tales of personal rivalries, and dispiriting anecdotes of arrogance and power-hunger.One of the book's strengths is that it shows many sides of Venice: readers get to know Archimede Seguso, an incomprable glassmaker and artist, and Massimo Donadon, who made his fortune from selling a better rat poison.I don't know if this is an accurate picture of what Venice is \\"really like.\\" I don't know if that matters. One thing's for sure: it's not the story of the guy washing dishes in a hole-in-the-wall restuarnt-it revolves around some of the city's wealthiest and most famous citizens. But it is a compelling read, filled with interesting (if not always likeable) characters. If it was more tightly focused, I would say that it's non-fiction that reads like a novel, but as it is, it's non-fiction that reads like very well-written non-fiction.The book is hardly a travel guide to the city (nor was it meant to be), though it does give intriuging backstory for some of the city's landmarks. Watching Globe Trekker's Venice show (which was coincidentally on the week I read this), I was thrilled to see many of the places Berendt describes in living color. So if you are thinking of travelling to Venice, and are of a literary bent (if you read book reviews, I've got to assume you are), this makes a fun read, maybe combined with a more straight-forward history of the city. It's definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt has a formula - and it works well.His narrator is a writer who visits a tony town full of eccentric personalities who fit beautifully in their small habitat, but would very likely be outcasts anywhere else. In \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" the characters were often homosexual, transsexual, bisexual or overly sexual southerners of Savannah, Georgia. In The \\"City of Falling Angels\\" it is less about sex and more about the perfunctory idiosyncracies of the Venetians -- the artisans -- and their arts which somehow survive amidst their very Italian buraeucracy(ies).In each book, the writer quickly befriends the \\"players\\" of the respective communities and hears the gossip. And, oh what gossip his ears get to hear. In \\"City\\" the narrator relays the gossip to us about the horrible tale of how expatriates Jane and Philip Rylands convert the Ezra Pound legacy for an apparent personal gain; or how the Seguso family feud regarding the famous artisans sons and their fighting over the company bequeathed to them by their iconic father; or how the numerous fiascos affiliated with the bidding and lawsuits by contractors to rebuild the burned down Fenice are more ruinous than the fire. Each is a sad tale: sometimes of the best of intentions appearing to have been misunderstood; or, the worst of intentions being understood by the often pessimistic society of little Venice.Great story line. Great story telling. Interweaving real names with fictional accounts make this tale all the more believable.Maybe not as great as \\"Midnight\\", but few stories are so lusciously layered with characters of such superbly rich and unique quality. But, this is not much worse.A must read for Berendt fans. A worthy read to all others."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Berendt's \\"Falling Angels\\" payed full homage to both the quirks and beauty of Italy's famous sinking city state. With the usual high quality detail and maintanence of an unraveling thread of relevance throughout all of the \\"characters\\" covered and incidents recalled, I really felt that I was back in Venice, but this time behind the damp velvet curtains, rubbing elbows with the essence of this faded city. Much like the \\"Garden\\" this novel was a great read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Perhaps John Berendt has invented a new style which focus on the development of eccentric characters vs a central plot. This leads him to present subplots and ultimately a collection of short stories. Holding this book together is a whodunit on the Fenice opera house fire, an overarching story to which Berendt returns between short stories. With or without this glue, the stories collectively create a description of Venice.As one might expect from his previous book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, the character selection and depiction is excellent. The fact that all the characters are real makes them all the more interesting. Berendt also provides interesting place descriptions.Dealing with all the characters was a bit of a struggle, as were the Italian names and terms. Berendt apparently anticipated this and provided the following tables: Glossary (2 pages), People, Organizations, and Companies (6 pages), and Names of Buildings and Places (4 pages). I recommend that the book be read steadily, not in spurts widely separated in time which make it more difficult to keep track of people and events.The story itself covers 397 pages. A table of contents is provided."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Sorry, but I did enjoy the first pages of this book, but it bogged down and became a silly he said/she said.........I skipped on, and found another of the same. I will finish it shortly and throw it away."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I was so excited when I purchased this book! I was so disappointed when I finished. The scenery was beautifully presented, but the story was hard to get through. I felt constantly lost, as the author jumped from one time period to another within a manner of paragraphs. Situations were never resolved and left me hanging. Perhaps that was Mr. Berendt's purpose?"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"which is the Italian phrase meaning \\"As is was, where it was\\" and introduces John Berendt's fine book THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS about the historically significant Venetian philosophy that affected the response to the rebuilding of the tragic fire that destroyed the opera house La Fenice 1996. Berendt is such a fine journalist with a definite novelist's bent that he manages to transport us to Venice where he not only investigatively reports on the fire itself, but also smoothly integrates the mood of the floating (or sinking!) city of Venice, Italy through the eyes and lives of many of the inhabitants. The result is an insider's look at what has for centuries made Venice the city of lovers and dreamers.Berendt moved to Venice shortly after the complete conflagration destruction of La Fenice in January 1996, not as a short term tourist, but as a long-term visitor, a fact which allowed him to not only report on the incident and the subsequent investigation of the origin of the fire, but also the Venetian neighbors who watched the fire, the people involved in the aborted reconstruction attempts and the final restoration of the opera house with all the original art and antiquities duplicated. AND all of the subterfuge and scandal involved in that seven-year process (the opera house reopened in 2003).But Berendt doesn't stop there. Along his journalistic route he reports on the museum that Peggy Gugenheim built, the people who took over the museum upon her death, the clash of classes, the lives of Ezra Pound and Olga Rudge, the Ezra Pound Foundation enigma, and the fascinating life of controversial poet Mario Stefani whose suicide by hanging initiated yet another investigation of occult mysteries, the type that makes Venice the fascinating city it is. During Stefani's last days he had created graffiti with a red paint can with the message \\"Loneliness is not being alone; it's loving others to no avail\\", and Berendt uses that bit of information to uncover truths to the many wills left by Stefani (among them wills assigning all his worldly goods to street hustlers who satisfied his lusts, to a small child Anna whose parents owned a greengrocer he frequented, to churches, preservation societies, etc). This is journalism at its best.But where Berendt really shines is in his poetic capturing of the sights and smells of Venice, the attitudes and demeanor of Venetians, the glory of the monuments and palaces, the gossip about the history of Save Venice and those who wrought havoc in attempting to disguise restoration attempts for personal gains. Even the Mafia is addressed! 'Everyone in Venice is acting. Everyone plays a role, and the role changes....The key to understanding Venetians is rhythm - the rhythm of the lagoon, the rhythm of the water, the tides, the waves...' This is a book to treasure with a slow read, a read that allows the mysteries and ambiguities of this 'wondrous strange' city to filter in through the vital information to the heart. Highly Recommended! Grady Harp, November 05"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I just got done reading this book. It is a very absorbing read filled with engaging vignettes of Venetian society. It's a veritable kaleidoscope of characters and their tales. Each narrative engrosses you fully; the author uses his journalistic skills with an understated brilliance: within minutes of picking up the book, the narrator disappears and you see the persons speaking and the scenes unfolding before you. Chapters flow smoothly; each turn of the kaleidoscope presents another interesting picture. The book is also very informative, presenting aspects of Venice's history, politics and map (literally, on the inside covers!) together with it's cultural and social attributes. I almost think that I should visit Venice!I went back to read the Prologue again when I finished. The notion of Venetians treating bridges as transitions and part of an innate rhythm falls into perspective at the end. In that light, I could understand better the central episode of the burning of the opera house and it's subsequent reconstruction. In fact, I felt I could also see shades of it even in some of bureaucratic episodes described in the book. For instance, the renovation of the Lauritzens' room in which the officials simply had to be involved, even if they didn't do anything drastic about it.The Rat person's story was a gem; I found it very interesting and refreshing in a way. The history and the skirmishes between the top two management officials of Save Venice were also very tautly described: I couldn't pull myself away from the book whenever I was in the middle of any of these stories. They also provide food for thought on the workings of human nature and personalities. Art and artists are active elements in all of the book, from the architecture of the city, it's streets and palaces to poets, writers, glass-blowers and mask-makers.I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants some good informative and relaxing reading."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I loved \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" and I was delighted to see John Berendt had another book out.Could it be as good as his first? No, I do not think he has a chance of repeating the book on Savannah, but this book should be taken on its own. If you want eccentric characters, they are to be found. If you want fun stories, they, too, are easily found. If you want to catch the feel, or atmosphere of Venice, it can be found in Berendt's book.Read the book for enjoyment, and don't worry about comparisons. Take it on its own merits, which are many. Its a damn fine book and it makes you enjoy some of the fun things one can find in life."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Although a resident of Venice, I have been traveling and only now had the chance to read Berendt's new book. He perfectly captures the unique levels of the city, its diverse neighborhoods, local scandals, obsession with weather, concern for reputation, etc. Until now I despaired of ever making anyone understand how Venice lives, what it's like to exist in a world- famous place that is also a small town--complete with gossip, centuries old feuds, the constant parade of newcomers. Venice is just too odd. Now I only need urge visitors to submerge themselves in \\"City of Falling Angels\\" to feel a part of the \\"Real Venice\\"!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Early in the year 1996, Venice watched while the Fenice Opera House burned to its destruction. John Berendt arrived three days later. Intrigued by the rumors circulating among the Venetians as to the source and cause of the conflagration, he decided to hang around for a while so he could listen to the stories and, as a bonus, experience the city without its usual herds of tourists. For several years thereafter, he followed the investigation. Was it arson, or negligence? Maybe an act of God? Or possibly a more sinister explanation, one involving mafia ties?While watching the reconstruction of the Fenice --- from contract-letting to celebratory grand opening --- Berendt interviewed a virtual who's who in Venice list of names, dropping some very familiar ones. The Venetians told him of their most famous residents' quirks, like the poet Ezra Pound's vow of silence and art collector Peggy Guggenheim's plans for burial with her dogs.He also encountered a host of not-so-familiar people, but seems particularly drawn to colorfully outlandish and flamboyant characters --- something there is certainly no shortage of in Venice. He met the Plant Man who \\"appeared at first to be a shrub that moved.\\" One evening while having a drink, he met Capitano Mario Moro, a happy man who liked to dress in official uniforms, none of which represented his actual profession, that of an electrician. And somewhere in his wanderings, Berendt was introduced to the Rat Man of Treviso, an eccentric entrepreneur who made a fortune selling rat poison because he studied and understood what rats like to eat.Berendt discovered that there is a rhythm to life in Venice, as steady as the rise and fall of the tides in the canals. He shows us the real Venice, a crumbling city awash with history, unlike any other in the world, with its gondolas and vaporettos taking the place of cars and trucks, and its pigeons charming tourists and annoying residents. He gives us a sampling of what it might be like to live there. \\"It's contradictory, hypocritical, irresponsible, dangerous, dishonest, corrupt, unfair and completely mad....Welcome to Venice.\\" He also gives us a sort of tour book glimpse at its landmarks, the enchanting Rialto Bridge, St. Mark's Square and its not-uncommon floods, the wonderful faade of Santa Maria della Salute, and the glassworks at Murano.A city with a perpetual Carnival atmosphere, it is clear that Venice does not take itself too seriously and prides itself on its uniqueness. However, it's a small city with big problems --- and a continuous struggle for political power and prestige. And Berendt reveled in learning its secrets. There's one quote that he wrote after a stroll, but it seems apropos of the Venetian way of life: \\"...it occasionally felt like walking through a funhouse, especially at times when, twenty minutes after having set out on a course that I had thought was a straight line, I discovered I was right back where I started.\\"THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS reads like a mystery mixed with travelogue.

In fact, I recommended City of Falling Angels to my book club based on my experience with Midnight. Now I wish I hadn't.At first I thought this was going to be about the Fenice burning with vignettes of quirky characters, and it is to a point, but the storyline fizzles quickly and dissolves into aimless rambling and name-dropping that seems to lead nowhere.The only thing I can make of this is that maybe Berendt was trying too hard to replicate the success of Midnight and just ran out of ideas. There's a lack of overall cohesiveness; maybe there wasn't meant to be, but I think I would have enjoyed this more if there had been.On the up-side, I did learn a lot about Venice, its Murano glass families, the expat experience, Venetians, and more, so it was not without some merit.

The author noted early on that no one has written about people that actually live in Venice. He is correct, and they still haven't.

I now choose carefully what to read about Venice, particularly popular stuff; Berendt's book was loaned by a friend and I am grateful I did not spend a penny on it. I am astounded that after centuries someone (though an 'ugly' American is not surprizing) came along and was niggling, beggarly and bucolic enough to write that much slaver about this paradise on earth. But for the size in page numbers it's mere gossip and only one or two (at most) of his chosen characters (victims) are interesting but for the fact they are Venetian.

The 'Fenice' burned to the ground in January, 1996, three days before the intrepid writer, John Berendt, arrived to survey the scene to determine if there could be a crime involved and trial. Was it arson or like the brick building in Ohio? Like Knoxville, is a dying town, nothing modern or futuristic looking.He'd traveled the country on the prowl for a good story, and it took him nine years to locare a comparable site to Savannah, Georgia (USA), located surrounded by marshes and the ocean; then, he went back to Venice which is full of lagoons and mysterious bars. The true Ventian ambiance is in places off the beaten path. If you follow direction signs there showing \\"straight ahead,\\" you wind up confused with the twists and turns and \\"forks in the road.\\" A local columnist tried to explain a similar problem in our downtown and decided that the sign need to be \\"rotated 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise fashion ... to make sense.\\" Men are bad about following directions anyway and refuse to stop and ask anyone.One old theatre was significant to Venice's being considered a living entity. He gradually learned that \\"everyone in Venice plays a role, and the role changes.\\" Even the tide there changes every six hours. Bridges are 'transitions' as you go across from one reality to another reality. He wondered as he mingled with the social group, which included a gay poet who had committed suicide (or was he killed?), \\"What is true? What is not true?\\" The truth can change according to who is proclaiming it; that it the Venetian effect. They actually mean the opposite of what they say -- my sister called that 'reverse psychology.'According to 66-yr-old Berendt, \\"Venetians never told the truth.\\" He found his Savannah with gondolas and some pretty eccentric people. He sees garbage everywhere as he pursues the 'Rat Man of Treviso.' He learns the city's secrets, a struggle over ownership of Ezra Pound's valuable papers left in his last home there. He follows wealthy Americans who try to become a part of Venetian society.He did a lot of research for this book and used real names in this one as opposed to MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, which Clint Eastwood made of good movie around the affair and trial of gay men. Then, John Berendt returns to his Manhattan townhouse. He's old enough to settle down, but will he?"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like Charleston, in Midnight in the Garaden of Good & Evil, Venice proves equally fascinating.

Blessed with the occassion to expound for some 398 pages, he illustrates a world in terms of the goings-on within it better than one could ever find in a work of journalism.A city is the protagonist of his book, as the title attests. The strength of his writing is in his recognition that one can only understand a place by knowing what happens there and one can only understand what takes place by knowing well its setting. I closed the final page feeling as though I had been somewhere and witnessed something, first-hand, and had now arrived at some understanding of it all.I applaud his ability to write a nonfiction piece in the first-person but manage to never seem to intrude on the action or its depiction.

I also marveled at the willingness of just about everyone the author met to divulge information that he should not have been privy to, and at times the author was a down-right nuisance to a police investigation with his Sherlock Holmes attitude. However, he did manage to interest me in 2 specific subjects that I had no prior knowledge of."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"It's about the burning of the legendary opera house The Fenice in Venice.The book gives a great detailed description of Venice and its surroundings. With real names of the people involved in the reconstruction of the Fenice.The Fenice was burned down in the early part of the year 1996, the author arrived a couple of days later and decided to stay and find out about all the rumors regarding the legendary opera house. There were accusations of arson and negligence among others.The names are real and the story is true. It gives a glimpse view of this romantic city and its habitants. I found it specially amusing the source where the author got the name of the novel.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the confusion of the names. Even though it is a real event and there is a list on the back of the book with the names of all the persons mentioned throughout the novel, not being used to Italian names, at times it can get quite confusing."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The writer has the gift, as does Dominick Dunne, of being chatty without being downright gossipy, and of telling more in what he leaves the reader to gather from between the lines than in what is actually written. I've been enjoying a lot of Donna Leon's work lately; this non-fiction work was an interesting complement and counterpoint to her novels."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Although not born in Venice (I am an American ex-pat), it has been my home for 16 years. I consider myself quite knowledgeable and well read on the subject of Venice. I was thrilled at the prospect of beginning the book - a gift from a friend. And I wasn't dissapointed in the least. The author really \\"got it\\". He painted a picture of Venetians, several of whom I know, so perfectly it is hard to believe that he is a foreignor. And he was so adept at sniffing out the good guys and the bad. For those who haven't experienced Italian beuracracy first hand, it is truly difficult to believe. He makes it believeable. This book shouldn't be missed by anyone who has visited the city, who dreams of visitng the city, or who simply wants to be an armchair traveler."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"First, I realize that Berendt was careful when writing this book to avoid the criticisms he received after \\"Midnight\\" - eg. composite characters and inserting himself into scenes in which he was not actually present. But, he must have carried around a tape recorder for years when writing this book. There are pages and pages of quoted dialogue. As in \\"Midnight\\", everyone he meets in Venice is fascinating, quirky, and eccentric. The problem is that the various stories he hears don't necessarily move the main storyline forward - the burning of the Fenice and the various conspiracies and theories of how/why it happened. His descriptions of Venice and its inhabitants are wonderful. I just found the book disjointed and boring."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS (Non-Fiction-Venice, Italy-Cont) - VG+Berendt, John - StandaloneThe Penguin Press, 2005, US Hardcover - ISBN: 1594200580First Sentence: \\"Everyone in Venice is acting,\\" Count Girolamo Marcello told me.In January 1996, La Fenice (the Phoenix) was destroyed by fire. Was it an accident, or was it arson? Berendt's book is a non-fiction look at more than the investigation, but a true study of the history, culture and people of Venice.I loved this book. No, it's not on the same level as Berendt's first book, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" but it's a very different book. \\"Midnight\\" was about a murder and followed a very specific cast of characters.In this book, the central character is the city of Venice and it was fascinating. Berendt excels at sense of place so real with the city. I really did have a sense of the lady beneath of veil of whom one catches intriguing glances.I loved learning about some of the history of the people; Ezra Pound and his mistress Olga, the glassblower and his sons and part about Francesco da Mosto, who hosted \\"Italy Top to Toe\\" on the Travel Channel recently, about the politics and how the city runs, or doesn't, and the dissension within the organization Save Venice. All the sub-stories wound about as do the canals of Venice and I was enthralled.I am not normally a non-fiction reader, but this was a one-sitting read for me."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Considering part of his background as a periodical columnist and editor, John Berendt could have chosen illustrated magazine articles as the medium by which to publish his vignettes of life in Venice. Lucky for us readers, we do not have to search here and there. He has done the work of assembling all his observations and research into the fascinating 400 or so pages of his \\"The City of Falling Angels.\\"The warp of the larger story, of course, is Venice itself -- the water, the boats, the architectural beauty, the hierarchy of royals, their watchers, famous residents, year-round citizens, skilled craftsmen, seasonal tourists, Carnival goers, and the conflicts among them all, including the international organizations ostensibly dedicated to saving the city. The mix is lively, intense, and intricate.The central thread is the most recent destruction by fire, in early 1996, of the Fenice, Venice's fabled opera house, and the supremely laborious, bureaucratic, legal, commercially contentious, artistic, and years-long struggle to restore the glory.Berendt's writing is vivid, of the fire itself, of every person he encounters, of celebrities and workers, shopkeepers, palace owners, writers, politicos, and connivers alike. Though appreciating that Berendt is verbally adroit in all his descriptions, yet in our visual age one is left with wanting to see the pictures themselves -- of the flames, the shell of the Fenice, the boats, the faces and persons of the famous, the buildings. Again, we are fortunate, for however piqued may be one's curiosity, there is the Internet, with the capability of drawing up as many as one would like. Fun, no end.Of the many characters, I could recommend many, but outstanding is Count Girolamo Marcello, a man of fine intellect and perception, who speaks like a poet. Here is but one of his observations:\\"The rhythm in Venice is like breathing,\\" he said. \\"High water, high pressure: tense. Low water, low pressure: relaxed. Venetians are not at all attuned to the rhythm of the wheel. That is for other places, places with motor vehicles. Ours is the rhythm of the Adriatic. The rhythm of the sea. In Venice the rhythm flows along with the tide, and the tide changes every six hours.\\"You will find out. Fascinating."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"TCoFA is a set of intertwining stories (non-fiction, occasionally of the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction variety) set in Venice. Perhaps because I had the great pleasure of visiting Venice many years ago, and, like the author, was so charmed by it myself (it is one of my favorite places on the planet), I was particularly disposed to enjoy TCoFA. Even so, Berendt is a fine writer and the stories he chose to tell are interesting in their own right. There isn't much substance between the covers of TCoFA, but there's heaps of flash to entertain."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Not as compelling as \\"The Midnight Garden of Good and Evil\\", but interesting enough. Using the fire at the Fenice Opera House as the thread, Berendt introduces us to an interesting variety of people, at the same time giving us a real feel of Venice itself. It helps a lot if you're interested in Ezra Pound."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt is one of my favorite books, so I decided to read his latest, The City of Falling Angels. While the formula for both books is pretty much the same, Midnight is a much better book--only because Savannah is a much more quirky city than Venice, Italy.As with Midnight in the Garden, Berendt combines many elements to create The City of Falling Angels. He provides a little history of Venice. He interviews dozens of colorful characters. And he focuses on a possible crime. In Falling Angels, this is the burning of Venice's famous opera house, La Fenice. As far as history, I felt the author could have provided a little more information about Venice's rich past. Venice has many interesting characters, and Berendt did his best to seek them out. He interviewed Murano glass blowers, city officials, American expatriates, artists, and even a man who considers himself a culinary expert. His specialty is making the world's best-selling rat poison. He also looks into the many famous Americans who made Venice their home, including Peggy Guggenheim and Ezra Pound. But the characters in Venice fell short of Savannah's eclectic bunch including The Lady Chablis, the Voodoo priestess Minerva and antiques dealer Jim Williams. Also, the Fenice fire didn't quite have the drama as the murder in Midnight in the GardenBut I still enjoyed The City of Falling Angels immensely, and John Berendt is a fine writer with a keen eye when it comes to describing places and sites that he visits. After witnessing the opera house fire, glassblower Archimede Seguso goes to his shop and starts creating glass vases like he's never made before. \\"Against an opaque background as black as night, he had set swirling ribbons of sinuous diamond shapes in red, green, white, and gold, leaping, over-lapping, and spiraling upward around the vase. He never explained what he was doing, but by the second vase, everyone knew. It was a record of the fire in glass--the flames, the sparks, the embers, and the smoke--just as he had seen if from his window...\\" As for why he chose this city, \\"Venice was uniquely beautiful, isolated, inward-looking, and a powerful stimulant to the senses, the intellect, and the imagination....Because I could not imagine a more enticing beat to assign myself for an indefinite period of time.\\"I don't think that The City of Falling Angels is going to do to Venice what Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil did to Savannah. However, after reading The City of Falling Angels, I'm certainly considering a trip to Italy."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"What can one expect following the earlier book. A slight let-down. But still a nice little book on the vagaries of another tarnished port city. Berendt does a good job handling the various kooks, nuts and average Venetians he comes across in a fair and even-handed way.He does a fine job explaining Venice in a non-traditional way, and made me want to visit off season, to really check the place out.He also piqued my interest in the labrynth that is the Italian legal system.All in all a fine little book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If you think Venice, with its canals, its piazzas, its churches, its architecture, its history, is fascinating, this book will convince you that the city is ten times even more so. Berendt truly captures the rhythm of the city through his tales of people and power, all held together by the fiery destruction of the Fenice opera house it the subsequent investigation. Though non-fiction, the book reads like a carefully written novel. The characters are very well described; the power struggles and intrigues irresistible (\\"we Venetians are a Byzantine people\\" says one character). The book picks up momentum as it goes along so that by the end, you will be totally absorbed. Berendt's decade of effort here has brought forth a tour de force that will rank as one of the best books ever written about this incredible gem of a city."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"That is how I would summarize this book after I finished the first 100 pages and quit reading it.I decided to give this book a try based on all of the good reviews it received here at Amazon and now I'm wondering if those people read the same book I did. I keep waiting for something to happen, or some sense of a story to develop and there was NOTHING. Absolutely nothing ties the book together, it is basically about someone writing about people they meet who really are not all that interesting. The only thing that makes the book remotely interesting is that it is set in Venice. If it were anywhere else I probably would have quit reading a lot sooner.Maybe it gets better later in the book, but frankly I don't feel like wasting my time to find out."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"An enjoyable book, but not up to the standard of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (one of the greatest book titles ever.) Midnight had a much stronger narrative line, telling the story of a sensational murder trial as well as detailing experiences of numerous eccentric personalities in Savannah.Falling Angels tries to follow the same formula, but the central event, the rebuilding of Venice's famed Fenice opera house, fails to hold the center stage in the story. I felt like I was reading several magazine articles that were pulled together to make a book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I bought this book in the mistaken belief that it was a novel. In fact, it is a work of non-fiction, but its rich cast of characters might provide enough material for several novels; they leap off the page in all their obsessions, follies, and foibles with an intensity that seems to belong more to fiction than to sober fact. But then Venice, which is the setting of John Berendt's book, has always seemed a place of fantasy; perhaps that is why it has attracted so many expatriate artists over the centuries (Robert Browning, JMW Turner, Henry James, Richard Wagner, Claude Monet, Igor Stravinsky, and Ezra Pound, to name but a few), besides producing such great art of its own.Berendt arrives in Venice in January 1996, a day or two after the city's famous opera house, La Fenice (the phoenix, aptly named), had been completely gutted by fire. He decides to stay in the city for a long time, and the story of the investigation of the fire, raising the money for the theater's reconstruction, selecting between competing plans and bids, and the Byzantine process of gaining approvals and managing the rebuilding forms the major connecting thread of the book, ending with the theater's reopening in 2003. But there are other stories as well, often with strong novelistic overtones. One in particular -- an account of shady dealings in the disposal of a large cache of documents left by Ezra Pound -- Berendt sees as a virtual replay of the plot of Henry James' novella,THE ASPERN PAPERS, in the same Venetian setting.Berendt shares a nineteenth-century novelist's fascination with internecine feuds. There are two main ones in the book. The first details a split between the sons of the last great master of Venetian glass-making, Archimede Seguso, whose final works were created out of a personal response to the Fenice fire, which he watched from his apartment. Berendt has a way of making one brother seem an angel and the other the villain -- until he interviews the other, allowing the reader to see the situation from the opposite perspective and to make up his own mind. He uses the same technique in describing the feud between the Americans Larry Lovett and Bob Guthrie, the successive presidents of the Save Venice foundation. Here the dealings get a lot more unpleasant and leave a nasty taste in the mouth even after the book is finished. I think this is partly because these people occupy a social stratum far above that of most readers; I find myself asking of these and several other characters in the book: \\"How can you use your privileged position to behave like THAT?\\"For there is one quality that I do not like in this excellently-structured and well-written book: Berendt writes from the perspective of a superior gossip columnist and social snob. The whole book has an implied put-down of tourists and ordinary visitors. Berendt claims to write about the real Venetians, the people who live there the whole year round. But a high proportion of his characters are the movers and shakers, the Venetian contesse and marchesi, foreign royalty, captains of industry, millionaire expatriates, film stars, and a few powerful members of the city administration. Even his historians and connoisseurs have to be world experts. There seems to be little room for ordinary travelers and art-lovers who approach this special city with respect and wonder. Berendt takes delight in visiting the rich and famous in their palaces that others cannot penetrate, but the effect on this reader at least is one of exclusion, not access. Having spent many weeks in Venice as a student of art history, then a musician, and then on my honeymoon, I feel a sympathy with the place; but instead of extending my admittedly partial understanding, this book makes me feel that I do not belong there at all.My title, opera buffa, is also the title of one of Berendt's chapters; there is indeed a comic-opera quality through the entire book, the extended spirit of the Venetian Carnival, though I think less of opera than the crazy excess of a Fellini movie. But there is a softer side to the comic vision, verging on pathos, which Berendt handles especially well in his brief portraits of Venetian loners. Early on in the book, we meet Capitano Mario, an eccentric who dresses in a different uniform every day to perform perfectly useless tasks of splendid busy-ness. Then there is the Rat Man of Treviso, an industrialist who has made a fortune selling country-specific rat poison which tastes of typical leftovers from human food, only better. And a very moving chapter near the end tells of the apparent death by suicide of a well-known gay poet, who wanted to be known as \\"the man who loved others\\" but who had nobody truly to love him. Here, as the human comedy shifts into tragedy, Berendt touches a note that validates the underlying seriousness of his book, despite the baroque excesses of its upper crust."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If Venice is a city you've always dreamed of visiting, or your favorite travel destination, this book still isn't for you! Don't get me wrong, I love great stories filled with interesting and eccentric characters, as this book is billed. Trouble is, this book doesn't deliver on that score either.Sure there are some great stories buried in the pages of social party drivel, like the Seguso glass dynasty - worth every paragraph and more.But mostly Berendt's long awaited follow-up to Midnight is chock full of gossip, innuendo, and pandering blather about all the \\"great\\" people Berendt can name - John, I get it, you can list all the hall of famers on the 19th and early 20th century facist poet dream team. Trouble is I DON'T CARE.With so many great and beautiful books in the world about Venice and it's people, this work lacks the luster or unique perspective worthy of the slog to get through it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Eleven years ago John Berendt published \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" which stayed on the bestseller lists for more than four years. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, sold the film rights to Hollywood (a terrible film was made), researched another book (which never came to fruition), and suffered a heart attack. He's had a rather full decade. Much of that time he spent in Venice.Only days before Berendt arrived in the ancient city, the legendary Fenice Theatre was destroyed by fire. Venice, very much like the Savannah of \\"Midnight,\\" is filled with history, myth and an unending number of eccentric characters, including artists, politicians, lawyers, and royalty. Berendt has brilliantly exploited Venice and it denizens to create a portrait as rich as any painted by the masters. Stories of Henry James, John Singer Sargent, Ezra Pound and Olga Rudge are generously mixed with references to current events, scandals, chicanery and local color. The tale of gay poet Mario Stefani is particularly poignant.The recurring theme is The Fenice Theatre - what happened, who was responsible and the long road to restoration. Berendt's writing style is smooth. He's a natural. Some may find his numerous excursions into the lives of so many individuals tedious. I am not one of them. \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" inspired me to run to my encyclopedia more than once to search for pictures of this building or references to people in history and, finally, to watch the Katharine Hepburn film \\"Summertime,\\" just to see Venice in the background (and, yes, I cried all over again). I adored this book. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I don't know how I could have missed it, but I totally missed this when the book was released in September, 2005. It's funny how things work: one day some weeks ago I thought to myself \\"Is John Berendt a one-book wonder?\\" and not long after that, I saw this book. I grabbed it immediately.When you distill \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" (414 pages) to its essence, it's basically a carbon-copy of \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\", but this time in Venice, Italy. And when I say carbon-copy, I mean it as a compliment. Berendt's way of telling the story is unique, in that he, as an outsider, brings you such a unique insider perspective, that it makes you wonder how he managed (hard work, no doubt, is one of the answers). The premise of the book is the burning of the Fenice, Venice's opera house, in 1996 under suspect circumstances, as it happens a mere 3 days after Berendt arrives in Venice. From there, Berendt brings slices of life in Venice, from a renowed glass-blower's family to the power struggles within Save Venice, the US non-profit aiming to save Venice's old building, to the background of the many direct and indirect suspects in the burning of the Fenice. It all flows wonderfully, and I couldn't wait to turn the pages.Which leads me to wonder why \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" barely caused a ripple in the best-sellers list, as opposed to the incredible 4 year run of \\"Midnight\\" in the best-sellers list. Is it because this book is set outside of the US? Who knows... Nevermind, \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" is a terrific book from start to finish. Here's hoping that Berendt won't need another 10 years to bring his next book. I can't wait to see which city's outsider/inside perspective he'll brings us next."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt brings us a brilliant evocation of Venice in his new book \\"City of Angels\\". Through it's feuds, intrigues, machinations, crimes and loves the soul of this most magical and mysterious city is revealed. Bracketed by the fascinating story of the fire which destroyed Venice's great opera house, La Fenice, and the resulting investigation, criminal trials and rebuilding, the author gives us individual chapters about the high born and low born of The Most Serene Republic. We are introduced to native Venetians and expatriates alike - a rat poison mogual, a suicidal poet, Ezra Pound and his mistress Olga Rudge, the Curtis family owner's of the magnificient Palazzo Barbaro upon which Henry James based his materpice, \\"The Wings of the Dove. Through this pointillistic montage Venice is laid bare to the reader's eyes. Definitely for those who are already enchanted by Venice. However, I am not sure if the crime drama behind the burning of La Fenice will be enough to hold those not familiar with Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book is about a small scattering of elite people who happen to live in Venice. One or two of them are Venetian. The rest are expats from Britain, America and a handful of other places. Apparantly Mr. Berendt only meets shockingly wealthy people. The only people Berendt runs into in this book are fur coat wearing aristocratic socialites who have box seats at the opera. Though he repeatedly comments on how everyone in Venice is democratic and equal, \\"brothers.\\" It is a contradiction.The book begins strong, with the burning of the Fenice and introduces a few interesting characters. If he had stayed with this storyline, the book might have been better. However, the author loses focus and goes on a gosssip rag style writing spree about who owns what palace and who collects Vivien Westwood gowns. Is this Venice? I don't think so. It sounds more like a social column in a gossip magazine.None of it comes down to a plot or storyline. It is fragmented. It would be better described as a book of vignettes or short articles than a novel.If you want to know what Venice is like, this isn't it.If you want to know about super rich elitist socialites who go to $1000 a plate dinners, this might be your kind of book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"john berendt definitely brings the city of venice to life in \\"the city of falling angels,\\" the title coming from the the cherubs, etc., that sometimes fall from the deteriorating facades of the centuries-old buildings... it's definitely toned down from \\"midnight in the garden of good and evil,\\" a favorite of mine.

I got to a point where I didn't care about Venice or about the characters, I just wanted the book to end and be far away from me. At least in Midnight, the characters' stories were centered around a central plot. Not so here. There is a fire in Venice's main opera house. That's all the plot there is. From there it's just the main \\"character\\" doing interview after interview of people. And not having to do with the fire either.

Read it if you want, but borrow it, don't buy it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The City of Falling Angels, by John Berendt, is an excellent book. The evocative prose really puts you in Venice. The book is literally a feast for the senses; in that the vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of Venice are described in great detail. The book which centers around the burning of the famous opera house La Fenice, is much, much more than s imple mystery. We are introduces to various characters and political machinations involving Venice. I found the book very readable and enjoyable. I highly recommend this book. I have yet to read Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but this book has inspired me to do just that.A solid 5 star read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a deliciously gossipy book about a small town which just happens to be one of the world's treasures. For whatever reason, people *talk to this author and provide insights into the heart of a city that few tourists ever really see for what it is. I read this book just after spending two weeks in Venice and found that it corroborated in great detail so many of my own impressions. Venetians talk about it, sometimes with mixed feelings, but they do talk about it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I was a big fan of John Berendt's first book, Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil, so I was eager to read his next offering. I'm happy to report Berendt remains a born storyteller, gifted with the ability to engage his readers and transport them to a whole new world. This time around, that world is Venice, and as Berendt uncovers the mystery surrounding a fire that burned down the famed Fenice Opera House, he once again introduces us to an array of endlessly fascinating characters, from the sublime to the truly looney. His inventive and compelling narrative make this a must-read. If Falling Angels does for Venice what Midnight did for Savannah, the city of canals and gondolas may sink even faster beneath the weight of so many tourists."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is not a thriller nor a typical mystery. The Venice Opera House burns to the ground - committing suicide to save Venice. What's behind this tragedy? To find the answers, John Berendt paints a canvas of Venice. He is a very astute observer who watches the people who live and travel there; whether it is an enigmatic widow of Ezra Pound, a lunatic who dresses in different costumes every day, the city mayor, a vegetable vendor, a poison manufacturer, or a tourist who likes to feed the pigeons. That's the beauty of the book. Overall, a very pleasant read. The narrator is not extraordinary, but he is competent. I recommend purchasing a photographic guide to Venice to help you visualize the scenes in the book, such as \\"Dreaming Venice\\" or another similar photo essay."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A great read set in modern day Venice - full of interesting, lesser known facts about Venice, its history, and personal tidbits about the people who lived in and loved this famous city.

I can't remember if I've ever done that before. I did learn about the history and local culture of Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like so many of the literally millions of readers who found John Berendt's \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" an endless source of pure reading pleasure, I have been eagerly awaiting his next book. Well, the wait was more than worth it. I grabbed my copy of his new book, \\"City of Falling Angels\\" the very first day it went on sale. Berendt has now taken us to Venice and he digs beneath its surface--just as he did in Savannah--to find fascinating tales of intrigue, human folly and human decency. I found myself devouring it and yet at the same time wanting to slowly savor its interwoven stories. While the author introduced me to Savannah, with Venice he takes me to a place I thought I knew well--only to discover that I had been the merest of tourists on my many trips there until I had John Berendt as my guide. He goes beneath the obvious fascination of the city's history and art to introduce us to Counts and Marchesas, electricians and fruit-and vegetable sellers, artists and poets, criminals and politicians. In \\"Falling Angels\\" the core event is the destruction by fire (arson?) of Venice's famed historic opera house, the Fenice--and the byzantine aftermath of this great loss to the city. But, as in \\"Midnight,\\" Berendt is not content to merely tell a gripping story. He once again introduces us to a series of memorable characters, some petty and venal, some filled with charm and wisdom, all fascinating. While this book is a work of non-fiction and true in every detail, Berendt has an amazing ability to delve into a place and get its inhabitants to divulge their secrets to him like a great journalist. In \\"City of Falling Angels,\\" just as in \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" he combines this skill with the art of a novelist in getting the people to tell their stories. Such authors as Henry James, Thomas Mann and Daphne du Maurier have famously SET novels and short stories in Venice. John Berendt gets Venice to tell ITS story."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berndt hit a home run in 1994 when he wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, an interesting expose about Savannah and some of the more colorful characters that called that wonderful city home. Serving as a focal point was a midnight murder and subsequent murder trial. Midnight in the Garden spent four years on the NYT best seller list and made Berendt a world wide celebrity.Berendt has released his second book, The City of the Falling Angels and it reminds me a lot of Midnight. First is the location. While I have to admit Savannah and Venice aren't alike, they do both ooze atmosphere. Savannah, quaint but somewhat isolated is so different from the ancient and worldly city of Venice that it seems hard to understand their connection. You'll have to read the book first, but I think you'll see why Berendt selected Venice.Secondly, Berendt manages to find some really interesting locals to put in the book: Olga, the former mistress of Ezra Pound, an artisan glass blower, the Rat-Man, and pigeon exterminators, et al. These provide the color that was such an interesting part of Midnight.Finally, the loss of the Fenice Opera House and the subsequent trial of the arsonists gives the book an anchor similar to the murder trial in Midnight.Berendt is a consumate story teller. His prose is like boating on a calm canal.Whether The City of Falling Angels can come close to achieving the status and success of Midnight remains to be seen. As for me I found The City of Falling Angels and terrific read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"It seems like whenever there's a good book about a place, we're told \\"It's so good it makes you want to go there.\\" John Berendt's first book, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" apparently did that for Savannah. But in the case of \\"The City of Falling Angels\\", I felt that even if I went to Venice a hundred times, I'd never get the kinds of insights I got from reading this book.Just the way Venice is so unlike any other place -- a tiny, canal-filled, floating museum of a city that once was actually a world power -- I learned that its inhabitants, perhaps inevitably, are equally unlike those of any other place.Nowhere but in Venice could I find Massimo Donadon, a \\"chef\\" who cornered a whopping 30% of the world's rat poison market by studying different countries' food preferences -- and then making his rat poison taste like those foods, since that's what local rats grow to like after they eat a place's garbage. (Butter for France, pork fat for Germany, curry for India.) And apparently no one but Berendt ever discovered the entertaining, carnivalistic characters like him (and many, many others) -- even though several literary giants, such as Henry James, Thomas Mann, and Ernest Hemingway had their chances.And there's virtually nothing in \\"Angels\\" that you can find in any book of its kind. Or any book, period.\\"Angels also has its \\"serious\\" side. It meticulously investigates the 1996 fire (accident or arson?) of one of history's most renowned opera houses. And while doing this, it gives us a basic cultural and political portrait of probably the world's most unusual city.It's obviously tempting to compare \\"Angels\\" to \\"Midnight\\" -- since it's also about a city, and \\"Midnight\\" was such a record-breaking hit. But a much better reason is that it shows that Berendt isn't a one-shot wonder. Nor is he a writer who found subjects so rich that any first-rate writer could have made good books out of the them. It demonstrates that he's a writer who must now be recognized as one of the very best around.The elegance, ego-lessness, and spareness of his prose are the equal of any contemporary writer I can think of. His writing is never excessive or needlessly detailed -- and it never draws attention to itself or its author.After I finished \\"Angels\\", I wondered what had made it so easy to read. A quick riffle of its pages gave me the answer. Whereas most of our best writers frequently confront me with huge blocks of type -- making me almost want to cry out for oxygen, or peek to see where one of those mountainous paragraphs ends -- Berendt's pages are pleasing to the eye. I know I'll always have breathing space -- and his rhythm will become my rhythm.It's a shame that his perfectionism has kept him from writing a larger number of books. (And God knows why he chose to start so late.) But one thing is now clear: He's someone from whom we can expect nothing but fine works.I just hope he doesn't make us wait so long again.Nevertheless, I'm grateful."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I stopped reading after page 168. Cold turkey.I loved \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" so I was pre-disposed to liking \\"City of Falling Angels.\\" But I just couldn't get into it. It isn't Berendt's writing. It's crisp and his sentences are well constructed and easy to read, as always.So what is it? I think, suspect, really, that it's because, at least until page 168, the book's mainly been about the rich and \\"famous\\" of Venice. Oridnary people, the common man, hardly appear. Yes, there is the rat catcher of Venice, the men who \\"control\\" the pigeon population and the man who wears a different uniform every day - really interesting people - but that's about it and their appearances are all to brief. Mostly, \\"City of Falling Angels\\" has been about the foibles of rich people - transplanted Americans, in large part. In my book, at least, the rich and privileged of Venice aren't nearly as compelling as the ordinary Venetians who made too brief an appearance. Which leads me to another point, contrasted with the people who made up \\"Midnight in the Graden of Good and Evil\\" - the man who wanted to poison the city's water supply, Lady Chablis, etc. - the people who appear in \\"City of Falling Angels\\" are positively boring in comparsion - their penchant for wearing nothing but white and transforming rooms in a Venetian palace into a Mars Embassy, notwithstanding.I was expecting more or, at the very least, different. I didn't want the \\"grand\\" stories. I wanted the small but interesting ones about oridnary people. Unfortunately, \\"City of Falling Angels\\" isn't about them. And, for me at least, that is a shame."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The City of Falling Angels is a non-fiction piece that examines the places and people that populate the city of Venice during the non-tourist season. Part history lesson, part travelogue, with a touch of the National Enquirer type of investigative reporting that keeps you titillated with its \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\" approach.Utilizing the fire that destroyed one of the city's cultural landmarks, the Fenice Opera House, as the glue which holds the various stories together, Berendt interviews a variety of Venetians with backgrounds ranging from titled nobility to the man who developed and sold the rat poison that has made him a millionaire. We are taken on vicarious explorations of grand palaces and tiny cottages and given a tantalizing peek into the public and private lives of Venice inhabitants. From public servants, like Casson, the bulldog-like prosecutor intent on convicting someone (anyone) for the fire, to the likes of Peggy Guggenheim, Ezra Pound and his former mistress and the Seguso family (designers and creators of beautiful and expensive Murano glass pieces).The story of the fire becomes almost secondary as Berendt traverses other avenues in pursuit of additional stories and alternate truths. Of course, all of the interviews must be viewed with a bit of skepticism when one considers the advise given to the author by Count Marcello who tells him, \\"Venetians never tell the truth. We mean precisely the opposite of what we say\\". It is ultimately up to the reader to choose what portions are fact and what are seductive fiction."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I noticed some time ago that whenever anyone in a movie goes to Venice, something bad happens. Donald Sutherland gets hacked up by a deranged dwarf, Rupert Everett gets his throat cut by a sadistic admirer, spinster Katherine Hepburn gets her heart broken by a married man. Even Shakespeare had Venice as the setting for intrigue, usury and betrayal. Venice is a place where bad things happen. Now John Berendt, author of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, takes on the fabled city at the turn of the new Millennium and achieves some dazzling results. It's still a city of duplicity, con games and corruption despite its glorious artistic, literary and historical heritage. Berent uses the city as the setting for a series of related essays dealing with arson that maybe was not arson, suicide that maybe was murder, feuding old Venetian families, feuding expatriates, duplicitous philanthropists, and out-and-out swindles by supposedly respectable people. Who is lying? Who is telling the truth? Is there such a thing as truth? A lot of this book is very anxiety-inducing, especially those parts dealing with people who are obviously crooks who are obviously going to get away with it. Berendt has the extraordinary gift of being able to write truth as if it were fiction. One of the episodes, \\"The Man Who Loved Others,\\" could just as easily be anthologized in a collection of great short stories. As a big fan of Berendt's previous book, I dropped everything to read this one. I'm glad I did. This intelligent and literate book is wonderful writing. We'll be talking about it for years to come. I'd especially recommend the book for anyone who has been to Venice or plans to go as well as fans of Henry James. The best parts of this book are as good as the work of James himself."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt has come through with another great hit, following MIdnight in the Garden of Good and Evil ten years earlier. While, Savannah was the location of his previous title, one can't help but sense an aura of similarities that the author wants to entertain about the people who live in a world within the world.Interestingly, like the murder in Savannah, the trial of the fire that destroyed Venice's famed opera house Fenice, takes center stage, providing the platform for cultural and historical issues that engulf the Venetians. He portrays the peoples' moods vacillating like the tides of Venice that occur six times a day. The \\"Venice factor\\", as described, sets the stage for the players, giving them the space to act accordingly.Berendt has creatively intertwined the trial of the burning down of Fenice Opera House with true stories, often distancing the Venitians from the Italian way of life, yet, invariably still part of it. He engages in philosophical presentations of how the truth changes according to reflections of ideas, just as sunlight reflects from the window to a vase, etc. It's part of Venice, as even the instruction to follow a straight line, \\"straight ahead\\", soon ends up in more turns, curves, and forks.This is a great book that encompasses a story in real time, inclusive of culture, travelogue, and history. It's a literary achievement of a class author, who has surpassed his first title. We hope he gives us the pleasure of reading his next book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"As a fan of \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" I probably am in the same class as most readers of both books in being disappointed by this second one. It has many similarities to the first: both are first person accounts of several years spent as the \\"outsider\\" observing the strange customs of an unknown foreign tribe, like an an early explorer in the wilds of who-knows-where. He brought that sense of awe and naivete more believably to us in \\"Midnight\\" where the people of Savannah, fellow Americans, did come across as truly an unusual group with customs and ways new and different from the rest of us. Somehow, though Venice is an actual \\"foreign\\" city for most of us, it doesn't seem so strange; the author doesn't bring to the table the same sense of excitement, of being in a really new envirnment. And it shouldn't have been that way. There are certainly a large cast of characters; a possible murder that sort of fizzles out; the fire which destroys the old Fenece Opera house, a tragedy for Venetians and Opera lovers; but somehow I never FELT the loss myself...The only one of his little vignettes of which the book is made that I became emotionally involved in was the story of Ezra Pound, and his long-time partner Olga Rudge, their daughter and her family, and the attempts by a nefarious American woman to fleece Olga, then in her 90's, of not just money but more importantly the rights to the papers, and the memorabilia over 50+ years that she had from the late Pound. It is a sad story that if it took place here and now in this country would fall under elder abuse laws, but there and then seemed to have been brushed off by the authorities, and even Ms Rudges' adult daughter and grandson seemed not to be overly concerned though they themselves took a financial loss. Berendt was perhaps prevented from pursuing further into this, but is was by far the most interesting and heart-tugging episode: Olga in her late 90's going by foot to the bank to get some of her papers from Pound and being told no, she couldn't have them, they now belonged to the \\"Ezra Pound Foundation\\" that is, the dummy foundation headed by the American woman and her attorney, and to whom Ms Olga Rudge and unwittingly signed over her control of everything she owned, even her house. That story just stops too. All the side stories seem to just end, with no real feeling of completeness. I know its non-fiction, and things don't neatly wrap themselves up, but in some of the cases, thing ends with a sort of flat thud. I also never got a clear visual of Venice, which is odd, the gondoliers, the palaces and St Marks Square...I should have but it was never clearly painted for me, I think it was assumed I knew it from photographs, but that should not be assumed by an author. Nor were the people he discussed well \\"painted \\" verbally. Overall, though I stayed with it, a disappointment."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book obviously generates the whole spectrum of reactions. Having not read Midnight, I came to it with no expectations. The attraction for me was Venice. I have been reading a lot about Italy lately, and no other book has been anything like this.I found Berendt's writing style extremely easy to read and very descriptive. I was really caught up in every little story he told, and his characters are some of the most memorable I have ever encountered - and they are real people! In many ways Venice is like a theme park. It is hard to believe people really live there. So I was fascinated to read about some current and previous residents of Venice. It was also interesting that so many people who presume to treat Venice as their own are actually expats or even foreigners.In short, I loved it and would read it again. I felt that I was getting insight into \\"the real Venice,\\" or at least one of its guises."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I noticed with this book that I often make comparisons to previous books that I have read. At first I was concerned that I do this, but after contemplating it more I have come to the conclusion that I have to have some type of base to work from. In the Olympics the subjective sports usually give lower scores to the first person performing so that they setup their base for future performers. Well this performer was based on the previous work by Berendt, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Where Midnight read at times like a mystery, The City of Falling Angels feels more like a grouping of short stories with a splatter of lawyer/trial thrown in. The book still does a great job of describing the real sense of Venice and its people. It makes me want to go and see the city and the Fenice just as I was able to visit Savannah."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"\\"Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\\" -- Deuteronomy 4:33 (NKJV)If you have ever been to Venice, surely you've wondered what it's like to live in one of those palazzos and to be there when the city is under water in the winter. The native's Venice and the day tripper's Venice couldn't be further apart in perception and vantage point.John Berendt managed to meet a lot of real Venetians and to spend extended time there. Gradually, some of the doors to what the tourists never see were gradually opened to him. Surprises waited inside.His time there overlapped with the burning down of the Fenice Opera House and its difficult reconstruction. That's the main focus of the book, but there are rewarding side canal visits to subjects such as the Save Venice organization, maintaining the heritage of Ezra Pound, and playing a role in Venetian culture and society. While that combination may sound a little out of focus, realize that there's a mystery in the middle of riddle here. Who did what to whom in Venice? Who will take the blame? Who will steal the credit?The three main stories are examples of a bigger theme, residents trading on interest in the glorious past of Venice to gain unearned benefits in the present. Normally, that would be unattractive, but Mr. Berendt manages to capture the \\"glamour\\" that the outsider sees that makes the fight over the remnants of Venice more interesting than the typical selfish squabble.I recommend listening to Holter Graham's unabridged (no pun intended) reading as a way to capture the reverence for things Venetian that makes the events more interesting. Awe and caring are in his voice in a way that your own \\"mental\\" voice won't be. As a result, the story becomes more dramatic, grander, and decadent . . . at the same time.Although the base story isn't as interesting as in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, there's plenty to attract here.Some people may tell you that this book will add a lot to your enjoyment of going to Venice. I doubt that. In fact, it may reduce it. The topic is really human character, seen through the mirror of Venice from the native's point of view."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Perhaps you remember John Berendt's strong novelistic narrative drive in his book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil? And perhaps you recall the excellent movie version that was made from the book? This book, The City of Falling Angels, is a different kettle of fish.Had I not visited Venice in November of 2007 and roamed around that enchanting city for six days and nights, I would have found this book heavy sledding indeed. It's all about Venice and the disastrous fire that destroyed the interior of La Fenice, the Venice opera house in January of 1996. This book is a non-fiction account of Venice, its people, and its politics by a man who has a genuine love of the city.Unfortunately it spends a great deal of time on non-Venetians and their efforts through the Save Venice charity to restore the city's glorious buildings. The politics and internal squabbling of the leaders of the organization are described in too much detail. Berendt is an elegant writer who is somewhat snobbishly obsessed by the successful and wealthy.Was the opera house severely damaged by arsonists? Was a Venetian poet murdered or did he commit suicide? And what happened to Ezra Pound's estate? Berendt tries to build suspense by raising these questions and delving into rivalries among American city saviors and all sorts of legal maneuvering.To get through this book, you'll have to resurrect your skimming skills. There are nuggets here to be found amidst the falling angels of the great city, but they come at the cost of heaving slogging through minutiae."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"In 1996, a fire started in the Fenice Opera House in Venice, Italy. And not just any fire. A fire that would consume not only most of the beautiful building, along with it paintings, frescoes and history in this last of it's kind building. No, this fire consumed almost a decade in the life of Venice. How did the fire start? Was it arson? Was it negligence? Who had the most to gain? Was it the Mafia or was it the contractors that were working on the remodeling? These are just some of the questions that drew John Berendt to extend his stay in Venice and try to capture the city and it's people in print.In the course of the investigation, Berendt introduces us to many of the citizens of this city. We meet Archimede Seguso, a renowned glass maker, that watched the Fenice burn and then created over one hundred glass vases to memorialize it. Of course, most of these pieces still haven't been seen by the public because they are tied up in a litigation of a weird brotherly feud. We meet the Rylands - Jane, an American Expat and her British husband that waylaid a poor old lady and took her incredible achieves for their own profit. The woman was Olga Rudge, the famous Mistress of writer Ezra Pound, who's writings and letters were worth a small fortune. And we meet members of the Save Venice foundation, a non-profit organization that was created to help restore buildings and art in the city of Venice. But an implosion of the group was caused by mixing too many people with large egos wanting the Title and prestige involved with this organization.I will readily admit I had high hopes for this book. I thought Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil about the city of Savannah, Georgia was fantastic! He did such a wonderful job describing the beauty of the city, as well as the eccentricity of it's people. Not so much with Venice, although he certainly tried. Maybe it's the fact that I just don't understand the Venetian culture the way I do culture in the US. Or maybe this book was more about the glitterati instead of just the average folks. Either way, it fell short for me. I really didn't get a chance to CARE about the people in this book. There were too many exceedingly shallow people that cared more for their titles and their parties than they did about anything else. The back story of the Fenice fire just seemed to get lost in it all. And since reality is never as cut-and-dried as fiction, we still don't know what really happened that night at the Fenice.I did enjoy learning more about Ezra Pound and Olga Rudge. And I was intrigued about the side story of the poet Mario Stefani, a man that took his own life during this time period. But reading about the Save Venice Organization and their constant bickering over whose name would be at the top of the stationery and who got the best seats for a gala rather turned my stomach. As did the story of the Rylands and how they swindled a poor elderly woman AND her family out of their birthright. Maybe my expectations were just too high for this one. Venice is a beautiful city, one I'd love to visit some day. But this book didn't do much for me! Like a Seinfeld episode, it was a whole lot about nothing."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"John Berendt does a gret job of making you feel as though you are right there with him. His investigation of the Fenice opera house fire and other occurences help to bring insight into why Venice operates the way it does. It was hard to put the book down. I am ready to go back again and spend more time getting lost in Venice."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"First, my observation about the one- and two-star reviewers. They appear to be laboring under one of two misconceptions.The first would be that Berendt intended an exhausting social history of Venice. He never makes that claim anywhere that I'm aware of.Second is that some people may over-romanticize Venice. Berendt writes about \\"long time glass blowers\\" because Murano is an important part of Venice. He writes about old, aristocratic families because they are, too. Venice is NOT Smallville, USA.Now, that said, my take on the book?The political picture is very good, but could have been filled out even more, to show just how politically dysfunctional Venice can be. The Save Venice split, and other foibles of the socially arrived and the arrivistes probably could also be fleshed out more.In other words, Berendt seems to have fallen somewhat between two stools with this book. I think expanding both narratives, integrating them even better, and some judicious editing, would have made this a five-starrer.That said, it is a solid read, if a bit convoluted at times. It's lower-to-middle four-star territory.Oh, and who tagged this as \\"literary fiction\\" and \\"historical fiction\\"? The book is non-fiction. Maybe things like that are the cluelessness from which some of the poor ratings stem."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"An interesting, if somewhat long winded, take on an event in Venice. Makes you want to visit Venice, more than you want to know the resolution of the fire at the opera house there."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I wanted to read this book because the loss of La Fenice was so profound and I wanted to know much more about it. Mr. Berendt unfortunately has written nothing more than an extended gossip column.The book is filled with observations, about people especially, which are either of no interest to anyone but the most mesmerized tourist or useless as anything other than page fillers. He is so taken with the rich and famous that he forgot, at least up to the point at which I gave up, to talk about La Fenice in any meaningful way. It's so nice to know that Woody Allen was fined for trespassing but what's that got to do with the story?Sadly Mr. Berendt is a classic example of an American tourist \\"going native\\"."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Being an opera singer myself the La Fenice fire was a topic that was compelling for me. I had also recently visited Venice and the newly restored La Fenice so it was high on my list of books to read. What's more I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. So what was stopping this book from becoming an unputdownable adventure?It seemed to me that Berendt simply ran out of ideas. What we ended up with was a boring litany of squabbles amongst a pack of mad rich socialites who aren't interesting and who, for the most part, aren't even Venetian.I stayed to the end just out of curiosity - to find out the end of the La Fenice story - but was quite relieved when I finally reached the last page."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A question posed to the author about life in Venice Italy. Is it a challenge or an opportunity? I purchased this book last year and it sat on my \\"book runway\\" with all the other books I plan on reading. My wife and I just travelled to Italy and while visiting friends in Umbria ( Mike Tucker and Jill Eikenberry, Mike just published his book about buying a home in Umbria entitled; Living In A Foreign Language- excellent), I turned to my wife mid way through lunch in a small cafe in Campello and suggested we travel to Venice. I had never been to Italy and was reeling from it's wonders and it occurred to me that we could drive to Venice in a few hours so the next day we found ourselves approaching The Grand Canal and on our way to The Londra Palace for three exquisite days in Venizia. As we strolled around this enchanted city I expressed a desire to learn more about the history and the politics and inner workings of this unique place. I then remembered that I possessed The City of Falling Angels which was precisely what I was looking for. When we returned home last week I devoured the book, now if you have been to Venice it is easy to conjure up his references to The Fenice and The Danelli etc. but if you have yet to visit Venice this book will hasten your desire to visit one of the most unique places on God's Green Earth. Mr Berendt has again vivified a magical locale, I look forward to his next destination."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I basically liked this book, although I wouldn't stop reading here about Venice. First I'd like to refute some of the negative reviews. A lot of them complain about the plot and the characters and what a terrible novel this is. Good Lord, are these people so out of it they don't know they're reading NONFICTION? And right up front, the author says this is an account of the people he met in Venice and what actually happened. This isn't a Michelin guide, either. He got to know both expatriates and Venetians and so what if a lot of them were rich people? A lot of people complained the book was boring. I didn't think so, except for the part about all the infighting at the American organization Save Venice. I really didn't care about these men's egos and it had little to do with the city. On the other hand, the book tied in with several other books I've read this summer, including The Master by Colm Toibin (which is a novel about the life of Henry James) and a new book by Jane Rylands. This book put her in a new light for me, all right. I liked her writing, but she sounds like some piece of work. I didn't think it at all odd that Berendt, who probably got a lot of money and fame from his first book, had connections to the rich and famous. Most people wouldn't have the opportunity to go to Venice except as a tourist for a short period, and would never get inside this world. There was quite a bit of interesting information about the city's history, architecture and art. However, anyone who is interested in a subject can't stop with one book. I've already done additional reading on La Fenice, which has burned down three times so far. If a book provokes my further interest in its subject matter, then to me it is worth reading. I'd say if you find certain chapters or parts of chapters boring, skim over them. I'm now anxious to read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and I have been to Savannah."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book starts off great, but becomes a let down very quickly. It seems the writer ran out of story and didn't know where to go. It turns into a gossipy soap opera."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The author's more famous \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" is a great accomplishment, on the knife's edge between extraordinary and over-the-top. \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" stops a hair's breadth from being over-the-top---which is precisely what makes it brilliant.The \\"City of Falling Angels is well \\"over-the-top\\", meaning pretentious, excessive, non-credible, and offensive---except possibly for readers with a sick interest in the vulgar vulgar rich."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Having enjoyed Berendt's first book, my husband and I looked forward to reading his latest, much to our mutual disappointment. If I wanted to read local gossip, I'd pick up one of the rags at the supermarket. I've been to Venice, and wanted to read a book about this fascinating city which includes the political and cultural landscape. Unfortunately, this is not the one. It's a hodgepodge of unrelated anecdotes, none of which interested me in the least about people I don't care about or want to know about. Sure, there were some tidbits that shed a little light on Viennese society; but overall, this was a huge disappointment. The only mystery is...how did it get the good reviews it has had???"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I've been to Venice three times. I so want to love it. I have friends who rave about what a magical place it is. And while I admit, that first look upon exiting the train station is like nothing you've ever seen.... I just can't get there. Venice is so crowded with tourists and people selling dancing Mickey and Minnies on the famous bridges, and crowds of inappropriately dressed folks off the cruise ships. The first time I heard the orchestras in St. Marks Square start up, it was the theme from Bonanza they played; not Vivaldi.But now that I've read The City of Falling Angels I am anxious to go back! I want to explore the hidden backways I've read about. I want to read Ezra Pound and see a performance in La Fenice (at the very least, I want to take a tour of the refurbished Teatro). I want to see the glassmakers on Murano with new eyes. And I want to stay in Cannaregio and get up early to watch the world come awake.I really enjoyed this book. The residents of Venice came alive for me. I have a new understanding of the sense of history and fears for the future. I've developed a whole new reading list in the process of reading this. Any book that leaves me with more books to read is successful, in my view."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil so I was eager to read this much awaited book. While I don't think it is fair to do a direct comparison between the two, Berendt almost makes you compare. \\"Angels\\" has the same format - find an interesting city with lots of history, look for some interesting and humorous characters and find a compelling story that will tie it all together.While Venice is an interesting and historical city, I agree with other reviewers that the compelling story is lacking. The fire at the Fenice just doesn't resonate as a good tale and the excrutiating detail Berendt provides is often boring and laborious. I'm not really that interested in the contract bidding process for the restoration of the Fenice. But for me, the crucial missing parts are the really interesting and quirky people, which were in abundance in Midnight and gave it such humorous and interesting life.I think that Berendt would have done well to depart from the Midnight format for his second book. That would have prevented the inevitable comparisons that cause City of Falling Angels to come up severely lacking."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I have mixed feelings about The City of Falling Angels. On the one hand I love stories and anecdotes; especially ones that reveal the inner workings of interesting and old places like Venice (or Savannah, GA for that matter). The City of Falling Angels is full of all the things I would have liked to have observed and delved into in the short four day weekend I spent in Venice if I'd only had the time. There is huge array of interesting characters that capture the imagination, not to mention a mystery surrounding the burning of a landmark of Venetian culture.On the other hand, this strength was the very weakness that made The City of Falling Angels not as good as Berendt's first, and by far better book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. There were so many interesting characters, and so many stories to tell, that Berendt could have written five books to cover everything he wanted to tell in this one book. As it was these fascinating people became mere shadows flickering on the wall as Berendt hardly took the time to really illuminate so many of them. Also, the mystery behind the fire was told about and wrapped up in about four chapters out of the book's total of fifteen in a very abrupt manner.Overall, even though I enjoyed City of Falling Angels, I give it a three out of five because there was so much to tell, but Berendt seemed to cram it all in far too quickly to do his subjects justice. If you have visited Venice I highly recommend this book, but if you are looking for something more visit Venice first, then come back to this book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is quite possibly the biggest claim of false advertising in the known Universe! The back of the book is totally lying about what the book is about. The author drones on and on about stuff no one would probably care about, all the while name dropping and sounding important. There is absolutely no story, no mystery and no point to this drivel. An entire 30+ page chapter on the membership of the Save Venice committee? Who cares? Unbelievably bad and boring, as if the author just wrote what he saw and put it in a book.

Both are light, gossipy little romps through famous, exotic cities, built around a pretext of getting to the bottom of a notorious crime. Both books lack focus, and don't really solve their crimes. But their value lies in the profiles and vignettes that swirl around in somewhat formless fashion. Berendt is a decent researcher who tries to stick to the facts, which are often colorful enough to need no embellishment. He is also a capable writer. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. Reading City of Falling Angels is like visiting little corners of Venice piecemeal, an activity that can never be boring."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book is boring and almost a chore to read. While Midnight wasn't great literature, it was, at least, very entertaining. This book, however, seems to be missing a point, a plot, and any ability to sustain interest. What a bore!!!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Although I opened the book with great anticipation, I found it surprisingly boring. Berendt pads the story with numbing descriptions of palaces and mansions. He spends so much time eyeballing ceilings it's a wonder he survived with his neck intact. Adding insult to injury, he then veers into a Reader's Digest history of Venice, with profiles of famous former inhabitants. All of which can be found elsewhere. Midnight... was a classic work. This book was simply unnecessary."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Recently, my sister-in-law loaned me a copy of John Berendt's 2006 book \\"The City of Falling Angels\\". She read the book some time ago and had raved about it. When I perused the dust jacket I figured there must be some mistake. My sister-in-law is well aware that I only do non-fiction but as I read the synopsis of the book I figured that there was no way on God's green earth that all of these people really did exist and the events depicted had actually taken place. This had to be a novel. Then I opened the book and read the \\"Author's Note\\" which stated quite emphatically: \\"This is a work of nonfiction. All the people in it are real and are identified by their real names. There are no composite characters.\\" Really? Let's have at it! I must admit that I knew precious little about the city of Venice and it's rather bizarre culture and as such was quite unprepared for the story that was about to unfold. \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" turns out to be unlike any other book I have ever read. Be prepared to make ample use of the glossary of people, places and Italian words offered by the author at the end of the book. It would appear that practically everything about Venice can and does get extremely complicated.The main storyline in \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" centers around a fire that destroyed the historic Fenice Opera House in January 1996. The Fenice had been undergoing extensive renovations and the first reports indicated that the fire was most likely either an accident or possibly the result of negligence. Arson had pretty much been ruled out. Quite by chance, author John Berendt arrived in Venice just days after the fire. As a journalist Berendt simply could not resist and began poking around the city to try to determine what might have happened. His ongoing investigation would last a number of years and lead him in a multitude of directions. John Berendt would encounter a whole host of characters and players that range from the mildly interesting to the downright bizarre. And although I had no idea where all of this was leading I must confess that I found the story damned compelling and was hard-pressed to put it down.It turns out that \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" is about a whole lot more than the investigation of a spectacular blaze that consumed an historic opera house. It is also about political power, legal manuevering, Venician high society, art and artists, some incredibly large egos and the ongoing struggle to preserve and maintain all of the wonderful and historic buildings in this enigmatic city. You might think that John Berendt bit off more than he could chew here but he manages to put it all together in a very readable and titillating way. I sure got a whole lot more than I bargained for in this one and I really appreciate the insights into a city and a world that I knew virtually nothing about. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Like in \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" John Berendt goes into a city which is not his home and by merely asking, is invited into the homes and Palazzos of the wealthy, the not so wealthy, the decadent, the Venetian families who have lived there for centuries, and those families who have been there less than 100 years(new comers). How does he do this?Venice has a lot of craziness in it. The Fenice opera house burns down suspiciously. Ezra Pound's and Peggy Guggenheim's fortunes go through the hands of a couple who feign concern for them when they're old and ill. Whenthis couple finishes the fortunes are somehow smaller than they should have been. A local poet commits a suspicious suicide. The non profit organization, Save Venice, goes through restructuring due to nasty in-fighting(no one got killed there).Read this book and you will be thoroughly entertained as once more, John Berendt, the master, story weaver and part time detective writes another book that is truly spell binding."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"After reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil I was excited to read The City of Falling Angels. I tried so hard to get through this book it was incredibly boring and dry. I appreciate the amount of work that went into this book with all of the historical facts and such. I was just wanting more. It literally took me 2 months to read this only reading a few pages a day....very little interest at all. If anything I took away an extreme amount of knowledge of Venice. I wish the author had focused more on the Fenice plot. I felt like I was reading a textbook...it definitely did not compare to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I know what I expected from a new book by Berendt. I expected something better than the last. I realize now that it was a lot to expect.The City of Falling Angels does not come up to the standard set by his previous novel. It's not that Venice does not compare to Savannah (I am in no position to tell not having visited the latter), it is just that The City doesn't have a decent story to keep the book together.Similarities are quite striking - in both books the narrator arrives within days of a crime being commited. In The City it is the fire of the Fenice, Venice's opera. You're not thrilled? Well, it isn't exactly a crime in which the finding of the guilty would keep you reading through the night. The book traces the opera's reconstruction to the re-opening but again that also wasn't anything most people would need to hear about.The narrator spends years in Venice (the book isn't too specific about it - my guess is he drops by every now and then rather than waits for the Fenice to be reconstructed) talking to people. By the way - it is quite striking how almost everyone in Venice has nothing better to do but to talk to him at length... We get a number of (allegedly) true stories, none of which, however, is thrilling. Actually, after a while they get mildly disgusting - petty rivalries in Save Venice, quarrels over the will of a suicidal local poet, fight over Ezra Pound's letters... There is usually some money involved (actually, there is usually big money involved) and it is the money that most often becomes (I would say against the author's wishes - he is quite desperate to present a cultural and literary context) the real issue.In short - a long and nicely written book without a decent plot and/or conflict. If you haven't read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil - buy it immediately. If you have - wait for another Berendt. You may well skip this one."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I am almost done with this book, and have not been able to put it down. Berendt has a talent for finding interesting, unique people who make up the fabric of a society. This book gives you a real view of what Venice is like behind all the tourist attraction edifices. If you are interested in Venice, this is the book to read if you want the rest of the story that lies beyond all of the guidebook discriptions. And even if you don't know Venice, this book is an excellent testimonial of a unique place and it's unique people."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"If this book had been pure fiction I would say it was filled with charming and quirky characters, a la Anne Tyler. As it is billed as non-fiction, I will say that it takes a different view of the players.I have been to Venice only once and fell in love with the city. This book reminds me of the city, quiet, winding, much more under the surface than it appears.I enjoyed this book so much I was sad when it finished it."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"While I was a little disappointed with \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" I still wanted to see what John Berendt's next book would be like. I wasn't disappointed. \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" gives a wonderful insight to the lives of the allusive residents of Venice with a well-told story from an insider's (Berendt's) view. While I had a hard time keeping track of the characters in \\"Midnight,\\" I was able to follow along \\"The City of Falling Angels\\" without any problems, possibly due to the uniqueness and memorability of each character. Thanks to Berendt's glossary at the back of the book, he is able to tell the story of the Fenice Opera House with an authenticity that would not be possible unless the reader either knew Italian, or had access to a translator."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is a fun book to read. I started it while staying in a small palazetto in a Venetian side street, and liked the sense of the city that it captured and some of the figures within. Having read de Mosto's Venice tour book, it was also fun to see him show up in the book.This is, like Berendt's other book, part travelogue, part mis-en-scene, part unresolved mystery. The flow and development are very similar; the setting different.It is a pleasurable read and one that lets you pop your head briefly into other people's lives and into a different city and lifestyle.If you like this type of a subject you might consider Erik Larson (e.g. Thunderstruck), which treat historical subjects in a similar approach, albeit much more in depth.Worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN \\"MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL\\".WELL DEVELOPED CHARACTERS. TCHNIQUE OF TOGGLEING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE CENTRAL THEME OF THE FIRE AND WHAT CAUSED IT TO THE COLORFUL CHARACTERS GAVE THE BOOK GREAT BALANCE. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO EXPERIENCE VENICE ONCE AGAIN."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I will read anything about Venice, but this book puzzled me.Ostensibly, the author decides to trace the events surrounding the fire which destroyed \\"La Fenice.\\" To an extent, he delivers by getting close to suspects, prosecutors, persons in-the-know, and various Venetian characters.Yet, in the doing, he inserts himself in to myriad Venice intrigues, often talking blandly to both sides before going back to his keyboard and spilling the beans--to what ends?Reviewers have said many informants feel stabbed in the back by this haphazard gossiping. I can imagine they do, but for me all this pointless rumormongering simply cluttered the book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"The timing could not have been more propitious. Celebrated author John Berendt arrived in Venice for a short visit, just as the ruins of the city's world famous opera house, the Fenice, were still smoldering. How had it happened and who was to blame? The entire city was abuzz with these questions. And Berendt caught the fever. He extended his stay in Venice in order to seek answers, and in the seeking, he tells a true story about the city and its history that is panoramic in its scope and riveting in its detail. This book, by the way, is not a novel, it is a work of non-fiction but you would have to go very far indeed to find a novel as fascinating as this.Although Berendt never mentions the fact, it is helpful for the non-Italian speaking reader to know that the word Fenice means Phoenix--and even as the opera house's ruins cool and the long years of rising from the ashes begins, we meet those dogged (and competing) law enforcement officers who investigate the fire and those from organized (and disorganized) crime circles who lurk in the shadows. We meet tenth-generation titled Venetians and we are observers of the social whirl of competing groups of prominent International philanthropists and various hangers-on, all of whom have one eye toward saving Venice form crumbling forever into the lagoon and the other eye toward self aggrandizement.The competing contractors seem intent on nothing less than robbing Venetians blind. The machinations of a pair of under qualified but myopically aggressive art museum directors play out like a great Hitchcock film, with all of the suspense and glamour one would expect in a city that epitomizes romance behind masks and history filled with mystery. We are taken into the household of what is perhaps the most illustrious glass blowing family, from their apartment overlooking the ruined theater to the furnaces of Murano. We meet fascinating people from Venice's past, as well as her present, ranging from expatriate literary giants to the obscure itinerant plant seller, in a city where there are more old masters than gardens.Venice's nickname is \\"Serenissima\\", meaning \\"the most serene\\" and while serenity may be the over all effect of this city, still currents run deep and there is a lot of intrigue going on just under the surface. As one of the most compelling of contemporary Venetians, Count Girolamo Marcello says, \\"Venetians never tell the truth. We mean precisely the opposite of what we say\\".In so many ways, the author evokes the enticing yet claustrophobic atmosphere of the Venetian alleys and canals. This is a long book, but one, like a visit to the city itself, you wish would not end. Of course, John Berendt is the author of the blockbusting best seller, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\", which put Savannah, Georgia, on everyone's travel list. Now he has done the same for Venice. We wonder where he is going next and hope he won't wait another ten years for his next compelling yarn.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Planning a trip to Italy...City of Falling Angels is a perfect way to get a sense of history of the most unique city in the world."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This book increased my interest in seeing Venice. The author did not leave out a thing. It is the closest thing to being there. I was so dissapointed in all of the unnecessay everyday happenings of talented,, fortunate, and yes blessed people who go about doing things that hurt their fellow friends and family members. This behavior culminated in taking advantage (in my opinion) of an elderly lady who was suffering from memory loss. May God always be with those who are expoited by the people in their lives. The book was informaitonal and beautiful in many ways but my soul was hurt when the people in the book were hurt."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil years ago and loved it, so I was excited when this book came out. Berendt really knows how to select a setting. He also knows how to seek out the local \\"characters\\" and bring them to life in print. Like Midnight, this book has a central mystery that's rather unsatisfactorily solved (in this case, the burning of The Fenice Opera House), fabulous descriptions of the city and its art and architecture, and lots of minor intrigues and petty infighting amongst the locals. It's like a really well written gossip column. And it's lots of fun.I doubt I'll retain much of what I read, but I did really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is more like an extended magazine article than a book. However, there are interesting characters presented here against the backdrop of a beautiful city. If nothing else, this is an enjoyable work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"\\"The City of Falling Angels\\" is the second book that I have read and enjoyed by John Berendt. Although the characters were not quite as intriguing and flamboyant as those in \\"In the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" I still enjoyed this story very much. I learned a great deal about the history of Venice, the Venetian people as well as their politics and views. I did not know much of the details about the fire which destroyed La Fenice, and all that was involved politically, socially and legally in resolving the question of who may have been responsible for the fire. Mr. Berendt's writing style kept me interested and eager to keep reading. All in all, it was a good book!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is an uneven book. One of the main problems is that the main story - that of La Fenice - is simply not as interesting as the main story in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The other stories were interesting, but the narrative thrust of the book is seriously weakened by the lack of a compelling central story. The most interesting part was the story of Jane Rylands (author of Venetian Stories) and her wrangling in on Ezra Pound's archive. This was a compelling story that might have been able to carry the book and was the only part I found myself wanting to read more about. Other parts of the book do tend to be heavy on the actions of expatriates and the wealthy, although there are some sections on regular Venetians. While interesting, the book can be seen as an example of sophomore slump."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"I'm very pleased with the condition of the book and the quality of the transaction. I highly recommend this Seller."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is one of those books that are pure reading pleasure. Not too scholarly, not particularly historical, occasionally bordering on the gossipy but (or shall I say therefore) pure joy.I was in Venice once, in the mid-nineties. I spent a few days in the beginning of April when there were (relatively speaking) few tourists. The weather was nice and cool. Still, there was one thing that is branded in my memory - the terrible stench rising from the canals. I can only imagine what it smells like in the summer. I was surprised that the author never mentioned the smell of Venice.This book is a kaleidoscope of different Venetian personalities, many great and petty at the same time. I finished the book feeling that sociologically, Venice is no more than a small village."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Traveling to Venice in the Fall for the first time, I have been reading everything that I can get my hands on to enrich my experience. This book has given me a wonderful insight into some of the more \\"contemporary\\" characters and their influence on the city. With the Fenice as the protagonist, Mr. Berendt takes us into the lives of many noteworthy characters in the Venician art world directly and indirectly affected by the tragedy and then beyond. It is a great read and I will certainly be on the lookout for Enrico.....!!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"For anyone who loves Venice this novel is a must. If you have never been to Venice, this novel will entice you. Berendt explores and uncovers the city in a way few people have previously done. While at times the gossip of the \\"elite\\" Americans who believe they have \\"saved\\" Venice is a bit much, the stories within the novel unfold nicely and the players make for interesting drama."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"There is a strong element of mystery in John Berendt's new book that alone would be enough to propel a reader through his interconnected stories of Venetians and the sometimes eccentric others who have made Venice their home, or home-away-from-home. But there is also a brightness and energy in the prose itself that makes the book a pleasure to read. Again, as he did in Savannah, the author maneuvers very skillfully within a hermetic and sometimes surreal environment, and you find yourself happy to be alongside him, complicit in his investigations, and feeling all the smarter for it. After reading several books about Venice, this one has convinced me I need to get out of my armchair and see it, finally, and I'm taking my first trip there this coming June."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"This is no \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\\" That said, if you take the time, even allow yourself to set \\"City of Falling Angels\\" aside and pick up something lighter once in awhile as you read, you will get a taste of how yet another eccentric city ticks. The people of Savannah are known for their quirks. So are the Venetians, and John Berendt lets you know there are a myriad of idiosyncracies in Venice.It's not an easy read, like \\"Midnight,\\" but it's worth the effort if you want not one story with an easy-to-follow plot but a character study that will explain a culture."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"City of Falling Angels is all about Venice. Following his overtly popular Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, author John Berendt decided to turn himself towards one of the most intriguing cities in the world, a city without cars and with streets of water, a cities where folks are eccentric, moody and often just plain weird. A city where the law is so complicated that no one truly understands it. A city called Venice.As he arrives in Venice, Berendt learns of a fire that destroyed the city's most beloved Opera House, the Fenice. When Berendt arrived in Venice, he had no idea what he was looking for or what he would write about. But he now believes that the mystery behind this fire would be a good subject for a new book.And it is, in a way. But the book is about too much and too little all at once. Berendt concentrates on many things in this book, some that are sligthly related to the fire, but others that have nothing to do at all with the subject at heart. This is more of an outlook of the type of city Venice is under its surface and less about a mystery. I wanted more about the fire itself, more about the trial and the people involved in it, and less about the eccentricities of the city.Some of the interviews are interesting, while other stories are slightly on the tedious side. Each chapter presents new characters, some that are quite eccentric and others are just have no real relevance. I particularly enjoyed reading about the challenges behind the Save Venice movement, but I wasn't fond of all the talk of aristocracy.Venice is a city that has much to offer and I can understand how Berendt would have had troubles concentrating on just the story at heart. There is too much to tell, too much to know. But sometimes, less is more, and this book is an example of that.City of Falling Angels is a good, interesting look at this wonderful and magical city, but not a particularly amazing one."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Venezia, City of Falling Angels, is every bit as captivating as the story woven by John Berendt. I remember my romance with Venice when I went there in the 70s.How does John do it? Berent has the ability to ingratiate himself into a foreign city or country and become the keeper of its secrets. Secrets which he has willingly shared with his readership, Thank God!After I finished the last page and closed the book, I got out my magnifying glass and inspected the inside cover to get a closer look at all of the places mentioned in the book. Then I closed the cover and savored the ingredients, wanting to start all over again!Few writers have this effect on me. Maybe the reason is because, it would appear that for Berendt, writing a book is an experience to be lived and then written. Unlike the many formulaic authors who crank out book after book with no real research or intense feelings.John Berendt is a quality writer and I have no doubt this book will be among the best sellers for a while to come.Now, unfortunately, I have to wait another 3 -5 years until he writes the next book! Keep 'em coming John, your instincts are supberb!"},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"(The stars should read two stars, not four.)Because of Berendt's previous book I was eager to read him again. What a disappointment. This is nothing more than gossip columnist material dragging on and on. My wife and I had recenlty visited Venice and found the city captivating, although it was difficult to move about with so many tourists. A reader could find a much more real sense of Venice by reading Donna Leon's \\"Guido Brunetti\\" series of novels. I would have given it one star but there was some historical value attached to a paragraph here and there, but I studiously avoid the society pages in my local newspaper just because of this type of drivel. Sorry John."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"Meandering but not in the same interesting way of the Venetian alleyways. Sorry, but if it hadn't had the name Berendt attached, I wouldn't have read more than 50 pages. I kept hoping for the book to deliver. It did not. And I'm sad to have had to write that. I had such high hopes when I cracked the book open."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"On January 29, 1996, a sensational fire destroys Venice's historic La Fenice Opera House. The fire burns for hours as firefighters continue pumping water from the canals, doing everything in their power to confine the blaze and save the city. The loss is a catastrophic one for Venetians--five of Verdi's operas premiered at the Fenice--and is made even worse by the realization that arson may have been the cause of the fire. Three days later, journalist John Berendt arrives in Venice before the tourist season begins. He's there for one reason: to see Venice through the eyes of its citizens, to study the city and its people when tourists are not present. Learning about the fire shortly after his arrival, Berendt seizes the opportunity to do his own investigating into the cause.But as in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, the investigation is secondary to the characters; the story Berendt tells in THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS is not so much about the fire as it is about the atmosphere of Venice and the Venetians themselves. Throughout the course of his investigations, Berendt encounters a number of rich characters: Ezra Pound's mistress, who is beguiled out of her fortune by a manipulative husband and wife; a poet who, before hanging himself, writes his suicide note on plywood all over Venice; a surrealist Venetian painter who is a great lover of 'scherzos' (jokes); an organization of high-society Americans committed to saving Venice's art and architecture, all the while crumbling from within; and countless others, including the Rat Man of Treviso, the Plant Man, and a man trying desperately to get to Mars.THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS is an atmospheric ode to Venice, that mysterious city built on water, that quiet place of myth and magic, decadence and controversy. Berendt has written a book about the real Venice, the city that exists when Carnival is over and all of the tourists leave. Venice is a paradox, a mystical and inscrutable and beautiful place different from every other city in the world. And while the ending of the book is inconclusive, this too is consistent with the world of Venice: Like the canals weaving through the city, the plot of ANGELS meanders, and, in Venice and in Berendt's book, sometimes no absolute answers really exist.While focusing more on the mystery of the fire and the subsequent trial that resulted when the arsonists were discovered would have made ANGELS more suspenseful, I think Berendt has succeeded beautifully with this new offering. In the pages of ANGELS, he has captured Venice as it really is: a place of mystery and scandal, a city that has a pulse of its own and is peopled by surreal characters. THE CITY OF FALLING ANGELS is a brilliant ode to that ancient city, and to the Venetians who call it home."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"For anyone who has visited Venice, its charms and history physically pulsate through the air. In Berendt's runaway bestseller, \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\", he submerged himself in the city of Savannah, Georgia, gaining access to the people and families that go back to the city's beginnings. This was a unique \\"travel\\" text, reading like a novel, strewn with strange and intensely interesting characters, which only an inspired novelist could dream up. These extraordinary characters, however, are all real people, who most continue to live and strive in that magical town. Berendt has brought this same sensibility; his journalist's flare for finding a good story, and submerged himself in the culture of Venice, again, uncannily gaining access to the city's oldest families, its aristocracy and legion of unconventional characters. This is a side to Venice that most of us would never see or experience.Similar to \\"Midnight\\", The City of Falling Angels centres on a single event, in this case, the tragic burning of the famous Fenice Opera House in 1996. The theatre was entirely destroyed, devastating the city's inhabitants and many people across the world. Berendt decided to stay in Venice and remained there for eight years until the theatre was painstakingly re-built, amongst mind-boggling bureaucracy, money-grabbing companies, ruthless public officials, and artists and the societies elite.Many high profile people have chosen to live in Venice over its long history and continue to do so today. The city has been the setting for some of the greatest novels in the last 500 years, Thomas Mann's \\"Death in Venice\\", Henry James' \\"The Aspen Papers\\", and Shakespeare's, \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" to name only a few. What is it about the city of Venice that inspires artists and writers to create their works of genius? The greatest self-proclaimed lover in history, Casanova, had his greatest and most memorable affairs in Venice. Lord Byron chose to live there and wrote lovingly about the city, and Ezra Pound chose to live and die in Venice, leaving his long-time mistress, Olga Ridge, whom also passed away there at the age of 101. Berendt captures and connects Venice's present time charm with its rich history, illustrating that these cultural traditions continue.What struck me about Berendt's book, was how so many people, foreigner's as well as the Venetians, care intensely, passionately about Venice. It is part of our past that must be maintained and remembered, because beauty is fleeting and fragile.As some critics have proposed, this book does not position Venetians as the \`other', a \\"race\\" to be studied as something exotic and otherworldly. Berendt's book is a tribute to the city and the people who love her. Anyone who has visited Venice wants to become part of her because of her rich past and her beauty...this book captures that feeling. This is a well-written, educational and highly entertaining tribute to one of the greatest cities in the world."},{"Title":"The City of Falling Angels","review":"A friend gave this book to me as I was headed off to Venice for vacation. I had no expectations regarding the kind of story, but I did expect a great story given the author and topic. However, I was disappointed. It almost felt like a Vanity Fair article, or one long gossip column. Even so, I did persevere and finish the book because the redeeming qualities were that of the details. Venice is indeed a unique and enchanting city. So I enjoyed learning about some of the areas and buildings and the ins and outs of the people while reading the book. I do believe it had an impact on my impression of the city. So for that, I was pleased. But if you are expecting a good mystery, or a coherent plot line at best, don't; it's not that kind of book at all."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"This is a timely and important illustration of the history of the struggle of the women of Afghanistan. Brodsky describes a \\"cosmopolitan\\" Afghanistan that many Westerners are unaware once existed. Once, a society where 40% of all medical doctors were women, Afghanistan disintegrated into a feudal society dominated by the Soviet occupation in the late 1970's and various fundamentalist regime changes (including the Taliban) throughout the next 20 years.Brodsky's book is a powerful response to the influx of burqa-dominated books that hit the market last year in the wake of 9/11. While books on the subject of Afghan women over the past year have focused primarily on the burqa as the ultimate image of oppression, Brodsky's book expands this narrow view as she depicts the life and death struggles of women who have fought (and continue to fight) a slow but persistent battle to gain basic human rights in a fundamentalist society that views them as worth half that of a man. In fact, Brodsky shines some light on the history of the burqa noting that in some cultures it is a woman's choice whether or not to wear burqa - a topic not adequately addressed by other books currently on the market.Set in motion prior to the events of 9/11, Brodsky began this project in early 2001 with the goal of documenting the struggles of RAWA through the scope of resilience studies. As the U.S. led attack on the Taliban brought heavy media attention to Afghan women, Brodsky picked up the pace of her research and has produced a timely book that will attract a wide range of educated, politically conscious readers.With All Our Strength opens with a riveting (if revolting) depiction of the execution of a 35 year-old women in a sports stadium in Kabul. Accused of murdering her husband, Zarmeena is led to the stadium in burqa where she is forced to kneel before the assembled city and is executed. Her execution is portrayed as a warning to the women of Kabul. RAWA members managed to videotape the execution in secret - had they been discovered, their fate would have no doubt been the same.And so goes this appalling account of life in Afghanistan. Though the history is somewhat repetitive at times, Brodsky's strength lies in effectively balancing Afghanistan's history with personal accounts of RAWA members and succeeds in creating an engaging and informative narrative that will leave readers demanding action.A book you should read and pass on. The website also provides invaluable information - though you should be prepared for a very graphic encounter."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"I have been a supporter of RAWA for four years, and thought I knew a lot about the organization, until I got my hands on this book. All of the questions that I have had over the years have been answered here, and then some! Brodsky's analysis and background information fill in the gaps for me in ways that nothing else has to date. I have read many books on Afghanistan, Afghan women, and even the other recent books that focus on RAWA, but this book is my best source yet. For anyone interested in helping this magificent organization, this book is a MUST read. I have given this book to family members and friends as gifts so that they may understand why RAWA is so important to me. I urge everyone who is even remotely concerned with women who resist to read this book. You will not be able to help but love RAWA and their spirit of resistance and strength. I thank Anne Brodsky for this enormous gift of information. Her contribution is truly in the spirit of RAWA, and I cannot encourage enough people to read it and to help these valiant women in their life-changing, tremendous work. If ever an organization deserved the attention of people all over the world, this is the one!"},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"While there are a couple other books about RAWA, this one really stands out. It is thoughtful, thorough, well documented, and very readable, with excellent interview excerpts and stories. It explains a great deal that has never been available before about this amazing, all-volunteer, indigenous, pro-democracy, afghan women's group and how they have been able to build such an effective organization under such terrible circumstances in Afghanistan. RAWA has sometimes been mis-characterized, and this book corrects those misconceptions as well as discussing why it is sometimes depicted wrongly. It also very well describes the various facets of RAWA's work and organization, as well as the human side of their work and lives. Therefore, in addition to being an engrossing and useful account of RAWA, it tells and important and usually neglected slice of recent Afghan history...that of women. The book and RAWA itself are also an excellent example of organizing for change that could be useful across the globe. Worth reading!"},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"I became fascinated with the work of RAWA about six months ago. I had never heard of the organization before and although I knew the Taliban was a terrible regime, I had no idea that pre and post Taliban rule there was this wonderful underground organization working to promote independence for women, hope and peace for the country. I have read quite a few books on Afghan's women's struggles, and many books with a focus on RAWA, and I have to say this one is by far the best book written on the organization of RAWA. Anne Brodsky spent much time in both Afghanistan, and Pakistan, observing, interviewing and living with supporters and members of RAWA. None of the other books I have read on the subject get as deep into the underground workings of this incredible group of people. Unlike some of the other books I have read by authors that have visited with RAWA members, Anne Brodsky has a journalistic style of writing, where her personal opinions don't over dominate the book. She is very objective, and writes much like an observer, which I really appreciated. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"From its opening pages, describing the mobilization of RAWA members to clandestinely record, at tremendous personal risk, the Taliban's public execution of a woman, Anne Brodsky's book affords the reader a gripping account of a remarkable, dedicated group of individuals. The shocking footage of the burqa-clad figure toppling to the ground after a rifle-shot to the head was subsequently seen by audiences the world over; that it was seen at all was entirely due to the courage and determination of the members of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.Each chapter of \\"With All Our Strength\\" carries as its title a verse from poetry written by the extraordinary woman who founded RAWA - Meena, murdered at age 30. This apt touch presages the exceptional degree to which Brodsky fashions her narrative from the words of RAWA's members. Unlike so many other writers and journalists who have ventured of late into this geographical and political territory, Brodsky does not project herself front and center into her tale. Instead, she serves as a witness - an attentive, informed, empathetic one - who helps put the RAWA phenomenon into cogent historical, political and sociological context. No mean feat, given the complexities of the modern history of this region, as well as the sheer number of voices she interweaves into her narrative. What's more, while contributing to the central story of RAWA's rise and ongoing struggles, these voices also emerge, distinctly and movingly, as those of individual women who have made difficult choices and extraordinary sacrifices in the effort to create change.These days, with the Bush Administration taking credit for bringing freedom to Afghanistan, it is vital to recognize the dedication of the RAWA members who militated for democracy and women's rights while the U.S. was supporting the forces that coalesced into the savagely misogynistic Taliban. It its parts and as a whole, \\"With All Our Strength\\" portrays the bravery of individuals and the power of collective action in the face of evil. Profiles in courage, indeed."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"The founder of RAWA, a visionary woman by the name of Meena, who was subsequently assassinated for her activism in 1987, joined together with four of her acquaintances from high school and university in 1977 to establish RAWA which quickly expanded to include a core group of eleven women. Anne Brodsky, the author, quotes Shaima, now a senior member of RAWA, about her memory of the early days. \\"We were daily witnesses of rape, of domestic violence in families and of oppressions in work and all aspects of life. It was obvious that women always had the inferior role in family, society, everywhere. And we thought that one woman cannot change all of this; there needed to be many women coming together, establishing a group movement to get rid of these inequalities.\\"A term in Dari, one of the common languages of Afghanistan, \\"mushti dar dahan,\\" or \\"a fist in the mouth\\", is particularly apt in describing just how revolutionary these founding members were. Shaima explains that women had to be \\"a fist in the mouth\\" not only towards the men in their families, but to society and government, where they had no position of respect or leadership.Education and consciousness raising, along with a great need for security, were the first steps these women took. \\"From the beginning we thought we needed ways to continue this struggle because we knew that it would not take 1 or 2 years, but decades or centuries and in order to continue this struggle the first bricks needed to be laid in such a way that when others continued to build it would work.\\" (Shaima) Against a background of ever changing governments, from the overthrow of the king, a brief flirtation with democracy, the takeover of the Soviet Union for ten years and finally the horribly oppressive Taliban regime, the women of RAWA and their male supporters have continued to educate and train women to become leaders.Central to RAWA's philosophy and methods is an alternative model of education based on the truly democratic and relatively \\"flat hierarchy.\\" \\"...members are not micromanaged when in new positions, but rather allowed to find what they think is the best way to carry out an activity.\\" Because RAWA uses a committee structure for decision making, a great deal of innovation and flexibility is allowed. Activities are carried on in a great many locations, hence the leadership is de-centralized. In Pakistan in 1984, Meena founded the Watan boarding schools for girls and boys. These schools operated for 10 years and many of the younger women of RAWA and their male supporters are graduates of these two schools. Almost all of them had experienced war, personal loss and family trauma as young children, so \\"students were encouraged to treat each other as sisters and brothers.... This atmosphere helped students cope....\\" It also created strong bonds that even today are the model of community building that is applied throughout RAWA's activities.Brodsky's book is both an historical account and a call to action. These courageous women need our support, and in getting to know their stories, we can learn from them how to build a future based on equality for women. They are facing the toughest odds and in overcoming obstacles they have a lot to teach us."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"In alot of ways, the history of RAWA is the history of 20th Century Afghanistan.The story starts from Meena's (RAWA's founder) father, and proceeds right through her short but highly influential life, and carries on with the 26 year history of the organization, fighting first the Soviet occupation, then the fundamentalist warlords it left behind, then the Taliban, then the US occupation.You can only read in awe at the strength and persistence of each of RAWA's members. Forced to run their operations from outside the country to avoid persecution and even death, RAWA fights tirelessly for the most basic of rights for the women of Afghanistan.The book is filled with countless stories, anecdotes and interviews from members of the organization as well as analysis from the author's perspective with her background as a community psychologist.RAWA's story is a moving one, but this book does have a couple of flaws without which it would probably be more accessible and wider in appeal.Partly because of the difficulty in gathering information about RAWA (so much of what they do has to be kept tightly secret even from one member to the next), the book is forced to flow between story, and research project. The author set out for it to be a study of RAWA but it seems due to the nature of the organization it ended up somewhere outside of that. It begins in chronological order but ends up skipping back and forth, and there isn't great continuity between the order of ideas and concepts expressed.Don't get me wrong - the book still deserves 4 stars, but if you're a lighter reader or don't have a lot of time for the work, you might find it a little challenging.The Kindle edition also has a problem with the text sizing, which caused all text in quotations to be too small to read relative to the surrounding text. (for me anyway)Regardless, the author deserves all credit for undertaking such a mammoth task, and even higher praise for bringing this special organization closer to the spotlight at such an important time."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"I really liked Anne Brodsky's book because you can tell that she really got in there with the women of RAWA to tell a true story about them. As it says in the book, many tell tales of RAWA, but they make them one-dimentional. In other books and publications, it felt more like a story of heroines, instead of real women who are actually sticking their neck out and seriously risking their lives to help people. Not just women, people. This was a very good book and I think it was great that she spent time there with the women."},{"Title":"With All Our Strength: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan","review":"I first learned about RAWA and the deplorable situation for women in Afghanistan several years ago in a pre-9/11 magazine article. I was horrified by what I read about the Taliban and the unimaginable restrictions on and persecution of Afghan women. I wanted to help, and I was excited when I learned about RAWA and what they were doing to help the women of Afghanistan. Since then I've searched for more information on RAWA, and this book was the answer. Ms. Brodsky's book is well researched (she spent time in both Afghanistan and Pakistan with RAWA members and was the first writer to be given such unrestricted access to them). In her book I learned information about the history of RAWA, their organizational structure and operations (which was fascinating to me), and their struggle to overcome enormous obstacles with limited funds. Most mesmerizing for me, though, were the author's many excerpts of interviews with members of RAWA, both new members and those who have been with the organization almost since its inception. After reading this book, I was so impressed with the members of RAWA -- with their strength and courage, their fierce determination to better the lives of the women of their country, their great personal sacrifice, and their total devotion to their cause that I am sending a monthly donation to them. (Ms. Brodsky is donating all of her profits from this book to RAWA.) This book is a must-read for anyone interested in learning more about RAWA or to anyone interested in feminist issues or resistance movements."},{"Title":"The Best American Science Writing 2002 (Best American Science Writing (Paperback))","review":"These essays are phenomenal- all intriguing and all lingering in our minds well after reading. Science writing is an art I particularly relish. The math is gone- and that's good- indeed all of the qualifiers for a scientific career or training are reduced to one- fascination- and there's plenty of that in this collection. My favorite author, in this category is Jerome Groopman, M.D. a feature writer for the New Yorker and a practicing oncologist. His topic is cell-speak, the astounding discovery that cells communicate between distances. The scientific term is \`signal transduction.' Groopman's prose evokes molecular music receiving and answering and generating movement. Skeleton like structures are woven by these messages and the whole stunning revelation becomes political, economic and religious in its challenges and possibilities. The least of which is nothing less than universal design and grand scale unity of all matter. Microscopic matters, as equally valuable to the private sector laboratories as to the religious nature of being and infinity.Athol Gwande, another New Yorker writer, writes about the painful ramifications of excessive blushing. The embarrassment is so defeating that people undergo surgery- and not minor surgery- just to control it. Post surgery, people report a quality of life surge that makes the risks and costs well worth it. Perhaps the most allegorical piece is a study of the plastic surgeon who dreams of giving people wings and other improvements as implanting rods and cones to make our vision more spectacular. These dreams are oddly absent when the same physician attends to remodeling a face eaten away by cancer. At odds most dramatically by the callow bedside manner and the narcisistic ego of this Leonardo of the dream. Condemned by colleagues and despised by the residents we try to ascertain if he is a visionary, Icarus or would he create another Frankenstein.The strange and the miraculous are in turn celebrated and given to dark reservations and caution.

I picked it up in 2003 for the article on Joe Rosen, the plastic surgeon. I read that one, then forgot about the book. In the last year to year-and-a-half, I've been reading more about diet and exercise, including Gary Taubes' Good Calories, Bad Calories. Just sifting through some old books now in late 2009, I noticed Taubes name on the cover of this book and flipped it open to discover that one of Taubes early articles on dietary fat was included. The editors made a good predictive decision in selecting Taubes' article for inclusion. Also, if I had read the Taubes article at the time maybe I would have had 5 years head start on my reading in diet and exercise. These are good endorsements of this volume of essays, and maybe of the series as a whole.Reading further, I found the essays inconsistent for literary merit. Mary Rogan's article on Josef Penninger has interesting subject matter, but is written in an annoyingly self-conscious style and latches onto American/modern themes like the oppression of the genius by the system and the panacea cure for cancer. Good correctives are (1) learning that Penninger has since moved back from Toronto to Austria (where he could never live again--oh, the melodrama!) and (2) Jerome Groopman's article in this same volume on the futility of predicting an immanent cure for cancer.Taubes' and Groopman's scientific cold water bathes are filled out by more skeptical articles like Satel's on race and medical conditions. Articles like Julian Dibbell's on early web security will take the later day reader nostalgically back.As another reviewer says, these are good essays and excellent doctor's office and airplane material. Back issues are probably worthwhile as well."},{"Title":"The Best American Science Writing 2002 (Best American Science Writing (Paperback))","review":"These are exactly the type of articles I love to read on airplanes trips or in doctors' offices.

It has a DVD with photos, etc. on it so you can work step by step through the book. It is a great book for beginners, but may not be technical enough for experienced users.It begins with how to import music into your Mac, transfer the music to your iPod, burn a CD of this music, make a movie and finally burn a DVD.The chapter on iTunes also shows you how to get the names of songs, change names of songs, create playlists, etc. A good basic beginning.The iPod chapter gives you the basics including name limitations for songs so you can see them on your iPod, and even the kind of cable connections you need to play your iPod songs through a stereo.There's a chapter on good photographic techniques and this includes importing your photos directly into iPhoto from your digital camera. It does NOT go into detail about how to import from your camera if you don't want a direct import into iPhoto, but does tell you how to import a folder of photos.Basic iPhoto tools are clearly explained, including what happens to the original when you crop, eliminating red eye and a very detailed section on making an iBook. It describes the steps to making a simple slide show which is great for beginners. The next chapter, however, goes into more depth and teaches you to make a more sophisticated slide show including special effects such as the Ken Burns effect.It has a good discussion of why you would want to use iMovie in certain situations instead of iPhoto to make slide shows. Using still photos to create an iMovie is detailed, step by step including how to add titles and music.Want to make a time lapse movie of that cactus starting to bloom? Don't have a digital camera but do have an iSight. This book will tell you how and explain what kind of transition & times to use.Editing tips, the cable needed to connect your camcorder, using the timeline and finally adding narration are illustrated in an easy to understand format.There's a set of extensive examples of how to add audio recorded on your camcorder into a movie and synchronizing it with the movie.He also explains how to record using the built in microphone on your Mac.There's an extensive chapter giving hollywood hints on how to take videos with your camcorder.Garage band with explanations of the major functions and an example of combining sounds is quite detailed.The DVD chapter explains how to make a DVD, the difference between a slide show made with DVD versus iPhoto, and finally how to burn a DVD."},{"Title":"Apple Training Series: iLife 05","review":"This book is part of the Apple training series. Peachpit publishes all of the Apple Pro Training series which is the official training curriculum for Apple Pro applications.This book is a very beginner how-to book for iLife '05 and is the only Apple certified guide to iLife. The author has not published anything else for Peachpit, but has written 3 other titles, dealing with video editing, one of which is in its 4 edition. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting with iLife, especially those new to Apple. It is a very basic book written in plain language and it takes you from not knowing how to do much more than open the program to being able to perform frequently used and much needed functions. You can even get new lessons online as the program is updated. For the most part, this book is just getting right down to business, but there are a few dry humor lines included. I am somewhat new to iLife and I felt like this book was a great help and I have already recommended it to a few friends. The \\"note\\" sections are very helpful if you have not played with many apple programs. There are a lot of clear graphics and each lesson is step by step, it doesn't take long to get through the book. You can do the lessons at your own pace and take weeks or just a few hours. There is only one thing that I wasn't thrilled with; the \\"note\\" sections contain most of the troubleshooting for the lessons and in some of the lessons it would ask you to perform a task and then wait until 3 tasks later to tell you how to access that particular command if it is not readily available.

Unfortunately the reality of ambigious warfare (chapter 3) has already reared its ugly head...Anthony Lake has unfortunately made himself into somewhat of a prophet. The other chapters are incredibly pertinent also.As someone who participated in and helped craft major U.S. foreign policy initiatives and decisions, Lake is able to share anecdotal snipets which really bring his subject into focus. I especially enjoyed the chapters on peacekeeping and Washington politics and the experiences Lake was able to share to illustrate his points.The only negative aspect of the book is that sometimes he can delve into examples where it seems as if he is more interested in vindicating himself than staying focused on the topic. I truly however feel and it is evident in the book that Lake was able (and desired) to remain non-political while writing the book and when he was the National Security Advisor. As he suggests in the book, national security is one issue in which politics and ideology should have the least influence."},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"Ok so the title I used for this review was a bit harsh in relation to this book. This review could be titled the tail of two books. The book that was advertised in the title and dust jacket is a review by a Clinton Administration National Security Advisor of what he thinks are six negative situations that could face the United States and the responses we should take. Similar to the old Nixon book Six Crises. Unfortunately for Mr. Lake, unlike his name he takes a rather shallow approach to his writing. The situations he chooses are interesting and with merit, it is just that all he gives the reader is a rather light, fat free, skim the top version. It really read almost like a magazine article and if you pulled this section out of the book it would probably be no more the 80 pages. This was disappointing, because the book dust jacket lead me to believe the reader was going to get a detailed book full of insight from an inside guy.The second book was a split between what the Clinton Administration did in relation to similar issues to the six highlighted by the author and a sudo memoir that is a good outline, but not much else. Again, the author just did not develop either of these two directions. I kept finish sections and chapters saying to myself . . . and then what. The Clinton Administration had some interesting foreign affairs issues, Ireland, the Middle East, Bosnia, Haiti, Terrorism, China etc, how this author and inside player managed to miss half of the detail is beyond me. And while I am on a role, there was the authors overriding and unending positive verse. This guy needs to write self-help books, because even though I was disappointed in the substance, the writing had an almost pick me up vibe to it. The author is a very positive guy.I do not want to be all negative about this book. He did touch on some threats to the US. He gave a brief overview of what would need to take place if any of the crises came to pass, and the items I found most interesting were his comments on terrorism. With all that is going on today with the 9-11 commission and the election, it was interesting to her his thoughts on the terrorism threat. Although I did not come across any smoking guns, I get the feeling that if this book had come out after 9-11, the section on terrorism and the efforts of the Clinton Administration would have been beefed up some. Overall the book is a light, easy to read overview of some Clinton Administration foreign affairs issues. If you are looking for a quick read on a weekend it will serve the purpose."},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"Anthony Lake's Six Nightmares is an exciting and important treatment of the most pressing threats to U.S. national security. The book portrays six potential threats to our way of life ranging from terrorism employing weapons of mass destruction and information warfare to partisan politics dividing our government from the people and against itself. Each chapter begins with an actual nightmare, a short fictional premise that unfolds events that many would consider unthinkable but which Lake, who served as President Clinton's National Security Advisor from 1993 to 1996 and now teaches at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, is in a position to know are possible. Reflections on Lake's own extensive government service round out this rousing cautionary work that prescribes urgent change to safeguard the United States. While making complex issues accessible to most readers, Six Nightmares also draws the attention of the national security policy community in Washington to issues that Lake believes are not being addressed. A useful as an intriguing primer or refresher, or as a textbook supporting serious study, Six Nightmares is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"6 Nightmares was actually only one or two nightmares. Anthony Lake begins discussing the global dangers facing our nation today, but eventually digresses and gives us his autobiography instead. He also dedicates quite a bit of space towards how Bill Clinton really wasn't as bad as he seemed to be and how we are all victims of the vast right-wing conspiracy.There were plenty of interesting insider tidbits, but I think an article in TIME might have been more appropriate than dedicating a whole book to Anthony Lake."},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"More than 2,000 years ago in The Art of War, Sun Tsu suggests that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. Hence the importance of anticipation and (especially) preparation. As indicated in The Art of the Long View, Peter Schwartz is among those who advocate that anticipation and preparation are even more important now than ever before. Recent and tragic events offer neither the first nor the last evidence of that. But first there must be recognition of plausible possibilities and then an understanding of what the probable implications and consequences of what each possibility may be.In this book, Lake examines six different \\"nightmares.&quot; No doubt there are several others he also could have included. He introduces each of the six within a fictional context but, make no mistake about it, any one of them could well become a reality at any moment. It would be unfair to the current administration to suggest that it is unaware or indifferent to the potential dangers which Lake identifies. (Presumably many of the senior-level members of that administration have either read or will soon read Lake's book.) The greatest value of his book, in my opinion, is that he helps readers such as I to think about -- and think more clearly and knowledgeably about -- the unthinkable. There really are no acceptable alternatives to doing so as we proceed into an uncertain and, indeed, a perilous future."},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"The book starts out OK--and some of the concepts are impressive considering it was written in a pre 9/11 world. Then it seems like the author runs out of things to say and the tone of the book shifts. The second half reads more like a memoir and its purpose is to name drop. Yawn!"},{"Title":"Six Nightmares","review":"Apropos of this day, I decided on this book written by a former national security advisor to President Clinton (who apparently was too engrossed in his personal problems that he failed to take these possibilities seriously). Not only were his predictions ignored, he compared the barren 'low-tech' White House Situation room as symbolic of America's position in addressing threats to our nation's security.\\"We are embarking on a new century with the mental furnishings of the century past,\\" he wrote five years prior to 9-11. During the Clinton administration, they were more concerned with chemical or biological terrorism, preceding the Atlanta Olympics scare. Mr. Lake challenged the procedures on dealing with a nationwide basis and there were no answers, only silence.He was in a position to see firsthand that our military and diplomatic strategy had not kept pace with our hardware. Today, in Iraq, it is not the military who are losing their heads but innocent people who look American and are in the wrong place at the wrong time. I've lost count of the number of be-headings there (it's got to be a 'given' thing and our government has done nothing to help our civilian casualties in the God-forsaken war.)In this book, written before Bush 'bushwacked' the electoral college four years ago and took the office of President away from the victor of that election, he predicts that threats to America's security are based on 'globalization' and 'to meet them we must anticipate, help to shape, a world of change.'As events have played out, his advice was ignored as if he were talking to the wind. Of course, he was from the wrong political party (a year later) and I doubt that his reports were ever read by the new administration. If they had been, we'd have been prepared as he clearly states how the Internet could be used by terrorists to hatch their plans and hide their tracks. Which they did! But, I'd like to know how they got into this country unobserved to perpetrate their dastardly deeds.He blames globalization on America's downfall. It eroded our government's ability to act on behalf of the people as they sought to placate other countries. He calls it the 'devil's work.' The neutral reaction to seek refuge within the familiar and not be aware of the enemies' abilities to infiltrate is dangerous. \\"The natural reaction is not always the smartest,\\" he writes.He lists his six concerns of what would culminate in an actual nightmare. We are living that nightmare now. How can America survive if this atrocity is allowed to continue? Partisan politics and complacency (plus abuse by the press) has allowed this to happen -- and to continue.He gives some background of the Marshall Plan, United Nations, and NATO as created by America's great post-war leaders in the 1940s -- Truman, Acheson, Cordell Hull, Vandenberg and others. They worked to lay the foundation for half a century of peace and prosperity. At the start of the 21st century, we were reaping the returns of their farsighted vision.We need to strive to get that vision back. His worries about chemical and biological weapons haven't become the worst nightmare you've ever had, but it's just around the corner. He reiterates something from the book, WHY ENGLAND SLEPT, about Churchill's description of the 1930s as the 'years the locusts have eaten.' They've had another turn!Decades after Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy planted seeds of a nuclear test-ban treaty, President Bill Clinton was the first world leader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, which was supposed to be a historic milestone toward reducing nuclear threat and building a better safer world. That treaty wasn't worth the paper on which it was printed. It's one thing to sign a bill or 'treaty' and another to act on it. Partisanship got in the way.McCarthyism was more evil than the pre 9-11 days but it was part of a debate about an issue of great consequence -- how to pursue a Cold War in which our very existence was at stake. Politics has become an end in itself. Now, the only test of victory is whether an adversary's moral standing is thoroughly shredded and destroyed -- mostly on the national level.Knoxville's mayoral race was exactly the opposite with courtesy and kindness exemplary action by the winner over an unprepared, but 'nice', female opponent who didn't know what hit her. She can't say she wasn't warned, as I told her plainly that it is not the time for a woman Mayor. It was a learning experience.Our politics have become absurd almost beyond the point of parody, a form of show business. There is a communications gap between politicians and the public, leading to damaging consequences. He mentions global warming as an increasing possible 'nightmare' when the ice cap melts.The greatest nightmare of all, according to Mr. Lake, is further erosion of the 'democratic' compact which brought us through past crises but is sadly lacking today. He said, \\"Washington must go back to governing, rather than letting the political games of 'gotcha' consume its energies.\\" Else, we will have further 'nightmares' and pay a terrible price down the road. That, we are doing in Iraq, which may consume this country internally.Anthony Lake, who was a professor at Georgetown University when he penned this prophetic memoir, has written and edited other books including THE 'TAR BABY' OPTION, OUR OWN WORST ENEMY, and THIRD WORLD RADICAL REGIMES. His warnings went unheeded by father and son presidents, to our detriment. We'll have more nightmares.

This book explores that thought by showing that some things we say are one really have more items in them, like ONE baseball team has NINE players or ONE forest has LOTS of trees. It gives a number of different examples of how ONE can be MORE.Mommy Bookworm's Thoughts: This book has very vibrant illustrations, which would appeal to various ages of children. There is a conflict of reading level and/or appropriate ages for the book. Personally, I think that 2- to 3-year-old children would enjoy the book because of the illustrations, but think that the reading level is more for ages 4+. I think the book is interesting in that it tries to teach how when we say ONE it may sometimes have more parts to it. However, I also feel it is a little confusing especially if you're trying to teach it to a little child.Dahlia Bookworm's Thoughts: I did not like the book because it was not very interesting since it had facts that I already knew. I can easily read it. I would recommend it to younger kids though.Daisy Bookworm's Thoughts: I could easily read it by myself and only needed help with two or three words.

Abdu'l Baha was the successor of his Father's faith and the authorized exponent of his teachings. These questions were put to him by one of his French followers. They are a lively array of topics: Biblical prophecy, comparative religion and scripture, social issues, Baha'i perspective on traditonal Christian topics, spiritual psychology, man's development, etc. This incredible array of topics is so amazing that few will find it hard to believe that Abdu'l Baha was a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire most of his life, suffering alongside his father, Baha'u'llah. Abdu'l Baha was eventually freed during the Turkish revolution, allowing Abdu'l Baha to speak in Western countries, including the United States and Europe. These questions and answers are bound to stimulate your thinking and enlighten you as many spritual mysteries are made clear to you. I strongly recommend this book to all seekers after deep spiritual reality, students of comparative religion and scripture, Biblical students, and students of the Baha'i Faith. It is wonderful book which will get you thinking and provoke you about spiritual subjects for a long time."},{"Title":"Some answered questions","review":"I've been interested in the Baha'i faith for a long time, and this book takes the cake as one of my favorite Baha'i books. It is essentially Abdul Baha explaining to a student of his certain key questions, from the importance of nature, to connections to Christianity. He even mentions workers rights, and many topics relating to the early 20th century. This book as a religious text seems slightly odd, because most of the concepts aren't to foreign and can directly be applied to a person living an Euro-American lifestyle. All this, and I'm not even an actual Baha'i."},{"Title":"Some answered questions","review":"Some Answered Questions is an excellent book.

The topics range from the symbolism of the Bible and the Prophethood of Muhammad to man's place in the universe and the nature of free will. In total, 84 different topics are covered, each in only a few pages. But these few pages reveal a philosophy both heartfelt and self-consistent, a coherent philosophic world-view that is on par with that of the greatest philosophers of the ages. But it not only speaks to the mind--it speak to the body and everyday experience with the greatest of wisdom. A must read for students of philosophy and theology; but I recommend it to everyone as one of the paramount works of this century."},{"Title":"Some answered questions","review":"Some Answered Questions is a compilation of the talks of Abdu'l-Baha (son of Baha'u'llah, Founder of the Baha'i Faith). Abdu'l-Baha gave both logical and traditional proofs to establish the existence of God and the necessity of Divine Educators such as Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the B&aacute;b and Baha'u'llah, each being a successive link in the chain of God's unfolding plan for the education of mankind. He presents in a freshly illuminating way the Baha'i point of view on a number of perplexing Christian subjects such as the meaning of the &quot;return&quot; or second coming of Christ, the Resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.There are innumerable subjects covered in this revealing compilation. Perplexing passages from both the Old and New Testaments are explained, the power and influence of the Prophets of God and their connection with the emergence of civilisations is expounded upon. Man's relationship to God, the immortality of the spirit, the existence of the rational soul after the death of the body - these and almost any questions which the human mind has reflected and pondered upon, are answered in a way which the mind can grasp and meditate upon.Some Answered Questions is a treasurehouse of knowledge to the student of religion and to the person who questions what life is all about. It is an important part of Baha'i sacred literature."},{"Title":"Some answered questions","review":"Totally amazing book. What Abdul-Baha accomplished in informal answers at the dinner table took some Bible Scholars years of research to reach the same insights, while Islamic scholars are still groping in the dark. Excellent variety of subjects. A major Baha'i legacy to the world."},{"Title":"Some answered questions","review":"This book only impresses naive, unthinking people with lazy minds. There are many logical errors and contradictions in this collection of talks. For instance, under \\"Proofs and Evidences of the Existence of God\\", 'Abdu'l-Baha states, \\"The contingent world is the source of imperfections\\", but later under \\"Modification Of Species\\", he states the opposite, for he says, \\"...the universe has no imperfection,...\\" Well, which is it? Another talk asserts \\"The Nonexistence of Evil\\", where he omitts the very real evils that men do to themselves and others, such as murder, rape, thieft, lying, etc. The list goes on and on. I recommend this work only to active, critical, free-thinkers, that they may become well informed on the muddled reasoning of the faithful.

Example I ran Mansion of Madness three times for folks and it's the weakest of the bunchThis is a must buy for any serious player"},{"Title":"Mansions of Madness (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 1920s Era)","review":"This 1920s scenario book MANSIONS OF MADNESS has a theme of houses (ya think?). Since the plot device is an object and not an event, it is much easier to insert these adventures into your game without outside connections; at least one, \\"Mr. Corbitt\\" (unrelated to a different Corbitt in a different house from the rulebook) has nothing to tie it down to any location. It is, in fact, in your neighborhood! Others, like \\"Plantation\\" and \\"Mansion of Madness\\" are tied to a particular region, while \\"The Sanatorium\\" is an island, but it could be off any coast. So all the scenarios are really versatile, and can be inserted into almost any campaign or even be involved tangentially in a single adventure.The other distinguishing characteristic of MANSIONS OF MADNESS is that all of the adventures seem exciting. That's right, ALL of them. Usually you see one great, two good, and two filler. And that's a good supplement. No, all five of the scenarios in MANSIONS OF MADNESS look exciting and interesting.\\"Mr. Corbitt\\" - a non-descript man in a non-descript house in a non-descript neighborhood. Except you happen to live there. You might think that the exotic garden he keeps in the back is the plot hook - ala \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\". If so, you'd be wrong . . . and maybe dead. As a bonus, the crypto-cultist isn't intentionally evil; he's doing the best he can in a crazy situation. One-D cultists are easy to dispose of; when the antagonist is a genuine nice guy, except for the whole \\"end-of-the-world\\" thing, it gets real interesting.\\"The Plantation\\" There's a cult, a sacrifice, and a cultist ringleader. There's also an evil sorceress playing the cult for fools. And she's not human. And your friend (the good guy) wants to break up the cult so that he can start his own. Oh yeah, there's a GOO involved here too, but he's on your side. Of course, that's just as bad. There's some serious layers to this adventure.\\"Cracked and Crook'd Manse\\" It's the house man, it's the house! Faster, investigators, kill! kill!\\"The Sanatorium\\" Okay, you're on an island for rest and relaxation. Ha! Investigators only get R&R; when the Keeper secretly plans to kill them all. Of course, you're trapped in an asylum on an island after a man is possessed and kills all the doctors. So now you've just got crazies walking around. What I particularly like in this adventure is that the investigators can restore order by giving medicines, continuing psychoanalysis sessions, etc. Otherwise, the crazies all become level-up POW snacks for the bad guy.\\"Mansion of Madness\\" This is really a two part adventure, centered around a macguffin. The fun part is all the bad guys losing their humanity to possess it. This story is good and creepy in a lovecraftian way. And really, what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Mansions of Madness (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 1920s Era)","review":"This is one of the best collections of Call of Cthulhu scenarios out there.

With emancipation, these women searched for identity as free women, as paid workers, and as African Americans. White woutherners developed institutions and laws to restrict the newfound freedom black southerners sought to enjoy. Black women workers responded through community awareness and activism, showing intelligence and the desire to better their lives. Hunter's innovative use of sources shapes her work and helps the women's voices come alive. Because of limited African-Americal literacy in the early Reconstruction period, Hunter turned to newspapers and white southners' diaries fo flesh-out black women's experiences. Although problematic, the attention given in them to black women domestics demonstrated the division of both race and gender. Hunter also incorporates unique sources like dance steps so show the many ways newly freed women sought to define themselves. Her haunting use of illustrations reinforces the oppression and struggle for freedom black women laborers faced. As someone who knew very little about this aspect of history, Hunter's work has developed my interest in this time."},{"Title":"To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War","review":"A wonderful book for anyone interested in women's rights and the struggles they have endured over the years for pay equity and equality. This book traces the newly freed slave women; their battle to survive on the paltry sums ex-slave masters paid them, the women's determination to organize strikes for a living wage. This book also depicts the efforts for control over the very bodies of ex-slave women even down to efforts to restrict their right to dance and 'joy their Freedom. The consensus that partying and dancing would restrict the women's ability to do a good day's work. But the truth was the desire to control and re-enslave these women by controlling their very bodies."},{"Title":"To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War","review":"For those of you who were tantalized by the community, culture, and hints of deeper history in Kathryn Stockett's recent bestseller The Help, Tera W. Hunter's To \`Joy My Freedom provides an intellectually stimulating and readable history of black women's urban work and politics in the American South following the Civil War. It provides a full-bodied history of the dynamics that seem so well-established in The Help. Stockett's work narrates the dynamics between black and white Southern women in the 1960s and the complexities that labor added to those habits, but leaves the intrigued reader begging for more of the history behind those relational and economic dynamics. Hunter's historical work, centering on the 1881 Atlanta washerwomen's strike, creates a groundbreaking context for an examination of black females' efforts to create independent political, cultural, economic and labor identities in the postbellum South.Tera Hunter's work, published in 1997, collects personal diaries, newspaper articles, court documents, letters, statistics, political cartoons, bank statements, early photographs and other primary documentation, in addition to secondary sources, to craft the first narrative of these southern black women's lives. Her excellent source work not only grants a new in-road to the academic study of this generation, but also gives depth to the stories of the women themselves. Hunter's sources enable her work to sufficiently challenge the historian reader yet remain accessible to the general reader. Divided thematically and chronologically, Hunter explores the development of black female social culture, class conflict, racial segregation, political independence, and political action, identifying key cultural, political, and labor developments of the eight-decade period between Appomattox and the Great Migration. Hunter suggests that involvement in the post-War Republican Party and establishment of hierarchically organized black social clubs, called mutual aid, benevolent associations, or secret societies, taught newly-freed southern blacks the patterns of group leadership and organization. This history, combined with the major contingent of black females working as domestic workers throughout the South, created a strong force of women. Hunter tells these women's stories for the first time.Hunter's personal accounts indicate these women's deep struggle and the resilient strength on an unprecedented level. Her work is groundbreaking in its gift of voice to a generation of domestic workers who knew slavery personally and whose early fight for liberty strengthened the black community life that supported the second, and more noted, Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. She empowers the cultural identities previously unrecognized by historians, granting inherent value to her work through provision of new source materials and content regarding black, urban women. Hunter's book is personal. This element of its composition is, perhaps, its greatest strength. Not only does Hunter newly examine a subset of Southern culture, but she gives the women a strong voice through direct quotes drawn from her strong primary sourcework. Her book is a sturdy and inspiring. It fulfills the scholarly requirements of academia yet crafts a strong, honest narrative that can appeal to the educated reader. It is especially important for readers with an interest in racial and gender history in the United States.Since I am such a reader, I recommend Hunter's book. It is certainly not a light read, with heavy data incorporation and a frustrating finish - one that begs inclusion of the mid-20th century Civil Rights movement. Yet, Hunter also leaves the reader extremely grateful for her hard work in excavating and exploring the new territory of urban, black female life in the South and, deeper still, a more complex understanding of the persistence of Southern black urban women. And for those whose interest in Stockett's The Help has propelled them to the end of this review, the domestic domain and subtle acts of rebellion in Stockett's 1962 Jackson, Mississippi, suddenly find themselves in the context of a larger, stronger historical group of black urban domestic working women. Regardless of your interest, however, Hunter's work is a worthwhile, educational, and engaging read."},{"Title":"Corn Snakes (Reptile Keeper's Guides)","review":"This book is excellent for beginning snake hobbyists. It covers corn snake care, breeding and housing. The book also included some excellent pictures of the different kinds of corn snakes. Along with providing helpful hints to keeping your snake healthy, the book provides information on the correct way to obtain your first snake! In my opinion, the best part about this book was the detailed way the authors take the reader step-by-step on constructing an incubator for snake hatching. Everything in the book is well organized to provide easy reference. At the end, a helpful glossary also allows easy reference.

I've lived in Vermont, with my lover, since 1976, but sail mostly in Maine waters on my gaff-rigged coastal schooner. So, while the book hooked me with its literary quality, my own experience mirrors -- to a some degree -- the author's. And I tell you: It rings true, with a beautiful, clean tone."},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"This is an interesting and fascinating memoir of one man's life who happens to love sailing and who is also a gay man living in a caring and loving relationship. You don't have to have a knowledge of sailing to enjoy this book. Although I have gone sailing a few times, I wasn't familiar with a lot of the sailing terms, but the author explains them very well. The author writes with dry wit, a questioning self-analysis, and deep passion. It was a pleasure to read his story, and it was never boring. This is a true-life story that will have broad appeal to many people.Storandt tells in vivid detail the story of his transatlantic sailing adventure from Saybrook, Connecticut to Ireland, then on to Scotland aboard his 33-foot cutter named Clarity. He made this journey with his longtime partner Brian, and their friend Bob. It's an adventure that turns out to be exciting, unpredictable, and even life-threatening. They certainly get to test their sailing skills through rough seas, gale force winds, and a fierce storm. It's not \\"The Perfect Storm\\", but it's close. Interwoven throughout his sailing adventure we learn all about Storandt's earlier life; his marriage, being a freelance musician, living in the Vermont woods in a geodesic dome, leaving his marriage, coming out, and meeting his soon to be life partner, Brian, a Scottish doctor.So whether you're hooked on sailing or just want to read a well-written passionate coming out story, this book is for you. I was disappointed when this adventure ended. As good a writer as he is a sailor, Storandt tells a wonderful story I couldn't put down till finished."},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"William Storandt wanted to sail across the Atlantic. And he was afraid he wanted to love a man. In this sometimes harrowing story of the ocean and the heart, Storandt tells us how he finally managed both.His journeys take him from Julliard to a hippie dome in the Vermont woods to a 30-foot sloop in a life-threatening gale off the coast of Ireland. His parallel course leads him from a youthful marriage to a live-in girlfriend to his first gay bar. And then to Brian Forsyth, a Scottish-born pediatrian at Yale.Storandt's clean prose and eye for fine Homeric detail make for an exciting yarn about an unusual life. You won't have to be gay or nautical to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"This book, in its less than 200 pages, kinda sneaks up on the reader. It starts out with the writer/narrator filled with self-doubts, both about the voyage he has embarked on and his life for his first thirty years or so. Stay with it and you will be richly rewarded. By page 80 or so I was totally enchanted, first by what slowly unfolds to be a beautiful love story. A love story told with such restraint that it wasn't until halfway through the book that I realized that Bill and Brian were actually a couple, and had been so for more than half a decade. He writes about his partner with such understated ardor that I was sure that the story would end in tragedy, or that merely the two parted company. Neither is true.Oh yeah, and Overboard was also a rip-roaring sailing yarn. And what would have been a rather pathetic coming out story (what took him so long?) until I realized how old he was. Denying oneself and getting married was a more reasonable survival strategy before Stonewall."},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"I bought this book because I was blown away by Storandt's first fictional novel, \\"The Summer They Came.\\" However, as a straight male who does not know the first thing about sailing, I did not know what to expect from this work. My enjoyment of Storandt's effort is all the more impressive, given my lack of knowledge about the subject matter. Like all master story tellers, Storandt lets the reader enter his world by describing the situation in detail, with references to more familiar subject matter. For instance, when explaining why he cannot get out of bed during a severe storm, Storandt says that he can no more get out of bed than a potato worm can unfold in your hand ... brilliant! Storandt has 2 running stories in this book. In the foreground is his gripping account of his sailing adventure to Scotland (the homeplace of his life partner) across the Atlantic. In the background, is a discussion of his and his life partner's lives up until the time of the trip, with particular focus on how they came to realize they were gay. I highly recommend this book to even the most staunchly conservative \\"straights,\\" and to the landlubbers most prone to sea-sickness!"},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"Sometimes a friend will surprise you. You know there's a memoir in the works, that it is to be published. Good for him. You'll have to read it. Reading it, you are impressed, knocked out, amazed. This is what happened to me with Bill Storandt's book, Outbound. The two stories, interwoven in alternating chapters, will satisfy both those seeking the taste of wind-driven mid-Atlantic salt spray and those who seek to better understand a gay man and witness his success in finding a life partner. There are wonderful side trips to Julliard, the Vermont woods, the Caribbean, the Scottish coast, and married life.The book also satisfies a larger audience, however, and it does so with the simplest and most difficult device: honesty. Bill gracefully and without pretense shares his difficulties and successes, both maritime and personal. It is no accident that his boat is named Clarity. Because he has taken the risk to be so honest with us, an unusual bond develops between author and reader. The authenticity of his voice causes us to care about his perception of the world and to examine how it compares with our own. This happens rarely and it is a privilege and an adventure. We are in good hands with Bill, whose gentle and persistent humor, thoughtful consideration, and respect for all parties make the voyages we take with him away from and back to safe harbors both illuminating and very enjoyable.I literally couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Outbound: Finding a Man, Sailing an Ocean (Living Out: Gay and Lesbian Autobiographies, Joan Larkin and David Bergman, Series Editors)","review":"Crossing thresholds, living dreams, staying steady and listening within!

It's a cheaply made deck of playing cards (I can buy poker cards of higher quality for $2.00!) The book is simply one where you ask your question and look up the answer next to the corresponding card. No interpretation, no predicting, just a nonsense answer with little relevance."},{"Title":"Gypsy Fortune-Telling Cards","review":"This set is not worth 15.95, and I highly recommend those that are interested in learning a form of Fortune Telling to look elsewhere. What you are basically spending your money is on a nicely made Box, because the deck is just a regular playing deck that you can get anywhere for around 1 dollar. The Book, even though a re-printing of an old book, is horrible. And sometimes things that are old should be forgotten. The answers are ridiculous.The format is quit simple, that any 7 year old kid could follow. It gives you an out line of how readings would go. Example. Does He Like Me? Shall I be sought after? What is My Greatest Attribute? And So Forth. Then the answers are ridicules. \\"Yes\\" \\"No\\" Maybe\\" \\"Today's Lost\\" Honestly I kept getting reminded of the Magic 8 Ball that you shake and the answer appeared in the little blue window.If you want interested in Divination learn from a cheap Rider Wait Tarot, and you can find books afordable relating to the Rider Wait anywhere.

This was more or less a parlor game in the 1920's and was never intended as a hard core spiritual oracle or anything deeper than that.

The play centers around the lives of the noble house of Cenci, which is daily terrorized by Francesco Cenci, head of the household. Francesco is molded in the style of other gothic villains, such as Radcliffe's Montoni and Walpole's Manfred, yet he manages to stand apart from them.Cenci is, in both word and deed, more insistently evil than either of the aforementioned figures. Cenci's purpose, unlike the other two, is not to increase his wealth, or secure his lineage, but instead to bring both to ruin. From the beginning of the play, Cenci seeks to eliminate his entire family. He firmly believes that his curses are heard and enacted simply because he is the authority figure in his home.Beatrice, Cenci's daughter, and her step-mother, Lucretia live in a state of constant apprehension and fear of Cenci. Beatrice is the tragic heroine of Shelley's play, whose beauty, apparent intelligence, and strong will prepare her only to be fully aware of the injustices of her father, common law, and religious law, and her inability to enlist the mercy of any of them to aid her family.As Beatrice, her family, and friends, attempt to wrangle out of Cenci's designs, they find themselves drawn into a whirlpool of desperate acts. The gender issues and politics of the play indicate the helplessness of women, be they strong (Beatrice) or weak (Lucretia), and point out a total disdain for autocratic and aristocratic rule, be it familial or otherwise.Written in 1819, only a few years after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, these issues may be a direct response to the disillusionment of Shelley, a second-generation Romantic poet, with the failure of the French Revolution to affect any real change. Poetically, it may echo his doubts about the effects of the Romantic visionary imagination. At any rate, &quot;The Cenci&quot; is a well-written, if occasionally outlandish tragedy, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Cenci","review":"Shelley's The Cenci is just one of many tellings of a true story that captures the imagination and the heart of almost everybody who hears of it. The story has been retold in many novels, even in opera.It is the tale of the lovely and innocent Beatrice Cenci, who in late 16th century Rome was molested by a corrupt and powerful father, Count Francesco Cenci. Her father was so well-connected that there was no one, not even the Pope, to whom she could turn for protection. So, with the help of her mother and her brother, she seeks the ultimate revenge and pays the price.Shelley's poetic drama is considered one of the best works of his short life. His treatment is more Shakespearean than poetic, but without the immortal bard's light comic touches. The Cenci is true tragedy through and through with a poetic touch that will capture the soul of the reader. I found myself reading passages aloud to myself to both hear the dramatic content and to better understand the meaning of dialogs broken into lines of poetry. This is not an easy book to read, both for its subject and its writing style, yet the reward is well worth the effort. Some of Shelley's greatest lines are in this work. Here is a brief segment from the 5th Act of Beatrice's words in contemplating her fate:Oh, trample out that thought! Worse than Despair,Worse than the bitterness of death, is hope;It is the only ill which can find placeUpon the giddy, sharp and narrow hourTottering beneath us. Plead with the swift frostThat it should spare the eldest flower of spring;Plead with awakening earthquake, o'er whose couchEven now a city stands, strong, fair, and free;Now stench and blackness yawn, like death. Oh, pleadwith famine, or wind-walking Pestilence,Blind lightning, or the deaf sea, not with man!Cruel, cold, formal man; righteous in words,In deeds a Cain."},{"Title":"The Cenci","review":"The Cenci is a tragic five-act play written and published in 1819 by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The work was one of Shelley's most critically acclaimed works and was his only work that was published in a second edition during his lifetime. The play was Shelley's most accessible work and the one for which he planned and anticipated not only critical acceptance, but popular acclaim as well. The controversial themes of parricide and incest prevented the play from achieving popular success during his lifetime.Shelley explained in the preface that the purpose of the play lies in \\"teaching the human heart\\": \\"The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of itself.\\" Tragedy results due to flaws in human nature or to events or circumstances that we cannot control. Each person, however, has freedom of will or a choice. Our own decisions determine whether tragedy is the outcome. Beatrice Cenci, the victim of an incestuous rape, chose to retaliate. Shelley wrote that peace and love were the appropriate responses to injustice and crime: \\"Undoubtedly, no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another; and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance, and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love. Revenge, retaliation, atonement, are pernicious mistakes.\\" It was by making these pernicious mistakes that Beatrice Cenci revealed her human flaws that ultimately culminated in tragedy.The tragedy, based on a historical event, is set in Rome in 1599. Beatrice Cenci is raped by her father, Francesco Cenci, although Shelley never used that term and the nature of the crime is left ambiguous. She then seeks retaliation against her father by planning his murder. By executing this plan, she subverts and destabilizes the established hierarchical and patriarchal norms and dogmas of authority of her time, upsetting the accepted order. Her parricide becomes a revolutionary act that must be punished to the fullest extent of the law to preserve the status quo and to maintain stability.Mary Shelley described the play as \\"the best tragedy of modern times.\\" She called the Fifth Act \\"a masterpiece\\" and emphasized that Shelley intended the play to be acted on the stage. Lord Byron wrote that the play was \\"a work of power and poetry\\" although he questioned whether it would succeed as a drama on the stage. Byron, nevertheless, concluded: \\"The Cenci is ... perhaps the best tragedy modern times have produced.\\"Beatrice Cenci struggles to find a way to confront oppression. She states that \\"what a world we make/ The oppressor and the oppressed.\\" Her brother Giacomo as well perceives himself as oppressed: \\"We are now no more, as once, parent and child, But man to man; the oppressor to the oppressed; The slanderer to the slandered; foe to foe: He has cast Nature off, which was his shield, And Nature casts him off.\\" They are, however, \\"as scorpions ringed with fire\\", who in popular myth, will sting themselves to death rather than be consumed by the fire.The Cenci is a dramatic masterpiece that examines justice and injustice, the role of the oppressed and the oppressor, and how human flaws result in tragedy. Ultimately, it is an attempt in \\"teaching the human heart.\\""},{"Title":"The Cenci","review":"The Cenci is not only Percy Shelley's most underrated work but one of the most underrated of all English dramas - nothing less than one of the best plays in the three centuries between the genre's Elizabethan height and its late Victorian resurrection. An excellent verse drama, it is one of the last of its kind, coming a few decades before prose became standard. As one would expect from a poet turning to drama, the verse quality is very high, reaching lyrical heights of extreme emotion and frequent beauty. Much of it is also very memorable, not so much epigrammatic as simply mesmerizing. Yet, unlike many verse dramas, it is believable as natural dialogue; Shelley somehow manages to play both ends well, as only the very greatest verse dramatists can.The story itself is more of a departure for Shelley. In contrast to his wildly creative and often intensely personal poetry, this is a historical drama. The tragedy of the Cenci family had been well-known for centuries and was in many ways ideal for drama; the unbelievably tragic tale of a man so evil as to be bent on destroying his own family only for them to be executed for his arguably just death could hardly be treated otherwise. Specific details were few, and Shelley essentially uses the basic outline and fills in the rest. The story would have been familiar to the audience had the play been produced, but Shelley's twists would have been more than compelling. He plays up the inherent drama for all it is worth and adds other lurid details, making for a highly wrought play that grabs attention quickly and keeps it. The result may be somewhat melodramatic, but we must remember the factual basis; Shelley may even underplay much of what happened for all anyone knows.The characters are also vividly memorable. Beatrice Cenci is one of the great pre-modern female parts, strong and highly sympathetic. Shelley was far ahead of his time in making a lead female character so independent, articulate, and powerful; this is one of the clearest signs of his proto-feminism and perhaps a large part of the reason the play was not staged for almost a century. Her many lines and their highly emotional nature make her a very difficult role; only the greatest actors can pull her off convincingly without being overdone. This is perhaps even more true of her father, who is one of literature's great villains - fully evil and thoroughly despicable. The same can again be said for most of the other characters in varying degrees.However, the play is not all melodrama and poetry; like Shelley's other work, it is notable for successfully mixing artistry with intellectual depth and political content. This last is muted beside his more politically explicit work, but he does touch on issues like the nature of justice, the fairness of the \\"justice system,\\" a man's responsibility toward his family, women's rights, etc. The play is very thought-provoking on top of being extremely moving and entertaining. Debate about its onstage feasibility continues despite several successful performances, but The Cenci is definitely a great piece of literature and should be read by anyone interested in Shelley, English verse drama, historical drama, or simply great writing.As for which edition to buy, the dedicated will want a deluxe standalone such as this, but most will be well served by a Shelley anthology including it. Whatever method is chosen, one will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Finding Your African American Ancestors: A Beginner's Guide (Finding Your Ancestors)","review":"This is a very good reference.

He focuses especially on the impact of Structural Adjustment Programs.Very roughly, health promotion is involved with the social milieu in which health outcomes are determined, not merely the doctor's office or the specific application of treatment, etc...It also doesn't merely involve itself with those aspects of the social milieu which determine how the doctor's office will be or how much access to treatment people will have. It also deals with how social factors impact health without necessarily being mediated through what is traditionally considered the healthcare system. A good example is that well known negative impact that economic inequality, in and of itself, has on health.To give examples of some of MacDonald's case studies - he shows how manipulative marketting campaigns have sold breast milk substitutes throughout the third world. This is inferior to breast milk, but there is of course no money in the latter! He details how pharmaceutical companies pay third world doctors according to how much they prescribe, so of course drugs are overprescribed. He shows how AIDS is spread because of female subordination, which is a result of absolute levels of poverty.Most importantly, he shows that health is a collective process involving personal empowerment and community advocacy, and he details case studies of such progressive strategies. The most extensive one is a study of Cuba which has an excellent portion showing the effects on health of the U.S. embargo. To avoid being sanctioned by the U.S. foreign companies must go through unrealistic amounts of red tape to sell pharmaceuticals to Cuba. They must fill out a 38 page application for each individual patient! The process taking months, of course. Cuba's infrastructure is built to U.S. non-metric specifications and relies on international suppliers for parts. Thus, the embargo prevents effective maintenance of infrastructure."},{"Title":"Third World Health Promotion and Its Dependence on First World Wealth (Studies in Health and Human Services)","review":"the title of this book makes me think of the idea: newspapers throughout the developing world have an item printed with Iodized ink; just eat the article to cure a disease that affected 2 billion during the 20th centurywikipedia says Iodine deficiency disease has affected two billion people simultaneously; a third of earths 20th century populationNewspapers are ubiquitous trash available as new used or trash to almost all humansprinting a nutrition Item brings Iodine sufficiency to giant numbers of peopleIodine sufficiency can be achieved with near 70 micrograms of IodineThere is also an opportunity here to put microgram micronutrients like V Sn B12 as well as birth defect reducing folate with the materialwww.halfbakery.com /idea/Iodized_20newspaper_20ink_20cures_20Iodine_20deficiency_20disease"},{"Title":"Third World Health Promotion and Its Dependence on First World Wealth (Studies in Health and Human Services)","review":"Theo has worked in Korea, Vietnam, the South Pacific, Nicaragua, South America and the Caribbean. He begins by setting the scene in which health workers struggle to do their jobs. He shows how the global debt crisis, expressing US domination of the international financial institutions, damages health across the world. US-imposed Structural Adjustment Programs force dis-investment in health and education. He notes how first world banks have made at least three times the amount they originally lent, and how no country has ever paid off its IMF debts.The heart of the book is a superb chapter on the Cuban model of development. 40% of Cuba's GNP, the world's highest proportion, is spent on health and education. By 1974, its doctor-patient ration was better than the USA's or Britain's, and in 1996 it could generously send 600 doctors to South Africa. Cuba has adopted the basics of health promotion - personal autonomy and high self-esteem, leading to neighbourhood advocacy and female emancipation, and to collaboration between health and education workers. Cuba is indeed a \`worldwide model of how to organise and administer global health promotion'. Its precondition is a social revolution, based on democratic participation; the old systems of representative democracy simply won't do the job.Theo presents a series of brilliant case studies of primary health care in Nepal, the World Bank-imposed user health fees in Uganda, the effect of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, the privatisation of pharmaceutical provision in India, and the IMF's \`shock treatment' of Peru. He details British American Tobacco's assault on China, China's development of its successful health and education systems after the USA ended all its aid programmes to China in 1949, the USA's use of GATT to stop Thailand banning tobacco imports, and the baby milk manufacturing companies' attack on breast-feeding. He also refutes Amartya Sen's pro-capitalist dogmas about the causes of famine.Paul Walker, Vice President of the Socialist Health Association, sums up the book's vital message in his Foreword, \\"capitalism is bad for health; effective health promotion requires a socialist economic and political milieu.\\""},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"An incredible novel of accounts from countless men and women who gave their all-their lives for past and future generations to come.As a grandson of WWII and Korean War Grandfathers, I strive to understand and relate to their past.

Life happens right?Carroll's collection of war letters is one of the most interesting nonfiction pieces I've had the pleasure of picking up. It is one thing to read the politics or the history of a conflict, it is another thing entirely to read the thoughts of the men and women who fought it. To read, in their own words, their motivations, emotions and understanding of history as it was being made.In most cases, the individuals who put pen to paper were not writers and Carroll did not make any effort to edit their correspondence. These letters are presented in their original format, therein preserving the value. What I'm saying here is don't expect perfect structure or grammar and be prepared to navigate some interesting variations of spelling. Look beyond that and you will understand my rating.I wont call this a must read. It isn't the kind of book that takes over your down time and creeps up on you throughout the day, but I will say that I greatly enjoyed it.

With the recent release of the movie Pearl Harbor, the questions that my generation wants to ask the veterans of war are rising out of the ashes once again. Carroll did an excellent job of putting together a collage of soldier's letters which portrays the true emotions of our freedom fighters. Recently having studied many of the wars included in this book, War Letters pulled everything into one book; from the Civil War all the way through Bosnia/Kosovo. The letters in WWI and WWII seemed more hopeful, and 'the great generation' seemed more patriotic. While the soldiers fighting Vietnam had more of a sense of urgency, kind of 'get this over with already' attitude. A common theme with all the letters was they were writing to loved ones, and would claim they would see them soon. Unfortunately, many of these letters were the 'last letters' to the families, some even written on backs of photographs, on scratch paper, or on Hitler's personal stationary. Also, these letters are written a few hours, days, or weeks after the events happened. The soldier has no opportunity to hear what the media said, or how the nation reacted to such a horrific event. They write with their souls, spilling their guts to their families, and shedding their blood for their nation. Granted, having just completed one year of US History helps me understand these events just that much more, but all in all, this book was everything from terrifying to heart warming."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book is rarely boring, but it doesn't get five stars for me on account of:1. The editor, Andrew Carroll, limited himself to only those letters that have not been published yet. Why? Are you going for a scoop? There are plenty of classic war letters from American history that will knock your socks off but that aren't in here, on account of their having appeared in print before. So don't think this is anthology of what Carroll views as the best, most representative, or most moving letters. No, to get in here you couldn't have been published before (although you could have been read on TV: parts of some of the letters have been read on various Ken Burns documentaries).2. There was too much interlarded text from Mr. Carroll. It really broke the spell for me. I mean, honestly. If your readers are educated enough to be picking up a book like this, do you really need, as the editor, to lay out what happened at Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge?"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"WAR LETTERS is a truly remarkable work that serves as both an excellent history of American wars as well as a highly effective meditation on war itself.

Each letter is extraordinary in its own way, and Andrew Carroll chooses to print them exactly as they were written, mistakes and all. In between the letters are brief descriptions of the letter writer as well as extremely well-written summaries of the various battles. The result is a riveting work that is both extraordinarily rich in scope and detail and deeply moving."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"Let me start this review by confessing that I am biased.

I did one a day, a felt like I got a wonderful- if that's the right word- walk through some of the most brutal wars our country has been involved in. I listened with my son, who is just starting to study the civil war in school, and found it to be a wonderful study aid- it brought up questions and perked his curiousity in certain areas that a simple textbook could never hope to do.The readings themselves are quite wonderful. Harry Smith narrates, and then you hear the actual letters read by a group of some of the best actors I've heard on audio books- Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Eric Stoltz, Campbell Scott and Edward Hermann. Apparently Rob Lowe also read some, but I couldn't tell which voice was his. In any case, the readings are simple and heartfelt, letting the words themselves sink in, and it's just terrific.If you want your children to get an understanding of the true horrors of war, listen to this with them.

Love letters come close but the emotions that a person taps when remembering some buddy blown away, nights of fear from being under fire, or some family member far away, result in an outpouring of oneself onto paper that is the essence of humanity. The letters here run the gamut of human emotional expression: fear, anger, grief, joy, love, faith, hope, courage, humor. They are from every major war or engagement that the US has been in from the Civil War through to the Gulf War and finally Bosnia and Kosovo. Soldiers, their family members, journalists, doctors and nurses, all have something to say to someone else that suddenly seems very important in the shadow of war.If you step back from the emotional impact for a moment and look at this book objectively, the the appeal of these letters and the willingness of the writers or recipients to make them public, may seem a bit puzzling. Afterall, they are all very personal letters. The mystery is removed when you realize that it's not a coincidence that these letters are singularly American; I doubt there would be such an equivalent public sharing from citizens elsewhere. Our openess is sometimes called American bravado and exhibitionism by others, but as these letters of humanity plainly show, they are more properly seen as simple testaments to honesty and truth.I for one am proud of a country that appreciates such human expressions but am even more proud of the many men and women who served or waited for those who did, and whose stories are told here. They, more than most of us, can appreciate the following sentiments.&quot;Everything that I have written is closely related to something that I have lived through.&quot; (Henrik Ibsen)"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"I was given this book by my daughter, and I had read from it from time to time.

The project was initially started when a fire in Carroll's home consumed all of his family letters dating back through history, making him realize that the preservation of such materials must be started on a larger scale effort, and prompting Abigail Van Buren to post in her &quot;Dear Abby&quot; column, a request for such letters. As expected, Carroll's mailbox overflowed, and 200 of the finest letters he received are published here.The correspondances range from soldiers in the battlefield writing home to their loved ones, wives, children, girlfriends, and friends, to family members updating soldiers on what is going on back on the homefront. Letters by Army-type and government celebrities such as President George Bush, Richard Nixon, General George S. Patton, General William Tecumsah Sherman, Julia Childs, Helen Keller, and numerous others can be found here, but most of the book is comprised of letters written by soldiers who were simple men serving their country.The writings are in their original form, unedited and without corrections, such as to show the personality of the writer and the conditions/stress under which the letters were written. While many are comforting and consoling as soldiers write love letters and those of reassurance back home, a great number show the fear, suspense, and horror of battle, while many of them describe death, being wounded, and the physical horrors of war in graphic detail. The fact that these men took the time to chronicle these events and the editor took it upon himself to organize and get recognition for them gives a great sense of appreciation.While many letters written during the Civil War are difficult to read due to the high rate of illiteracy and low rate of education then, these traits reflect the stress and time period of when they were written. Those written in World War II and Vietnam are the longest and most grueling, with their graphic details about mens death in battle, and the horrors of the concentration camps. The sections on Somalia and Bosnia are the shortest, but enough to give the reader a detailed look into the real situations that occurred there. Those written during The Cold War period are more political than anything else, and one of the only sections than touches the politics of war more than anything else.A small number of letters leave the subject of actual battle, such as ones chronicling the Kent State shootings, ones discussing reflections on the war after being home, and several prophetic letters written before war was declared, discussing the writers thoughts of the escalating situations.Each letter contains an explanation of the situation, the writer, and the historical events surrounding the war going on, and finally explains the fate of the writer, i.e. whether they returned home alive or not, or how their fate was met.More than anything, &quot;War Letters&quot; gives one a sense of pride to be an American and to have such a military that has laid down, and continues to lay down, numerous sacrifices for the good of its country. I only appreciate the freedom this country has fought for even more after reading &quot;War Letters&quot;, and have a great sense of pride in the countrys military. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially those who appreciate and indulge in history or need a crash course on the REAL side of war and its effects. 5 stars."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"Reading these letters is a bit like finding a stack of correspondence in your attic and getting to snoop on someone's old declarations of love or fear. I bought the book because an old family friend is among the soldiers with a letter in this book. The letters make for fascinating reading, after which you sort of gulp and read the italicized copy hoping to find that THIS soldier did not die in action. Too many did. I was surprised to find that the more recent letters (Vietnam and Gulf War) were the most interesting to me. For whatever reason, they seemed more morally complex and sympathetic. Great book."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"&quot;War Letters: Extraordinary Corrspondence from American Wars&quot; is an amazing anthology. Edited by Andrew Carroll and featuring an introduction by Douglas Brinkley, this book brings together a wide range of letters written by military personnel, nurses, family members, and others who have been part of the wars fought by the United States from the Civil War onward. The book is divided into several sections: &quot;The Civil War&quot;; &quot;World War I&quot;; &quot;World War II&quot;; &quot;The Korean War &amp; The Cold War&quot;; and &quot;The Vietnam War, The Persian Gulf War, Somalia, and Bosnia.&quot;Editor Carroll has been quoted as calling these letters &quot;this nation's great undiscovered literature.&quot; In his foreword, Brinkley gives probably the best description of the content of these letters: &quot;impassioned evocations of love and sacrifice, duty and honor, fear and confusion, courage and perseverance, rage and the intimations of mortality that spark it.&quot; The letters are mostly by ordinary people, but the letters of some famous individuals are included. There are letters from both men and women, and from people of various ethnic backgrounds.Enhancing the book is the presence of many historic photographs, as well as facsimiles of some of the letters. Probably the most extraordinary photograph is that of a letter pierced by a scorched bullet hole (the soldier, who was unharmed, was carrying the letter in his backpack when he got shot).It is not really possible in a short review to cover all of the remarkable highlights of this anthology. But some letters that particularly struck me: the angry, frustrated rant of an anonymous Union soldier from the Civil War; a letter by an African-American soldier serving in the Union army during the Civil War; General John Pershing's letter praising African-American soldiers who served in World War I; a Red Cross nurse's touching letter of condolence to the mother of a soldier who died during wartime; an eyewitness account of the attack on Pearl Harbor; an amazing letter from Adolf Hitler's nephew, Patrick, to Franklin D. Roosevelt; a letter from a Japanese-American woman who was placed in an internment camp; and a letter from a real-life &quot;Rosie the Riveter.&quot;The letters are accompanied by supplemental notes that put them in historical and personal perspective. This is a wonderful book that offers some very human perspectives on history."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"There are letters from \`very' different types of people such as George W. Bush (after he was shot down) and from George McGovern (who was a bomber pilot). I really don't care whose side (politically speaking) the authors of the various letters represent as long as it deals with the stated topic (WAR LETTERS). This is why I only gave the book 3 stars. What in the blue blazes are letters from Helen Keller (who is writing about a friend she once knew who is now in jail for being an American commie) & a letter from the American commie traitor Alger Hiss doing in the book? Neither of these letters even remotely have anything to do with an American War.There are other letters which also have very little to do with a U.S. war but I looked over these as they \`sort of' and that is a stretch - were leading up to a war. I do not know for sure - but I believe the author is a left of center sort of guy and it comes through in the letters he chose."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"After reading this I now realize why my father will not talk about his WW2 experiences in any detail. Anyone who can read this book without getting a lump in their throat or tears in their eyes has no heart. It makes me so thankful for those who went before, and so sincerely sad for those families who experienced the loss of children and fathers. It is a profoundly moving collection which should be required reading in every history class in the world, not just in the US. Deeply recommended."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book is a great book that has real letters written by soldiers fighting in war. This book is a definite buy if you have a realative who was in war, or if you are just interested in the fights. I recomend this book to really anybody who enjoys a good read about war. I know that I loved it, and you will too!"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"While this book is entitled &quot;War Letters&quot; it is actually a love letter to every United States citizen. The men and women who authored the letters within had no idea at the time what the future would bring, many were confused and most were scared. But they knew that what they were doing would make the world a better place for those to come.Andrew Carroll has done an amazing job. I don't know how he could have chose what to include or what to quote. I do know though, that every American should read this book and thank the men and women who have contributed."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"It's good to find a book that puts the carnival of carnage known as war in perspective, and such is the case with &quot;War Letters&quot;, a collection of correspondence from just about every great and not-so-great conflict in American history.The editor, Andrew Carroll, does a superb job of mixing the types and plights of the American servicemen and women who pour their hearts into the pages of these letters. Examples: a man who writes a last letter before his hanging for participating in John Brown's Raid at Harper's Ferry; a WWII soldier who describes the horror of liberating the Dachau Concentration Camp; a Gold Star mother writes to her son, thirty years after his death in Vietnam.The editor also sets up the letters nicely with italicized lead-ins that provide historical perspective.As a whole, love of country is somewhat evident in these letters, but even more prominent and common is love of family.War represents the despicably vicious side of mankind, and it's a poignant irony that the experience yields some of the most tender, loving and eloquent phrasings ever placed on paper."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"The book has some great war letters in it, and they are not all about combat, some very personal and touching ones. Many letters in fact have nothing to do with War and in fact are about personal matters back home.The Editor sometimes also sets up the letters with a bit of history behind the specific time of the war, a great touch.It makes war a bit more personal and in a time we find ourselves prepared to perhaps see another War, it makes you realize War is not a glorious thing as Hollywood would paint it. There is a time when you must stand and defend what you and your country stand for, but make no mistake, War means death and pain.The letter many of these soldiers wrote are touching not because of the bravery they showed, but because they showed often how scared they were or how no matter what was going on around them, they always kept their loved ones in their minds. It reminds us all that all soldiers have someone waiting for them back home.I recommend you read this book along with \\"Slaughter House 5\\" and see if you ever look at War the same again."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"I received this book as a gift because my family knows I love reading personal histories from those who lived it and \\"War Letters\\" seemed perfect for that. I enjoy learning what life was like for the average citizen in an era, whether its someone riding the Erie Canal in 1840, a foot soldier in the American revolution, or a journal from the Civil War.This is a remarkable book and taken individually there are many, many heart-rending emotional stories that probably need to be read by many people. It does in fact put a personal face on war. Because it is a collection of letters, the book is easily read in short spurts; you don't want (and shouldn't) read this book quickly.I only gave the book 4 stars because I actually found it hard to read. While the personal letters (the spelling, mannerisms of the authors) help tell their stories, it also keeps the book from developing any flow. Some letters are agonzingly slow to read and understand. I'm certainly not faulting the authors or their stories; but if you're looking for a great, well-written, smooth-flowing story that you can't put down, this isn't it."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"War Letters is an extraordinary collection of American correspondence pulled from each of the major US engagements from the Civil War on. The letters from servicemen and servicewomen range from mundane accounts of their military routine to moments of truth about their loved ones and reasons for fighting that are so honest and intense, you will be stunned. Combined with an excellent narrative that provides the background for each conflict, this unique volume also serves as a pretty good history book in its own right. However, that is just a fringe benefit. The letters encapsulate hopes, fears, and love, which makes them literature and history."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"I can't say enough good things about the book, video and articles produced by Andrew Carroll. In addition, he's a kind, caring and compasionate gentleman. If you want a true taste of what the soldiers and their families are feeling during war time, get this book. This is &quot;reality reading&quot;."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"I received this book as a birthday gift and was impressed with its many facts and photos. My Grandfather was a cook on the USS Nevada that day. He was badly wounded, but survived. This book describes the attack from start to finish with detail and keeps your interest without being too long. Its a good addition to anyones library!"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"If you are looking for purity and truth from the people who lived and died in the atrocities of war this book tells it like it was. I cried when reading the accounts of the men describing their desperation of loneliness, fear and courage. I treasure it."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book is awesome, I have read it numerous times. My heart goes out to the letters writers and receivers... I urge you to spread the word of this book... It will really open your eyes to see that Military Personel and their signifigant others are real people, with real feelings... I really look forward to another book like this coming out. I will definately buy it."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"War Letters, begun after a project to preserve the writings of our servicemen overseas during the Second World War, here expands on that program very well. With letters from most American military conflicts, this offers insight into quite a few people in very different areans confronted with a need to connect with those they care about. In most cases, the fate of each writer is given, and provides further glimpses into the writers' lives. The exmaple of a 15-year-old who enlisted in WW2, then went to boot camp, and then to combat, is powerful, and not to be missed. This book is very helpful in my classroom as we prepare for veterans' visits, and would be worthwhile for anyone."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"For those of us who have been affected by war, this book will touch your heart and soul. We have lived all those letters over and over again, whether it was in sending or recieving them. It is a true contribution to all veterans of all wars. And for all those who continue to keep a blind eye towards the cost of war and for all the draft dodgers, I dare you to pick this book up and read it, for it will tell you the sacrifices others were willing to make for you so that you may sleep comfortably in your bed at night. I also give thanks to Andrew Carroll for preserving a very important part of history, had it not been for him, these memories of war would still be sitting in some attics or filed away in some little treasure box. And to all those in the book who were willing to share their letters with the public my thanks and sympathy goes to each and everyone of you."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book blends the thoughts and feelings of soldiers in combat while at the same time it strips away the veneer of myth and romance that young men throughout history have felt at the unset of deadly struggles. It dispenses, without trying, the bromide that &quot;God is on our side&quot;. As we can see here, God is personal to each and every one no matter which side of the field they're fighting on. These letters are moving beyond belief, particularly as the fate of the writer is factored into the discussion at the end of each one.Andrew Carroll has done a wonderful thing here, and he needs as much media exposure as possible. As telecommunication technology proliferates on every continent it will incrementally reduce the ability of dictators to expose young men, in wars of attrition, to the maiming and death that so often awaits them; and let's not forget the heartbreak and emotional suffering of families and friends. The &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; and &quot;Modern Times&quot; should be read for perspective on why so many have died in the 20th century.Men who have seen combat don't often like to talk about it, the emotional trauma is just too great. On the History channel we are treated to interviews of veterans of various conflicts in past wars, usually on the anniversary date or some such. You can always see it in their faces, they never forget the horror, they choke up, they go silent, they look away, they shake their heads; this book tells you why. Reality is hard.I bought this book after hearing Mr. Carroll interviewed on the Gordon Liddy show. My wife's father was killed on the eastern front north of Riga in August of 1944. He was in the Wehrmacht and had just written home to his wife and two small children telling them not to worry, that he would be home soon. Three days later he took a direct hit from a rocket. I had to buy this for her. She had gone to Riga this past February to try and find the area where he fell, and she did although everything was just a jumble of mass graves.Good men die in all wars, and this book shows that in a way no other could. A blockbuster and one for the time capsule."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"War Letter's is an excellent piece of non-fiction, and i was truly moved by the bravery, and courage that all of these letters contained. To see a war through the eyes of the men, and women that were there fighting it just made it that much more real. The book is hard hitting, realistic, and brutally honest. An excellent book, and well worth the read. Enjoy, and Never Forget our heroes."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book is hard to put down. It reads easily. The format makes the reader feel as if the letter is to 'them'. Besides showing what these men and woman experienced ( physically and emotionally ), this book also 'teaches' history. This book should be a part of high school US history class. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This book is a great read. It is refeshing to be able to read words, thoughts and dreams from people as they perform such honorable duty overseas. This book is powerful and should be required reading for all, especially Americans.Some anti-war activist may think it is \\"pro-war\\" but it isn't just that. This book reveals personal thoughts and challenges faced by American military personnel in wars from the Civil War until the later conflicts in the 20th century. It is pro-war, anti-war and everything in between.This book reminds me of the sacrifice that so many make for their country. It is a great tribute for those who have served."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"This is quite literally one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I am not a history buff, nor do I typically like reading books about war... this book, however, integrates narrative works (through letters) with tidbits of historical significance and has captured me. Not only were the letters compelling, they helped me understand periods of time that I did not have the privilege to live in. I only wish this book had been published when I was failing high school history class."},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"Those who have read this book before me and left their reviews have said it all. It's almost impossible to read these letters with a dry eye.This novel compiles letters written during the most prominent wars of our Nations history. I read these letters, almost feeling like I was peeping into another's life, and felt my heart wrench. It brought me to a different state of mind, I began wondering how I'd act or what I would do, in certain situations. It was like I had a chance to live in their shoes; military personnel, nurses, journalists, celebrities, and the leaders of our country at the time. It was enthralling... I'd curl up on the couch with my book in hand and emerse myself in letters written from a long ago time.Mr. Carroll has a knack for writing, and his compilations of letters bring a new sense of awareness for what we went through as a country. What our military men & women went through as they fought daily for the freedom we take for granted, and they do it all for the love of their country. Their family.I highly recommend this novel! Thank you, Mr. Carroll!~Gina"},{"Title":"War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars","review":"Strolling through a local bookstore, this book caught my eye, I read the covers, and immediately bought it. I consider myself a very patriotic American, although I normally don't read up on the subject of War. This puts you inside the mind of Soldiers from all wars &amp; skirmishes dating back to the Civil War. Not only are the letters from the soldiers, but also the loved ones they left behind to fight for our great country. It's amazing to read all the emotions these people were going through, and to get their perspective. Highly recommend to others!"},{"Title":"Practical Mono (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"At first glance, you would think that Practical Mono is yet anotherintroductory book about C# and Mono, but all of that drasticallychanges the moment you look at the book's table of contents and seethe variety of topics it covers and the lengths to which the authorgoes to describe the more important details.The book gently eases the into what .NET and Mono are giving ahistorical background for each. What I found very interesting is thefact the author takes time to explain about .NET in the real world,and ties this to Mono to give the reader a clear idea of how any whyMono was started and what the reader can do to participate in thiseffort.Since a lot of people using Mono might be coming from a traditional.NET environment, the author expects those people to be used tocertain development tools. To that effect, the second chapter in thebook is dedicated to introducing the reader to development tools thatcan be used with Mono, especially Mono Develop. This gives the readersome heads up about what can be used instead of their conventionaldevelopment tools and makes sure you start off on solid grounds.Having gotten the user all set up and ready for action, the book thenmoves on to introduce the author to C#. This is a subtle introductionthat eases the user into what C# is and how the language works.Chapter 3 comes in very handy when you want to brush up on your C#skills or are new to C#. the author continues to give the reader moreinformation about C# in a more detailed fashion in Chapter 4,\\"Learning C#: Beyond the Basics\\". This chapter goes into somenitty-gritty detail about C# classes, exceptions, and all round moreadvanced C# topics.Chapter 5 moves into the more exotic areas of .NET that deal with theCLR, IL, assemblies, and the general assembly cache (GAC). Thischapter is very helpful if the reader wishes to acquire in depth infoof how the .NET environment works. Other discussed topics here aregarbage collection, application domains, and the class library. Thisis one of those chapters that make this book an excellentrecommendation for both novice and advanced users of C# and .NET.The first 5 chapters have made sure the user is very knowledgeableabout what Mono is, what .NET is, what C# is, and how all of themrelate to each other. They have also explained C# and introduced thereader to its syntax and advanced features. Starting with Chapter 6,the \\"Practical\\" bit from the books title starts to kick in quitestrongly. If its a book with both theoretical and real worldinformation that you want, then the coming chapters are really goingto quench your thirst.Chapter 6 goes right into the heart of on of .NET's most desiredfeatures, Windows Forms. The author explains what Windows Forms is,what GDI+ is, how to implement a good user interface, and gives realworld examples of how to do all of that introducing the reader toWindows Forms' various controls. A nice section that is mentioned inseveral chapters is the \\"Whats New in Version 2.0?\\" section thatinforms the reader about what to expect in the new version of .NET inregard to that particular topic.Because the author knows that not all people will be using WindowsForms to design their graphical interfaces, he goes into GTK+ andGlade and takes up a complete chapter explaining what they are and howthey can be used instead of Windows Forms. Chapter 7 serves as agentle introduction to the GTK+ and Glade world, and makes sure theuses knows how to pick between Windows Forms and the GTK+ / Gladecombination.After finishing Chapter 7, the user has a very good idea about how todesign a complete graphical user interface using freely availabletools (Windows Forms in Mono, and GTK+ / Glade using GTK# in Mono).The author now moves on to describe ADO.NET, a heavily used feature of.NET which is also available through Mono. This chapters enlightensthe reader and explains all aspects of using ADO.NET in applicationsto connect and utilize databases. The particular example is gearedtowards installing MySQL. Explanation is given both for Linux andWindows, which also shows that Mono can be used as a .NET alternativeon Windows.Since XML is constantly referred to as a \\"hot topic\\", the author doesnot let us down and dedicates a complete chapter to discussing XML andMono. If the reader is new to XML, then he / she will be pleased tofind out that an explanation to what XML is and its history is givenat the beginning of Chapter 9: Using XML. The chapter deals withlooking at XML documents and traversing them. The author shows us areal world example by applying this knowledge to create an RSS feedclass library.Chapter 10 is for those of us with enthusiasm for networking andremoting. This chapter, \\"Introducing Networking and Remoting\\", startsby explaining what networks are and their general concepts, then divesinto how we can do networking related programming in .NET. We applythis knowledge later on and create an RSS feed handler.Another heavily used feature in .NET is ASP.NET. Chapter 11: UsingASP.NET, explains what ASP.NET is, how it works internally, and how touse it. This chapter shows the reader how to set up a web server forASP.NET (both the XSP web server and an external web server) and moveson to show the user how a web service can be written. A lot of readerswill find this chapter very useful as web services seem to be anincreasing and expanding field right now.Finally in Chapter 12: Using Advanced Mono Techniques, the authordives into such topics like performance tuning, reflection, and usingthreads. Advanced readers will particularly like this chapter as ithandles some of the \\"harder\\" more demanding features of .NET.This book not only serves as a great learning experience that showsyou how things are done in the real world, it also as a general goodreference for C#, .NET, and Mono and several of their features.Definitely one you should have in your bookshelf right by your workdesk.I enjoyed reading Mark's book, and I would recommend it topeople that are either getting into .NET / Mono or have someexperience but would like to further it."},{"Title":"Practical Mono (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"I have used .NET before but only in a limited capacity and I was interested in using .NET on Mono. I therefore found the C# primer useful, but obviously not a replacement for a dedicated book. However, the step by step way in which I was introduced to key topics was intuative and easy to understand and its coverage of most .NET topics was comprehensive, especially given the constraints of a single book."},{"Title":"Practical Mono (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"I picked up this book, hoping it would be to the usual APress standard and I wasn't disappointed. I've played with .NET on the Windows platform before but had often wished that this technology would be made available on Open Source.When Mono was introduced, I wanted to get my hands dirty but not start learning all the facets of .NET from scratch and without having to go through the trauma of understanding the implications, how GTK+ may hook in etc.I was therefore overjoyed to find that this book covered all of this and more and using a practical book project rather than theoretical examples. It starts gently which I was happy to go through as I picked up a tip here and there. The C# primer chapters were comprehensive and I use them to as a reference guide.Then we went into chapters that covered ADO.NET, ASP.NET, XML, Networking and much much more. The Author has not only covered the essentials but added tips along the way and these proved very useful in ensuring that I was following a standard path.At the end of the book, I feel comfortable with .NET and Mono and its all within the familiar surroundings of Open Source. How could it get any better!I'd therefore recommend this book to anybody wanting to no more and .NET, Mono and more."},{"Title":"Practical Mono (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"This is the poorest excuse for a programming book that I have purchased including many from Apress. It is very dated even if only a couple years old, does not reflect the current state of Mono. Commands are plain wrong. The author doesn't complete instructions and the sample scripts are incomplete. I finally gave up at the ADO.Net chapter where he almost tells you how to setup the database in MySQL.

From misplaced/mislabeled figures to blatently incorrect code, to out-right confusing paragraphs/sentences. When I said \\"OK for experienced programmers\\" in the title, I mean the kind that have the ability to see past the mistakes and could fix most of the errors; they are usually obvious, however I have at times needed to look up external resources to figure out the correct way to write the syntax and other things. I cannot imagine how a person new to programming would manage to make it past the third chapter (Introducing C#), and I would not blame that person, I would place blame on the sloppy authorship and editing of this book.I am seriously considering returning this book in favor of another which does not require me to double-check it at almost every page."},{"Title":"Practical Mono (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"I received this book yesterday.

This book fills a gap in the currently available books on directories in that it not only covers directory basics, such as namespaces, schemas, and various APIs, but also important subjects such as replication, synchronization, directory access security, and metadirectories. The last 7 chapters of the book concentrate on a diverse selection of case studies, which are always welcome when researching one's own directory strategy. Although books by Howe et al and Weltman &amp; Dahbura are also excellent, they are either more verbose or more targeted at programming for Netscape directories.More importantly, the focus of this book is how to use directories to build scalable, highly available applications, rather than simply using directories for white or yellow pages applications. It includes discussion of the directory standards, as well as the popular variations and extensions on the standards. For example, there is an appendix covering some different access control mechanisms used in several directories. The CD includes useful IBM Redbooks as well as programs that can be used with Active Directory or the included IBM SecureWay LDAP Directory.The chapters are divided into relatively brief subsections that highlight the subject of the chapters well, making the book easy to read and reference. The sample programs are simple, but useful foundations to perform a variety of tasks using a directory."},{"Title":"Main line of Mid-America;: The story of the Illinois Central","review":"I ordered on Saturday and the book arrived the following Wednesday.

It gives parents a realistic view of what children are and are not capable of at different stages in their developement. It helps us realize just what our children's capabilities are and how to maxamize our teaching.Dr. Healy's writing style is very easy to read, informative and lively. The chapters are laid out in such a way as to make it easy to find any area of interest. For most of us, motivation is a subject we discuss often. Under &quot;Tools for Learning,&quot; she lists &quot;Motivation (pg.190),&quot; and &quot;Ingredients for Motivation (pg. 214). In each chapter, she outlines key information about the subject, for example &quot;Raising Motivated Learners,&quot; and &quot;Dealing with Motivation Problems.&quot; She gives anecdotal stories to underscore the information she presents, which makes it much easier for a layman to understand.This book definitely impacted not only my teaching style, but bettered my relationship with my teenager. This is an important book to have in your home."},{"Title":"Your Child's Growing Mind: A Guide to Learning and Brain Development from Birth to Adolescence","review":"If you buy this book to learn about your baby, plan to hang on to it for many, many years. I have a newborn AND a 14-year-old. Although there was a lot of interesting information concerning my newborn, I learned even MORE about my older child! I really wish I had had this book a few years ago when she was struggling through sixth and seventh grades. I finally understand why she struggled! There were tips in this book that would have helped. This is a book I will try to reread at least once a year because the information is relevant to so many stages in your child's life. It is easy to read, enjoyable and useful. I especially like the bullet points of things to do at the end of each section."},{"Title":"Your Child's Growing Mind: A Guide to Learning and Brain Development from Birth to Adolescence","review":"It details in a clear, parent-friendly way the various developmental phases growing children go through and explains why it is so important that they be allowed to go through those phases.

It makes an excellent gift to give to new parents."},{"Title":"Your Child's Growing Mind: A Guide to Learning and Brain Development from Birth to Adolescence","review":"This book is a must given the intense pressure on kids placed by parents and educators on the young nowadays. I have enthusiactically recommend this books to all my friends with young children. The topics on the development of the brains is definitely a good read for parents who are pushing their kids beyond their development stage. Beware that your kids may miss out on developments/experience that will be necessary in the later part of his/her life"},{"Title":"Your Child's Growing Mind: A Guide to Learning and Brain Development from Birth to Adolescence","review":"Just ordered another 3 copies of Healy's book (1994 edition). This book was recommended in my doctorate program in education as a MUST HAVE for anyone who is expecting. The suggestions of how to build brain capacity and learning begin while a woman is pregnant, so I've purchased it for all female family members who are now expecting as well as those who have recently had babies. I've also purchased a copy for my elementary school's parent resource center. The information presented in Healy's book presents the transitions of the brain through the school years in a practical, easy to understand manner."},{"Title":"Your Child's Growing Mind: A Guide to Learning and Brain Development from Birth to Adolescence","review":"This is a great book for learning about neurological development in children, in *accessible* language. As a teacher, I used to share MUCH of the information in this book with parents in my class. If their child was just beginning to read, I photocopied a couple of pages about supporting emergent readers; if their child was struggling in math, I photocopied pages about the neurological pathways associated with Math.I think it's an invaluable resource for teachers and parents alike, valuable enough that I'm buying it again, after loaning out my copy, never to see it again :)"},{"Title":"Look at the Moon: Curriculum Enrichment Series","review":"Beatifully illustrated by Indiana artist Jackie Lacy, this book is timeless and educational.

I already have the &#34;Best of Baltimore Beauties II' and had been searching for the first book. The patterns in this book are not duplicates of the Part II, but some do sometimes appear similar but with subtle differences. Overall, I would say the vast majority of the patterns are unique to this book. The one thing this book does not contain are color photos of the patterns. I found this disappointing but not of such consequence that it impacted the patterns, only my desire to see the work in color.There is the same history as in Part II of each block's design which is helpful and informative. There is also an addition to this book of several 'Baltimore' style designs but with a modern twist. This book is an excellent to any Baltimore collection and will inspire you with the detail and devotion required to complete one of these album quilts so many years ago."},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"I am an experienced quilter who loves Elly Sienkiewicz style of quilts, and owns a number of her books.

Many of the projects in this book reference her first book for detailed instructions.

As a new quilter, I have been looking forward to doing a Baltimore albumn quilt. The book keeps refering to previous books and lessons to learn how to use the patterns, but does not attempt to explain or assist the reader in any way. I do not own any previous books so this one leaves me cold. Not recommended for new quilters like myself."},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"This is the second book of STRICTLY Baltimore Album Applique Quilt Blocks, sized for 12 inch squares. (if you want larger squares you would have to enlarge the well defined blocks) There are about 6 pages of color displaying variations of the same and similiar simple blocks shown in the body of the book. Most of the blocks in this book are contemporary designed blocks from students of the author. However there are some complicated floral basket designs from historical Baltimore Album Quilts as well. This book is only for the experienced applique quilter who is familiar with Baltimore album Quilts - since it is primarily only patterns to choose from in making your own quilt. This book will not teach you how to make a quilt, nor how to applique etc as only earlier books by this author contain these instruction. Since I have all the authors books, I found this a delight to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"I'm disappointed there are no color photos of quilts to show these patterns."},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"Elly Sienkiewicz books in the past have been absolutely fantastic.

There is alot of variety - roses, wreaths, vases, papercuts, etc, but almost every block refers you to Baltimore Beauties and Beyond Vol 1 to know HOW to put them together. I am an experienced quilter and love to applique, but have never tried Baltimore-type blocks. I think Vol 1 is probably the book to begin with, and The Best of Baltimore Beauties is more of a pattern resource for quilters that are Baltimore-experienced!"},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"This is an excellent book for all fans of applique quilting. I've looked through almost all of Elly Sienkiewicz's previous books but have never yet purchased any of them. I'm glad I waited for this book. It really does contain some of the best designs by Ms. Sienkiewicz. Probably not for beginning quilters as the focus is on the patterns and not technique, but the experienced applique artist will enjoy the many challenging blocks. It's definitely a great addition to my quit library!"},{"Title":"The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns for Album Blocks and Borders","review":"I found lots of patterns in this book. Great!

This feature is helpful when looking for block designs of a specific theme for a quilt."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"This is a wonderful resource.

I was CONFIDENT in my travels! I'm looking forward to my return trip to Paris! Thank you KAT!"},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"I'm glad I didnt let Joan M guide my decision to purchase this guide. Obviously, she was looking for a general book on Paris. That's not what this book is. It's for people who want a SPECIFIC experience in ADDITION to the general sites and \\"how to\\" get to these places WITHOUT being taxi dependent, especially for first time, non-French speaking travelers. Anyone can show you where the eiffel tower is, for goodness sakes and the internet, while helpful, is no substitute for hand checked, personally examined sites. If you want to know where the Eiffel Tower is, any general guidebook can take you there. But if you want to see a side of Paris that few people are privy, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"Kat Tracking Through Paris is a bare bones no frills guide to Black Paris. There are no glossy pictures or maps which is one of its flaws. The information is direct and to the point, with little narration by Ms. Kat herself. Although Kat does list the major black haunts and hang-outs of Black Paris, the book seems cold and impersonal. Other than the little introduction by Ms. Kat at the beginning of the book, there is little narration throughout the rest of the book. On a good note, I did like the book because Ms. Kat's directions to all of the hotels, restaurants, and clubs listed are precise and to the point."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"Before I first went to Paris in July of 2002, I tracked this book down.

I went back again in October 2002 with my trusty pocket sized tour guide. Once again, Kats directions and recommendation are right on point. Thanks Kat, for giving me life long memories.

This was a useless book as well as a waste of my money. I purchased it specifically because it professed to give a black perspective on Paris. You could do better researching on the internet yourself. As a travel book of any kind, it was a poor excuse. Do not waste your money. Purchase a traditional travel guide for a lot less and a lot more info."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"If (and that's a BIG IF) this suuuper-slim book(let) contains any unique kernels of information, they are certainly not worth your hard-earned $20. The price is especially ridiculous when you consider that there are books three times as thick, with glossy photos and a real wealth of information about Paris overall, that cost less even before any discounts. I was sorely, sorely disappointed in this book, and I am returning it first thing Monday morning. I turned around and bought the Eyewitness guide instead, which gave me some real insight into Paris as a whole, and then for that black/African-American/African angle, I did some research on the Internet, which led me to find out about the Goutte d'Or neighborhood and various restaurants of interest.As much as I griped about the price, I think even if this book were priced in the $7 - $10 range, I would still give it one star or at the most, two stars. There is simply not enough information in here for it to be much of a guide at all."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"I have not traveled to Paris yet and never really got excited about going.

I'm going to Paris next year - with Ms. Kat."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"This was my first trip to Paris, in June 2010. Of all of the guidebooks I had looked at, this was absolutely the most useful and well-written, especially in helping me to figure out how to find my way around the city and navigating the Metro system. I kid you not -- every time I started to panic with Metro anxiety, I was able to calm myself down by telling myself, okay, remember page 15 -- Kat said it's not that complicated -- it's just like identifying the Fremont/Richmond train on BART (being from the San Francisco Bay Area, that was an analogy I could relate to)."},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"I am wondering what book Joan M read??!! It could NOT have been Kat Tracking Through Paris.....an easy-to-read and even easier-to-follow Guide to Black Paris. As the founder of BLACK PARIS TOURS and an ex-pat who has lived in and loved Paris for 11 years, I recommend reading Kat Tracking to all of my tour clients preparing to come to Paris -- anxious to find and explore the culture and cuisine of contemporary Black Paris. I appreciate the annual updates Kat Tracking provides. I'm amazed when folks come to Paris looking for restaurants and night clubs that have been closed for YEARS. But not if they have read KAT TRACKING first! Kat Tracking Through Paris is the perfect sized, light weight travel companion to throw in your purse or back pocket and hit the streets to adventure, good food and fun in Black Paris!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris","review":"Some Paris travel guidebooks (both general and black culture-specific) provide practical and historical information before taking readers on colorful strolls around the world's most beloved city, and that approach is fine. Others take readers on walks through Paris neighborhoods while imparting the information, which is also fine. Because there is room on the savvy traveler's bookshelf for more than one or two kinds of Paris travel guides, I purchased Kat Tracking Through Paris: A Guide to Black Paris, and added it to my bookshelf. This travel guide transports readers directly to the information it offers. I highly recommend it.Kat Tracking Through Paris provides concise, easily accessible entries that are chock-full of information, and not just about the great touristy monuments and navigating one's way around the City of Light. It also offers information on particular African American, West Indian, and African restaurants; plus selected hotels with reasonable rates (some black-owned, some not), where famous black writers, visual artists, and musicians from history lived. Additionally it gives readers information about famous caf&eacute;s, some of which were the haunts of writers like James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Poet Ted Joans, and others. It steers travelers who are interested in the nightlife scene to the Hip Hop, Reggae, and R&B; clubs. It leads Jazz devotees to a number of historically famous Jazz clubs that are still open and popular today.I took Kat Tracking Through Paris with me on my most recent visit to Paris. The book's size and format made it convenient for me to either pack it into my carry-on luggage or slip it into my tote bag. I chose to slip it into my tote. While using this guidebook in Paris, I found it expedient not to have to consult an index or wade through superfluous pages in order to locate the exact information I needed. Kat Tracking Through Paris is well organized, full of information, and user friendly. It is a valuable travel resource!Reviewed byVee Garcia, Author ofthe Paris & Jazz Novels,FORBIDDEN CIRCLES andTHE JAZZ FLOWER"},{"Title":"Chow Chow: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This book has been very helpful to me.

I liked the 1980's cover of the last edition best and recommend this title if you can find one!"},{"Title":"The Twisted Thing (Signed)","review":"&quot;Crime novels are a good way to make money&quot; Mickey Spillane is quoted as saying. &quot;Twisted Thing&quot; which appeared in 1966 proved to be still another money maker for him.&quot;I, The Jury&quot; (1947) was the beginning, the beginning of a round of thrillers by then unknown Mickey Spillane. Mike Hammer, one of thrillerdom's ace protagonists was introduced, and the world couldn't read enough of his adventures.Today Mickey Spillane is 85-years-old, and acclaimed around the globe for inventing the hard-hitting, hard-boiled protagonist who is a compelling mix of sex and sharp shooting. It's hard to believe this many years have gone by for the Brooklyn born Spillane. He's outlasted and out sold many of his contemporaries, and when last heard from was still hard at work.Perhaps those of us who love to read don't take time to thank the writers who have given us so many hours of pleasure. I certainly fall into that category, so a big hats off to Mickey Spillane and gratitude for the wealth of reading pleasure he's given so many."},{"Title":"The Be (Happy) Attitudes: 8 Positive Attitudes That Can Transform Your Life","review":"We in the United States have so much to be happy about, but are we happy?

On perception, consider the quote in this book from Karl Menninger, &quot;Attitudes are more important than facts!&quot; Attitude relates to need. We are interdependent and being aware of that truth is liberating. In the body of Christ, we are gifted to contribute to others. In turn, we receive the benefits of other people's efforts on our behalf. Or as Dr. Schuller puts it, &quot;...the deepest need of the human being is the need to be needed.&quot; We need to use our gifts. Our satisfaction comes from making a difference. Humility is admitting we need help.In reading Dr. Schuller's works, including this one, there is a realization that here is a man who is writing from first hand experience. He so powerfully teaches on forgiveness that you just know only a person who has mastered that challenge can so eloquently address the issue. This is an encouraging look at the Beatitudes. One additional point worth pondering is that Dr. Schuller believes Jesus gave them as a logical progression. He believes that one is a stepping stone to the next one."},{"Title":"The Be (Happy) Attitudes: 8 Positive Attitudes That Can Transform Your Life","review":"i love this book. first read it around the time it first came out, and it has stayed with me since. just bought it on kindle for mobility. his paraphrases of the individual beatitudes are genius. great stories to illustrate + all dr schuller's years in ministry combine to bring great insight and wisdom to this key teaching from the sermon on the mount."},{"Title":"The Be (Happy) Attitudes: 8 Positive Attitudes That Can Transform Your Life","review":"I think this is a excellent book for anyone. The book brings out the morals and virtues that we all bascically believe in, but don't necessarily portray or adopt into our lives. This is a positive book which relates to any situation from spiritual to chewing gum (HaaaHaa). This is a real book about real every day situations. A highly recommend this authors' books, though they might be repetitious from book to book. The advantage of the repetition is ok in a sense that it is sort of testing your memory or retaining of information, which is good because you will know if you got the message.

I practice Taoism and found this book very helpful in understanding the internal martial arts of Taoism. Master Dong takes you through a journey which is deceptively easy. The student get their first taste of the reverse-breathing technique of the taoist. I can say that the book is presented in a very understandable way with all the motions of each exercise presented a fully as possible. While the book cannot replace the instructions of a master, the book does give the reader a chance to experience the energy flow of the taoist internal martial arts. I found the book very helpful in that the techniques described can be used carefully by a person is not the best of shape and needs a &quot; low impact&quot; exercise technique. The techniques presented in the book are powerfull. I would recommend anyone who tries the forms demonstrated in the book to realize that the forms must be done on a regular bases as a part of a complete taoistic experience to have the best effect on both mind and body. The book really wetted my appetite for more and I have placed the forms demonstrated in the book with my other daily taoist practices.

If you have not felt energy flowing in your body before, then these claims will sound strange. When I started Chi Gong, I decided to practice without judgment. After about a month of daily practice, I suddenly felt a flash of energetic warmth pass through my breast bone --the first sensation I had of Chi. Since then, the sensation of Chi has grown to the point where I feel as though I am in a warm invisible energy field with these flowing movements. My hands become hot as the energy channels through my body and around me. This little book of Chi Gong technique, by Master Dong, is the definition of still water runs deep.

Having read the book I have a far more ambivalent opinion - the concept for the book is excellent, the photography is excellent, the research for quotations is excellent - but the book is filled with over-simplifications. For example, it refers to the &quot;Boddhisatva&quot; ideal in Buddhism as if were basic - in fact, the southern school of Buddhism does not share this as an ideal. It refers to the practice of clearing the mind and non-attachment as if this separated mind from body and nature, whereas many of the traditions see these practices as making one more aware of the physical world as it is i.e. minus the distorting factor of mind. It refers to the washing of feet as &quot;little known&quot;, an editorial comment that would puzzle most Catholics and other &quot;high church&quot; Christians. It speaks of gifts of the spirit (charisms) as if they belong to an exclusively Pentecostal strain of Christianity.While the book occasionally notes its oversimplification, I am not comfortable with balance it achieves. It is, however, an excellent way to introduce the concept of physicality in prayer.

Before reading this book, the only way I knew the speak to God and express his presence was by praying, but this book showed me otherwise. I thought that is was very especially touching as it allowed me to really pause to think about the ways I express the presence of God in my life and the way I view my spiritual life. Since I wouldn't consider myself to have a very enriching spiritual life, after reading this book, it has inspired me to really think about it and search for spiritual insight. I would love to have a go at some of these such as \\"table grace\\" and \\"the cosmic mudra\\" which is basically meditation as I find it very relaxing and a good way for me to take a break from reality.

Even so, as Christie entered her sunset years, the nature of her novels changed, often becoming less interesting for the complex plots that made her reputation than for a their chatty charm.Such is the case with 1964 A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, which finds Christie revisiting her favorite character Jane Marple--but in a unlikely setting. Suffering from arthritis, Miss Marple has been sent on vacation to a south seas resort by her nephew Raymond. The weather is lovely, the sea is lovely, and Miss Marple finds her incredibly bored... until the unexpected death of retired Major Palgrave forces her to wonder if there is, as the Major seemed to suspect, a killer in this island paradise.The plot is entertaining but, for Christie, surprisingly transparent; most readers will spot the killer approximately two thirds of the way into the book. The great charm of the book is in its characters and the deftly amusing way in which Christie presents them. A visit with Miss Marple is always enjoyable, and she remains every one's favorite English spinster--and Christie presents several other characters, including the very wealthy and very gruff Mr. Raifiel and his ever-calm secretary Esther, both of whom will figure in the 1971 NEMESIS.Hardcore mystery readers in search of one of Christie's truly mind-bender tales may be disappointed with A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, but most Christie readers will find it unexpectedly light but none the less enjoyable for that. Recommended for fans.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"..Agatha Christie to read.This is not a good example of her writing. The pace was slow, the characters were a bit too &quot;cookie cutter&quot; and it didn't contain any of the wonderful puzzles that AC is well known for.Miss Marple is on a Carribbean vacation, where, suprise, a murder occurs. Or is it murder? Only Miss Marple can solve the mystery.Is anyone really suprised that the happy couple really aren't? Is anyone really suprised that characters aren't what they appear? This book was too stereotypical for me. AC is not an author strong on character development, however she usually does a better job than this. Similarly, she sends Miss Marple to an exotic locale, then barely describes it or utilizes the locale for differences in her writing. It could just as easily have taken place in St. Mary Mead.If you're an AC fan, you may like this book. I found it readable, but not great. If you're looking for a &quot;classic&quot; AC, try something else: And then there were none, Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

Notable for its beautiful locales as well as the interesting dialogue among the various characters, the most interesting of which is the interplay between Miss Marple and Jason Rafiel, an old, ill millionaire who despite this failing powers, still comes to her assistance at a crucial moment. This also sets the stage for the sequel to this book, &quot;Nemesis&quot; where Mr. Rafiel asks for Miss Marple's help in solving another, much older crime. You should definitely read that as a followup to this one."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Caution!This Book Could Make You A Mystery Addict, too!~ ~ - ~ ~I first read \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\" at age 12, when we were away from our home in Boston, MA, and staying in Israel for a year's sabbatical. I was desperate for anything in English to read and resorted to my mother's paperback mystery collection. I was so excited and intrigued by this story, that it started me on a Mystery book addiction, now going on 32 years worth of mystery reading.~ ~ - ~ ~I remember the chill down my spine at the intricacy and \\"rightness\\" of the solution to the mystery. The story is very simple. Agatha Christie's sleuth Miss Marple has been sent on a vacation to the Caribbean, supposedly to relax, by her wealthy nephew. She meets an interesting group of fellow travelers at her hotel, and watches them carefully. A retired Military gentleman is ruffling the other guests feathers in his blunt way, and is with a group that includes most all of them when he is suddenly very upset by something he has seen or heard. When he becomes the victim of murder, Miss Marple must deduce what it was that had affected him so, in order to find the killer.~ ~ - ~ ~This is a wonderfully entertaining example of the \\"Classic\\" mystery, with a fixed group of suspects, a circumscribed location, and a wonderful sleuth to follow. I like Helen Hayes in the movie adaptations of Miss Marple. She seems as endearing, and as seemingly muddle headed, shy, and retiring as the Miss Marple of the story.This book follows the unwritten rules that the clues were there all along, but you just don't see them, until the case solution is revealed.On reading the solution to this neatly done mystery, I felt that spine tingling sensation- and it remains the standard that I use to judge the success of a mystery.~ ~ - ~ ~You don't have to be new to mystery stories to enjoy this light, easily read, entertaining book.

This is an actual Kindle version so the navigation and type-setting are appropriate to Kindle.Book review -Great story. This is one of my favorites (although you'll hear that about probably two thirds of the Agatha Christie novels that I review).The puzzle is decent, the red herrings abound, and the characters are fun and interesting. If you are new to Agatha Christie the Miss Marple mysteries can have her as a main character or as a side note, basically working in the background. This one is actually as much about her, putting her in a new setting, making new friends, experiencing the world... basically taking her out of her comfort zone.If you have not previously read any of her works I would recommend that you read one where the detective is the main character - whether it's Miss Marple or Poirot. The ones where they are incidental characters are not as satisfying if you are not familiar with their quirks and their methods."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This novel was written late in Agatha Christie's career when she was already well into her seventies. So, not too surprisingly, it's not as good as the novels written during her prime from the late 1920s through the mid-1940s. The book is a little short, at about 220 pages and somewhat sketchily written. Christie was never a great one for extensive descriptions of her settings, but here she dispenses with description almost completely. The novel is set at a Caribbean resort, but I never had a clear idea of what the resort was like because she doesn't bother to provide much description. The mystery is decent, but not exceptional, and the herrings are a little too red. There are too many suspects with more or less the same potential motive. Anyone who has not yet read all the Christie's from her classic period should read those books before this one. Anyone who is close to completing the Christie cannon will probably find this one at least mildly enjoyable. I will say I love these Black Dog editions, which at less than $10 on Amazon are a great bargain."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"If this is your first Christie buy, don't do it.

Normally, they are excellent mysteries, but when she sets them in uncharted territory, you have the extra dimension of the unusual setting, which adds to the atmosphere of the book, and the overall satisfaction of the plot. I cannot explain it very well, really.This book is raised above the excellent Miss Marple norm by being set elsewhere, in the parching heat of the carribean, where relaxing and enjoying the sun should be the order of the day, not cold-blooded murder. But, this is an Agatha Christie novel, and she is no respector of venue.The plot is excellent. Some of her Marple mysteries tend towards the tedious and boring, with very little real excitement or action. This one breaks that trend. there is action a-plenty, violent death, vicious murder, intriguing characters, intrigueing murders, the whole cavalcade.Marple is at her best here, and Christie's solution is unexpected, and very good.

All classics. People rarely remember Agatha Christie for 'A CARRIBEAN MYSTERY' with brought one of the best settings to the table without a good mystery. Because I read this book long and slow, even referring to and re-reading chapters from time to time, I found it to be predictable. Even a teenager could figure this out in no time. I feel the writing is somewhat overdone. This is the usual with classic British authors (ahem Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) but I never found this to be the case when reading Miss Marple books. While Peirot books are somewhat unrealistic, Miss Marple books portray the best plot.Likewise, I was annoyed by the sloppy redudancy and predictablility, but it is a classic Miss Marple book. You can expect the wit, force, and nosiness that makes her likeable. You can expect her to take more role into the mystery unlike in books where there is an inspector or chief detective from Scotland Yard. This is a good thing. The ending might give you a surprise but the biggest shocker will be a 'double' at the end.

To readers of this review, I mention this because I read Nemesis before this book and therefore could easily eliminate several characters from the list of potential suspects.Ms Marple's brain could not rest even though she was supposed to be on vacation in a beautiful Caribbean resort, courtesy of her nephew Raymond. Just the day before, the retired Major Palgrave was yakking away to her his life experiences, the following day, he was found dead in his room. The verdict was heart attack, which Ms Marple found strange as the major had no history of heart problems. Or could it be related to the photograph of a murderer whom he was about to show her but changed his mind hastily?Though set in the tropical West Indies, the background was quite incidental, similar to a number of Christie's other tales set in exotic locations. A failing of Christie in these books was to cause the rich background to fade to near obscurity. Perhaps this was her method to train the focus of the readers to the characters, underlining the customary emphasis of Hercule Poirot and Ms Marple that to understand a murder, one must look into the people, their character and their interpersonal interaction. While a legitimate claim, nevertheless, such an approach would render the titles of these books near to the category of false or misleading advertisement.Another disconcerting feature of the book was the readers were offered many glimpses of happenings not available to Ms Marple. Thus while the clues were in abundance to the readers, they were not supposed to be so to Ms Marple. However, Christie revealed some of these information to Ms Marple in almost a ridiculous manner, female gossip.As an avid reader of her mystery book, I pit my armchair detective prowess against the array of pieces presented and my correctly deducing the answers were not as satisfactory as I considered this one of the less hard mystery. The pattern is clearly discernible, one just needs to know where to look."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Another Kindle edition. Love having it on my Kindle.

The next day he is dead and Miss Marple is in her element as she recognises the types of people among her fellow guests who remind her of people in her home village of St Mary Mead.I particularly liked some of the characters in this well written mystery especially the irascible Mr Rafiel and his attendants as well the Hillingdons and Dysons who seem to be friends who do not always get on well together. There are plenty of clues and plenty of red herrings before the murderer is finally revealed by means of some clever deductions by Miss Marple and Mr Rafiel.This is not St Mary Mead but it is entertaining reading with an interesting background and Miss Marple proves herself to be as resourceful as ever even if her age is catching up with her."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Elderly spinster Miss Marple is enjoying a relaxing Caribbean holiday funded by her nephew Raymond, basking in the sun and socializing with other guests in the Golden Palm Hotel.

But finally something piques her interest - he claims to have a photograph of a murderer in his wallet. He is just about to share it with her when something strange happens: he suddenly stops short and hurriedly returns the photograph to his wallet, looking flustered as a group of hotel guests arrive.Miss Marple never sees the photograph herself, but her suspicions mount when Major Palgrave is found dead, and the photograph missing. Miss Marple tries to share her suspicions, but knowing that the testimony of an old lady will only be scoffed at, comes up with a couple of rather clever ruses in order to gather information. Finally she gets the attention of the very old, very wealthy Mr Rafiel, who becomes her confidant and sounding board.\\"A Caribbean Mystery\\" is a diverting read, but certainly not one of Agatha Christie's best. The killer is so obvious that I ended up think that it must be someone different, only to be disappointed when it *did* in fact end up being the obvious character - though I suppose there's no predicting how another reader would approach this particular mystery. Maybe you'll be surprised. In saying that though, there is something a little pedestrian about this plot: the characters aren't particularly vivid and the pacing feels a little off. It does introduce the wonderful character of Mr Rafiel who reappears (in a way) inNemesis, but several aspects of the story feel a little far-fetched (even by Christie standards!)Despite the exotic location, it doesn't really figure into the mystery much, except in the utilization of a rather dated portrayal of the West Indies and its people. Still, no Christie is ever not worth reading, and Miss Marple is still her same delightful self, underestimated by everyone as she solves devious crimes in slippers and pink cardigans."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"The Caribbean Mystery was my least favorite of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries and in fact, I skimmed quite a bit of it.

It may not be the most macho reading in the world so don't tell anyone I enjoyed it!This is a fun, quick read about a murder on a fictional island in the Caribbean. Christie was extremely prolific so her characterizations may not have been the best. I recommend an edition with a list of characters at the beginning because, as the cast of suspects is trotted out, there is little to distinguish them at first besides their names.I enjoy Agatha Christie's books because of the window they provide on the time in which they were written.

One day in the Caribbean, he is about to share a photo of a murderer with Miss Marple but he suddenly hides it. The next day he is dead. She realizes that something is going on and that she may be the perfect person to solve who did it.Thoughts: I thought this was a pretty good Marple. Again she is underestimated by most of the people around her because she is an elderly woman who blathers. But they are wrong of course and she does figure it all out. It was very interesting to see the part that rumors played in this novel as they serve to confuse the characters and the reader.The characters are very colorful: Major Palgrave, Mr Rafiel, the Kendalls, the Prescotts, the Dysons, and the Hillingdons, among others. Rafiel proves to be an important ally to Miss Marple as they are both on the ball in hunting down the killer before s/he can strike again. Molly Kendall seemed like such a sweet lady and she was probably one of my favorites.I did not figure out the murderer but I did figure out part of the mystery (I also did not like that that person was the murderer because I liked him/her).

Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Miss Marple escapes the rigors of an English winter, thanks to her nephew, the successful mystery writer Raymond West. He has sent Jane on a Caribbean vacation and it is at the Golden Palm Hotel on St. Honore that we find her with her ever-present knitting needles. After the eventful life she has led in St. Mary Mead, however, Miss Marple finds the island life a bit boring. But all that is about to change rather quickly. It begins one day when another elderly guest, Major Palgrave, is about to show Miss Marple a photograph of someone he claims is a murderer who got away. He stops short when four other guests approach, any of whom may have heard the conversation. A chambermaid telling tales and two murders are pivotal in this mystery that Miss Marple solves with her usual shrewd detection skills. Notable to this book is the introduction of Jason Rafiel, an ill, rude, and extremely rich guest we will hear of again in &quot;Nemesis.&quot; He recognizes in Miss Marple a kindred spirit and together they form an effective partnership which prevents further murders."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"A Caribbean Mystery is the only Miss Marple mystery in which the intrepid old lady from St. Mary Mead finds herself away from English soil. The doyen of crime is taking a much needed vacation in the West Indies.She is on the St. Honore island enjoying the holiday paid for by her devoted nephew Raymond West. She becomes acquainted with Major Palgrave. Palgrave recounts to her stories of his days as a soldier in the British empire's distant outposts including Kenya. He tells Jane Marple he will show her a picture of a murderer which he has in his wallet. He then changes his mind when he sees someone looming over Miss Marple's shoulder. The Major is later found dead. Police suppose he died of high blood pressure. However, Mr. Rafiel an elderly guest at the hotel tells Miss Marple that Palgrave did not have high blood pressure. He was murdered.There are two more murders in the short novel. Suspects include Colonel Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon; Gregory and Lucky Dyson; Timothy Kendal and his wife Molly who is often ill. Whodunit? Join Miss Marple in the search for clues. The conclusion of the case is intriguing and quite clever on the part of author Agatha Christie.The novel was published in London in 1964 making it late but good Christie. Not one of her major works but a corking good read for a wet afternoon or quiet evening besides the fireplace!"},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Murder still finds Jane Marple even while she is away relaxing on a Caribbean vacation.Major Palgrave, a fellow vacationer, is full of stories (maybe made up, maybe true), one of which concerns a serial wife-killer. Miss Marple thinks nothing of it, but Major Palgrave suddenly dies, seemingly of natural causes. Half convinced that Major Palgrave was murdered, Miss Marple sets out to find a killer, armed with the help of an unexpected ally, the very crochety Mr. Raifiel (who will also figure in another Jane Marple mysteryNemesis).I thought \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\" was a pretty entertaining read - and Miss Marple was a hoot as she went around pretending to be a scatter-brained old woman as she 'interviewed' the other vacationers, trying to get more information about Major Palgrave. My only problem with the plot is that Agatha Christie wasn't quite so clever about hiding the guilty person here. Yes, there's red herrings a-plenty, but there's only a handful of characters that can be considered suspects, and out of them, the murderer was pretty obvious, given the initial story or clues given by Major Palgrave."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"As other have mentioned, if this is your first time reading AC, I would recommend Death on the Nile of Murder on the Orient Express. I got this book hoping she would make use of the Caribbean setting, unfortunately, AC really didn't get too descriptive with the setting at all. Also, I noticed she left a lot of character actions unexplained, ***Possible Spoiler, but not really***, such as why Mrs. Hillingdon had gone to the chemist one random day. I would have liked if this action were explained, not that is made a difference, but I don't like to random incidents thrown at me just for the sake of throwing me off the scent. Character development also leaves much to be desired.This book was just OK to me."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Miss Jane Marple is on vacation at an isolated resort on a Caribbean island. She is half-listening to a \\"Colonel Blimp\\" type going on and on about events in his past. He tells a story about a serial killer and pulls out his wallet to show her a photograph of the killer. As some other people approach, he suddenly puts the wallet back and quickly changes the subject. That night he dies, and the photograph disappears.Thus starts a \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\". Needless to say, Miss Marple investigates and uncovers the murderer. This is a classic \\"cozy\\" murder mystery -- small number of suspects in a isolated environment. The plot is good and definitely \\"fair play\\"; characters are above average; atmosphere is very good; the pace is deliberate but not pokey; Miss Christie's characteristic humor is present but not consistent (Miss Marple and the parson's sister have some really great exchanges).So why isn't this one of the best Miss Marple books? I'm not sure. The plot is certainly not as good as most of the others and has a blatant cliche (murderer kills the wrong victim). Other than those weaknesses, there's nothing wrong -- it just seems as if it could have been/should have been better."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Are you tired of picking up boring books? Do you struggle to find good books? Well I have the book for you. the book \\" A Caribbean Mystery\\" ia very interesting book. I would highly encourage anyone and everyone to dive into this murder mystery. This novel is one of eighty that Agatha Christie wrote during a fifty-year writing career as well as nineteen plays and five nonfiction books, including an autobiography. This novel was written for her good friend John Cruikshank Rose with memories of their trip to the West Indies. The book is about a group of people who were vacationing and during their vacation they encountered a scare. When a man suddenly disappear and is found dead, the group begins to worry. Pick up this book next time you get the chance and solve the mystery"},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Re-reading A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY for the nth time, I was struck by its family resemblance to another Christie piece from another time. Stripped of its idyllic, and beautifully drawn island setting, it's basically the story of Molly, a young married hotelier scrambling from dawn to midnight to keep a struggling establishment running, aided by a husband with as much energy and charm as she. Why, it's THE MOUSETRAP all over again except drenched in sun instead of buried in snow. After having told THE MOUSETRAP in radio format, on the stage, and as a novella, might it be that even fifteen years later, something about the marriage of Molly and her husband kept working itself out in Christie's creative unconsciousness? It's almost as though she had yet another twist to tell about this story, and couldn't of course change THE MOUSETRAP, so she just wrote it again changing nearly all of the plot except for what was important to her: Molly's apparent efficiency and cheer, a mask for what seems to be a deeply ingrained history of breakdown and blackouts.Naturally this makes me want to relate this to something about Christie's own life, famous for its 1926 incidence of \\"disappearing.\\" From this period (1963) on, too, you get more and more of Christie's heroines acting out, they seem demented, and the men in their lives have to rescue them from mental instability and/or drugs (AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL, THIRD GIRL, BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS). As everyone knows, Christie's later books are marked by an increasing vagueness and insistence; and you really have to be in the mood. I have a weakness for A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, Christie's only novel set in the Americas. It has problems galore but at the same time, some of Christie's most vivid characters and intriguing subplots, with echoes of the famous \\"Brides in the Bath\\" case, as well as the real-life \\"Caribbean mystery\\" of the death of Sir Harry Oakes in Nassau (Bahamas) in 1943, the case which implicated the then Duke of Windsor right up to his royal arse. You'll find echoes of the Oakes enigma all throughout A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, as well as a timely reminder that you don't have to be paranoid to have enemies, but it helps."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"but you can't stop murders from following.Jane Marple had been quite ill, her doctor had recommended a vacation to a warmer climate and her kind nephew, wealthy Raymond West had obligingly sent her out to the West Indies to recuperate. Miss Marple found the new surroundings both comfortable and exotic but also just a bit boring. At least until the murders began.Soon the village parallels began to surface as past sins came to light. Naturally the quiet old lady in the background managed to arrive at the answers first.This 1964 novel has worn well with only just a few comments that would be judged politcally incorrect today dating it just slightly. This one also leads into the 1971 NEMESIS by introducing wealthy invalid and kindred spirit, Jason Rafiel.Despite the exotic location this is very much a \\"Jane Marple cozy\\". The resort hotel, guests and staff take the place of the usual village and residents. As always with a Christie mystery the clues are all there for the reader to follow but the plot twists and turns to make it a challenge to arrive at the solution before Miss Marple."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"I actually give this book 4 1/2 stars. Why not 5 stars? Unlike in the book Evil Under The Sun, there was no fast pace to accompany the exotic locale.(But then again, who would associate this with Miss Marple anyway? She's more acquainted w/ the \\"slow pace of the country\\" type of setting) Other than that, I thought this book excelled in every other way imaginable.The mystery takes place on the carribean island of St. Honere'. Miss Marple takes up with the likes of several of her elderly peers,one being the very lonely and long-winded Major Palgrave. Major Palgrave was in the annoying habit of recycling story after boring story. Miss Marple obliges the old man as much as she can bear it until he recalls a tale of murder that he happened to know of third hand. He begins to show her a picture of the murderer in question until he sees something that dissuades him from doing so. And before long, the major winds up dead. Miss Marple makes it her business to sniff out a murderer amongst her fellow travellers.A.C. fans will not be disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"I think that A Caribbean Mystery is one of Christie's best mysteries. At least for me, the ending was quite surprising and I would never have thought of it (however, the fact that I'm not a very good sleuth may have something to do with it!). This book has many twists and turns and even though it's set in a limited confined atmosphere, it still manages to have the breathtaking atmosphere that only Christie can create. The end is really surprising, akin to the end of The Sixth Sense for those who have watched it. Even though many people have said that this book has stereotypical characters, I don't think the characters are that stereotypical and the culprit in the end is not as obvious as some thick-headed people seem to think. I recommend this book to everyone, Christie fan or not."},{"Title":"Essential Dynamic HTML fast: Developing an Interactive Web Site (Essential Series)","review":"This book barely got into DHTML at Chapter 10.

Illustrations are exquisitely created by the master illustrator, Anton Pieck. Children ask to hear these stories again and again."},{"Title":"Stories from Arabian Nights","review":"The Arabian Nights, also known as The Thousand and One Nights, is a collection of tales that I would personally not mind if I lived a few of them. The stories date back at least to 947, and it is amazing that great literary stories such as these have been kept alive by the dreamers who embrace them. This book by Naomi Lewis is only a small collection of the stories. I encourage dreamers to read this book as a starting point for finding the perfect mysterious fantasy collection.One thing to love about this book is the fact that it is the equivalent of today's campfire stories, only these take place hundreds of years ago. These stories are the middle-eastern viewpoint of stories that are universally used. For instance the story \`The Anklet' is of course Cinderella, yet it is also \`Ashputtel' in Germany. Many age-old stories have been translated and have drifted around Europe and neighboring continents, giving us a similar story plot but are characteristic of the culture they come from.Personally, I love to read a collection of good short stories, and the structure of this book has kept my attention. A girl in danger of losing her life to a mad husband tells the stories. So the great stories in the book are a result of, in fact, an outside story. This novel structure is one that definitely keeps my attention, and my eyes glued to it. For those who have trouble finding a good book to read to the sleepy kids, this is an excellent bedtime book. And on a side note, mixing a bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate topping and reading this book before going to bed will guarantee a night of stellar dreams."},{"Title":"Carrara: The Marble Quarries of Tuscany","review":"This gorgeous book is about the centuries-long process of destroying a body of rock. Every picture shows a landscape or an interior white with the dust of Carrara's exceptionally pure marble; stonecutters white with the dust; even some pictures where you can't tell whether it's fog or dust in the air, or whether it's snow or dust on the rooftops. Carrara is the source of marble for some of the most revered works of sculpture in the Western canon: Michelangelo's David and the Pieta; Bernini's busts, St. Teresa, and hundreds more. To see it all as essentially an industrial process, and to see the people who have given their lives to quarrying this rock, is beautiful, bitter, and moving. There's also a great essay at the back by an Australian anthropologist, which is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The life triumphant","review":"An amazing book that will help you get through the dark nights of the soul and emerge triumphant.

It's a story about a cynical, burnt-out development exec who has to turn a raw, hapless, would-be screenwriter into a Hollywood \\"player\\" to win her treasured severance package. The love object is overshadowed by the secondary characters, but the plot builds to a zany climax and ends on a surprisingly sweet and satisfying note, as the dispirited heroine, Lizzie Hubbard, slowly gets her groove back.

I have included all the categories listed below, along with two sample questions from the section.1) Knowing God (19 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Why does God remain invisible?\\" and \\"Why does God love us so much?\\"2) Who Is Jesus (9 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Was Christ capable of sinning?\\" and \\"Did Jesus ever laugh?\\"3) The Work of the Holy Spirit (10 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Does every human being have the potential to receive the Holy Spirit?\\" and \\"What was the role of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament?\\"4) The Book of Books (17 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"How were the books of the Bible selected and compiled?\\" and \\"How do you know the Bible is true?\\"5) The Way of Salvation (23 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Why did God save me?\\" and \\"What do good deeds have to do with salvation?\\"6) Sin and the Sinner (13 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What is meant by the term original sin?\\" and \\"Are there gradations of sin?\\"7) Faith and Philosophy (14 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Doesn't science disprove Christianity?\\" and \\"Is there a distinction between Christianity and religion?\\"8) The Power and Purpose of Payer (11 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"How can we, as Christians, have more power in our prayer lives?\\" and \\"Does God hear the prayers of the non-Christian?\\"9) The Growing Spiritual life (27 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What do you do in your daily devotions?\\" and \\"What concerns you most about today's Christian?\\"10) Understanding Satan (6 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Can the Devil read my mind?\\" and \\"Has Satan been given dominion over the earth until Jesus returns?\\"11) Heaven and Hell (16 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Will we recognize each other in heaven?\\" and \\"What happens to animals when they die?\\"12) Sharing the Faith (10 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What is faith?\\" and \\"Is the Christian faith really rational?\\"13) Church Life (26 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What are the basics to church growth?\\" and \\"What is the most crucial issue confronting today's church?\\"14) Marriage and Family (22 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What should make Christian marriages distinctive?\\" and \\"Are there biblical grounds for divorce, and if so, what are they?\\"15) Career Issues (9 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What is the biblical concept, if any, of retirement?\\" and \\"How can an employer show employees Christlike dignity?\\"16) Money Matters (10 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What do you believe the Bible teaches about tithing as it relates to Christians today?\\" and \\"Is there a clear biblical position against lotteries and casino gambling?\\"17) Life-and Death Issues (7 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Does the Bible say anything about euthanasia?\\" and \\"What should be the Christian stand on the death penalty?\\"18) Suffering (12 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"What is the difference between God testing us and tempting us?\\" and \\"If God is all powerful, then why does he allow suffering?\\"19) The End Times (12 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Are we living in the last days?\\" and \\"What does Scripture teach us about the future role of Israel?\\"20) Lifestyle Ethics (17 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Should Christians impose their ethics on non-Christians?\\" and \\"Is it wrong for scientists to engage in genetic engineering?\\"21) Christians and Government (13 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Are biblical solutions to world problems outdated?\\" and \\"Should Christians work to have Christian values in public policy?\\"22) Puzzling Passages (19 Questions asked and answered) - for example, \\"Why in the Old Testament does God demand so much violence and war of the Jewish nation?\\" and \\"The Lord says in the Old Testament that he loved Jacob but he hated Esau, and in 1 John, John actually says that if we say we love God but hate our brothers, we're wrong. How can we reconcile these two passages?\\"I think this is a resource you will use for life - especially for Christian leaders, pastors, counselors, missionaries, and teachers - who deal with similar questions in their respective ministries on a regular basis. The index in the back of the book makes this a resource that you can use to find if a specific question you are struggling with, or have been asked is included. It is not exhaustive, but has a lot of the questions that most Christians struggle with and are asking. It also makes a great gift for someone who loves to study God's Word."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"I bought this book because every year, our church has a theological question and answer night, and this book has a lot of good questions that people ask about the Christian faith.R.C Sproul is eminently qualified to write this book because he is a leading apologist for the Christian faith. I especially appreciated his answers to questions related to God's sovereignty and man's freedom, the identity of Jesus Christ, the reliability of the Bible, and heaven and hell. Sproul's questions and his answers will prepare and help a pastor or Christian layperson explain the faith to those with inquiring minds.I also appreciated the humble spirit that Sproul brings to this book. He knows that it is an awesome thing to teach the word of God, and he feels the weight of the calling (you can tell this by reading the introduction).It should also be stressed that R.C Sproul is a five point Calvinistic Christian. That means his answers to questions related to predestination, eternal security, the end times, and the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross are going to be slightly different than the answers a less Calvinistic Christian might give.For example, Sproul believes that God predestines certain individuals to be saved and chooses to pass the rest of humanity by. He also teaches that Jesus died only for those chosen to salvation.He also teaches that the coming of Jesus predicted in Matthew 24 is a coming in judgment on Jerusalem and the temple, not a 2nd coming to establish a 1000 year millennial kingdom on earth. Some believers in Christ do not hold these positions, and yet they color a number of Sproul's answers.But the preponderance of the book gives solid, evangelical answers to the questions people ask. Sproul is also not afraid to say that sometimes, the answer is \\"I don't know.\\" This is a good book, and I am glad I found it at the Barnes and Noble book store.Rev. Marc Axelrod"},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"Dr. Sproul does an excellent job of addressing tough questions we face everyday. He breaks up the book into eleven sections. Each section contains numerous questions. This book is an excellent reference. I also notice that visitors are always picking it up. Therefore it is an excellent tool in evangalism."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"Having this book in my library is quite valuable. It allows me access to sound theological and reasoned answers to many question that pop into my head. This is not meant to be a highly technical book, but of the more general question variety. It is very good at what it does. I would assume Sproul wrote this so he wouldn't have to answer so much mail on the same questions. So if you like the wit and wisdom of Sproul, I highly recommend this book. Not so much to read through, but for reference use. Especially if you question a lot and desire answers."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"This is an excellent resource book for answering a lot of questions that are common to people struggling with spiritual and/or moral issues."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"This is a book I give to Christians who are looking for many answers to the common troubling questions out there they are presented with by their unbelieving friends, or even their own selves.This would be one of those books you'd like everybody in the church to read just to be better prepared and more confident in their faith."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"Once again, R.C. Sproul uses his conversational style to shed light on tough questions in Scripture. His insights and deep understanding of the Bible should help any serious student of Scripture. I recommend this book highly.Samuel Hall"},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"After absorbing his answers I found myself asking more questions and, questioning some. Most were familiar, although, the book did contain an assortment of questions which were new. In general, his doctrine is sound, however, there is a few instances where there is sure to be disagreement. Some of these we may agree to disagree, where others demand further examination. We mustn&#8217;t&#8212;and Sproul would certainly agree&#8212;fall into the trap of subjective thought, or relativism.I think he stopped short at times, nevertheless he gave simple, far from exhaustive (a couple pages), yet sound, answers; and several, profound, were very much worth underlining. I spent time studying the conflicting answers and determined them partly unbiblical, particularly concerning salvation, fraternal organizations, children and infants, abortion, predestination, and some ethical.It is good to test and replenish our minds, and to equip ourselves for when we are asked. In this way the book was helpful.Scott"},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"I loaned out the copy I had on my book shelf, which never got returned so I was hoping to at least replace the original with a good copy, without too many dog eared pages or markings.To my surprise and glee, I got what can only be called, a brand new book, exactly as the one I've lost, AND this one only cost 1/5 of the original price.I am so happy I took the chance and the book arrived in a timely manner.I cannot be happier with this purchase."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"Soft cover book by R>C> Sproul, \\"Now that's a good question\\"The item arrived in good condition and in short order.

What I appreciate so much about this book and other books by R.C. is that he goes strictly by the Word of God. I always read R.C.'s writings with the discernment the Lord so graciously gives to His children. Rarely do I ever find anything that even slightly conflicts with what God has spoken. This book will be a blessing for anyone seeking a deeper relationship with our Lord."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"This book is more autobiography than question and answer. It gives a profile of the man who also wrote the book \\"Roman Catholicism.\\" R C Sproul gives adamant defense of anyone who criticizes freemasonry because his family background grew up in the Lodge. This explains the real reason, the hidden reason, he criticizes Roman Catholicism. This explains why he refuses ecumenism with Catholics. In fact, it is ironic that he can offer ecumenicism with Freemasons, who are gnostics, but deny such ecumenicism with Catholics, who are Trinitarian. Another, more legite, reason for his veiw on Catholicism is his Calvinistic theology. However, just because Catholics have \\"negative faith\\" in the sense they assert \\"we don't know if we're saved,\\" doesn't mean it is no faith. Catholics believe there were sins so aggregious that it cut off our relationship to God. Did not Paul say, don't be deceived, fornicators won't inherit the kingdom of God? Moreover, Paul said that he must finish the race lest he be found a castaway. Therefore, was Paul's lack of certainty about his own salvation negative faith? Jesus said, all we need is the minimal faith of a mustard seed. When Catholics receive the sacrament of communion, it is in honor of His suffering on the cross that they attribute the source of grace. They do this every Sunday, in remembrance of Jesus. It is also receiving of Jesus as Lord and Savior, and practiced every Sunday to keep us close to the throne of grace that we may persevere. Purgatory does not negate the atonement since it holds that the redemptive work of Christ continues into the next life. We are saved from the penalty of sin upon faith in Christ, we are being saved from the effects of sin as we grow in holiness, and we will be saved from the presence of sin upon the final resurrection of the dead. Therefore, suggesting the redemptive work is continuing into the next life in not inconsistent with biblical thought. Besides, Sproul's Calvinistic theology came from Augustine, who also taught the doctrine of purgatory."},{"Title":"Now, That's a Good Question!","review":"All steps to making the purchase were very easy.

Hypnosis and it's phenomenons are simply explained with some history on it and a wide practice. It was a very nice and easy reading with a lot of the basics for self hypnosis and hypnosis itself."},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"The book offers most of the basic information on hypnosis. Yet it lacks the depth that one would expect on the topic. I know many books on hypnosis and there is definitely much better stuff around. An excellent one I recently read was which offered also many excercises that are required to really learn hypnosis."},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"This book will give you a short history and explain what hypnosis is and isn't. Everything you need to know to try self-hypnosis is provided. Most people get their information from TV and movies and have a distorted reality where this subject is concerned. The next book to get would be an older title, \\"The Complete Book of Self-Hypnosis\\" by John M. Yates, M.D. and Elizabeth S. Wallace. I have purchased a dozen books on the subject so far and these two have proven to be most valuable in my quest for knowledge."},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"This book is more about how the author learned about and worked with self-hypnosis. It doesn't actually have well planned out steps to hypnotise yourself. It has a quick &#34;how do ya do?&#34; and then it goes back to the side-effects, the history of self-hypnosis, how they came to love hypnosis-I was looking for a step by step book on how to hypnotise yourself. This book didn't meet my standards. If you want a book on the history of hypnotising, or what happens when you do it wrong, or how a random author came to love hypnosis, heres a book for you!"},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"This was one of my first Hypnosis Books and is my favorite. It may be a little dated, but it is still a clear cut easy to read and understand guide to self hypnosis and hypnosis of others. Melvin Powers was a good author with a practical view for everything."},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"This book has a special place in my heart because it's one of the books that got me interested in hypnosis and self hypnosis many years ago when books on this subject were scarce and hardly ever available in conventional bookstores.While some of the material is dated, much of it stands the test of time. If it's basic information about self-hypnosis you want while staying on a budget(e.g. free on Kindle and 6.99 for the paperback), this is a great place to start. There is some practical \\"how to\\" in it; certainly enough to start experimenting.Melvin Powers, for those of us old enough to know, put out a LOT of very interesting books and material through his press, Wilshire Book Company. His other books on hypnosis included Advanced Techniques of Hypnosis, and he's one of the few authors who mention the induction of hypnosis through the use of mesmerism (using the energy in one's gaze). It may sound like hooey to some folks, but I predict that one day it'll make a comeback. What's old will become new again--no doubt under a term someone creates to make it more palatable for a modern audience.Melvin Powers has contributed to the current popularity of hypnosis and self hypnosis books. Of that, there is no doubt in my mind. If you are a collector of hypnosis books (like I am), then A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO SELF HYPNOSIS is a must-have. It's a classic and for that reason, and a few others, I have given it FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis","review":"I read other reviews about this book and almost didn't get it.

It is very thorough if you are looking for a comprehensive guide to self-hypnosis as I was. I will say that the writing exemplifies the period in which it was written, and I imagine that some readers will have a hard time staying focused. There are also periods of repetition, that felt dry to me.

I bought this book for the chapter on LaSalle. The rest of the book is a collection of Texas stories, many of which seem true. The book did have a few J Frank Dobie type tales. The tales cross the entire state and cover most time periods, from LaSalle all the way to Bonnie and Clyde. The book has also given me a few short stories on Texas towns that I have driven through for years. I recommend this book to all who enjoy the lighter side of Texas History."},{"Title":"Extreme Metal II","review":"When Joes McIver's book Extreme Metal was published in 2000, it contained descriptions and the background stories of 250 of the world's largest and most influential metal bands throughout history, and turned out to be a very useful guide, to say the least, for anyone who needed a thorough dictionary that could be used again and again. Since the book was published, the metal genre has expanded immensely, new sub-genres have evolved, and styles that only a few years ago were considered too extreme are now crawling closer and closer to the mainstream. And that is both good and bad, I guess.Anyhow, five years after Extreme Metal was published the world of heavy music had grown to such a great size that a sequel was needed: Extreme Metal II. This time around the number of bands has increased to almost 400, and instead of having complete discographies each entry now has one recommended album. This change is definitely to the better; because for people out searching for new bands it'll be great not having to listen through tons of records. After all, metal music is just like any other music: there are numerous bands who suck more than anything has ever sucked before.Extreme Metal II is, just like other books of its kind, not meant to be read from beginning to end in one go, even if it's perfectly fine to do just that. It's quite handy whenever one hears of a metal band one hasn't heard of before, or when a simple background check about a certain band is needed. A few errors occur here and there, but that doesn't really matter much.All in all, Extreme Metal II is a great tool for all metal lovers, and if you have a genuine interest in the music, you don't wanna miss out on the opportunity of having your own copy."},{"Title":"Extreme Metal II","review":"There are alot of bands in here that are worthy and alot of bands that I never heard of. I saw Carnal Forge in it, and that is why I bought the book. I agree his opinions are annoying sometimes and the bios are way to short. Still I haven seen alot of \\"metal\\" books out there that forgets these bands. Thats why I give it four stars."},{"Title":"Mark Coffin, U.S.S.","review":"I always enjoy the books of Allen Drury because I enjoy politics in general and I'm a Republican. Drury, of course, wrote exclusively about the men and women of Washington and was unapologetically conservative. There aren't many conservative novelists out there so Drury's books always served as a nice relief but unfortunately, outside of his Advise and Consent series, few of his novels live up to their promise. After winning his pulitzer prize for Advice and Consent, Drury seemed to spend the rest of his career essentially rewriting that book. Mark Coffin, USS is a good example. The novel, from the '70s by which time American politics had changed considerably since Drury wrote his first classic book, deals with California's junior Senator -- the idealistic and niave liberal Mark Coffin. Only thirty years old, Coffin enters the Senate as something of a celebrity and immediately finds himself thrust into a battle over the President's choice for Attorney General. Unfortunately, all of this brings up memories of Advise and Consent's battle over the President's choice for Secretary of State and the comparisons are not favorable. Whereas Advice and Consent was blessed with some very complex characters, Mark Coffin and his fellow Senators all seem to be faded carbon copies of the characters from that earlier book. None of them capture the imagination and most of them are flatly written. Mark Coffin, especially, seems to be compiled of every other young, idealistic politician that has appeared in countless other political novels over the years. As a character, he can't surprise us and as such, his lessons and conflicts simply do not hold the reader's interest. As well, most of the dialouge and scenes seem rather corny at best as if Drury, the '50s political insider, had spent the last twenty years forgetting everything he knew. In the end, Drury seems to be trying to write a novel about the Washington he knew set in the very different, post-Watergate political climate and, as such, comes across as being, for lack of a better term, lost. Still, bizarrely enough, this book is also a rare Drury book that contains a few really sterling and lyrical prose passages as opposed to the somewhat rough, awkwardly constructed sentences he became infamous for in most of his other books. Sadly, one gets the feeling that Drury was making a real effort to craft an important statement with this book (certainly, America needed one at that time). Unfortunately, the times had just passed him by."},{"Title":"Dweller on Two Planets","review":"The story is engaging, very tersely written but packed with implication. The author asserts that it is a channeled text and that he received it as a medium.The story deals very succinctly and briskly with the multiple lives of the protagonist and his wrestling with the karma he generates back in Atlantis. Multiple characters appear and reappear later.The style of the writing is not spectacular. The language is somewhat stilted and archaic, and the author sometimes waxes enthusiastic about kind of uninteresting topics. However, he does pack a lot of information into a tight space, which will be fascinating for anyone interested in channeled texts, theosophy, the secret city supposedly inside Mt. Shasta (N. California), Atlantis, etc.The formatting was problematic. The book seems to have been scanned in, so there are weird gaps in the text between one paragraph and the next one, and a number of words were misinterpreted by the uploading software. For example, &#34;modern&#34; consistently appears as &#34;modem&#34;. This is not really a big deal, as the eye almost always fills in the appropriate words. I only had to stop and guess about what the author actually wrote a few times.Overall, interesting story (if you are interested in the occult, reincarnation, theosophy, Atlantis, etc.)"},{"Title":"Dweller on Two Planets","review":"One of the most life altering books I have read.

Topics are presented in a humorous but insightful manner. Vigor gets immediately to the point without wasting words and points out in sailing there are often various acceptable solutions to problems with no single solution being the best; he describes what has been time tested and has worked for him over the years.

It is organized alphabetically, by subject, and the end of the book includes many useful tables, formulas, etc., that you might not easily find anywhere else. It covers various preventive techniques, ways to correct problems if they do occur, and things that merchants and repairmen might never tell you unless you know to ask. I also like that this book includes a fair amount of humor, and that the subjects covered are not all purely technical.

From knowing what kind of documentation is needed to sail into foreign waters to renaming or repainting a boat, Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing avoids many pitfalls."},{"Title":"Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing","review":"This is a strange book. Vigor has collected about 200 \\"observations\\" on sailing, each one a short item of a page or less in length. Each one is amusing, but it is not primarily a humorous book, although you might get that idea from the cover illustration.The information is sound and contains many useful tips about many aspects of sailing, but the book is also not really intended as a \\"serious\\" guidebook.It reads like a collection of short magazine articles that were written over a period of time, probably whilst actually cruising, and probably inspired by whatever he had been doing that day. This is not bad, but it is quirky. The title is a bit odd too, as you might reasonably think it is information intended for beginning sailors or landlubbers thinking about sailing, and that's not at all right. It is the sort of information that would be most of interest or humorous to those who already have some sailing experience.I gave it 4 stars as there is nothing really wrong with the book, but it was not quite what I was expecting.

Sailing has been a challenge for me, and I must admit that there have been many times when I have felt like the official \\"Village Idiot\\" of the waters of Galveston Bay, Texas. I was just about on the verge of selling the boat and returning to my beloved Couch when I purchased and read this book. This book served as an affirmation of the sailing knowledge and skills I have been gathering.

This book must be the ultimate documentary of music as well as the music scene in Jamaica during the 60's,70's, and 80's. It's not just a book about Scratch; it is a book about all Jamaican musicians, singers and procuders of the period. It's the best documented piece of Jamaican history. Someday it will become the most sought after Jamaican history book!David Kratz ensures that the reader lives moment by moment with almost every musician, producers, and Jamaican artist of the period - some of whom have long been forgotten. He takes you into the studios, delves into the background of each and every artist mentioned in the book, takes to the UK and US with Scratch and Bob Marley, then brings you back to the Black Art Studio where Scratch produced some of the most revolutionary and influential Jamaican music.Any Jamaican who reads this book will certainly say: &quot;Me know da music deh, but me didn't know sey a Scratch do it.&quot; The reader will soon learn that Scratch is the greatest Jamaican music producer. No other producer will ever come close to matching his skill and artistry of Scratch in the studio. Nuff respect to Scratch. He is a true genious! And hat's off to David Katz.

Katz is very sympathetic to Perry, has obviously done an enormous amount of research, and spent hundreds of hours sifting fact from fiction, not to mention tolerating the mania of one of the 20th century's greatest artists, but what he hasn't done is written a book that could hold my attention.I think the book is a disaster and cannot understand how anyone could call it a masterpiece.

Carl thinks he may also be on the list, so he has a vested interest in the killings. Jack agrees to take the \\"case\\" at $20.00 per day plus expenses, but makes it clear Richter is hiring him, not his gun. Richter agrees, giving Jack a $100.00 retainer, and things take off like a bullet shot from there.

The problem is that Mr. Bickmore discusses &quot;The Apostasy&quot; as if it were an actual major event that we all recognize. As a devout Catholic and amateur theologian, I have never discovered ANY evidence for a &quot;Great Apostacy.&quot; I need to kindly remind my Mormon friends that only 11 million people on this planet (out of 6 billion) believe in this so-called apostacy. Mr. Bickmore's modus operandi seems to be peicing together tiny scraps of questionable &quot;evidence&quot; and calling it &quot;extremely plausible.&quot; The problem with this approach, is that he completely ignores the ample evidence that refute his theories. An example of this: The early Fathers of the Church wrote extensively about the Trinity, the Real Presence, Purgatory, Bodily Assumption of Mary, Invocation of Saints, Confession, and other common Catholic doctrines that are found nowhere in the LDS Church. You can't just pick and choose small scraps and ignore large sections if you are going to convince anybody. Bickmore did his homework, but alas this book will only convince the preconvinced."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"I am a Orthodox Christian and in MY OPINION Barry Bickmore misrepresents the Holy Fathers. The claim that Justin Martyr called Christ a \\"second\\" god was treated very well in perhaps the greatest and most comprehensive book on the subject of how the early christians thought of the Trinity in an economical sense and how their early thoughts developed all together in J.N.D. Kelly's book Early Christian Doctrines. Bickmore as well as other famous LDS apologists like to use Irenaeus's famous little 'couplet', \\"God became man so that man can become like God.\\" What they fail to tell their audience is that when it is read through Irenaeus's eyes it was really saying,\\"Since Christ shared or participated in our 'human' nature we may also share or participate in the divine nature only through Him, though we don't become the divine or assume the divine nature.\\" We can become partakers of the Divine nature (2 Peter),and we can become all that God is-- loving, forgiving, long suffering, merciful etc. Irenaeus as well as all the other early orthodox fathers including also most of the heretics ALWAYS distinguished the differences between God and Man. This was perhaps my biggest problem with his doctrine of Deification or as the Orthodox call it Theosis. Yes this doctrine was taught but not in terms similar or even remotely close to the LDS concept. The LDS complain about anti-Mormons using the same arguments over and over (with which I can agree with the LDS on this point), but they still claim (in a vague way) that Early Christianity was corrupted with Hellenistic thought and that the Church went into apostasy although they can't pin when. There is some validity in this assertion of Hellenistic thought i.e. Platonic, however they too have some of these great restored \\"truths\\" that coincide with Greek philosophy as well but will choose to gloss over them. This argument of theirs also gets rather boring. The scholarship is directed at the LDS to keep them faithful and to challenge the layperson of mainstream Christianity to sway in their beleifs. I am truly amazed how much this book has been praised by the LDS elite. If this is the kind of scholarship we can expect perhaps the LDS are on their last leg. I wouldn't like to call this book \\"deceitful\\" but sometimes when I read LDS apologists I wonder. This goes to show how much catching up they have to do with the \\"mainstream.\\""},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"The more research I do into this book, the lower my opinion of it becomes. Not only does this book on the one hand make a spurious charge regarding the effects of \\"hellenization\\" (i.e. incorporation of Greek ideas into the early Church's doctrine) against the Catholic Church, but it does not bother to mention the fact that many LDS doctrines are themselves based on faulty Platonic ideas. Examples: pre-existence of the soul, different degrees of heaven, the bondage of the soul \\"trapped\\" in the earthly body, and the rejection of creation ex nihilo. These Mormon beliefs are all based on Platonism, yet we are expected to believe hte early Church went wrong because it incorporated platonic beliefs!? The remainder of this review may be read with these new insights in mind.The book tries to make a case for the beliefs of the Latter Day Saints from he writings of early Christianity. It fails to do this however. Specifically:It ignores voluminous citaztions which prove Catholic teachings of the early Church;It quotes many Gnostic and apocryphal documents, which are often obscure and do not accurately represent the historic fact of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ; for example many Gnostic writings are Docetist and do not accept the physical bodily resurrection of Jesus.It cites the writer Origen many times, a writer whose works are filled with many internal contradictions, (for example,Origen sometimes wrote of endless cycles of rebirth, then says there is a final restoration of all things).The book also is apparently a bit confused as regards the supposed loss of the LDS doctrines from the early Church. On page 100, for example, the Church rejects pre-existence in favour of creation ex nihilo, supposedly because pre-existence was too Platonic, yet one of the major themes of the book is that the Church went wrong because it adapted Hellenistic (ie Platonic) philosophical beliefs!Further, the long-discredited Adolf von Harnack is quoted a number of times. Harnack, with his Marcionist tendencies is hardly one you want on your side if you want to make a convincing case in this day and age.The book, in addition, is filled with admissions of uncertainty on the part of the author. For example, on page 147 he writes \\"we cannot be sure of the exact dynamics of the loss of the doctrine of pre-existence\\". Which in fact means: there is no evidence for this doctrine in the early Church. And there are many more examples: on page 182, pre-existence is proposed a a solution to the traditional Christian Churches' problem of reconciling the ideas of predestination and foreknowledge. How pre-existence solves this mystery is not, however, explained. In addition, if pre-existence were indeed a solution to this problem, one would expect the idea to crop up in the time of the Reformation and the Controversies on Grace, yet to the best of my knowledge, it nowhere appears in these periods.Other examples of uncertainty are to be found in the chapter on \\"The Temple\\" e.g. on page 331 we are told \\"it must be admitted that the doctrine of eternal marriage is not explicitly taught in the New Testament\\". On page 332 we have a \\"more subtle reference\\"; on the next page, \\"some evidence\\" and \\"Melito of Sardis may have referred to it [eternal marriage]..\\"; in other words, there is no real evidence, just speculation. As I mentioned above, the evidence that Bickmore wants to see just isn't there. On page 334, that author acknowledges \\"no proof has been presented here\\" regarding eternal marriage. On the subject of plural marriage, we read on page 338 \\"the evidence is far from conclusive:\\" To be fair to Bickmore, he does qualify this statement , and also the previous quote I cited, with an \\"although\\"; however, the weight of the argument is hopelessly against him.Further, Augustine, Tertullian, and others are proposed as being among those who were not sure about the doctrine of original sin as we currently understand it, and the origin of the soul. Yet Augustine himself, in 423, cites 11 Fathers of the Church (in \\"Against Julian, 2, 10, 33) in support of the doctrine of original sin. Further discussion on original sin by this book is clouded by the failure to distinguish original and personal sin.Finally, the book's chapter on the alleged \\"apostasy\\" fails to take into account the traditional Catholic teaching on the nature of the Church's indefectibility and infallibility. The author leaves a footnote to discuss the \\"gates of hell\\" passage in Matthew 16:18 but this, if I understand correctly is a reference to the indefectibility of Peter's faith (an by extension, the Catholic Church's). . In contrast, the idea of the indefectibility of the Church as a whole is based primarily on the belief that the Church is the Mystical Body of Christ, in spiritual union with Him, and that the Holy Spirit is the Soul of the Church. From this leads the notion of ecclesial indefectibility (this is how I understand the Catholic view. It is not simply that Peter was given a promise in Matthew 16:18). This view of the Catholic Church's indefectibility, however, is nowhere treated in Bickmore's discussion of the alleged \\"apostasy\\", a fact which further weakens his already hopelessly unsubstantiated case.Overall, the book is looking to find evidence for the 1830-invented Mormon theological system which cannot find support in the writings of the Early Church. Recourse to Gnostic and apocryphal texts, which are frequently cited, as well as one-sided quotes from the Fathers, do not lead to a convincing argument. In contrast, I would propose that if the author were to do a search of the early Fathers to find Catholic beliefs and practises, the evidence would be (and is ) overwhelming. William Jurgens filled three volumes with the Catholic faith of the Early Fathers, and he just scratched the surface."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"Church history at its worst. If you are not familiar with the Church Fathers you maybe intimidated by this book but shouldn't be. Bickmore treats the Church Fathers completely out of the context of history. The Church Fathers wrote for many reasons and you have to read them in the historical context of their situation. For example: Justin Martyr wrote a defence of the divinity of Christ. His first defence was addressed to Emperor Antoninus Pius, his sons, Lucius and Marcus Aurelius, and to the Roman Senate and \\"the whole Roman people.\\" His second defence was addressed to the Roman Senate. The reason Justin wrote it was to defend Christians from persecutions and from being called athiests by the government (a crime punishable by death) because they wouldn't worship Greek and Roman Gods. Justin points out that Christians can't be athiests because they worship \\"the Most True God.\\"(referring to God in the singular) who is \\"Father, Son and Prophetic Spirit.\\" This is Trinitarian language all the way. Bickmore turns that into Justin calling Jesus a second god. This is absolutely absurd if you are familiar, even remotely, with the writtings of Justin. The understanding of what Justin was up against that would make Justin's work understandable is completely left out-and I would argue deliberately left out. The case is exactly the same with every single Church Father that Bickmore uses.Any reasonable, semi-reasonable or even partially reasonable scholar of Patristics (the Church Fathers) could not take Bickmore even remotely seriously. His reasoning is absurd, his methods highly suspect and Christian history is non exsistant in this book."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"You'll notice that Bickmore's book almost invariably receives either five stars or one. This may give some people the impression that only Latter-day Saints praise it and that no one else takes it seriously, but that's not the case. For an unbiased non-LDS review, I highly recommend running a web-search for the name \\"David Waltz\\" who has \\"a keen interest in Patristics, which started in 1980 with [his] purchase of the 38 volume Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.\\" While Waltz doesn't agree with everything in this book, the following quotation is a good example of his general attitude toward it:\\"I find it very interesting that Bickmore has organized, and put into print, many of the themes that I have seen in my personal reading of the early Church Fathers. I find it equally interesting that anti-Mormons who compare LDS doctrines with the early Church Fathers either ignore or gloss over much of the evidence.\\"He goes on to critique each section and details many points of interest. For example, \\"I must say that as one who is not LDS, I have been somewhat 'troubled' by the immense quantity of references in the Church Fathers which promote the doctrine of deification.\\" And, \\"Bickmore in this section gives his readers more than twenty citations from the Church Fathers that teach the doctrine that men can become Gods. To this number I could supply at least another thirty quotes, from my personal notes on the Church Fathers, which teach the same doctrine.\\" But perhaps the most pertinent statement in his review is this:\\"Is there strong evidence that distinctive LDS doctrine existed in the early Church? The honest investigator after reading this book must come to the following conclusion-YES.\\"But Waltz's review aside, Bickmore provides an abundance of quotations from highly renowned non-LDS patristic scholars (e.g., J.N.D. Kelly, J.W.C. Wand, John G. Davies, David W. Bercot, Philip Schaff, etc.) to show that he's not taking what the early Christians said out of context and superimposing some sort of pseudo-history upon them. The majority of the views in this book are the same conclusions that such respected and widely received experts on early Christianity have also come to.There are basically five different kinds of primary sources that Bickmore cites in this book. The first is, of course, the Bible. But there are hundreds of Latter-day Saint publications that cover the Scriptures rather thoroughly. What separates this work from most others is the remaining four types, which I shall list in a descending order of general worth: The writings of the early orthodox/apostolic Christians, Apocryphal writings, Pseudepigraphal writings, and heretical writings (most of which being Gnostic in nature). Drawing a line between the Apocrypha and the Pseudepigrapha can be somewhat tricky at times, but the reader is usually left to draw their own conclusions on that matter. And while heretical beliefs may be viewed as totally and utterly worthless by some, it was though among the early Christians that the heretics had \\"confound together the doctrine of Jesus Christ, with their own poison . . . As men give a deadly potion mixed with sweet wine\\" (as Ignatius said), and that the truth could be 'distilled' (as it were) from heresy and put to good use. An excellent example of those who had this sort of attitude and approach would be Clement of Alexandria, or even the Apostle Paul himself (see Acts 17:22-31 & Philippians 4:8).The translation that Bickmore most frequently uses is \\"The Ante-Nicene Fathers,\\" which is a wonderful choice because the whole ten volume set has been transcribed onto the internet, and thus one can easily check the context of the quotations for themselves. He also quotes from the two series of \\"The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers\\" as well, which you should be able to find at the same URL. In fact, while you're running web-searches for those works, you might as well do a search for Bickmore's book too, as it can also be found in its entirety online (and while it may be difficult or undesirable to read a work of this length off of a computer-monitor, it's still nice to have around at the click of a button).Want to know more about this book, who the early Christians were and what they taught, and/or what the Bible has to say about the post-Biblical Christians and the importance of their writings?

Well, for almost 2000 years people have been searching for the pure doctrine of Christ and his apostles. Unfortunately the New Testament is dominated with the apostolic teachings of Paul, and we do not have a clearer view of what early Christians believed solely from the Bible.If we investigate the writings of early Christians, maybe we can get a clearer view. This author comes forth with the proposition that spiritual gifts were lost to the church and thus they did not know which beliefs to hold on to. In some cases they adopted ideas from Greek philosophy, and in other cases they did not hold on to the correct beliefs that they should have.Just look at Tertullian's view of entertainment and the dangers of violence and sexual imagery (in the book mentioned later in this review.)Some Orthodox and Protestant reviewers may ask you to skip this one because it is \\"Latter-Day Saint material.\\" However, I challenge this audience to investigate the original texts that Bickmore pulls from to see the context for themselves. It is exhaustive pulling from numerous church father's from different locations and time periods.Interestingly enough, non-Mormon scholars are reaching many of the same conclusions that Bickmore has, namely that modern \\"mainstream Christianity\\" often does not reflect it's ancient roots.Good points Bickmore picks up on can also be found in the book: A Glimpse at Early Christian Church Life, by Tertullian This early church father's discussion of baptism gives good insights into the beliefs of the early believers on the centrality of baptism for salvation.Compare also with other scholarly works that take serious issue with Martin Luther and Augustine and disagree with the Reformation doctrine of Sola Fide. Disagree with him all you like, many scholars are now showing that the Early Church insisted that obedience and a life of holiness were necessary for salvation.Also, like Bickmore, other scholars are coming to find that the Christians of the 2nd and 3rd centuries did not believe in unconditional election, but upheld the idea of free will. Also, the doctrine of original sin is rarely spoken of before Augustine, and early creeds were less clear about the Son's full equality with the Father, even though they called the Son \\"God.\\" Look at \\"The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition\\" by Jaroslav Jan PelikanHe deals with the concept of creation ex-nihilo (which obviously has philisophical problems), with creeds that developed into the Trinity doctrine (which was not original Christian thought), the need for church organization and priesthood, apostasy (which was not a single event, but a process of slowly losing true doctrine over time), and much more.Protestants and Catholics alike are bound to deplore and reject this book. Scholars from the Protestant side agree with many of the conclusions that Bickmore makes as long as it supports thier position. The same goes for the Catholic side. Interesting how that works."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"This really is an excellent book. It's hardly the \\"be all\\" source of information about early Christian doctrines. It's not trying to be. Bickmore is a Mormon and he is obviously just showing that Mormon doctrines that are condemned today were taught anciently by some of the greatest heroes of Catholicism/Protestantism. (Athanasius, for example.) This is hardly surprising considering diversity of beliefs back then. Bickmore explains his purpose upfront and then proves it beyond doubt. Will it convince you to be a Mormon? Nope, not even close. But then that wasn't the point, was it?I have studied this topic quite a bit myself. After a friend of a different religion from mine claimed that there were always people who believed like him, I decided to take up the challenge and study early Christian writings up to the 3rd century. I was shocked at what I found. The early Christians are a very diverse group of people that believed a lot of different things. (A condition not unlike today, I suppose.) They certainly did *not* subscribe to many things the Western Christian world (i.e. Catholicism and Protestantism) holds near and dear today. The Nicene creed was certainly not part of early Christian beliefs. Whether you choose to see this as departure from an original truth or development to a better understanding of the truth is entirely a matter of point of view. You can't prove either position.I was delighted that after my own personal study, I found that Bickmore had found the exact same things I did. It confirmed that independent people studying the same subject would draw very similar conclusions. Did Bickmore find any thing that wasn't readily and obviously available? Not really. In a few days time I had found the same jarring differences between early Christian doctrines and modern Christian doctrines. Bickmore just found a lot more support for it due to obviously having studied it quite a bit more than me.Were the ancient Christian's Mormons (or any particular religion today) in belief? Nope - not even close. But Barry Bickmore is careful to point this out several times. (A point lost on some of the reviewers here. Did you actually read the book?) It's one of the reasons his book is so good. He's very fair - if somewhat speculative at points. But he tells you when he's speculating.Did the early Christians hold a lot of beliefs that are today condemned by Protestants/Catholics as heretical? (Deification being the most obvious example) Yup. Sorry, get over it. If this bothers you, you can always claim that they were human and they made mistakes as doctrines developed. A believable position, in my view, but you should probably stop condemning other religions for believing similar doctrines to the great heroes of your own religion. Let's face it, that's not a very logical thing to do. Bickmore's purpose was simply to show this inconsistency."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"This author is actually coming to the same conclusions that many other historians are coming to. Even mainstream Christian writers such as David W. Bercot, an Anglican Priest, is asking Christians across the board to reconsider what they consider &quot;traditional Christianity&quot;. Look at his book &quot;Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up&quot; and you will see many of the same conclusions drawn.I really liked how this author dealt with Calvanism and those who accepted such doctrines. It seems clear that after a couple of centuries, the Church began to bend some of it's doctrine to Greek philosophies, while tossing out true doctrines such as the pre-mortal existence, and creation from chaotic matter as opposed to ex-nihilo creation.Many of the early Christian Fathers saw the philisophical problems with with ex-nihilo creation and spoke about it. Example from the book: &quot;For there is no coercion with God, but a good will [towards us] is present with Him continually. And therefore does He give good counsel to all. And in man, as well as in angels, He has placed the power of choice (for angels are rational beings), so that those who had yielded obedience might justly possess what is good, given indeed by God, but preserved by themselves . . . . But if some had been made by nature bad, and others good, these latter would not be deserving of praise for being good, for such were they created; nor would the former be reprehensible, for thus they were made [originally].&quot; (Irenaeus, Against Heresies 4:37:1-2, in ANF 1:518-519, brackets in original.)Irenaeus is right. Furthermore, if God knew before hand who would choose evil before God even created them, why create them knowing that they would be punished for eternity. That, in my opinion, is a cruel act of a false God. Many people have a bone to pick with the Latter Day Saints, but that is no surprise. Many will condemn the book simply because it is written by a Mormon."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"Of course Barry writes from his own perspective as do all others. However, he makes an irresistible and compelling case that the LDS perspective and doctrine is the one closest to the original beliefs of the first Christians. It is amazing how much early Christian doctrine is ignored, hidden, or glossed over by other writers. I can testify from personal experience that this book DOES cause major heartburn to Evangelicals in the same way the Bible does and it is a major faith promoter of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The death of Sola Scriptura by it's own hand is evidenced in the form of this book. A must for every Christian library."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"I must commend Reviewer: David Baines - Look at it this way ..., January 7, 2004 He is absolutely correct.

It is much easier to share books that are available on Amazon. I don't know why they keep doing that, but I will submit a couple of books that support what Barry Bickmore has to say in this book. If anyone can read these books and still say orthodox Chrisian sects and the Catholic Church are strictly Bible based, then they are very reluctant learners:The Father Is Not the Son - 1890828076How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God - 0882906070The fundamentalist Christian sects that believe they are Bible-based need to research the tremendous admixture of Greek philosopy that comprises much of their \\"biblical\\" beliefs. No one is saying they are not Christians; they just have a lot of pagan philosophy mixed in with their doctrine."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"This is a book that can be overwhelming to many readers just because of the sheer onslaught of facts and references to ancient sources Bickmore brings to bear. Perhaps that's why not too many books like this have appeared before: it appears an incredible amount of work went into this; also, it takes guts to examine the often unexamined roots of Biblicist Christianity (specifically that cloying, anachronistic ultraconservative American variant of evangelical Protestantism appears to be Bickmore's&quot;~ target). If you're the American &quot;sola scriptura&quot; type, be forewarned: get good medical insurance first. You'll blow a head gasket reading this."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"I have been trying for years to understand Mormon claims that Catholicism is in apostasy from early Christianity as Jesus taught it. Catholics and Mormons alike can agree that Mormonism is a Gnostic religion. Mormons can claim a miraculous restoration, while Catholics can say that Joseph Smith and friends borrowed from Mosheim's history of the church and the Early Church Fathers' accounts of the Gnostic heresies."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"This is a very good book. I think many critics of Mormonism would find it extraordinarily challenging -- if they would read it. Sadly, they almost certainly won't. But I think Latter-day Saints generally will find Barry Bickmore's book fascinating and instructive. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Restoring the Ancient Church: Joseph Smith & Early Christianity","review":"Barry Bickmore has gone to a lot of work to write, \\"exactly the kind of book [he] would like to have read\\" about Mormonism and early Christianity. Based on the endorsements and reviews from notable Mormon scholars and other Mormon authors it is also a book that they enjoy reading. However, enjoyable reading based upon agreement between the guiding principles of the author and the presuppositions of the reader should not be the \\"empirical\\" test of a work that claims to present an accurate interpretation of philosophical and theological history. Rather, the test should hinge upon the fair and accurate representation of all sides of the issues that the author addresses, including the views of past and recent scholarship. In this regard, \\"Restoring the Ancient Church\\" is more a matter of reinterpreting history from the author's own religious point of view, and then accumulating quotations and citations as proof texts, taken either from writers with a similar agenda, or by simply ignoring basic hermeneutical and literary principles and practices. I had hoped to find a book that would lead to useful dialogue between Mormons and non-Mormons on the subjects addressed by Mr. Bickmore, but this is not that book. It will no doubt enjoy wide readership among Mormons as it affirms what they already believe to be true and give fuel to the fire between Mormons and non-Mormons, but it does not seriously address the issues in a way that will cause even a burp, let alone heartburn, among evangelical scholars."},{"Title":"Blake: A Collection of Critical Essays (Spectrum Books)","review":"The editor of this collection Northrop Frye explains in his introductory essay that the true Blake is not the mad, mystic devoid of connection with his own place and time, that he has often been made out to be. Frye writes that Blake was very much a product of the darker half of the Enlightentment, that his opposing of the social evils of his time was a strong one.Frye also collects in this volume essays about Blake's most popular literary work, \\"The Songs of Innocence and Experience\\" while at the same time giving time and attention to the longer, prophetic works. In one essay Harold Bloom gives an explication of 'The Four Zoas' And in an essay of his own Frye shows how the longer poems relate to, and in a sense evolve out of the shorter ones.Frye sees Blake as professional graphic artist and illustrator, and as amateur poet, as one whose work touches many different realms of being. He sees him as a great artist- poet whose work will continue to fascinate mankind in the future ahead."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"I built several web sites using PHP/MySQL and the only two books I use day-to-day are \\"MySQL Cookbook\\" and \\"PHP Cookbook\\".If you're already somewhat familiar with MySQL, this book is a great reference for the SQL and database manipulation you already know how to do. In addition, the examples push the envelope of what is possible with MySQL making it a good learning tool for becoming truly expert.Some of the information in the book I found useful includes:- simplifying complex SQL using temporary tables.- using FULLTEXT searches (similar to pattern matching but more efficient and easier to code when you're looking for the same text in several columns at the same time).- effective use of LEFT JOIN's for finding rows in one table that don't have a match in another table.- effective use of LAST_INSERT_ID( fieldName + 1 ) for transactionally updating a numeric field without using transactions and without locking a table.- numbering output rows using SQL variables (select @rownum := @rownum + 1; (see chapter 13.9))I really can't say enough good things about this book.

It's a free (for personal use) database system which can be easily integrated into a web application on virtually any system. It has supports most of the standard feature found in most database system and has quiet a few features unique to MySQL. This particular book is a good reference for the experienced user as well as for new comers and as an added bonus even covers MySQL 4.0.This is book was my first introduction to O'Reilly's cookbook series. It provides solutions to some of the most common challenged faced by the particular subject being covered (in this case MySQL). I thoroughly enjoyed it and was quiet impressed with it. Too many technical books simply introduce the concept without relating it to real world applications.This particular book introduces all of the most basic concepts of database manipulation (table creation, data insertion, data deletion, data update). As well as writing simple and advanced SQL statements to retrieve data. It approaches database design using 4 of the most popular languages (Perl, PHP, Python and Java). These are only a few of the many possible languages which can be used to manipulate a MySQL database.MySQL cookbook touches on a variety of different topics which I don't have the space or time to cover in detail, but here is a list of them:* Handeling duplicates* MySQL on the Web* Processing Web input with MySQL* Using MySQL-based Web Session ManagementOne of my favorite topics covered in the book is the idea of storing binary data such as images within a database. Although not ideal for most cases (unless you need fast access to a vast array of images), just the idea of it has a certain kewlness effect.Well, overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It needs to touch slightly more on the basic concepts of databases, and it can become the only book you'll ever need for MySQL."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"As an experienced Oracle DBA I had a need to learn about MySQL for the development of the FmPro Migrator utility to migrate FileMaker databases to MySQL.

His description sounded familiar to one of the recipes I skimmed in the cookbook.

This is perfect for a learn-by-example programmer like me. It makes a handy reference, too. He has examples and tips for just about everything the typical MySQL coder would ever need to do. Excellent reference - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"This book should be useful for anybody who uses MySQL, ranging from individuals who want to use a database for personal projects such as a blog or Wiki, to professional database and web developers. The book should also appeal to people who do not now use MySQL, but would like to. For example, it should be useful if you want to learn about databases but realize that a \\"big\\" database system such as Oracle isn't the best choice as a learning tool. The following paragraphs summarize each chapter to give you an overview of the book's contents.Chapter 1, Using the mysql Client Program, describes how to use the standard MySQL command-line client. In addition, the chapter discusses other ways to use mysql, such as how to number output lines or make long lines more readable, how to generate various output formats, and how to log mysql sessions.Chapter 2, Writing MySQL-Based Programs, demonstrates the basic elements of MySQL programming: how to connect to the server, issue queries, retrieve the results, and handle errors. It also discusses how to handle special characters and NULL values in queries, how to write library files to encapsulate code for commonly used operations, and describes various ways to gather the parameters needed for making connections to the server.Chapter 3, Selecting Data from Tables, covers several aspects of the SELECT statement, which is the primary vehicle for retrieving data from the MySQL server: specifying which columns and rows you want to retrieve, performing comparisons, dealing with NULL values, and selecting one section of a query result.Chapter 4, Table Management, covers table cloning, copying results into other tables, using temporary tables, and checking or changing a table's storage engine.Chapter 5, Working with Strings, describes how to deal with string data. It covers character sets and collations, string comparisons, dealing with case-sensitivity issues, pattern matching, breaking apart and combining strings, and performing FULLTEXT searches.Chapter 6, Working with Dates and Times, shows how to work with temporal data. It describes MySQL's date format and how to display date values in other formats. It also covers how to use MySQL's special TIMESTAMP data type, how to set the time zone, conversion between different temporal units, how to perform date arithmetic to compute intervals or generate one date from another, and leap-year calculations.Chapter 7, Sorting Query Results, describes how to put the rows of a query result in the order you want. This includes specifying the sort direction, dealing with NULL values, accounting for string case sensitivity, and sorting by dates or partial column values. It also provides examples that show how to sort special kinds of values, such as domain names, IP numbers, and ENUM values.Chapter 8, Generating Summaries, shows techniques that are useful for assessing the general characteristics of a set of data, such as how many values it contains or what its minimum, maximum, or average values are.Chapter 9, Obtaining and Using Metadata, discusses how to get information about the data that a query returns, such as the number of rows or columns in the result, or the name and type of each column. It also shows how to ask MySQL what databases and tables are available or find out about the structure of a table and its columns.Chapter 10, Importing and Exporting Data, describes how to transfer information between MySQL and other programs.Chapter 11, Generating and Using Sequences, discusses AUTO_INCREMENT columns, MySQL's mechanism for producing sequence numbers. It shows how to generate new sequence values or determine the most recent value, how to resequence a column, how to begin a sequence at a given value, and how to set up a table so that it can maintain multiple sequences at once. It also shows how to use AUTO_INCREMENT values to maintain a master-detail relationship between tables, including some of the pitfalls to avoid.Chapter 12, Using Multiple Tables, shows how to perform joins, which are operations that combine rows in one table with those from another. It demonstrates how to compare tables to find matches or mismatches, produce master-detail lists and summaries, enumerate many-to-many relationships, and update or delete rows in one table based on the contents of another.Chapter 13, Statistical Techniques, illustrates how to produce descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, regressions, and correlations. It also covers how to randomize a set of rows or pick a row at random from the set.Chapter 14, Handling Duplicates, discusses how to identify, count, and remove duplicate rows--and how to prevent them from occurring in the first place.Chapter 15, Performing Transactions, shows how to handle multiple SQL statements that must execute together as a unit. It discusses how to control MySQL's auto-commit mode, and how to commit or roll back transactions, and demonstrates some workarounds you can use for non-transactional storage engines.Chapter 16, Using Stored Routines, Triggers, and Events, describes how to write stored functions and procedures that are stored on the server side, triggers that activate when tables are modified, and events that execute on a scheduled basis.Chapter 17, Introduction to MySQL on the Web, gets you set up to write web-based MySQL scripts. Web programming enables you to generate dynamic pages from database content or collect information for storage in your database. The chapter discusses how to configure Apache to run Perl, Ruby, PHP, and Python scripts, and how to configure Tomcat to run Java scripts written using JSP notation. It also provides an overview of the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) that is used heavily for JSP pages in the following chapters.Chapter 18, Incorporating Query Results in Web Pages, shows how to use the results of queries to produce various types of HTML structures, such as paragraphs, lists, tables, hyperlinks, and navigation indexes. It also describes how to store images into MySQL, and retrieve and display them later, and how to send a downloadable result set to a browser. The chapter also includes a section that demonstrates how to use a template package to generate web pages.Chapter 19, Processing Web Input with MySQL, discusses how to obtain input from users over the Web and use it to create new database rows or as the basis for performing searches. It deals heavily with form processing, including how to construct form elements, such as radio buttons, pop-up menus, or checkboxes, based on information contained in your database.Chapter 20, Using MySQL-Based Web Session Management, describes how to write web applications that remember information across multiple requests, using MySQL for backing store.Appendix A, Obtaining MySQL Software, indicates where to get the source code for the examples shown in this book, and where to get the software you need to use MySQL and write your own database programs.Appendix B, Executing Commands from the Command Line, provides background on executing commands at the command prompt and how to set environment variables such as PATH.Appendix C, JSP and Tomcat Primer, provides a general overview of JSP and installation instructions for the Tomcat web server.Appendix D, References, lists sources of information that provide additional information about topics covered in this book. It also lists some books that provide introductory background for the programming languages used here."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"As indicated, this book is true to its title. It is a cookbook, by which I mean it contains a great number of (generally useful) recipes of varying complexity, but lacks detail and analysis that a more focused text would have.Mr. DuBois and O'Reilly publishing are clearly targeting a wide audience: the recipes range from frighteningly simple (e.g. 3.1, Specifying Which Columns to Select) to fairly sophisticated (e.g. 12.14, Performing a Join Between Tables in Different Databases). The recipes are typically clearly written, with ample supporting code examples and few typographical errors.I must also note that Mr. DuBois nicely avoids a pitfall many authors (the competence of whom I have to question) in this genre encounter: failure to weave security considerations into the text. While other books often mention security as an afterthought, or worse include code examples featuring disasters like non-escaped strings (hello, SQL injection!), DuBois explicitly points out the need to sanitize input and writes code examples that demonstrate the use of prepared statements in best-practices.Unfortunately, in other areas he is less thorough. For example, only passing mention is made of the (possible) dependence of FULLTEXT indexes on choice of storage engine. There is an entire chapter on handling duplicate rows, but the oft-needed (and non-obvious) process for removing pseudo-duplicate rows differing only by a primary key field is not directly addressed. Stored procedures, triggers, and other new additions to MySQL are among the least-well understood but most powerful features of the database engine, yet astonishingly little space is spent on them. (I could understand not discussing them in depth as there are other books available, but length did not seem to be a concern anywhere else in this book.)In summary, the book is an excellent resource for novices and experts alike - but only as a starting point. To return to the cooking analogy, the book at times feels like it is loaded down with recipes on how to add sugar to flour, but omits recipes on how to ice the cake."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"At ~950 pages, the 'MySQL Cookbook' is an EXTENSIVE look at using MySQL from top to bottom.

Nevertheless I would have to say that the book meets this challenge well. This book should be of use to anybody who uses MySQL.Practicality:I have to say that I have fallen for Cookbook style books. While I still thoroughly enjoy more theory heavy books, cookbooks can really deliver in the immediate practicality department.The MySQL Cookbook is a good example of this. This book has dozens upon dozens of recipes that will likely have some measure of application in whatever MySQL dependent system you are working on.Each recipe contains a brief \\"Problem\\" scenario, followed by an often equally brief \\"Solution\\", and finally a more lengthy discussion that shows how to actually implement the solution.OverallI am very pleased with this book. Mr. DuBois and O'Reilly did a great job. For instance, one of the things I especially like is that often multiple solutions are offered. For example if you were to look up Section 6.6 \\"Extracting Parts of Dates or Times\\" you will find the solution lists 3 possible options. The discussion section contains 5 pages of examples of how you might use those options to extract the desired data.If you fit in to the intended audience of \\"anybody who uses MySQL\\", I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"This book is huge and like the other books in the cookbook series the primary purpose of the book is to provide real solutions to real life problems. One of the reasons for the huge size of this book is that it takes the programming language that is being used with mySQL into account and provides coding solutions for not just one but five of the most popular programming languages that are used with mySQL databases. Even if you aren't using one of those five most of the other languages that can be used with mySQL will at least resemble one or more of the languages that is covered to allow you to work out how to convert the presented solutions into just about any programming language.This is not a book to teach you mySQL, it is the book that you get after you already have at least some knowledge of mySQL and are starting to face real problems of how to use mySQL to solve specific problems. It doesn't teach you how to design databases either so it wont help you in working outhow what tables you should have and what to put in each. What it will do is to help you work out how to use those tables most effectively once you have finished designing your database. It will also assist you in working out what data types to use for the fields that you have in your table and how to make your database accesses more efficient by setting up your database queries to work in the most effective way reducing the need for as much programming code around the call to perform the required task."},{"Title":"MySQL Cookbook","review":"I need to learn about MySQL for my small business.

If you're doing web development in Ruby, PHP, Perl, Python or Java, you should consider this book. It concentrates solely on the how to do specific things, so you won't get weighed down by too much theory and so on.

Chambers had publicly accused Hiss of having been a Communist Party member, Soviet spy, and agent of influence. Unfortunately for Hiss, Chambers had saved some of the material Hiss passed him for transmission to Soviet Military Intelligence. Alger Hiss ended up in prison, was disbarred, and spent the rest of his life trying to convince people a fantastic conspiracy had framed him.In 1971, Hiss made a mistake almost as large: he let an honest man look at his defense files. Historian Allen Weinstein had previously believed that Hiss was innocent. But when he read what Hiss's lawyers said in private, and what FBI agents had written J. Edgar Hoover, he found there was no reasonable doubt possible anymore. Hiss had spied for the Soviets, and Chambers had usually told the truth to the best of his ability. Chambers had sometimes lied, but only when he attempted to minimize Hiss's guilt -- and his own, for Chambers had secrets about himself to protect, and a well founded fear of being the messenger killed for bearing bad news.PERJURY is a fascinating account of two complex men, best friends who became mortal enemies when one split with Stalinism, and the other remained faithful. The lives of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers would have been interesting even if they had never met or publicly clashed. Their long duel caught them in \\"A tragedy of History,\\" as Chambers put it. PERJURY tells that story better than anyone before or since. It's a masterpiece of historical detective work.When it was published originally, all but the die hard apologists for Stalinism conceded Hiss's guilt. The new edition has recently released material from the National Security Agency's Venona decryptions, and the KGB's Moscow files that destroy even the unreasonable doubts. My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"This is one of *the* books that made me want to become a historian. It's a miracle of research and writing. Weinstein started out as a left-wing partisan who wanted to prove Hiss innocent, and he received blessings from the man himself. But as he dug deeper and deeper, the professor discovered the remains of the secret world of Soviet espionage in America, and became convinced that Hiss was guilty. And he proves it in a tour-de-force of historical analysis: I would go so far as to say their is really no reasonable doubt left. This new edition contains the evidence of the recently declassified &quot;Venona&quot; Soviet documents that were decoded by the CIA at the time. One can argue about the wisdom of keeping such damning evidence secret for so long, but their release now puts the last nail in the coffin of the ill-considered faith of those who still, after everything, mock Whittaker Chambers. The writing of this book affected Weinstein so much he left academia to set up a foundation to help the U.S. goverment build democracy around the world. He recently wrote a sequel, &quot;The Haunted Wood&quot;, about the history of Soviet espionage in the U.S. during the '30's and '40's."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"This is the most thorough and comprehensive piece of investigative journalism ever published. Weinstein treats the case like an onion, he peels off one layer, then another, then another.... His treatment of when the Hiss typewriter was manufactured would fill a small book in itself. The same is also true of the transfer of Hiss's car to the communist party, the Soviet gift of a carpet to Hiss, the dating of Chambers' microfilm, and so on.So why didn't Weinstein go on to become another Bob Woodward? Probably because his conclusion that Hiss was, in fact, a communist spy was unacceptable to so many people at that time. This was a great injustice to a man who told the truth and was himself suprised that the facts so heavily vindicated Chambers.With the publication of Sam Tanenhaus's \\"Whittaker Chambers: a biography,\\" the truth of Weinstein's conclusion has now been, finally, accepted by most people-even on the left. But why Tanenhaus's book, which contains hardly anything new, should have changed anybody's view seems odd. I suspect that with the passage of time, Tanenhaus's softer tone, and Hiss's death, many Hiss supporters felt the time had come to concede an unpleasant truth."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"This book is so credible, so exhaustively researched, it deserves substantial praise.

This book remedies that imbalance. Author Allen Weinstein is a lawyer making a case, and he does it well. He lays out the evidence in detail--great detail--and lets the reader draw conclusions, without hiding his own. I can now see both why Hiss became a liberal cause and why Chambers was despised. It is a case where the bad guy is far more likable than the good guy. I came away convinced, as many others have been, of Hiss's guilt.

So I have not read the revised edition, but the original book is very convincing. Those critical of it do not explain the evidence and how it fails to show Hiss guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. What Hiss did seems incredible, but the evidence remains convincing, despite all the efforts to show that the evidence in some way should not be believed. And I speak as one who at the time of Hiss's trial very much was hoping that it would be shown he was not guilty, and as one who voted against Nixon every chance I had (1952, 1956, 1960, 1968, and 1972)."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"Congratulations to Mr. Weinstein. He did not permit his original belief of Hiss's innocence to deter him from a dogged search for the truth. While this book is at times a very tough read,one can only marvel at the completeness of Weinstein's effort. By the end of the book he has methodically, painstakingly debunked every myth of this celebrated case. Fact by fact, strand by strand, Weinstein carefully, unrelentingly reveals the truth. Weinstein shows that Hiss's only hope in his trials was to portray Chambers as an unbalanced,psychopathic,liar. The only problem in this tactic was the &quot;immutable&quot; witnesses: the documents written in Hiss's own hand,Hiss's initials on other documents, and, of course, the infamous Woodstock typewriter owned by Hiss. Even though his lawyers had two trials to do so, they never disputed these &quot;immutable witnesses&quot;. In fact, Hiss's lawyers engaged typwriting experts who concluded not only that the typewritten documents were done on the Hiss's Woodstock, but that Mrs. Hiss was the very typist of the documents.Facts,facts, facts always get in the way of Alger Hiss's defense.In the final chapters, Weinstein reveals his conclusions from recently declassified NSA/CIA files. While there are no smoking guns, Hiss looks guiltier than ever. Some fifty years of lying and obfuscation are demolished by Weinstein's careful work.

He wrote in the introduction to this 1978 book, \\"My interest in the case began in 1969... I published an article on Hiss-Chambers and concluded that both men had probably lied; that Hiss hid facts concerning his personal relationship with Chambers, while the latter had falsely accused Hiss of Communist ties and espionage... Much new evidence (has come) from individuals close to either Hiss of Chambers... With the new evidence blended into the 'old,' most of the troubling questions about the Hiss-Chambers case can be answered. Not surprisingly, the story that emerges, although as dramatic as the conspiracy theories, provides one new dimension: it actually happened.\\"He notes that in a letter to the press, Hiss asked, in effect, why, if Whittaker Chambers told the truth, \\"no one had caught him (Hiss) out during this long period, or why his actions as an official had not revealed evidence of Communist association... Hiss thereby played what was clearly his strongest suit---a defense by reputation.\\" (Pg. 43) But in his later performance at the House Un-American Activities Committee, \\"Even Hiss's friends agreed that his performance at the HUAC hearings had severely damaged his credibility and, therefore, his reputation.\\" (Pg. 67)On the other side, \\"Not only did Chambers withhold from his wife detailed knowledge of his underground activities, but he also kept from her any awareness of his other secret life away from home, his intermittent sexual encounters.\\" (Pg. 118) In his own testimony, Chambers conceded that he might have used the alias \\"George Crosley,\\" and \\"admitting to several aliases during the thirties.\\" (Pg. 172) Weinstein suggests that Chambers ultimately turned over the \\"Baltimore documents\\" due to his fear of losing the libel lawsuit, and then being indicted by the Justice Department (pg. 176-177).Weinstein asks, \\"How can we explain the link between Chambers and the Hisses... Aparently, for the Hisses, he also offered some respite from the bourgeois super-respectability demanded of them by their backgrounds, their public associations, and their secret ideological commitments.\\" (Pg. 228) Later, he states, \\"Allegations of Hiss's Communist activities received independent reinforcement in 1945 from two additional informants... neither of whom knew Whittaker Chambers. The new testimony ... caused... the FBI to start a searching but secret inquiry into Alger Hiss's loyalty.\\" (Pg. 356)He concludes, \\"the body of available evidence proves that he did in fact perjure himself when describing his secret dealings with Chambers, so that the jurors in the second trial made no mistake in finding Alger Hiss guilty as charged.\\" (Pg. 565)Although later evidence is increasing the case for Hiss's espionage, this book was one of the more \\"persuasive\\" (particularly due to Weinstein's recanting his earlier defense of Hiss); it's a \\"must read\\" for any students of the trial."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"I finished reading this book last week and came away totally convinced that Alger Hiss was a spy for the former Soviet Union. Chambers is depicted in this book as a very unlikely hero for the Anti-Communist cause in the late 1940's. The book is very detailed and it leads you through the entire investigation process that took place immediately after Whittaker Chambers publicly accused Alger Hiss of being a Communist spy in the 1930's. There was much corroborating evidence through eye-witness testimony before the Congressional committee(HUAC) and in the 2 trials detailed in this book. It was at times quite tedious and extremely detailed, which I found to be rather boring. But history does not work in the fast pace people are accustomed to in the movies and on television. Espionage is a dangerous game to play and any sudden moves can get you killed. Most spies always try to hide in plain sight, which Alger Hiss was able to do quite well for many years. The end of the Cold War and the opening of the secret files in the KGB and VENONA transcripts allowed the author unprecedented access to evidence which proved devastating to Hiss's claims that he was not a spy after getting out of prison many years ago. Thank God for the end of the Cold War! Otherwise, we may never have known the whole story of Hiss's espionage activities. A great book if you have patience with all the details."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"August 3, 2008 represents the 60th anniversary of Whittaker Chambers'appearance before the House Committee for Un-American Activities, whichled to the indictment of Alger Hiss ten months later. Allen Weinstein haswritten a major historical work. Its command and breadth of documentarymaterial is amazing. The best way to advertise it is to excerpt it:From >Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case&lt; published 1997 by Random Housepage 42: \\"The point we are making is that Mr. Hiss, according to thisdocument, delivered the Ford auto to the Cherner Motor Company on July 23, 1936. On the same date, this car was sold or transferred to one William Rosen, but there is no evidence in the sales records of this particular transaction.\\"page 47: In a memorandum filed that day, Mclean wrote, \\"Emmanuel Bloch,attorney for William Rosen, told me the following [facts] today. Rosen does not know Hiss. Rosen did lend himself to a dummy transaction concerning the Ford car. Apparently Rosen did not sign the title certificate dated July 23, 1936. It is not clear whether Rosen knew at that time that his name would be used in this transaction. However, at some later date, a man came to see Rosen and told him that the title certificate was in his name and asked him to sign an assignment of (thecar) to some third person. The man who came to see Rosen is a very high (ranking) Communist. His name would be a sensation in this case. The man who ultimately got the car is also a Communist. Bloch hinted that Rosen is a Communist but did not say so expressly.\\"Mclean's memo tends to verify Chambers' account of how the 1929 Ford left Alger Hiss's ownership to be transferred by a \\"very high Communist\\"[J. Peters] to another party member.\\"page 60: When one of the Hiss attorneys approached J. Peters' lawyer, Carol Weiss King, seeking information from Peters, he was clearly takenaback by her response. The meeting with Mrs. King which took place in January 1949 was duly recorded in a memo by Harold Rosenwald: \\"She said that a liaison had been established . . . . I told her that I was not aware of any such liaison between Hiss's attorneys and the Communist Party. She smiled knowingly and mysteriously and refused to be more specific. She said that Hiss had been very foolish (inasmuch as he)vigorously denied that he knew Chambers.\\"Americans were confused and perturbed when it emerged that Chambers had tried to warn the State Department about Alger Hiss nine years earlierand that a typewritten account of that meeting had been retained by aState Department official.Weinstein was able to show that documents examiners hired by the lawyersfor Alger Hiss believed Hiss had written incriminating notes. They alsobelieved the Hiss's typewriter had typed other incriminating material. One documents examiner even \\"stated flatly\\" that Priscilla Hiss typed thematerial herself!Weinstein was further able to show that the Hiss attorneys interviewedpeople who stated that Chambers had met Hiss.page 122: \\"Alger Hiss did meet 'Carl,'\\" Josephine Herbst told Rosenwald.In her interview with Mclean, Herbst gave a clear description of the\\"parallel apparatuses\\" that Peters directed Chambers to organize in Washington.>Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case&lt; is one of the dozen most interesting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"This is a reasonably convincing look at the Alger Hiss case. Author Allen Weinstein initially set out to prove Hiss' innocence, but over time his research led him to the opposite conclusion. Weinstein uses much actual testimony, which points towards Hiss' guilt for perjury - and thus of having spied for the Soviets in the 1930's. Readers see that accuser Whitaker Chambers was hardly a sympathetic witness. He was disheveled, dishonest, homosexual, and a confessed traitor. But Chambers' remembrance about Hiss' bird watching and prothonotary warblers was powerful evidence, and it's hard to believe that Hiss would have given away his used automobile to a total stranger. This book doesn't prove Hiss guilty, but it points in that direction.Sadly, the Hiss case was and remains too much about politics rather than truth. Quite a few Republicans still use Hiss to attack New Deal liberalism, Yalta, and the patriotism of Democrats. President Reagan even idiotically awarded the Medal of Freedom posthumously to Chambers - a confessed traitor! Some Democrats, for their part, reflexively defend Hiss without considering the evidence. Sound like O.J. Simpson or Oliver North? Regardless of your politics, this is a fascinating case, although the author's thick writing makes for a slightly laborious read."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"What was this all about? In July 1948 the Democrats had controlled the White House for sixteen years. In the previous elections the Republicans had gained control of Congress, this allowed them to dominate the various committees. One committee the House Committee on Un-American Activities had some success in the previous year inditing some Hollywood identities over communist based issues. It now hoped to be able to find some links between the communist party and government as a further way of advancing the Republican Cause. That is by showing that the &quot;liberals&quot; and the communists were hand in hand, it would be possible to discredit the Truman administration.Whittaker Chambers of journalist who was a self-confessed communist was called to give evidence about his associates when he had been in the party some ten years earlier. In evidence he named Alger Hiss as a fellow communist. Hiss had been an important bureaucrat at one time having a role in organizing the Yalta talks and after that organizing the United Nations. By 1948 he had been eased out of government because of security concerns but he was the head of the Carnegie Foundation a prestigious position. If it could be proven that he was a communist then it was something that would embarrass the Truman administration.....The main attraction of the book is that it is written at some distance from the events. The main problem that it has is rather than telling the story in a brief succinct way it attempts to develop an epic by interweaving the biographies of Chambers and Hiss into the narrative to illustrate something or rather. Thus it tends to go on and on at some points with grand points illustrated by colorful literary outpourings rather than focusing on the legal issues and the political context. An account of the trial and evidence would have taken about half the length."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"I like that Weinstein sought truth over politics, but found his thick writing style very laborious. I also think Hiss was guilty, but the lust of right-wingers to use him to attack the late FDR aided Hiss' defense, and inspired such niceties as McCarthyism and State Dept. purges. Like Oliver North and O.J. Simpson, Hiss cried &quot;political persecution&quot; to dupe much of the public, but Weinstein makes a strong case against him."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"Unlike Weinstein, I originally believed Hiss was guilty as charged. In 1962 Nixon's \\"Six Crises\\" boasted they \\"built a typewriter\\" for the Hiss case; the book was quickly revised. I later read \\"Room 3603\\" which told how a forged typewritten document was used to win a franchise for a British airline in 1939; I understood what this meant. Since \\"Room 3603\\" was reprinted in 1978, and again in 2000, Weinstein can look it up.The typewritten documents were decisive in convicting Hiss (p.569). So if they were forged, Hiss would be not guilty. The Appendix discusses this topic, but does not mention the 1952 TRUE magazine article of Martin Tytell, or his work for the OSS. Weinstein claims the recreated typewriter had dissimilar characters, but this only showed up under high power magnification, not the 4X used at the trial. Tytell only worked part time, and had to search for samples of type to modify for the desired results. Once he learned how to do it, and had a budget for experienced engravers, it could be done more quickly.Page 572 mentions \\"microfilm\\" but doesn't explain its purpose: it doesn't show any fingerprints, and the paper can't be analyzed. Page 575 mentions the examiners who turned down the offer of investigating forgery by typewriter. Weinstein doesn't mention that this was a very politically controversial case, and would challenge their accepted beliefs. I don't assume Chambers could have forged a document. But as an agent for an intelligence service other assets would be available to do this. Page 578 mentions the collection of \\"hundreds of Woodstocks\\" but doesn't explain why. Page 579 tells about faking letters to ruin people's careers. Can't Weinstein connect the dots?I always wondered why Henry Luce would have hired a secret Communist as a TIME magazine editor. But if Chambers was really a double agent during the 1930s, his credentials would pass this test. It was only after the complaints of readers that Luce was forced to fire Chambers. He could not explain Chamber's background without giving away the secret. Anymore than Hiss could tell that his friends in the 1930s were the Fields, not the Crosleys; read \\"Operation Splinter Factor\\" on this.The book has a number of photographs, but lacks the long suppressed 1935 photo of Chambers. This shows him sandy haired, mustached, and around 145 pounds; his mouth is closed. Compare this to the 1948 photo showing him gray haired and balding, around 300 pounds, and with corrective dental work. Do they look similar? If people you knew a dozen years ago change in appearance, do you always recognize them under a new name?One reason why I believe Hiss to be not guilty is that he continued to live in NY, and did not flee like Kim Philby or other real Soviet agents. Hiss lived long enough to see Chambers dead and Nixon disgraced, but not long enough to be rehabilitated. You are well advised to always tear up handwritten memos before throwing them in the trash so they can't be used against you. And if you have the chance to become a triple agent, consider that future management may disavow all knowledge and responsibility for your actions."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"After Watergate, people reconsidered the Hiss case (Chapter XVI). We could no longer assume that &quot;government would not lie, that law enforcement agencies would not fabricate evidence&quot; (p.548). Hiss was re-admitted to the Massachusetts bar. This book seems to have been written to convict Hiss yet again.The statements about W Chambers lead me to believe he was a psychopathic personality that any normal person would avoid. The clue was the many stories he told that are self-serving. One person said Chambers claimed Francis B Sayre was part of a Communist underground (p.337); Chambers denied this. But if you ever meet someone who tells you stories about knowing things, to impress you, its a good chance he is a con man trying to sell you something.Hiss would not have been convicted without the documents produced by Chambers. The differences in character are so vast that Chambers can't be credible. One unexplained weakness on the part of the Hisses was their friendship with the Crosleys. Could they have been so trusting as to sublet an apartment, loan a car, etc? Yes, if they were taken in by this schemer. Page 360 says &quot;most of Hiss's associates and superiors ... found no evidence of disloyalty&quot;. Is the lack of evidence proof of guilt? The State Dept is the preserve of the rich and well-connected. It is unusual for someone without wealth and family to rise so high, given the rivalry and jealousy, unless Hiss had a powerful patron. As in business, a change in regime meant his star started to fall.Why is Hiss innocent? Page 357 tells of &quot;technical surveillance&quot;: phone taps, mail cover, physical surveillance, tracking daily movements. No crime was found then. Pages 153-5 tell of the AAA purge. Was Hiss used to investigate a clique that modified the law regarding sharecroppers? Was he then moved up to another agency as his reward? Don't these things happen in corporations and government?Was Chambers sent back to the Communist Party in 1929 as a double agent? Page 314 &quot;... I have had to re-examine my position as of 1929.&quot; That could explain his break in 1937, the year of the purges. Chambers tells of hiding copies of documents as a &quot;life preserver&quot;, but I don't see how a hidden paper would help if he wasn't around to corroborate it. I once read that 30% of Communist Party officials and 10% of the membership were FBI informers. How far back did this penetration go?Page 449 quotes Alger Hiss denying giving any &quot;unauthorized&quot; documents. Did anyone ask if he gave authorized documents?Page 557 says it is impossible to &quot;exactly&quot; duplicate the characteristics of one typewriter by manufacturing another one. But if you can get 99% accuracy, that may be good enough for government work. I once read that an expert could see differences between the Hiss standard, the Tytell machine, and the microfilmed documents. This would indicate there was &quot;forgery by typewriter&quot;, and these differences should stand objective comparison."},{"Title":"Highlights of the 1990 U.S. census of population and housing by block groups: RI maps (Rhode Island map books)","review":"At first W. Chambers claimed that Alger Hiss and others were secret Communists whose purpose was to influence policy (from 1939 to November 1948). After being sued for slander Chambers produced 69 documents to support his claim of spying. Chambers earlier stated he was a Communist until &quot;1935&quot;, or &quot;early 1937&quot;, or &quot;the end of 1937&quot;, or &quot;the spring of 1937&quot;. The documents were dated between January 5 and April 1 of 1938. Chambers then changed his story to leaving on April 15, 1938. You can judge his veracity by this. Note his memory of wallpaper patterns!The original State Department files were rated &quot;classified&quot; to &quot;secret&quot;. Most consisted of trade agreements, which were of commercial, not political, importance. When Chambers learned that Alger Hiss could not type, he then claimed Priscilla did it! (Did writer and translator Chambers ASSUME that other men had this skill?) The most telling fact about these documents is that most had never been routed through sections where either Alger or Donald Hiss had worked! This discrepancy has never been explained. When the contents of the three rolls of microfilm were released in 1975, they were found to be Navy Dept instructions on how to use life rafts, fire extinguishers, and chest parachutes. Where did they come from?The biggest lie of all is Chamber's claim that the stored documents were a &quot;life preserver&quot;. Because they had no value without his testimony to corroborate them! He should have seen a lawyer, made a notarized statement, and left immortal testimony.

This tome, which was greated with much media fanfare upon its release, is largely responsible for the current situation. Allen Weinstein's book is only as important as it is because of his credentials and status as an academic. When one ignores the hype and takes an honest look at Weinstein's sources and methods, his whole edifice collapses. \\"Perjury\\" is on par with Gerald Posner's disinformation masterpiece on the JFK assassination, \\"Case Closed,\\" for dishonesty and duplicitousness. A few examples:-Six of Weinstein's interviewees have stated that Weinstein misquoted them (one can only assume deliberately), turning statements not supportive of Whittaker Chambers into ones that are. One of these interviewees, Sam Kreiger, sued Weinstein. Weinstein and his publisher settled out of court for $17,500 and issued a public apology. An erratum slip was placed in subsequent printings of the book. In the current edition of his book, Weinstein quickly glosses over this incident in a very misleading fashion and leaves the rest of this disputed material unchanged from the original edition.-Weinstein has backed down on his offer to make his research files available to all interested parties.-Weinstein misrepresents a defense team memo, making it appear as if Hiss knew the location of the infamous Woodstock typewriter and was trying to cover up. In fact, Hiss offers several posible destinations for a typewriter (the Hiss family had had three up to that point).-Speaking of the Woodstock, the evidence still demonstrates that it was forged. The serial number #230,099 is inconsistent with the timeframe in which the typewriter was supposed to be manufactured. Ditto with the soldering, which is not consistent with a Woodstock. Discrepencies between the type of #230,099 and the \\"Baltimore Documents\\" become plainly apparent when letters are magnified. Typewriter forgery is certainly not impossible, Martin Tytell built a replica of #230,099 and J. Edgar Hoover himself confirms in a memo obtained by Gil Green through FOIA that the FBI has both the ability and the means to forge a typewriter.-The \\"Pumpkin Papers\\" consisted of blank pages and unclassified naval documents regarding the proper color to paint fire extinguishers. Obviously of great importance to the Soviets.-The Venona cable, No. 1822, touted by Weinstein and others, regarding an agent named Ales appears to not have anything to do with Alger Hiss. Particularly relevant is the fact that Ales dealt in military documents while Alger Hiss was accused by Chambers of turning over State Department documents. A recently surfaced soviet document places Ales in Mexico at a time when Hiss was in Washington. This should persuade most intellectually honest people that Hiss and Ales are not one and the same.I could go on and on, but I think this should be sufficient. To those still \\"In Denial,\\" to use Hayne's and Klehr's phrase, I have only one thing to say: The truth actually feels pretty good, give it a chance."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I didn't think that I would enjoy this book when I picked it up. And while reading it, I was amazed at how much I was getting into the story. I say this because it really lacks a driving plot. Maybe because I have read way to many mysteries and thrillers where its almost impossible to break the mold of tradition where you start in point x and end in point y that it was very enjoyable to be swept up in a story where you truly do not know what was going to happen next.The author, Pilcher also does a great job of second hand story telling. By this I mean he will have a character sit down say in a pub and tell an engrossing tale to another character which allows for the reader to be swept off on a tangent. I found that Pilcher really knows what he is doing when it comes to moving a story along and it was hard to put down this title because of that.Lastly, the only fault that I found here was that besides the main character 'Dan the Man,' the supporting cast was not fleshed out very well. I liked Dan and found him to be very human as he was undergoing a life transforming change. But the others in the book (his children, mother, wife, and acquaintances) were not pushed as far as they could have been. They change, but the change is too simple.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Robin's first book when it first came out years ago, and I was happy to see this one on the shelf. I needed a quick read in between reading books for review ~~ and this one fit the bill.Dan Porter is unemployed and his wife is getting highly irritated with him as she has to work fulltime in her career and keep things going. His two daughters are upset with him because they couldn't go to their expensive private school where they were very happy. Dan Porter was living a life based nearly on depression ~~ ever since he got laid off just before 9/11. When he reads of an interview of this woman in Scotland who started up a clothing business right off the ground ~~ and that the business was for sale, he thought perhaps he should go check it out. His son, Josh, offered to come with him and together they started off on an adventure that changed their lives and outlook on life completely.It's a quick read and very entertaining. Some of the conversations can be wordy but that's what is so entertaining about them. This is just a brief glimpse into a life of a frustrated man who decided that working for fast money isn't just enough anymore. And yes, his wife is a stereotypical character, angry at him all the time ~~ but even there, the reasons for her affair are so flimsy and weak ~~ that is really the weakest part of the novel. But fortunately, she doesn't figure into the novel as much as Dan and Josh are.It's a comforting read. And I think it is fair to say that Robin will not be confused with his mom who is one of my favorite authors. He has a totally different style of writing and his way is just as interesting and engrossing ~~ with a modern flair to ages-old issues of love, infidelity and life. It's a good bet that his book won't be considered boring.4-11-05"},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Dan Porter believes his life is near perfect as he has a wonderful job with a dot com firm, married to a loving wife for twenty years, and three precocious children. However, when his company hits bad times, the policy of last in first out leaves Dan unemployed. Meanwhile his wife Jackie is managing director of Rebecca Talworth Design Limited, but makes little money as profits are returned to the company.Dan fails to get a new job, which leads to a tear in his relationship with Jackie because she feels he has become complacent while their lifestyle slips. When he reads an article in Women's Weekly about a small Scottish firm Vagabonds needing help to expand, he races north while Jackie is on the continent on business. Though the makers of the popular \\"Vaggas\\" is not what Dan expected, he finds his life changes perhaps even more than when he lost his dot com job, but Jackie's resentment grows.This is an engaging character study of a person who once was riding the crest, but since has lost his self esteem. He begins to regain his confidence with his trip to Scotland, but the cost may prove too high. The cast is a delightful ensemble, especially Dan, his family, and the Turnbows (owners of Vagabonds). Robin Pilcher provides a deep look at what really counts as Dan reassess his values and how he has lived.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Many changes in life take time, they are slow and the person involved usually does not realize what is happening until it has been going on for a while. This book faces changes in a few lives, including Dan's, at a slow \\"real time\\" pace. This novel does not have a quick, to- the-point plot, but instead it is a story of daily normal domestic (some very humorous) situations lived by interesting characters going through changes in their lives and lifestyles and how these changes are molded by the decisions made in the course of the story. I did like this book a lot, I believe all of the characters are interesting and all of the secondary characters could have been a tad more enticing if their personalities had been developed a touch more. Nevertheless, what I loved the most is that while reading this book, I was permanently reminded of Fort William and I was amazed of how well the author has caught the daily rhythm of life of a Scottish highlands town. For me, it was like being there."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I've read both of his previous efforts, loved &quot;An Ocean Apart&quot; frowned over &quot;Starting Over&quot;. This book I enjoyed for the development of its principal character. The motivations and decisions that Dan Porter made were clear to me. I could only give it three stars as I felt some of the characters were superficially developed. His wife Jackie for example, I had no sense how she felt about her children, what motivated her to not consider custody of them, what was so attractive about Stephen. And Kate, the pivotal action she took was out of the blue, Maxwell Borthwick was a flat caricature. All of this aside, Pilcher has a lovely way with words, an adept, preceptive and warm manner in his presentation of children and adolescents, and wins me over every time portraying friendships of kindred spirits. I have to admit to taking him as he came, I haven't read any of Rosamund Pilcher's books, if having that name before him enhanced his being published, I am glad for it."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Mr. Pilcher puts together a fine story focusing on relationships and personal transformation. His characters are believable though not too deep or complex. The story moves along and is interesting.I listened to the cd of the book, and the narrator does an exceptional job reading the book and speaking for the characters' accents. You will thoroughly enjoy listening to him. I found myself sitting in the parked car to continue to listen--it is the audio equivalent of a page turner.I think this is well-written and fluid and explores some of the dynamics in today's family that has two working parents trying to fulfill themselves in careers and family."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Superb writer---my favorite author!!! Another great book by Robin. Good story, theme---everything. One of the best in language use. Just terrific."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I have never read a dreadful Pilcher book by either mother or son but some are better than others. Robin does not write as well as his mother but his books stand on their own. This is a nice read I would recommend to others. It is not the best of the bunch but I am glad I bought and read it."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I read the book, but was disappointed. The characters were not well developed and the movement was choppy.It would probably make a great TV movie, though.So far none of Robin's books I have read are as good as his mother's. But I'll keep on reading and hoping."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"NOT very believable. The problems Dan and family faced do not \\"fix\\" themselves just by wishful thinking as Pilcher would have us believe.A lay-about Dad goes to remote Scotland and \\"finds himself\\" within days; his lay-about son follows Dad and \\"finds himself\\" within days; two spoiled-brat teenage daughters go to visit Dad and brother and \\"find themselves\\" within HOURS. Poor wifie-Jackie--stays home and \\"loses herself.\\" Only a total misogynist could create a woman as shallow and unredeeming as that. The best and only redeeming feature of the \\"book\\" was listening to the audio-CD version's wonderful Scottish accent of the narrator."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Well, I struggled through this one, putting it down several times for a week or more at a time. The biggest problem with this book? The characters engage in pages-long soliloquies in order to fill in the story. I know it worked for Shakespeare, but it just isn't working here. If I ever engaged in a conversation where the other person was giving me five-minute speeches like this I would go to sleep, or go hang myself.The next biggest problem? Very sterotypical & flat characters. The wife is your stereotypical angry witch-wife. The protagonist is your stereotypical good-guy-trying-to-deal-with-angry-witch-wife. No story or relationship is that simple. It would have been much more interesting to read if these main characters had been realistic, or had realistic interactions. Neither one of the main characters inspires your pity or your interest. What is interesting about reading about a dysfunctional family & crumbling marriage -- all of which is failing because of two completely selfish & self-serving people? They can't even be bothered to take proper care of their children. This sort of family tragedy is all too common & isn't appealing when it is glorified as just a \\"life choice\\" & portrayed so unrealistically in its affects on the people involved. I was also appalled that the character was so \\"moved\\" by the events of 9/11 that he felt inspired to abandon his marriage & family, and that this is portrayed as perfectly reasonable & good behavior--all while remaining extremely critical of his wife for doing the same thing.This book was hard to read because of its long, unrealistic character speeches, its unrealistic characters acting like stereotypes. And the ending is just disappointing & makes me feel a bit pessimistic about the whole human condition."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I really enjoyed this book; however, I felt the book ended before the story was done. I feel like it's all still hanging in midair. I HOPE MR. PILCHER DOES A SEQUEL SO I CAN HAVE SOME CLOSURE!Some of the characters were more developed than the others. I understood Dan re-evaluating his life, family and career (I did the same thing, having myself been laid off from a dot.com company in July just before 9/11). I did NOT understand Jackie (nor did I like her much - which was probably the point of her), however from Dan's reminiscences of their early relationship I would have thought she would have more depth and character than to abandon her entire family - she struck me as the martyr type.With all of that, I must say I quite enjoyed myself. I'm a huge Rosamunde Pilcher fan and find Robin to be an equally satisfying author."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I enjoyed this book for its contrasting settings and characters. The main character is Dan Porter who faces problems the rest of us confront too. He is a man who cares about his family and enjoys his career. Quite suddenly he loses his job in the the dot com crash. After about 20 years of marriage Dan and his wife find they have different goals. Dan goes to rural Scotland for one day to check into a business venture and ends up staying much longer. I especially liked the author's description of Scotland and and the prawn packing plant. The characters are quite believable down to Dan's dogs and teenage daughters."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Once again, I enjoyed this novel by Robin Pilcher. I no longer attempt to compare his writings with his mother's. He stands alone and he's doing a splendid job. I have been a fan of Rosamunde Pilcher for quite a while now having read every one of her novels and enjoying them thoroughly."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"After two false starts, Robin Pilcher has come into his own with his newest novel, &quot;A Risk Worth Taking.&quot;This is the story of Londoner Dan Porter, a dot-com wunderkind whose entire fairytale life falls apart on 9/11, when he loses several close and dear friends in New York, and is subsequently laid off (made redundant, as the Brits say) due to the crash of the dot-com industry. As the book opens, Dan is a house husband, dealing with his three surly teenagers and his equally surly wife Jackie, a high-powered executive in her own right who has no patience or sympathy with her husband's jobless condition.Dan is going in circles, both emotionally and professionally, when, on pure whim (unlike him completely), he suddenly decides to invest in a Scottish clothing company he has read about in a magazine. Dan's trip to Scotland, his subsequent reawakening, the friends he makes, and the unexpected turns he experiences, both in his own life, and that of his three children, change him, his marriage, his view of life, and his very soul forever.I could not turn the pages fast enough to finish this wonderful book, and I am thrilled that Robin Pilcher has finally found his way, free of his mother's formidible reputation and finally able, like Dan Porter, to stand on his own. Bravo, Robin! Well done indeed."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"A Risk worth Taking follows the adventures of Dan Porter, unemployed, unsuccessful house husband of career-driven wife, and father of three. Dan impulsively goes to Scotland, gets himself involved with a woman running a mail-order business, and changes his life completely.Trouble is that Dan and the other characters are entirely two-dimensional, the plot dreadfully contrived, and the whole tale boringly predictable. All Robin Pilcher's male characters are somewhat similar - selfish, irresponsible and foolish. The women are all sex objects, with the occasional career thrown in to make it PC. The kids are cardboard cut-outs from a \\"choose your own problem child\\" handbook. Throw in the odd Type A, B, or C businessman/politician, etc., and there you have it.This level of writing and story-telling is acceptable if you want something like a \\"Woman's Own\\" story. If you want something a little more creative and challenging, more of a meal than a gooey doughnut with your cup of tea, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher is one of my favorite authors. Sadly, her son, Robin Pilcher, cannot pull off a writing coup such as his mother's immortal \\"Shell Seekers\\" or \\"Winter Soltice\\", books guaranteed to give you a long, cozy read, full of well-crafted characters, meticulous descriptions and highly enjoyable narrative. Robin Pilcher's work provides nothing but doom and gloom, with stiffly written characters, forced plot lines, inconclusive and feeble endings, and a boring storyline. I read this entire book because I kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately it did not improve. I find Pilcher's writing stilted and his characters shallow. His plot is obvious, the conclusion even more so. For more enjoyable reading, check out the wonderful writings of Rosamunde Pilcher, acclaimed British novelist."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"This book was awful. First of all, it took just about half the book to get to the real plot. (It followed a couple other potential plot threads first before the author settled on one.) Once the plot was settled on, the ending was easy to determine. No need to read the rest of the book.I won't be reading another one by this author."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Like many of Robin Pilcher's readers, I tried a second book by him (the first was \\"Starting Over\\") in a vain attempt to find something similar to the books written by the author's far more talented mother, Rosamunde Pilcher, who, sadly, has stopped writing. Again -- a complete disappointment. Robin Pilcher has learned some of his mother's narrative skills but has never managed to make any of his characters into someone most of us actually want to read about: Dan Porter is another obtuse, unlikeable man, whose wife I wholeheartedly symphathize with -- I'd leave him too. Pilcher's characters are shallow and uninteresting, with ridiculous motivations (for example, why would Dan Porter decide to \\"stay home for his family,\\" turning down all job offers and knowingly causing chaos in the process; but neglect to tell his family about his reasons for doing so?).I have trudged through two Robin Pilcher novels and I won't try another one. For those who think they might like to read this book, I strongly urge them to start with the Rosamunde Pilcher novels instead."},{"Title":"Titanic Lessons for IT Projects","review":"Reviewed by Regan Windsor for Reader Views (9/06)Any failed project can feel as catastrophic as the sinking of the Titanic, and we can all learn from the lessons of failed projects. \\"Titanic Lessons for IT Projects\\" brings both these premises together by taking a look at the lifespan of the building and sailing of the Titanic \\"project\\" and comparing the lessons learned to that of the IT Project life cycle.\\"Titanic Lessons for IT Projects\\" analyzes all facets of the building, marketing, and sailing of the Titanic. Full of informative diagrams, details, and insight it provides interesting and informative information on project management from lessons learned in the sinking of the Titanic.The Titanic, like many IT projects, faced many failures after the project was deemed complete and \\"in production.\\" However, many of the failures can be attributed to processes and design compromises throughout the project. Non-functional items were cut back to make way for more functional requirements (such as reducing the height of the bulkheads to allow for a larger ballroom, thereby reducing the ships ability to contain flooding). Proper testing was not carried out at various phases of the project due to pressures of time constraints and overconfidence; again major pitfalls in IT projects.Just as project management companies can gain valuable insight for future projects through the analysis of both successful and, more importantly, failed projects the project management world can benefit from an analysis of the failure of one of the world's most famous failed projects. Not only does \\"Titanic Lessons for IT Projects\\" highlight the importance of testing, design, and ensuring the project does not become blinded by external agendas, it does so by providing real life analysis from an intriguing and thorough analysis of a historical legend. Full of fascinating facts and analysis it is easy to forget you are learning the facets of project management!Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Titanic Lessons for IT Projects","review":"When I first saw the title of this book I had to smile at the thought of the big IT projects with which I have been associated that subsequently sank as though they had run into an iceberg.An example though of how this book approaches comparing the Titanic with an IT project: One way to get an advance notice of an iceberg ahead is to pull up a bucket of sea water and get its temperature -- it's colder around the iceberg. A sailor was assigned to do this. He was observed filling the bucket with tap water, the rope he was given was too short to reach the sea. The IT meaning - set up tests, but be sure the tests are real and that the results of the test are based on real data not what is easy to obtain or pre-determined by other means.This book is an easy reading - light hearted approach to illustrating some real truths about how projects (not only IT projects) really work. You'll pick up a few ideas about why the last project was so over time and over budget, and perhaps the next one will go better."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"I read this book after one of my Colombian friend recommended it. I could not put it down once I started reading it. It is not an easy reading and it requires you to think about how everybody in the western world takes life and facilities for granted which people in countries like Colombia strive hard to achieve.This book is a fantastic tale of individuals who don't take no for an answer, who had a dream and they worked to achieve it and in the process created an outstanding example of the fact that 'life and nature can co-exist' because that is how they were before we made discoveries and inventions to conquer nature.The book ends with a final message...If you have a dream then pursue it...you will meet people along the way who share your thinking...Hope floats."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read!

Not only are the people of Gaviotas innovators, but visionaries aided by the studies past and present technologies. While reading this tale I was not only amazed by the resourcefulness of a few people, rather what the implications are to the human family as a whole. It seems that the people of Gaviotas have given themselves an education that no classroom can offer. In fact quite the contrary, they are scholars of the laws of nature.One thing that I learned from this book is that it is easy to get stuck thinking within the parameters of modern society. It seems that every technology around us is based purely on the short term and hard resources. However it is the natural dynamics of Earth which run the resource base for the natural world, the wind, hot, cold and ultimately the sun."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"At its best, Gaviotas is a wonderfully inspiring story of real people facing real problems, and coming up with real solutions (which sometimes work and somtimes don't work). The book is brimming with interesting tidbits, stories, and personalities. What is absent is a more coherent account of the implications of Gaviotas for the rest of the world. To be sure, there are plenty of these implications voiced by the residents of Gaviotas themselves, which is perhaps as the author intended. But these are too scattered. If the author himself had taken more time to step back and do some pleading himself, it would have been a much more satisfying book. But as it is, I would recommend it. But it should be read in tandem with a book like Richard Douthwaite's &quot;Short Circuit&quot; or Michael Shuman's &quot;Going Local&quot; -- both of these titles have more analytical and social substance, and are less anecdotal in tone than Gaviotas."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"The third world, particularly Columbia, gets horrible press nowadays for its violent drug-ridden society.

There may be wonderful things happening in the llanos (especially the reforestation), but little of it seems capable of transfer to other settings.

Keep hope alive!&quot; we were with him, but I, for one, was left wondering where this hope was. Alan Weisman's &quot;Gaviotas&quot;, a chronicle of the Colombian village Gaviotas, is the real McCoy in black and white. Over and over again, &quot;Gaviotas&quot; details the hope-filling victories towards a smarter, more harmonious way of living with simple, clever, appropriate technology leading the way.&quot;Gaviotas&quot; talks about the power of creative thought sharply focussed on simple, appropriate technology for totally ignored boonies of the Colombia's tropical plains. It talks about the creation of an extremely dedicated community out of an infertile, barren plains in the middle of war-torn Colombia. It talks about the seemingly miraculous transformation of grassland into rainforest and the tireless dedication of it's creators. It talks about the power of community, networking and partnerships with universities.I was, however, disappointed by the relative lack of contact people, organizations, and publishings for people interested in creating their own community. The story of the Gaviotas community is so inspiring it deserves a newsgroup of its own on the internet!Being an engineer by trade, I was left brimming with questions. How did they come up with the process for ultra-black copper sheeting? Where can I get the six films about Gaviotas made by Pepe Gomez? How can a roof focus and reflect heat away from a building? Can a Gaviotas be created here in the U.S. or is life too easy here?&quot;Gaviotas&quot; is beautifully written; a real turner.

That village was Gaviotas; this book is his result.I read this book on a recommendation from Daniel Quinn, author of &quot;The Story of B&quot; and &quot;Beyond Civilization.&quot; Quinn's entire philosophy rests on two ideas: living in a sustainable manner, and allowing the reader to come up with their own solutions for doing so. Gaviotas is a community where people did just that - through ingenuity, creativity, and hard work, the residents of this planned village created a place where water is pulled from the ground using pumps attached to children's see-saws, heat is provided by the sun, and electricity by the wind.It's a progressive's dream come true, and an experiment that has succeeded in all possible ways. This book lays out the history of Gaviotas and its unique founder, Paolo Lugari, and places it within the context of the ongoing struggles in Colombia. In the wake of the World Trade Center attack, I decided to re-read Gaviotas to remind myself that not only is there hope for humanity as a whole, but hope that individuals will begin to take responsibility to begin freeing ourselves from the confining forces of our self-imposed prisons called &quot;civilization,&quot; but still manage to retain the good things, too.Every person on earth should read and re-read this book. If you haven't, buy it now or start hoofing it to the library."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"A captivatingly inspirational account of story that reaches to the core of what is remarkable about human nature, human courage, and human ingenuity achieving something great and important in the face of daunting conditions. The continuing adaptive accomplishments of the Gaviotas people in the face of multiple challenges -- extreme environmental conditions, corrupt government practices, turbulent and deadly national politics, indifferent and unsupportive post-1980s corporate globalization, continuing uncertainty -- is truly an affirmation that people can, and hopefully will, achieve a kind of society that is both ecologically sustainable and humanly necessary. This book is 'the power of one' writ large on our collective future.I teach a university course entitled: Humanistic Values in a Technological Society and, in the face of social and environmental problems caused by industrialization and electronic media-technology, it is difficult for the title not to seem a proverbial oxymoron. In the future this book will be required reading so that students can see that indeed there are solutions to our collective problems, both human and technological. One reviewer bemoaned that there was no 'useful information' in the book, meaning it was short on technical details (I am sure this will follow if sufficient positive interest is shown to this publication). In response I would point out that the people of Gaviotas have shown that the most important and necessary 'commodity' of the future is and will be human inspiration and perseverance; given these, the details will follow. I thank Alan Weisman for telling the Gaviotas story."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"In 1966, when he was 22, Paolo Lugari and his brother drove over barely passable roads to a desolate area 200 miles east of Bogota, Columbia. The llanos area is a poor-soil barren that grows only a few nutrient-deficient grasses, a vast expanse of sun-baked plains in spite of over 100 inches of rain per year. A place of deadly water and hungry mosquitos. Conditions were so daunting that the Columbian government abandoned an attempt to build a road through the area. Lugari saw an opportunity to create something very special. And he did it. Today Gaviotas is a thriving, sustainable community of hundreds of joyous people studying, inventing, producing, singing and dancing amidst a huge forest that they planted. Residents from all walks of life have designed and built, planted and harvested, birthed, nurtured, taught, and entertained. There are teeter-totters that operate super-efficient pumps to bring water to the school, solar heat to cook meals, solar kettles to sterilize drinking water, ultra-light windmills to provide power. The hospital has been designated one of the 40 most important buildings in the world. Some have called Gaviotas a utopia. Lugari insists that, &quot;Utopia literally means no place. We call Gaviotas a topia because it's real.&quot; Gaviotas the village is surprising, uplifting, extraordinary. Gaviotas the nonfiction book is as compelling as a novel, as educational as a textbook, as inspirational as the biography of a great person. If you need to rise early, do not take this book to bed with you."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"In 1998, journalist Alan Weisman collected and presented information about a little known, yet quite monumental, village known as Gaviotas. To get there, one must travel 16 hours by car from the nearest major Columbian city, Bogot&aacute;. Even then the path there is not a smooth one; rough, muddy roads and severe political unrest serve as some major barriers in getting to Gaviotas. So why then is such an arduous trip worth it; in essence, Gaviotas is yet another tiny village located in a generally uninhabitable region and possesses none of the modern modes of transportation or communication that we are accustomed to. While in a sense these aspects may be true of Gaviotas, it is also undeniable that this community holds as one of the most efficient, supportive, and thoughtful communities on the planet.Started in 1971 by a group of Bogot&aacute; scientists, Gaviotas originally was created as a sort of scientific experiment, a reaction to the way things were - which clearly wasn't working. A Gaviotas saying goes \\"the real maturity in life is to realize your dreams\\" and the founders of Gaviotas did just that when they decided to create their own society. The harsh life and extreme poverty that had been rampant in developing urban areas paired with the blatant depletion of natural resources was enough to spark the idea that maybe there should be a change. Yet instead of trying to make changes in the system already in place, this group of determined individuals took on the radical notion of creating an entirely new, segregated, yet completely self-sufficient, place to live. And that is just what happened."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Twenty-seven years ago, a group of South Americans envisioned a society in which limited resources would form the base of a sustainable future. To bring their experiment to life, they chose a site in the sparsely populated and nearly arid plains of eastern Colombia. They called their village &quot;Gaviotas&quot; and went on to create a host of ingenious and relatively affordable technologies. Alan Weisman produced a documentary on Gaviotas for National Public Radio in 1994. After producing his radio documentary, Weisman maintained an avid interest in Gaviotas. He returned to the village several times in the past few years, and updates the Gaviotas story in his new book: &quot;Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World.&quot; Weisman, a journalist based in Tucson, AZ, has covered some of the world's worst ecological disasters, but when he needs his faith in the future restored, he always returns to Gaviotas where, he says, &quot;people seem to have gotten it right.&quot; This book documents the successful implemntation of a self-sufficient, harmonious, ecologically based community that is building a sustainable economy. Gaviotas comes as close as human society can to achieving a real Utopia - and perhaps will serve as a model for a more balanced way of life for all of us."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Do you believe in Utopia? Throughout history people have looked for the ideal community, a place where problems are solved, not created, where a dream of peace and harmony can be fulfilled. In the words of the high llama of Shangri-La, in Capra's classic film, Lost Horizon: 'the world must begin to look for a new life and it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be kind. When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.' Alan Weisman writes his account of the Columbian settlement of Gavoitas firmly in the tradition of utopian literature: he has found his Shangri-La and it is not only a utopia but an eco-topia too. I found the story he has to tell immensely inspiring from an environmental point of view, especially his description of the way in which the Gaviotans have managed to reforest the pampas. However, I also found that the way he tells the story detracts from some of its potential power. At one point, he mistakenly claims that 'utopia' is the Greek for 'no place'and that therefore Gaviotas cannot be a utopia because it exists. In fact 'utopia' is Greek for 'good place', which would admirably describe Gaviotas, I would have thought. The problem with utopian writing is that it often leaves the reader doubting the reality of the place described. Can Shangri-La really be found? Can Gaviotas really exist, magically protected as it is from the twin ravages of marxist gorillas and cocaine barons? In promoting the positive aspects of the Gaviotan experiment, Weisman downplays any negative aspects that must surely exist. I would have liked to have read an account that presented the settlement 'warts and all', rather than this rather one-sided eulogy. Sure, Gaviotas may well be a utopia, a 'good place', and so many of its discoveries could well change the world, but please, Mr Weisman, let the reader decide."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"The vision described in the book is inspiring and very hopeful. The idea is to use our ingenuity in ways directly adapted to our environment so that small towns can be self-sufficient. Along the way, very clever uses of wind and water are discovered and described. If the reader is looking for great general ideas or approaches, this book would be hard to beat. On the other hand, if you are a garage-tinkerer and would delight in building the clever devices described, this book is close but no cigar. The drawings offered in the book purposely omit the most important details required to fabricate the devices in a proper working form. If you are a tinkerer and want to build these \\"goodies,\\" you have three options. In the U.S., you can e-mail with the \\"Sustainable Village\\" web site and get the plans (eventually---they are not quick in responding). You can contact the Gaviotas offices in Bogota, Colombia. You can, of course, also take the basic idea and think through the details for yourself. That could take longer and be a little more expensive---perhaps. If you primarily want the ideas and the inspiration, then buy the book, by all means. If you primarily want to tinker and build, go straight for the plans."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"This is truly one of the most inspirational books I have ever read, for a couple of reasons. For the most part, utopian ideals such as this are very hard to envision as a real solution, because they tend to be made up of people who for whatever reasons are willing to give up the creature comforts and bring their standard of living down a few notches. Whether or not their new style of living is actually better, and more enriching is not the issue in my mind, what is the issue is that the vast majority of those in the first world would under no circumstances give up those luxuries.But Gaviotas is a colony founded not by communalists or hippies, but by pragmatic engineers, who enjoy many creature comforts. They do not attempt to drastically change the social structure into something entirely non-hierarchical; instead, one gets the impression this is a group of very intelligent people, who realized they were destroying the planet they lived on with their lifestyles, and so keep it on a 'selfish' level, rather than introducing an ideological debate. This is terribly important, in my mind, to creating a new world in which we can live sustainably.This book is well written, full of intriguing concepts which will send you out looking for more information about photovoltaic systems and how exactly pumps work, and most of all, full of more hope than anything I have read in... well, forever.After all, if this can work in the middle of a virtual desert, in -Columbia- of all places, than it should be able to work anywhere.I recently bought fifty copies of this book, and I give them to almost everyone I meet. I'm not a zealot by nature, but this book is so very important, I would urge every single person who is considering buying it to do so, and to tell fifty friends as soon as you've read it."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Disclaimer: I do not know Alan Weisman and do not hold stock in Chelsea Green.&quot;Gaviotas: A Village To Reinvent the World&quot; is the story of the failures and successes of small but visionary sustainable community project in the &quot;wastes&quot; of Colombia's llano. The project succeeds, fails, and succeeds again in spite of drug war, guerrilla war, corruption (uh, I guess this goes without saying), inhospitable environment, unpredictable if not lame government policies, fires, chronic underfunding, technology learning curves, and more. What the pioneers of Gaviotas lack in stability and funding they make up with faith, cajones, and inspired resourcefulness. And a lot of hard hard work.The machines the Gaviotans make and the town they build are dreams made real. Power generators using wind and water, solar-powered pressure cookers and water purifiers--they even manage to make a solar-powered refridgerator that operates on ammonia instead of freon. &quot;Why make blueprints?&quot; one of the engineers says. &quot;You're going to build it anyway. It's easier to design in three dimensions.&quot;Gaviotas-the-place sounds like a slice of paradise (albeit surrounded by chaos and otras cosas muy malas). No crime. No police. Neighbors who help each other. Excellent homemade music. Constant innovation, frequently in the guise of inspired play.Author Alan Weisman is an NPR reporter/NY Times Magazine (et al.) writer who handles the big story with ease. Very readable. Not so techy as to alienate the non-geeks. Written with a two-part focus on the people *and* the machines they design and build. Plenty of humor, reverence, and plainly stated cold hard facts."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Gaviotas the place is amazing! I can't believe how many good ideas were put into practice in one community! Incredible. All working/aspiring engineers, city planners, architects, etc. should having a working knowledge of the theories and practices Alan Weisman describes in this book.Humans CAN be part of a non-destructive, even a positive, productive relationship with their surroundings. We CAN prosper without decimating everything with which we interact. Gaviotas is a good start--a good example for the rest of the world.READ THE BOOK! BUY THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Come along as Alan Weisman deftly weaves the true story of one man's dream and many peoples making. A dream of hope for our planet and belief in the triumph of many human spirits.Gaviotas is a dream that Colombian Paolo Lugari had over 30 years ago. A dream that Paolo never let go of and with the help of an indomitable group of engineers, teachers, doctors, students, musicians and native Colombian Indians he has succeeded in accpmplishing. Blessed along the way with grants from the United Nations as well as others, they have brought that dream, Gaviotas, to fruition.Paolo always believed that a self-sustainable community could prosper, working with nature instead of against her. To that end he found a piece of environmentally challenged land in the Savannas of Colombia and began his dream.The engineers went to work. Their solar technology runs everything from lights to phones to water pumps and heaters to water purification plants. They discovered how to ! get solar energy from the low light of rainy days, since the rainy season at Gaviotas lasts for 8 months of the year. The children's see-saw is used to draw water from the well. They grow their own food, then cook it with methane from cow manure. They&quot;air conditioned&quot; the hospital with centuries old techniques using not one whit of electricity. They've even managed to re-establish an ancient rain forest, and a thriving renewable industry to go with it.This would be a remarkable feat anywhere. That it was accomplished in Colombia is astounding. Colombia is as battle-scared as any nation on earth. In one decade alone over two thousand poloticians and two presidental candidates were murdered.Through all of this Gaviotas has thrived and willingly made changes when needed. They have shared unstintingly with those in need all around the world, all the while staying consciously unarned while surrounded by battling vigilantes, government troops and guerillas.!Weisman has told the story of the Gaviotans and their ! accomplishments so beautifully, it is one of those rare stories that I did not want to end. And in reality it has not ended because Gaviotas continues to grow and prosper.In a world where most of us doubt that these things can really be accomplished Gaviotas holds out a real hope for the future of this Planet."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Gaviotas describes the trials &amp; tribulations of Environmental Improvement in a place called the LLANOS in Colombia-The book has inspired me to help fund a project to bring Internet to Schools in the Caribbean-We want to thank Alan Weisman for risking his life-That was the part in the book that was a sort of wake-up call for me personally-and bringing back the stories of people's lives that have made an incredible difference in the preservation of our planet. The book also shows the positive and hard-working nature the Colombian people pride themselves on-yet it is never shown the way that GAVIOTAS does. All Colombianos should buy this book for their family to enjoy-and buy an extra one and send to your relatives in Colombia."},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"It was one of the best books I've ever read.Go get it right now!"},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"Has anyone actually tried to understand the two big &quot;inventions&quot; the author describes? Can any of you make the &quot;sleeve pump&quot; work given the explanation and diagram in the book? Does the solar water still make any sense? If you can, I would like to hear from you, because I can't. I have raised these points wqith both the author and the publisher but got no help Dave Johnson"},{"Title":"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World","review":"As someone living in a very remote area with unreliable or nonexistant technological supports, I was extremely interested in just what the Gaviotans managed to accomplish and invent. Unfortunately, this book gives little to no details about their inovations (except for vague descriptions)and focuses instead mostly on the personalities involved. We are repeatedly (unendingly) told about how brillant and incredible they are while getting only an occasional superficial token look at what they did. Granted, there is room for other books than &quot;how to&quot; manuals, but I really hoped to come away from this book with at least a few ideas to try. It is a book about inventors after all. Where are the inventions? For me....a waste of money. Wait until you can check it out of the library. This is not a book that you are likely to refer back to after you have read it once."},{"Title":"How to Draft Basic Patterns (4th Edition)","review":"This book offers the most basic (and some selected not so basic) patterns such as the front and back bodice, the sleeve, and the skirt draft. If you are already familiar with fashion design, you know that from those 4 drafts, you can go on to produce anywhere from coats to pants.The book is written in a clear and straight-to-the point manner; no confusing terms if you are, as I had mentioned, already familiar with fashion design. The diagrams are in black in white and are clearly labeled. The steps are laid out clearly and the instructions are very to-the-point. Another great feature about this book is that in it had black and white photos of the tools needed to make patterns, a must for those beginners who have no idea what a french curve looks like. There are also some brief but clear definitions and explanations to certain terms or phrases used in the book.The only downside to this book is that it is expensive for what you get (By the way, that's the reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5). The book is thinner than you'd expect... I'd say that it is less than 200 pages, probably even less. I myself was surprised despite the fact that I bought it used for [less]. I couldn't believe how thin it was. I was expecting a thick and heavy text book. Go figure.Oh and another thing, the book also includes a neckline measuring device supposedly produced by the publisher. I'm not sure if that contributes to the price but if it does, I say \\"What!?\\" It's made out of plastic but works beautifully. Luckily, my used version came with one in tact."},{"Title":"How to Draft Basic Patterns (4th Edition)","review":"I am thrilled with this book. It is clear, concise, and thorough. I'm totally excited to make all the slopers to begin creating my own library of designs. Content-wise the only drawbacks is that it's mostly based on standard form sizes. They do give directions about how to measure the body and the drafting itself is pretty simply explained so either measurements can be used. Also, there aren't instructions about collars or cuffs or button/zipper extensions which, granted, are not really necessarily drafted by measurements. But you do need a supplemental Flat pattern making book for those items.The only real cons I can tell are the publisher's fault - not the author's. The book is rather skinny for the price - I too was expecting a monster text. Should have known better - its a textbook right? so of course they gouge the student. Shameless really. On top of it, it is rather cheaply done - the pages look like photocopies!Also, one reviewer mentioned that it came with the neckline tool - I didn't get one! Now I have to scour the internet to find a replacement because they don't have directions about how to draft a neckline. My only real annoyance."},{"Title":"How to Draft Basic Patterns (4th Edition)","review":"My benefits included basic instructions regarding sleeve cap design, and detailed instruction on taking accurate measurements. I've added this book to my most available resources in my office, and refer to it frequently in the course of designing my own patterns and &quot;fixing&quot; commercially printed ones."},{"Title":"How to Draft Basic Patterns (4th Edition)","review":"I feel that not enough information is given on pants. When explaining the draft for pants or slack it refers continuously to the skirt. Also, it is to confusing in trying to explain how to draft a pattern."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"There was considerable interest in this book in the chess world, and some expectation of controversy. Fischer is a fascinating subject in his own right. He recently got back in the news after being detained in Japan for eight months before being given Icelandic citizenship and dramatically flown to the site of his 1972 triumph. Kasparov has not escaped Fischer's anti-Jewish ravings, and Fischer even accused Kasparov and Karpov of pre-arranging, not merely the results, but the actual moves of the games of their matches.There is also the little matter of historical reputation. Kasparov's dominance of world chess over the last 20 years has been extraordinary. It is very difficult for an objective reviewer to do other than accord him the title of greatest chessplayer of all time. But it is difficult for him to move out of the shadow of a man who quit at the height of his fame and ability at the age of 29 and, apart from a single match, has been virtually invisible since 1972. In short, Kasparov has some reasons to feel bitterness towards his famous prececessor, and many were curious to see if that bitterness would leach into the book.I am happy to report that there seems to be very little of that (although I think it affects his discussion of Fischer's great 1970-72 surge -- see below). Apart from 250 pages about Fischer, it also includes shorter sections on Miguel Najdorf, Samuel Reshevsky (and his rival Reuben Fine) and Bent Larsen. I particularly enjoyed the section on Larsen, who played many fine games. But the focus of the book is Fischer.It does not disappoint. First of all, there is a wonderful selection of games. Fischer's greatest hits: the \\"Game of the Century\\" against Donald Byrne in 1956, the famous brilliancy against Robert Byrne in 1963, the crush against Larsen in 1958, Black Magic against Portisch are all here. As before, in such games Kasparov and Dimitry Plisetsky [what to say about him] make ready use of old analysis, as well as computer programs. [Do they do anything new?] But there is also a good selection of games that are less well known. Kasparov plucks an obscure Fischer win over Tal from Curacao 1962, showing how Fischer, after an umpromising opening, grinds away at the position and finally comes away with a win. It's a good reminder that one of Fischer's greatest assets was his relentless, implacable will to win.Kasparov does a pretty thorough job on the Candidates matches that finally brought Fischer a match for the world title. It is on these matches - the 6-0 crushes of Taimanov and Larsen - that Fischer's legend is founded. The games are extraordinary and since they postdate Fischer's own My 60 Memorable Games, I was not so familiar with them. Kasparov outdoes himself. Game 1 of the match is annotated for eight pages. It is by no means a one-sided struggle. As readers of Bronstein's book on the 1953 Candidates tournament know, Taimanov was a gifted attacking player, and with white in this game he went all out, sacrificing a pawn for strong attacking chances. Fischer, of course, met him head on. As Kasparov shows, Fischer ran huge risks throughout, and Taimanov missed chances to gain a clear advantage. But in time pressure, Taimanov cracked, and Fischer won the ferocious struggle. Other games in the match are analyzed with similar thoroughness.A second, wholly unexpected strength of the book is the biography of Fischer. The book contains quotes from source material not included in previous books about Fischer, including Profile of a Prodigy, Bobby Fischer vs. the Rest of the World and Bobby Fischer Goes to War. My favorite was a 1963 letter from Fischer to Larry Evans that vividly demonstrates Fischer's work ethic: \\"I am mainly occupying my time by studying old openings books and believe it or not I am learning a lot! They don't waste space on the Catalan, Reti, King's Indian Reversed and other rotten openings.\\" Another: \\"Dear Larry, I am up here at yyour father's office still working on the Keres-Reshevsky game! . . . About the books: I would like the book on Anderssen's games by von Gotschall also the 1872 Bilguer's handbuch also the book on Cochrane's games interests me.\\" (315) This is something Kasparov can appreciate, since he famously revived the old Scotch Game.So, I warmly recommend the book, with a few minor criticisms. I think Kasparov is a little too eager to demonstrate that Fischer's overwhelming successes from 1970 through 1972 were the result of his opponents' psychological weaknesses as well as Fischer's own strength. Sometimes this leads him into dubious assertions. For example, annotating Smyslov's loss to Fischer at the Palma interzonal, Kasparov criticizes Smyslov's 7th move, Na4, writing: \\"A very strange, passive plan. Smyslov is afraid of entering into a theoretical discussion with Fischer, but in so doing, and this is altogether atypical of him, he disrupts the harmonious coordination of his pieces.\\" (357) At the end of his notes to the game, Kasparov writes, \\"Even such a battle-hardened and illustrious fighter as Smyslov played with a feeling of doom against Fischer.\\" (358) But Smyslov opened the same way against Tal in 1964, a game annotated in an earlier volume of OMGP! Evidently this approach to the opening is not so rare for Smylov, and it is difficult to believe that Smyslov was feeling particularly doomed against Fischer that day. Annotating a Petrosian-Fischer game from 1970, Kasparov criticizes Petrosian's 13th move, trading off a well-placed knight, and writes \\"apparently, Petrosian was thinking only of a draw . . .\\". A few moves later Petrosian launches an all-out attack. Betraying no discomfort, Kasparov comments \\"White has nevertheless pushed forward. . .\\". (342).Another anomaly is his treatment Fischer's style. Kasparov echoes many commentators when he says that Fischer evinced a strong preference for the light-square bishop over the knight, comparing him to Rubinstein in this regard. However, Kasparov also quotes extensively from a \\"dossier\\" Botvinnik assembled for his planned match with Fischer, at one point calling it a \\"subtle and professional analysis.\\" Well, although Kasparov never points this out, in the dossier, Botvinnik wrote that a study of Fischer's games showed that he preferred knights to bishops! This is so at odds with the conventional wisdom and with Kasparov's book that it is very strange that he didn't even mention it.In any case, these are quibbles. I loved OMGP IV and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"I was not planning on buying these books,just based on some of the lukewarm reviews,and also on the fact that I already have quite a few of the games in other books in my library.I ended up browsing one of them in a bookstore,and was impressed enough that I bought them all.I recently read that Kasparov was planning on revising the first two volumes because he wasn't as happy with them as he was with the latter two.I would agree with this,as the volumes concerning Petrosian,Spassky,Fischer et al seem a lot more fleshed out.I wasn't particularly interested in this volume,since so much has been written about Fischer through the years--what more is there to say?Surprisingly,I found a lot of Kasparov's (or Kasparov and company) comments interesting and penetrating.For whatever reasons,Fischer has always inspired an insane amount of hero worship and mythology around himself,and so any book taking an objective look at his career is bound to upset or disappoint some people.To those who have written that Kasparov is unfair to Fischer in this book,I have to disagree--if anything,he is generous.I thought Kasparov was much harder on another great player,Capablanca.There is a lot of lengthy analysis in this book,as in the previous volumes,and most of it seems to be original,as opposed to many of the annotations in the first two volumes.As for possible analytical mistakes,these are to be expected in any chess book.I don't particularly care if someone's desktop computer program finds some mistake in a branch of a variation several moves down--to those who wish to pick nits like that,I'd advise them to run their anlysis engines to their heart's content.I'm more interested in Kasparov's commentary (or,again,Kasparov and company...it's not always clear if it's solely Kasparov),and I thought Kasparov did a superb job on most of these games,as he did in the Petrosian/Spassky volume.In the recent volumes,Kasparov will often conclude the section on a player with an essay on his style,or personal remembrances.These,to me,are the true strength of these books,and also a reason why the first volume is not as good as the later volumes.I would love to have Kasparov's thoughts on Lasker's style,for example,but he never really gets into it.His essay on Fischer is perceptive and accurate,in my opinion.I also very much enjoyed this book's section on Reshevsky,and I learned some things I didn't know about this great player.A complaint about all of these books is that there are occasional inexcusable historical mistakes.I didn't see any glaring mistakes in this volume,but I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few,going by the series' past history.The major criticism that can be leveled against these books is that they straddle the hardcore/casual chess fan fence,and so they are likely to disappoint many in both camps.I think these are great reads,especially the latter two books.I would advise waiting for the revised versions of the first two books."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Contrary to the other reviews that found Kasparov's writing \\"vindictive\\" towards Fischer, I thought it was very even-handed. Those critics seem to want the same blind hero-worship of Fischer that has come before.I am a great fan of Fischer's. I come from his home borough. I know people who knew him, being only a few years younger. So any criticsms in this book kind of sting me. But they are true.Let's face it. He didn't play Karpov because he was afraid to lose. Kasparov states it bluntly (as is his style), and it's about time somebody did. The fact is, Fischer would have crushed Karpov had he been active in 1972-1974, but, as Kasparov implies, one can't sit out for three years and expect to retain the championship.In fact, I found Kasparov overly generous in his book, especially considering the blistering and outrageous insults Fischer has thrown at him. I thought this was very classy. To be truthful, I didn't expect Kasparov to show such restraint, but he did. Again, I think the book is very fair towards Fischer.Chesswise, I think Kasparov has given Fischer his positive due throughout a large part of this book, acknowledging Fischer as a true pioneer of chess in the 60's. It's only fair to write the bad with the good.As far as the analysis, I am only a 2000 player, I don't delve deeply into the extreme accuracy, nor do I apply the computer to such analysis. I'll just say that the book is certainly good enough to me to learn from.Oh, I left out how extremely entertaining this book is. Any chess fan above, say, 1500 rating, should enjoy it."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"I recently received my copy of the book - and it has been like a new toy at Christmas, I can hardly put it down. The focus of this book is the one and only Bobby Fischer, many consider this player be simply the greatest chess master who ever lived. And there have not been many good books on this player recently - GM Andy Soltis's book, (\\"B.F. Rediscovered\\"); being one happy exception.This eagerly anticipated book is well crafted, a high-quality volume designed for many years of enjoyment. Every fan of either Garry or Fischer will definitely want to reserve a spot for this work on their favorite bookshelf. (And Garry has corrected earlier mistakes; this effort actually has several indexes and a bibliography.)This volume is really two books in one. The first part of this work is devoted to three players: Sammy Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bent Larsen. (Three of the greatest non-Soviet players of the last 100 years.) This part of the book looks to be excellent, I am sure that there are many, many, many hours of enjoyment to be had in this section.However, I purchased this volume for the look at Fischer - this is the part that holds my attention and fascination. Fast forward to Chapter Two on, 'Robert, the Eleventh.'This section begins with a rather startling revelation - I had heard rumors of this before, but never anything resembling actual confirmation. There is a fairly decent biography; it details Bobby's first steps with chess poignantly and accurately. The first game, (# 50); is a rather lukewarm analysis of one of Fischer's most famous games. (Vs. Donald Byrne, New York; 1956. \\"The Game of The Century.\\") {See my web page for a more complete analysis of this game.}Another thing you should understand is that I have been studying chess my whole life, I grew up with the book, \\"My Sixty Memorable Games.\\" I am intimately familiar with most of these games, many I have studied so often that they feel like old friends to me. And they are also semi-sacred to me, without a study of these great contests, I am sure I would have never become a Master myself. This is why I object to this &lt;Modern School> of annotating. (Anytime a minuscule improvement is found, this gives the writer license to decorate time-honored chess moves with undeserved question marks.) As in previous volumes, Kasparov shows a heavy, ham-handedness in his annotations. He virtually suffocates and degrades these games with all kinds of appellations to the various moves. Consider game # 52, page # 222. (Versus Larsen, 1958 - a famous Dragon. This game was beautifully annotated by Fischer himself.) For example, he gives White's 15th move a dubious mark. (?!) I think here it is more of a question of style, Fischer would almost never willingly block in his own Bishops. In fact, one wonders if Garry's own ego would ever allow him to be truly objective. He seems determined to criticize and denounce Bobby Fischer, (and his play) ... as if in an effort to cement his own place in chess history.There are other things about this book that I object to as well. After Fischer's famous contest with Panno, (Game # 80, page # 346); Garry just could not resist sticking in one of his own games. Like a little kid who craves recognition for his work - \\"See? Look what I did?\\" This is SUPPOSED to be a book about Bobby Fischer! (Lack of focus. Again!)I decided to take one game in this book, and subject every move to the microscope of the computer. (Vs. B. Spassky, 1972. # 103, page # 438) I was hoping to find zero errors, but alas this was not the case. I found mistakes that ranged from the very minor, to the more moderate type, and at least one that must go into the, \\"My Goodness!! What happened there?\\" category. (I will save the details for the next update of my web page on this very famous game.) Kasparov certainly recognizes this game's importance, just the fact that he spends like seven pages scrutinizing it is significant; as well as the 8-10 exclams that he uses to decorate the various moves in this titanic clash. IF you want a different perspective on this game, see GM Yasser Seirawan's excellent book, \\"Winning Chess Brilliancies.\\"I must also take issue with the statement made after Black's fourteenth move, 14...a6. He quotes a famous game - Timman vs. Geller, Hilversum, NED; 1973. Then he states that this game: \\"Practically speaking, put the 8.cxd5 variation out of use.\\" This is such a silly, foolish and stupid statement; I feel obligated to take Mr. Kasparov to task on this one.I have practically every reference book ever printed in English, and I have 1-2 dozen books on the Queen's Gambit Declined alone. The latest book on this opening calls 8.cxd5, {still} \\"the time-honored main line.\\" Dozens of players still use this move on a regular basis. [See the game: GM S. Mamedyarov (2657) - GM S. Lputian (2634); / FIDE WCh, KO / Tripoli, LBA; (Round 2.4), 22,06,2004.] If this line isn't being used anymore, why are these two top players ... still fooling around with it? And the real punch-line is that the column in MCO-14 on 8.cxd5, is based on the following encounter: IM Luc Winants - GM Garry Kasparov; Brussels, 1987!!!This book is definitely better - especially in terms of the quality of analysis - than many of the previous efforts, but it is far from perfect. The editorial/product description calls this book: \\"a must for all serious chess players.\\" (I would definitely not go that far!) However, it is fair to say that this is a serious chess book, any player who is serious about improving his game or is interested in the history of chess - would benefit from a close study of the historic chess battles in this volume. But it falls far short of Garry's previous work in books like, \\"The Test of Time.\\" (Recommended.)"},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"The book is indeed a classic, no doubt. And, as you will read from some of the other comments here, Kasparov's analysis and game review is outstanding, with very few blemishes (caught by other reviewers on here so no need to rehash them). Overall this is a GREAT BOOK, worthy of placement in anybody's collection. But, as the competitive chess world is also a gauntlet of political machinery, to get \\"to the top\\" you have to appease the \\"powers that be.\\" Some of the politics associated with other players was painted with rosey paint, others, a bit too hard, layered too thick. Every author has their own viewpoint and perspective, including Kasparov. Perhaps it was some of these comments that caused Fischer to recently challenge the current FIDE World Chess Champion, Topalov, to a match. And, as reported online at [...] maybe we will soon see Kasparov and Fischer play a match after all!"},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Garry Kasparov put an enormous work on this volume with some high-class analysis. I guess I am not the only one that went directly to the Fischer-chapter! It becomes clear that Kasparov admires Fischer but by reasons of his own vanity he shows a rather critical approach. This is especially more obvious when compared with the volume on Karpov. Karpov is presented as an incredible genius and Kasparov suggests that he could have beaten Fischer. Whether this is so, can be doubted but we shall never know. Subconciously Kasparov sees himself as the truely biggest genius of them all, since he managed to beat Karpov!Kasparovs opinion that Fischer plays uncertain in unclear positions and has a rather poor intuition can be questioned. Perfect play doesn't exist and there are many examples of Fischer playing brilliantly in unclear positions. Apparently Kasparov is influenced very much by the old soviet anti-Fischer attitude. It looks as if Kasparov is looking for points to criticize Fischer, what he doesn't do with Karpov.Kasparovs comments on Fischer personal life are interesting but rather one-sided. It is true that Fischer had a very difficult childhood but it is also true that the soviet chess players - during the Cold War! - did everything in their powers to destabilize Fischer. Fischer was an easy target: he was alone, preoccupied with chess and limited defense mechanisms. To compete adult grandmasters who represent communist views on life, must gave added to Fischer paranoic tendencies. In this sence, it is surprising that Kasparov defend Fischer fight for better playing conditions but doesn't defend him at the end of the Reshevsky match. Here the young Fischer was confronted with a different playing schedule because the sponsor wanted to visit her husband's concert, Fischer lost and was condemmed by everyone while his behaviour is quite understandable. It would have been good if Kasparov would have defended Fischer on this occasion. How would he have reacted himself when this would have happened to him? He hardly pays any attention to Fischers behaviour towards the other chess players, which was highly appreciated by his colleagues.Also Kasparovs statement that Fischer won in 1971-1972 because his opponents collapsed psychologically, can be doubted. He suggests that Fischer would not have been succesfull if his opponents would have stayed stable. This is an underestimation of Fischers power. Fischer devoted himself completely to playing chess, knew how to play against different opponents and put all his energy in to it. In this sence Kasparov is right. Maybe the truth is simpler: Confronted with such a powerful opponent and a few losses, Fischers opponents lost their self confidence. Well, of course... He tried to win, but so did his opponents, who were excellently prepared by the Soviet chess school themselves. It seems to me that Kasparovs attitude towards Fischer is infuened by the fact that Kasparov, brilliant as he was himself, never was able to achieve the superiority that Fischer achieved in his top years. When you read the book with this in mind, you will have a wonderful time with this interesting book that I myself enjoy very much too! (and my apologies to Reshevsky, Najdorf and Larsen.. I didn't study them yet...)"},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Kasparov is unduly critical at times, looking through the lens of over 30 years of hindsight and assisted by computer analysis.Some of the variations he gives to justify his \\"corrections\\" of previously published assessments go to 15+ moves, with many subvariations, more than most mortals could possibly calculate at the board with the clock ticking.I did enjoy his looking at the openings used at the time through the eyes of modern theory, often describing how and when a line evolved- better than scanning the columns in MCO.He is best when he notes the psychological and competitive ideas that lead a player to choose one opening, or move, over another. The exception is the suggestion that some world class players felt \\"doom\\", by the 1970's, when matched against Robert the 11th. Fischer was just that much better!He does a great job of describing the scenarios surrounding each game, and he offers paragraphs of prose to accompany his deep analysis.What most impressed me is how well he shows that Fischer's utter relentlessness, not just his famous \\"play for a win every time\\" approach, but also his staying in a \\"drawn\\" game for 80 moves, and playing into positions with only a theoretically slight plus, but then posing a series problems for his opponents to solve, often just wore his"},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Several biases mar this book.1. Kasparov as the best ever.Seeking to be known as the best player ever, Kasparov periodically tries to knock Fischer. Fischer dominated world champion Petrosian, the same player who best Kasparov, and established a good record against Karpov. Fischer's superior record shows he would likely have defeated Karpov probably by a good margin.2. Fischer's criticism of KasparovPart of this may be retaliatory as Fischer made some crazy comments about the Karpov/ Kasparov match.3. Failure to Understand CuracaoThe 4 Russian players reached an agreement to fix the games between them as draws. Kasparov says it doesn't matter but fails to understand the practical consequences of the collusion, at least the perception of it. Assume Fischer is behind 1 point with 2 rounds to go. Is the Russian going to lose, in the midst of the Cold War. Wouldn't the collusion agreement require the Russian not in contention to lose to the one who was. Equally importantly, Fischer believed it, and he felt he had to be leading by a substantial margin to get a championship, and took unreasonable risks early on.4. Fischer's irrational behavior as a product of fearFischer undoubtedly had a tortured personality, but Kasparov makes some strange suppositions. Fischer was scared of Karpov that's why he didn't play. Fischer was scared to play at Palma De Majorca, and his narrow 3 1/2 victory, the largest ever in an Interzonal shows his feat. Obviously delays in the Spassky match did not indicate any realistic fear.5. Botvinnik and FischerHe misses some obvious observations. Fischer was really a follower of the Botvinnik theory, with his detailed analysis of every position eschewing general suppositions, careful analysis of his own games.6. Nitpicking and Failure to Note the Significance of Fischer/ Spassky MatchWhile compliments and respect follow some parts of the book, too often he tries to minimize Fischer's accomplishments. He fails to adequately convey the importance of the Fischer Spassky match. It was not just a chess match, but world news.Beyond the skills as a chess-player, my 60 Memorable Games was a great book.I like the other 3 books, but economium for Euwe and Reshevsky and criticism of Fischer, simply does not present an impartial assessment.In short, read the analysis, but get one of the other books on Fischer."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Fantastically detailed chess analysis. Personal opinions, outlook, including first-party, second-party, and third-party conversations of the historical matches and tournaments from the time period of 1920s to 1980s, from Samuel Reshevsky to Bobby Fischer so to speak. Any chess player interested in being spoon fed by arguably the greatest chess player ever, Gary Kasparov, an understanding of \\"style of play\\" differences and personalities of Sammy Reshevsky, Miguel Najorf, Bent Larson, and Bobby Fischer will totally enjoy."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Without doubt, Fischer in the period 1970 -1972 was the strongest players in the history of Chess. Only Lasker before world war 2 can be compared with him. Another player of equal strength comes later, it is Kasparov. Though Kasparov in this book sometimes deliberately critized Fischer's play, but paraodixically he himself is actually a Fischer re-incarnate!!Look at his games after 1990, does not his play was the same asFischer before!! In responding to 1e4, he meets with Najdorf Sicilian, with 1d4, with King's Indian or Grunfeld, Benoni etc.Of course, he is right, Fischer after becoming Champion, he himself did not want to play chess anymore, as he himself could not face any defeat. So he just passed his Champion to Karpov.I totally agreed with G.Kasparov that it was not a Champion's behaviour. But I would totally disagree that Fischer would lose to Karpov if he was actively playing chess in the period from 1972 to 1974. I also disagree with G.K. that Fischer was not good in dealing with complicated situation. Just one example would be enough. The first game with Larsen in the semi-finalwould show that Fischer was excelled in complicated position.With detailed calculation, one could not accept Larsen's exchange of one B and N for a rook. And just when Larsen threaten to mate and Fischer's Queen was caught by Larsen's Rook, the 28 move BC5 must be calculated long before hand. I also disagree with G. K. that the move 21 Bf3 was bad. As manyanalysis showed that this was the best moves. All the subsequent analysis showed that this was the best move!! Just looked at Timman's analysis!! All in all, all the 5 books on the Predecessors are good, as G.K. gave a good history of the Chess.One just enjoyed the history, but neglected Kasparov's own comments which sometimes not impartial."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"I feel that Kasparov's first and second books in the series were better. It is nice in one way that Kasparov only put Fischer in this book as his earlier books had more players. I feel Fischer deserves extra recognition.I felt that Part 4 on Fischer was not quite as well organized as the first two books (I do not own the third one) and Kasparov makes the analysis a bit more difficult to follow for a lower rated player than before.I agree with all of the other reviewers that Kasparov does try and make Fischer look bad. It is both a good and bad point."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Plain & simple, Kasparov has super computers doing all the work on finding Fischer mistakes in this book. Computers are the steroids of chess. Todays players cannot be judged equally because of this. Fischer, and prior chess masters, had only their minds and that is why they will continue to be known as the greatest natural players of all time."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"The famed Russian chessmaster analyzes chess games of the legendary American Bobby Fisher against some of his strongest opponents during the years Fisher was recognized as the world's top chess player. In furnishing much material besides just a simple record of moves and occasional comments, Kasparov also presents lengthy discussions of the ups and downs of the competition during the tournaments and individual matches. The exceptional book on chess goes even beyond this to give a broad picture of the chess world of the time and the play of the noted chessmasters Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bert Larsen. An invaluable book for serious chess players, while also of interest to ones attracted to the excitement and personalities of major chess tournaments; which in recent years have started to receive some media coverage."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Kasparov is very bias with his assessments.

I liked volume 1 the best."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"A large supposition of Kasparov is that Fischer was \\"afraid\\" of Spassky, hence his argumentative and demanding behavior prior to the match. He was not afraid of any Russian. He, like many who strive for perfection, was afraid of his own shortcomings and possible failure. The fact that he not only overcame his inner trepidation to beat Spassky but that he did so with the roots of a severe mental illness present, clearly demonstrates without question that he was--The Greatest Champion. He not only overcame the Russians but also himself. He would have destroyed Karpov."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"In my opinion Fischer was not measured with the same tape that Kasparov used for his other predescesors. I read the previous tomes that were generous in compliments and compassion for the previous world champions. For instance, Alekhine's allegued Nazi views were just touched upon with an apologetical point of view (those were the times during war...) Kasparov favoritism for Soviet chess players is also flagrant and makes a great effort to make Spassky look great when, of all former world champions, he was a swindler (and a great one.) that earned his Botvinnik used the Soviet apparatus to promote his chess career and he didn't show great superiority over Bronstein whose father was declared \\"enemy of the state\\" (can anyone play knowing that there might be a retaliation against your family should you decide to steal the world chess championship?) All in all, there is no balance in Kasparov's book and one can sense his animosity against Fischer in his writings. Sure enough, previous world champions have shortcomings and great things but all of them should have been measured with the same measure of equanimity. And, of course, computers will be able to detect flaws in games from the past but that doesn't demerit the greatness of former world champions. I can only hope that Kasparov doesn't apply the same hateful attitude towards Karpov and be more balanced in his views.Is the book worth owning? Yes it is.

IT IS A BOOK WORTH BUYING.I gave it a three star because of Kasparov views and because this book should be noted thats its not foranyone Under Class A Strength.Kasparov gets deep into the analysis and it gets pretty complicated, if you dont know your basic understanding on positional chess.."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"The book breaks down tons of games by Fischer--which is most of the book. Kasparov's views on Fischer are very guarded and extremely limited--mostly to his playing style and on the surface he suggests that Fischer would have not faired as greatly if he had continued to play competitively. Big deal--what else would anyone expect from one regarded as the greatest ever? What would you expect Tiger to say about Jones or Nicklaus? What I did not enjoy about the book are the extensive--and I mean huge--quotes inserted by Kasparov from other players and historians of the game to defend his views or elaborate on other points. Sometimes I forgot who was writing the book. Aside from this, it is an otherwise invaluable book as Kasparov is uniquely qualified to analyze many of the games and his insights are often as brilliant as his play. From a personal point of view, I would have liked Kasparov to have written about how Spassky should have handled the emotional and mental dominance of Fischer in preparation for matches. Spassky is such a pushover--he bent over backwards to Fischer in '72 and again in '92--the lighting, the cameras, the rooms, the atmosphere, the crowds, the noise--he almost treated him like his Master. I doubt Fischer would have gotten that kind of treatment from Karpov, but especially Kasparov. Fischer knew that and ran and hid. For this mostly all these Fischer fanatics--sadly including anti-semites--defend Fischer like some kind of God."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"This is a fine book. The analysis befits a champion and the surveys of Fischer and others are well-written. I can't disagree the Kasparov has a little attitude and an unwritten agenda is to suggest that if the two played Kasparov would be the victor. But that only makes the book better as Kasparov searches prior analyses by Fischer to make corrections and additions. Anyone below 2,500 who says the analysis is flawed is simply using a computer. The analysis can be demanding and occasionally a point is not completely explained. Nonetheless a fine book."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"Well Kasparov was world champion when he finally defeated Karpov after 130 games; but he never met Fischer on the board (neither did Karpov) which puts a stain on his record; the book is not so much written about Bobby than about the fact that whatever might be said the best player ever is Garry; I do not believe this to be accurate; since the book was published, Bobby passed away; know this: Garry called him something like \\"the great knight of chess\\" because he obviously thought himself to be the king; let say it: Bobby was the greatest player ever although he was also a madman: chess usually drives crazy his greatest advocates (see Rubinstein, Morphy, Von Bardeleben and Steinitz...); he learned chess by himself; he loved it beyond measure; he knew more about it than any other player: he beat Euwe, nearly beat Botwinnik who was saved by an armada of Russian grandmasters, he beat Tal, Spasski and petrossian, so he beat them all without help or computer; all Kasparov strives to do is to show flaws in Fischer greatest games; so what, chess is a game between human players (or it used to be); when Kasparov tried to meet the computer he was destroyed in a silly Caro-Kan variation, almost as silly as Kramnik's blundering into a mate in one against another silicon chip; Garry should have paid utter respect to Bobby who alone took the chess crown from the Russians because his hectic fight against Karpov should have made him understand what an achievement Bobby's victory in Reykjavik was; instead, he only endeavours to protect himself; this is pathetic.Read \\"Russians against Fischer\\" which really shows what Fischer was up against.P.S. It must nevertheless be said that Garry is an incredible player which I rate number two behind Bobby: in 1984, he was clearly weaker than Karpov and was crushed during the 30 first games of their first encounter (five to nil...); he then went on to delay the end until the 48th game...and from there he truly showed the extent of his wonderful talent but he was never alone as Bobby was...P.P.S It must be said too, that the notion of \\"the best chess player ever\\" does not exist; Fischer was obviously the strongest player in the world between 1970 and 1972; and Spasski was the strongest between 1966 and 1969 (see Santa Monica 1966...); Tal was proeminent between 1958 ans 1960 and so on; Capablanca was the strongest player between 1920 and 1925; how can Fischer and Capablanca be compared since they never met at the chess board; during his best period Tal destroyed a young Fischer 4 to nil; what does it prove?; in 61, Fischer finally beat Tal for the fist time but Misha Tal won a great tournament there, Fischer being only second to him; their last encounters were set at Curaao and Tal was too ill to put up a good fight; so chess strengh comes and goes; in between, we may identify peaks of form, strings of victory and bouts of defeat; again tal is a wonderful example of such chess moods since he had others peaks around 1965, 1972 and 1979; Spasski played in the candidates tournament in 1956 at Amsterdam and then crossed a barren area for 8 years ending it at Amsterdam 1964; during the years from 1984 to 1989 Kasparov and Karpov met so many times at the chess board that we can have a fair idea of their relative strengths: Kasparov won their matches by repeated low but sufficient margins; Karpov won 1 match, Kasparov 2 and they tied 1; from 1980 to 1993 they played 162 games (!!!) and drew 112 while Kasparov won 26 of them and Karpov 20; so Kasparov seems to be very slightly stronger than Karpov but when they had to face each other at the board, no one could fancy the result of their encounter, because they were so evenly matched. Moreover, one must point out the notorious problem of \\"the difficult opponent\\"; for example, Kortchnoy has a good record against Tal who had a good record against Portisch who had a good record against Kortchnoy... Let's take another example, Tal had a poor record against US player Seirawan (4 losses without any victory ans a few draws...); can we deduce from that the fact that Seirawan was stronger thah Tal? Seirawan was 20 when he met Tal for the first time in 1980 and Tal already an old and crippled man, although still a very strong player with amazing results throughout 1979 ; moreover 1980 was one of his worst ever chess years together with 1969...; at 22 Tal was already twice URSS champion (won this one 6 times) and winner of the Portoroz interzonal tournament (he won 3 of those) en route towards winning the candidate tournament with an incredible score culminating with snatching the chess crown from Botwinnik , feats that Seirawan only dreamed to achieve... In 1980 Tal lost with black from a superior position and thereafter lost 3 more times with black; so Seirawan was a difficult opponent to him from a psychological point of view; question: would Seirawan have achieved such a result against the \\"young Tal\\"?EPILOGUE: Kasparov and Fischer never met across the board but Kasparov at 17 experienced big difficulties against both Spasski and Petrossian around 1980; if Fischer had been an active player at that time, we can imagine that he would still be stronger than his older opponents from the sixties and therefore stronger than Kasparov; again, all Kasparov did achieve against the old Tal was a lonely win in 1986; what kind of game those two would have created if they could have been 20 at the same time?

The part on Reshevsky, Fine (Yes, Reuben is also there!), Najdorf and Larsen respect those, who never broke through the Soviet wall, although from time to time caused it some damages. In volumes 2 and 3, Kasparov actually answered the question, why such individuals hadn't got the slightest chance to compete the Soviet machine, who worked as a team. Imagine yourself Botvinik, who needed the best players such as Tal, Geller and Keres, to save his skin and to draw against the 19 yrs. old Fischer! TO tear the wall down you had to be: 1. genius 2. Addicted 3. Disturbed. Fischer was everything of the 3, and the book demonstrates it well, but in too many words. The chapter on Fischer is full of analysis but not on chess games but psychology. Most of it is speculative, and illustrated by many \\"if's\\". This semi-psaudo-psychogical analysis had to be limited, but Kasparov wasted a lot of pages on it. More than 30 years later, we know that Fischer has a poor-disturbed personality. It is also clear, that he actually didn't stop the Soviet machine, who created new generation of great players such as Karpov and later Kasparov, while Bobby was buisy competing with the old declining generation. So, we can agree with many of Kasparov speculations, but not with the way he represents them! Instead of the gossip, he could bring some more games, especially from the 92' match with Spassky (only the first game is in the book)."},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","review":"This a excellent book, one of my favorites.

Black-and-white plates are reserved for drawings (graphite, ink, charcoal), prints, and a few sculptures. All of these are well-suited to reproduction in black and white (although there is also a 43-page appendix, \\"a pictorial survey of modern painting\\", featuring 6-8 black-and-white illustrations per page). \\"A Concise History of Modern Painting\\" discusses artists who work within styles the author describes as specifically modern (as distinguished from earlier periods). It focuses on ideas, works and movements. All illustrations are chosen within that context. (Realistic artists are not represented.)The book includes text references, a bibliography, a list of works reproduced, and an index. It's a 6\\"x8\\" paperback edition, about an inch thick--a good size for packing. The binding is glued, not sewn, but it seems durable, and I think it will last. I carry mine on trips, though I haven't had it long enough to see how well it wears. I discovered the \\"World of Art\\" series while travelling and bought several titles. They're the best art books at this price I've ever found."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Modern Painting","review":"Herbert Read produced a remarkable volume , which enables the artist, the student , or the neophyte to understand the articulation and crossroads of modern painting , trough the motions of Modern Art.

Expecting a long siege the commander of the armed forces in the area (British I think, the book never really says) orders the evacuation of all nonessential personnel to Alexandria. This task is assigned to one Captain Anson and his friend and subordinate Tom Pugh. The Captain is also given the task of returning two nurses to Alexandria that were caught in the crossfire on another part of the battle field and separated from their unit.Due to the urgency of the evacuation, and having to wait for the nurses to arrive, the captain is forced to try and catch up with the convoy. He is given a red cross ambulance, named \\"Katy\\", in the hopes that he will be left alone by hostile forces if they think that the group are doctors that are treating the wounded on the battle field. The plan almost works perfectly except for the fact that the Germans advance much more quickly than expected. Soon afterward Captain Anson finds his superior officer killed in a surprise attack, the bridge he needed to get to Alexandria blown to stop the enemy advance, and he still has two nurses that he still needs to get to safety.To get them to safety he will have to deal with a savage desert, a solider that is not what he seems to be and the ever tightening noose of the invading army. The only question that remains is whether the desert is more deadly than the people traveling through it...----------I found this to be a pretty good read. The plot moves at a pretty good pace and generally makes sense. There is plenty of action in this book as the party moves from one crisis to the next. The characters are also pretty well developed with Captain Anson, Tom Pugh, and Zimmerman being pretty well explained as far as why they do what they do. Unfortunately the two nurses are not really given much \\"screen\\" time and are generally treated as if they are helpless. Most likely this is a result of when the book was written, but it can be a bit jarring if you are used to reading more modern stories. All in all I found this to be a good story with a interesting setting and interesting characters. This is also one of those books that does not rely heavily on sex and violence to carry the story. I would recommend this to anyone who likes WWII stories and adventure / action stories in general. m.a.c"},{"Title":"Making Friends: Training Your Dog Positively","review":"Of all the dog training books I have ever read-- this one is my favorite--it's the book I recommend most to anyone who is getting a new dog-- It is extremely well written with excellent advice, easy to follow training methods- In her book she not only teaches owners how to train their dog -- but how to understand how your dog thinks and learns, and why dogs do the things they do. I followed her instructions for teaching my puppy to sit, stay, and also house training and it made training my puppy easy and fun for the both of us. On top of all that- the book is full of entertaining stories about people and their dogs (so its fun reading her book). I can't say enough good things about her book. Anyone who has a dog should read it! (by the way: another person on this site wrote a review of linda's book and said it had typical advice about choke train methods- who ever wrote that must be confusing Making Friends with another book- because Linda Colflesh's book argues against choke chain methods of training- so someone should take that review off the site- the person who wrote it didnt read the book."},{"Title":"Making Friends: Training Your Dog Positively","review":"This seems in general a very sensibly written dog training book. The commands given are pretty standard, and the instructions are clear and logical. My only real gripe is that the title implies positive training, which this is not. This book teaches very traditional training, with leash corrections and other such, not the positive training method espoused by Karen Pryor (Don't Shoot the Dog). The author does place a welcome emphasis on not punishing your dog for what he doesn't yet understand, and on praising and rewarding good behavior, but positive training is a method, not an attitude. Adding more praise to traditional training gives you a kinder gentler traditional training, not positive training.That said, if you're more comfortable with traditional methods than with click and treat, this is a good book to work from."},{"Title":"Making Friends: Training Your Dog Positively","review":"This book is an excellent one for new and inexperienced trainersas well as a good review for those with experience in old trainingtechniques.

If your idea of \\"a science-fiction book\\" is lots of exploding spaceships, you're definitely in the wrong book here. A reader looking for the sorts of spaceship books (OK, not all exploding) that are Aldiss's more usual fare will react much like someone taking a swig of that they expect to be soda and finding it to be a vintage brut champagne: he or she will spit it out in disgust.\\"Brut\\"--very dry--is in fact a good reference here. The tale slowly, with meticulous care, builds a haunting image of a world that, as Aldiss patiently limns it, we shift from seeing as our own to perceiving as some dreamlike, perhaps nightmare, variant of it. The shadowy, almost motiveless, slow-motion activities of the characters seem more and more opaque as events unfold.That is not empty or pointless: the developing claustrophobic atmosphere reflects our own world in a distorted, but specifically distorted, way--it gives us to think of how and why our own world and lives differ from the empty gestures of the characters here--or, indeed, if at bottom they truly do. Are our own acts so deeply meaningful and rational as we like to think?The book, having given us that strange, dark mirror, then goes off in new directions, about which one cannot say much without spoiling some of the effect.All in all, this is not a summertime beach read, but if you bring to it patience and a willingness to go with the flow and ponder as you go, you can come away with some rewards."},{"Title":"Report on probability A (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"I'm confused why someone would give such a positive review with such a mediocre rating. As for 1 star, I don't know what to say.Aldiss is one of the 60's group of British 'New Wave' authors along with J.G. Ballard (editor) Mike Moorcock and other luminaries. In my experience fans of 'hard' SF (which I equate with guys in rocket ships held together with rivets getting hijacked by Pirates on Neptune) find anything vaguely philosophically, psychologically or socially relevant to be an artsy abomination.Warning: this is a difficult book. However, it is also short. Though you will feel like you've just been through The Ring Cycle.This story is about reletavism, reality and the perception thereof. The three major protagonists live in outbuildings near the rural house of a certain woman. Each is obsessed with her, and with each other. They observe her in meticulous, brain-tremblingly repetitious and obsessive detail. At the same time they are being observed by third parties who are themselves being observed by aliens and so on.I can't explain this book, which is partly why I admire it so much. It is horribly tedious, but that tediousness is the whole point of it. It becomes hypnotic, then extraordinary. I am a huge SF fan, and easily rate this in my top 10 SF novels of all time, along with (e.g.) 'A Canticle for Leibowitz', 'Rendevous with Rama', 'Ubik', 'Return From the Stars' or 'The Crystal World', just to give you an idea of my catholicism.It's a love it or hate it book, but it blew me away.Tim"},{"Title":"Report on probability A (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"I'm astonished that this book was re-printed in 2001. It was originally published in 1968 as some sort of weird avant-garde experiment.Plot summary: Nothing happens. It is described in mind-numbingly tedious detail. You keep expecting something to happen, but here's the twist: nothing ever does.Ha ha! Isn't that a great twist?As you read you think to yourself, \\"Surely if I can get just a tiny bit further in the book, something will eventually happen. And that will make it all worth it.\\" But nothing does. Eventually you start hating yourself for reading it and wondering why they even bothered. It sounds harsh but I'm really not joking.

But female residents have several extra obstacles in their way. Most female doctors are in fields like gynecology or psychiatry. Those who want to become surgeons are encouraged to choose another specialty, because surgery is \\"too hard.\\" Any patient complication will be looked at especially closely. Role models are rare; the number of female surgeons is tiny, while the number of black female surgeons is practically zero.Since surgery is very much a male-dominated field, there is the usual obstacle of women having to work twice as hard to be considered half as good. Residency does not teach a person how to keep their humanity (which some surgeons have totally lost); what to say to a family whose loved one has just been declared dead (suppressing their femininity).This book looks at the personal experiences of several black female surgeons. Their residency experiences, whether at predominantly white or black institutions, ranged from difficult to very difficult.Even though this is a doctoral dissertation, it is clearly written, easy to read, and worth reading.

The story is made memorable (and frequently hilarious) by John Gregory Dunne's chuckle-a-page expositions of Irish Catholic foibles. Lt. Tom Spellacy of the LAPD, a semi-corrupt but competent detective, jousts with his partner, his superiors in the department, and his brother, the Rt. Rev. Msr. Desmond Spellacy, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Dunne is to Irish Catholics as Philip Roth is to Eastern European Jews, and &quot;True Confessions&quot; is Dunne's &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot;--a must-read."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"Several previous reviewers have mentioned that they regularly go back and reread this book, and I count myself among them. \\"True Confessions\\" is in fact a triumph and John Gregory Dunne's best work. When it is said that a good novel by a \\"genre\\" writer \\"transcends the genre,\\" it usually means that the author has written a novel good enough to be judged apart from that genre. In \\"True Confessions,\\" John Gregory Dunne writes a book that achieves the status of literature while deliberately staying within the conventions of the detective novel, a much more difficult task indeed.The plot of \\"True Confessions,\\" as one previous reviewer noted, is really a MacGuffin for an exploration of the author's more serious concerns. The story revolves around a fictional version of the real-life murder of a woman in the 1940s in Los Angeles, the \\"Black Dahlia\\" case. Detective Tom Spellacy catches the case, which through sensational newspaper stories catches the popular imagination, and with it the pressure to solve the case.Tom sees himself as a failure, a one-time boxer with a glass jaw, now an LAPD detective trapped in a loveless marriage with a wife slowly losing her mind, a kid who never met a candy bar she didn't like, and a guilty conscience not entirely undeserved. His brother Monsignor Desmond \\"Des\\" Spellacy, by contrast, is bright, likeable, and ambitious, pious and practical at the same time. He is the handsome war veteran, the \\"Parachuting Padre,\\" who has set his sights on a Bishop's miter and perhaps a Cardinal's hat. He is charismatic and careful, as he makes his way through the duties of life as a professional Catholic. He woos the faithful on his weekly radio show, and works the owners of auto dealerships and mortuaries on the golf course to increase the building fund of the Archdiocese. He knows that all men sin, and though his conscience is sometimes troubled, he is not above selling indulgences to achieve the greater good.These very different brothers, who spend their occasional time together shadow-boxing about sin and absolution, corruption and salvation, come into collision with one another as Tom's investigation of the underlying murder increasingly involves Des. Before the story is over, both will make choices of immense consequence for themselves and each other.Tom's partner is a hard-boiled, wisecracking cop who eats off the cuff at his favorite \\"cheap Chinese\\" restaurant, and gets his suits from movie studios after every Sydney Greenstreet movie finishes shooting. He is Tom's, and the reader's, Falstaff, confronting us with his queasy morals, inconvenient truths, and asides about life and the job that make the reader laugh in spite of himself. Dunne also takes a hard, and sometimes hilarious look at the Catholic Church after the war. It is run as a modern American corporation, selling rosaries and salvation as if they were Chevrolets.The great achievement of \\"True Confessions\\" is that Dunne deliberately chooses such a seemingly confining \\"ring,\\" the pulp genre of detective fiction, within which to present the spiritual and temporal fights which engage the two main characters. He uses every convention of hard-boiled Chandler-esque postwar L.A. detective novels, every stereotype of Irish-American cops, priests, and politicians, and turns them all on their heads to present a tough, unsentimental view about what the country looked like as \\"The American Century\\" entered its second half.In \\"True Confessions,\\" Dunne manages to sort out facts from fiction, the real from the romanticized, true human conflicts for which there may be no resolution from the satisfying but empty trickery of the last chapter of a whodunit. With a seemingly dead-on and often wickedly funny portrayal of the voices, thoughts, prejudices, shortcuts taken and deals made, by real people in real life, he tells a story of power, ambition, mendacity, failure, occasional tenderness, and maybe even redemption. He turns the stew of pulp fiction into a true cassoulet for his readers.Strong language, strong everything. This is an adult novel in the best and most serious sense of the word. A \\"Father Brown\\" mystery it ain't."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"This is a deeply thoughtful novel that is also terrifically funny.

This one is a \\"must read\\" for both mystery lovers and those who enjoy a smile when they read!"},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"I love this book. I have read it many times and still continue to read it. Why?I love the protagonist, a cynical, hard-boiled Irish cop who picks up on every defect of everyone he meets and offers up a wisecrack that makes you laugh out loud. If he can substitute a street word for any noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, or conjunction, he does--but in such a precise context and rhythm that it makes sheer poetry.This book is not for the squeamish--he uses four-letter words, racial slurs, racial epithets. He includes people of his own Irish-Catholic background. As a matter of fact, they are often the focus of his caustic observations. I love every minute of it. I eat it up. Like I said, it's sheer, stimulating poetry--it's like a whiff of salt breeze or the sting of salt water on an open wound; it's like a very dry martini.Then there's the fact that Dunne has created a noir novel that is exactly like film noir. It envelops you like an L.A. fog and never really dissolves. L.A. in the 1940s was the perfect setting for noir--as Roman Polanski proved in his great film CHINATOWN. Like all great writing, Dunne produces this aura as if by magic.So if you've ever ridden in a squad car, dressed in a silent-movie vamp costume, on a Halloween night in the city, because you've lost your way and the cops are trying to keep you out of harm's way, but they can't resist turning the red light on and blowing the siren, and taking you along on a few calls on the way home just to show off; if you've ever hitchhiked on the Jersey Turnpike and been picked up by a cop, and ended up havin g a conversation about all the important things until day breaks and he brings you to a truck stop; if you have a soft spot for cops; if you don't mind bad language; if you like mysteries; if you have a sense of humor; if you love noir, you might give this book a try. I think it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"True Confessions is so well written that you may not realize that the apparent lack of style IS the style. No flowery prose, not a wasted word. Expert craftsmanship.Other reviewers have described the book as a mystery story. No such thing. The mystery is a MacGuffin, and the plot itself is just a device to, first, gradually reveal to us the characters, and, then, subject each of them to self-revelation and growth.Although there is much irony and many clever bon mots in the story, its overall tone is bleak. I give it only four stars because its lack of sunlight mars our acceptance of it as reality. The film, on the other hand - an excellent adaptation - contains perhaps too much sunlight.Summary: a great read, but don't hang your interest on its being a detective story."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"dunne writes well in this page turner about the cross currents among the movers and shakers in los angeles. cops, priests, businessmen and murder are all blended together in this excellent read.much better than the movie."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"I have never seen \\"True Confessions\\" the movie, and I never had really thought about Mr. Dunne until reading Joan Didion's \\"The Year of Magical Thinking\\" about his decline and death. He seemed like perhaps the more interesting of the two, and worth a trial.At first I thought, uh-oh, another book with an Irish-Catholic family with a cop and a priest as brothers. And, my, the language is certainly not for someone easily offended by vulgarity. As an example, the n-word and many other ethnic and racial terms appear frequently. You can get away with that in a book set in the post-war 1940s, I guess.After putting those aside, I really warmed to the story. Mr. Dunne wrote so clearly and with deceptive descriptive power. The murder mystery part of the plot hardly matters to the novel's drive, as the focus is more on the brothers and their relationship to their respective worlds, and secondarily to each other.Tom is more of a regular cop, sometimes effective and sometimes not, hampered by a frankness, cynicism, and unwillingness to play the games, such that his career and personal life are nothing much. Des is a rising star or near-star in the church, using some of those same skills that his brother as, only with much more effectiveness and attention to his superiors. His true talent is as a \\"getting things done\\" guy, on path to be a bishop, and not for his holiness. One can't help but wonder what he's really doing as a priest.Mr. Dunne does not paint a respectful picture of the LAPD, but that's nothing new for crime or detective stories set in LA. Many authors are doing the same theme today, 30 years later, and not necessarily with any better writing. What is more disturbing for potential readers is the image of the Catholic Church, concentrating more on fund raising, building projects, and its own prideful objectives than in the holiness of its leaders and members. Des's \\"getting things done\\" skills are often applied to making deals and dispensing favors in return for \\"donations\\" or other benefits.And don't forget to look the other way when it's inconvenient not to. Ultimately, the deal making leads to the downfall of Des through guilt by association, if not worse. The story is not one of redemption, because it's not clear that the main characters ever really regret what happens or some of their major decisions. This seems to be just the way it is and you may get it in the end or you may not. I'm not sure there is a truly appealing character in the entire cast. Is that Mr. Dunne's view of human nature or merely a particular theme in this novel?"},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"The Spellacy Brothers: Tom, a copy and Des, a priest, find their lives and pasts entertwining amid the investigation of a grisly murder of &quot;The Virgin Tramp.&quot; This book, based, in part on the infamous, never-solved, Black Dahlia murder in 1947 L.A., explores the byzantine and corrupt world of both the L.A. Police force and the Catholic church hierarchy.An outstanding mystery story, period piece and a true joy for anyone who knows and loves L.A.

A superb novel."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"It's postwar El Lay in the 1940s, and the body of a wannabe actress and working girl is dumped into a vacant lot after she's been savagely mutilated and cut into pieces. A racist cop/ex-palooka investigates the sensational murder while wrestling with his own twisted hangups. Sound familiar? But \\"True Confessions\\" actually predates \\"The Black Dahlia,\\" and, according to George Pelecanos' introduction, James Ellroy freely acknowledges his debt to John Gregory Dunne and this novel. The books complement each other. Where Ellroy goes widescale, Dunne looks inward and adds a layer of Irish Catholic guilt. Homicide dick Tom Spellacy's case runs parallel to shady dealings in the Church, where his brother, Desmond, a pragmatic priest, climbs the ranks with more aptitude toward the political than the spiritual. The murder is almost incidental to Dunne's study of the relationship between these two brothers and uneasy rivals. \\"True Confessions\\" is less interested in the heinous act of one psychopath than in the everyday venalities men commit to get by and the way those little sins accumulate and pile up into larger corruptions."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"The real-life Black Dahlia murder has been the basis for thousands of pages of speculation, and the inspiration for several novels, including this one. The book opens with a section called \\"Now\\" (roughly 1975), in which we meet the two protagonists, Irish-Catholic brothers Tommy and Des Spellacy, as the former drives to a rundown church in the California desert to meet the latter. It becomes clear that Des used to be a bigwig in the Los Angeles Archdiocese before something happened 28 years ago to cast him into this humble exile. The bulk of the story then returns to the postwar Los Angeles of 1947 and the severed corpse of a young woman that is the catalyst for what happens to the two brothers.Tommy is homicide detective who catches this gruesome case, and although the book is at least partially a police procedural that follows him as him slowly works the murder, Dunne is really just using genre as an outfit to dress up an almost classical story of brotherly resentment, sin, and the limitations of redemption. It really speaks to his abilities as a writer that he's able to pull off a stylish period crime story, complete with rat-a-tat slang, while simultaneously creating two compelling character portraits of self-aware and self-loathing men. As Tommy has to grapple with his superior's ambitions to become the next police chief, so too must Des navigate the exceedingly treacherous waters of Catholic church politics and the practicalities of getting things done. Both brothers are keen-eyed observers of the weaknesses of others, and don't hesitate to use that knowledge in the service of their own agendas.It's all very compelling -- however it's hard not to read the book and not be constantly reminded of the filmChinatown, which appeared just a few years prior to this book. Set in Los Angeles about a decade before this story, it also paints a very unsentimental and bleak look at the corruption that lies beneath even the most respected of the city's institutions and people. I can't believe that film wasn't a huge influence on this book, just as I can't believe this book wasn't a huge influence on James Ellroy's LA books likeThe Black DahliaandL.A. Confidential. Which is not to diminish any of these works, but simply to note how great art can inspire other great art and create a chain of influence. Definitely worth reading if you're into period crime or the larger themes of brotherhood, corruption, and sin. Themovie, which starred Robert Duvall as Tom and Robert DeNiro as Des is faithful to the book, but lacks its bite and bile."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"OK, so this is considered a classic of the genre because of Dunne's ability to build upon a real life mystery. I can see how this might have been different when it was written given the dialogue, explicit content, and pacing. I appreciated some of these elements enough to keep going.Even as I kept going, however, I did not see how these features alone make a great book. Dunne's dialogue and repeated short sentences are just as annoying here as they are in \\"The Studio.\\" If you like: He walked outside. It was raining. \\"Hey there\\" type language, this book is for you. If it makes you cringe (or dizzy, try reading this on public transportation) after a while, then I suggest you avoid it.The explicit content isn't bad, but the racial jokes get old after a while and are overused. Meanwhile, the pacing is such that by the time the police solve the mystery (by doing, really, regular work), you may not care anymore.It is worth reading, but it may not be enjoyable."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"The secular and the divine meet at a murder scene, that of the Black Dahlia appropriately recast as a desecrated Virgin Mary (the Virgin Tramp).

There are too many great books to read without wasting time on this one."},{"Title":"True Confessions: A Novel","review":"This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him. Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring. However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better. Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior."},{"Title":"Windhaven Plantation","review":"One day, Lucien Bouchard promised, he would build himself a home exactly like his boyhood ancient chateau.

I have an old worn, and tattered version of this book from that era that I replaced with this one. Some consider Mr. Frost to be a New England poet, but many people have now discovered in his poetry universal themes crafted for expression by the persona of a Yankee farmer, a profession by the way that Mr. Frost never suceeded in despite the fact that he owned several farms during his lifetime. He was also greatly admired in England where he lived for a time.This is a great book to have that covers many of major works."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I highly recommend this Audio book narrated by Charley Steiner.

It makes you think about how to get what you want out of life, whether it's financial success, love, good health, or anything else through the power of you.

Some of the most important aspects I've listed below:*Prayers are only realized once they are harmonized with your thoughts and actions.*Use your circumstances to discover your hidden powers and possibilities within yourself.*Change your thoughts towards others and other things, and those things will change in kind.*Fear, doubt, and indecision lead to failure, indigence, and dependence.*Courage, self-reliance, and decision will generate success, plenty, and freedom.*Your thoughts will shape your circumstances.*Thoughts allied to fearless purpose becomes a creative force.*Ideals and visions constantly acted upon will result in eventual attainment.This book is more than a good buy and an addition to your library, but is potentially life changing if you follow the principles!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book is awesome--very inspirational, powerful, and uplifting. Every chapter requires some digestion before one can move on to the next. To have used so few a words, Mr. Allen really said a lot. This is a must have book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"\\"As a Man Thinketh\\" is one of the pioneering works of the modern inspirational and self-help literature. More of a long essay than a proper book, it was first published in 1902 and it brought its author James Allen enough of a success that he was able to dedicate all of his energies to writing from then on. The book's title is an allusion to a verse in King James Bible \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" (Proverbs 23:7) However, the context in which the verse was written differs somewhat from the main theme of this book. The verse was meant to war the reader not to be deceived by the outward appearances but to pay attention to one's true motives. However, Allen used it a springboard into the discourse over the way that our internal states of mind determine our actions and situations in life - almost the exact opposite of what the biblical verse was implying.This book is a gem of virtue ethics and personal responsibility. Too many self-help books aim to work on external manifestations of deeper internal problems, but this book firmly aims to change our actions through changing the underlying thoughts that lead to those actions. This is a difficult task, but it is something that is admirable and worth striving for. The book reinforces this point in many well-written and accessible ways. In fact, \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" is a beautiful example of clear and straightforward writing that has stood the test of time. The book is truly inspiring without being maudlin. It is very short, and therefore easy to read in a single sitting. Nonetheless, much of its charm lays in the fact that it can be read and reread over and over again. As long as the human condition remains as it is, this book will remain relevant."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Short, sweet, and to the point. This is a great book to begin to look at how our thoughts impact our actions. Change your thoughts and you begin to change your behavior and eventually you change the results you get in life. This book opened my eyes to how many things were influencing my thoughts out of my awareness. Negative news and negative people should be avoided because they influence your thoughts and create fear, worry and self-doubt. It teaches you to seek out healthier people and sources who instead influence you to reach higher levels of personal success. This is classic book with a great message."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I stumbled across this book after listening to quotes from the book in a funkadelic song called: good thoughts bad thoughts. I am a true believer in self help books and this is one of the first and best. some other good ones are the power of believing, master key system and invisible valium."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I had a restless night sleep after reading this book. The english is a little old but it is a powerful book. Ideas and thougts swept through my head and I realised where I was going wrong.This book really hammered home the law of \\"You become what you think about\\".I'll definatley read this book again.\\"All that we are is the result of what we have thought.\\" Buddha."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book changed my life - literally. Before I stumbled across this book my life was a disaster. I was 31, living with my parents, no job, no money, my girlfriend had just dumped me, I was binge drinking at the weekends. I felt like a rudderless ship in a storm. This book changed all that. I read it all in one sitting - the truth is irresistable.James Allen saw clearly what the rest of us couldn't see - what we think is what we are. If your thoughts are mostly negative - you'll mostly feel bad and because you'll feel bad, you'll act bad. And acting bad or negatively will produce negative results in your life. You reap what you sow. And the exact opposite is true too! Positive thoughts = good feelings = good actions = good life. The best ideas are so simple.I took all the ideas in this little book and followed them. It was hard at first to break the old habits. I stuck with it and within 6 months my whole life had changed for the better. I started my own business, found my soulmate and became a better all round human being. I brought forth amazing new experiences, visited Paris, London, Iceland within a 1 year. I am now living the life of my dreams and I have James Allen to thank for it. Hopefully this book will bring you your dream life too. God bless and good luck!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book is very calming for me. I have a burning fire inside of me that becomes out of control when dealing with some of the ignorance in this every day society. There are a lot of dumb a%# people out here, just living hand-to-mouth that can really send me into a rage, but upon reading this book (now twice), I have learn to gain control of my thoughts, which changes my previous actions and attitudes towards those types of people. I gave the book four stars instead of five because it's too short. Multiple copies of this book needs to be placed in every welfare office in every part of the country."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I had this book along with its companion, \\"As a Lady Thinketh\\", for a number of years. I found it to be very good as a guide to living. One must remember that James Allen was writing at the turn of the last century. These admonishments of his can be applied to most lives. This would help us all to stop and think about who we are now and who we will be in the future. There are not many mentions of God in this book but one can see a very strong biblical influence in the writing. It is a book that must be taken in small doses as one wants to think about what they have just read and ponder on the passage for a while. There are many feel good about yourself books on the market but this one has stood the test of time and lived in the minds and souls of those who have been touched by it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book seems to have benefited a lot of people but I wonder whether his later works would've benefited these same people in a much better way. I say this because readers of books like these can often be mislead into thinking that 'thinking' is a great thing. James Allen himself didn't think much of this book. It was written in his earlier years. The title of the book is actually taken from the Bible: \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so he is.\\" Those who have studied success or esotericism thoroughly will realize that the title was taken out of context and that \\"to think in the heart\\" actually means 'to feel', not 'think'. James Allen gave little importance to thought in his later works on success. For those who want to learn more about success or personal achievement, I highly recommend his later works \\"Eight Pillars of Prosperity\\" and \\"Foundation Stones\\". For those who want to learn more about The Secret, Haanel's MasterKey is the only book I can comfortably recommend.\\"Non-thinking produces bliss\\" was one of Samael Aun Weor's many revolutionary and obviously spiritual sayings. Gurdjieff, a man of much greater power than Allen, said that to accumulate willpower or psychic energy one needs to \\"stop oneself from thinking.\\" This would explain the weakness of most people. One of the proverbs that Michel de Montaigne, the philosopher, wrote on his bedroom ceiling was, \\"Happy is the life without thought.\\" Thinking has driven people to insanity and even suicide. Obviously I am referring to the habitual thinking that occurs in most of us. To compare 'old' Allen with the later Allen, here are some examples. You will notice the deeper insight in his later works:On Sacrifice\\"He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.\\" (Thinketh)\\"In the managing of time, there will be many things which a man will have to eliminate from his life; some of the things and pursuits which he loves, and desires to retain, will have to be sacrificed to the main purpose of his life.\\" (Pillars)On Achievement\\"All achievements, whether in the business, intellectual, or spiritual world, are the result of definitely directed thought, are governed by the same law and are of the same method; the only difference lies in the object of attainment.\\" (Thinketh)\\"The studied elimination of non-essentials from one's daily life is a vital factor in all great achievement.\\" (Pillars)On Fear & Indecision\\"Thoughts of fear, doubt, and indecision crystallize into weak, unmanly, and irresolute habits, which solidifyinto circumstances of failure, indigence, and slavish dependence.\\" (Thinketh)\\"The timid apologetic man who seems almost afraid to live, who fears that he will do something not in the approved way, and will subject himself to ridicule, is not a full man.\\" (Pillars)\\"Indecision is a disintegrating factor. A minute's faltering may turn back the current of success. Men who are afraid to decide quickly for fear of making a mistake, nearly always makes a mistake when they do act. The quickest, in thought and action, are less liable to blunder, and it is better to act with decision and make a mistake than to act with indecision and make a mistake, for in the former case there is but error, but in the latter, weakness is added to error. A man should be decided always, both where he knows and where he does not know.\\" (Pillars)On 'Drifting'\\"Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to 'drift' upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.\\" (Thinketh)\\"Without a central motive and fixed resolve, your life will be a poor, weak, drifting, unstable thing. Let the act of the moment be governed by the deep abiding purpose of the heart. You will act differently at different times, but the act will not be wrong if the heart is right.\\" (Life Triumphant)On Character\\"A noble and Godlike character is not a thing of favor or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts.\\" (Thinketh)\\"Serious people make rapid progress both in their work and their character. It is in this way that they live, and \\"do not die\\", for only stagnation is death, and where there is incessant progress and ever-ascending excellence, stagnation and health are swallowed up in activity and life.\\" (Pillars)"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I give 5 stars for the content of James Allens' awesome book. I truly appreciate his valuable insights and helpful style of teaching.However, the CD gets 1 star. I have a wonderful vintage cassette copy of the same material so I thought it would be nice to have a CD that I can listen to in the car. I ordered the CD in August and received it over three months later due to unavailability. That's not so much a problem with the CD as with Amazon but I don't hold it against them. Amazon has always provided very good service so I knew I would get the CD eventually and didn't mind waiting.However, when I finally received the CD it looked suspiciously like a burned copy. It didn't come with a jewel case or printed cover material of any kind. It just came in one of those little blank paper CD sleeves that you can buy 50 for $5 at Office Depot. Also, the CD clearly was not printed by a publishing company or record label of any kind. There are no copyright imprints, license numbers or indications whatsover of what company has the rights to the material on the CD - nearly every CD does. Although I thought all of this was a bit odd I still didn't give it too much thought as I was just happy to finally have the coveted material on CD.But... then I put the CD into my laptop for a listen and it sounds AWFUL. In some places you can barely understand what is being said. My old cassette copy is very clear and read by a powerful voiced man. The CD on the other hand sounds EXACTLY like one of those computer simulated robot voices when the words are typed into a translater and out comes RoboRobert. Then I thought maybe it was a problem with my laptop so I put the CD into my DVD player which also plays CD, and into my stereo CD player - neither one would play the CD at all.I called Amazon to see about returning the CD for a refund and was told that since I was 6 days beyond the 30 days from shipment there was nothing they could do for me - even though I patiently waited over 3 months for the CD. I also explained that it wasn't just a matter of not being able to understand the CD (or play it at all) but that they should be aware that someone may have shipped me a pirated copy. Eventually the representative said that she would submit a request for refund but there was no guarantee. For me it's not so much the money as the principle at this point.If you also bought the CD version of this book and did not have the same issues please leave a review noting that. James Allens' \\"As A Man Thinketh\\" is wonderful and I would hate to steer anybody away from purchasing it. Maybe, and hopefully, my case was an isolated incident."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I've read this book several time, it's very short, and I learn something new every time. Such beautiful writing style, it's simple and elegant at the same time. The title says it all, \\"as a man thinketh\\", and when you are blessed enough to finish this book you will conclude that as you think, so shall you be. It's the secret in \\"think and grow rich\\" too and that is one of my favorites also. In summary, do yourself a favor and invest in this book because it will pay you back for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"1. Discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you.\`As A Man Thinketh' by James Allen encompasses the idea that \\"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.\\" James Allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that \\"In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own and not another man's.\\" Before reading the book I was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience. I have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to, though I was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create? After reading this book I felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective. I felt as though I had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life, slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture. A world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance I could begin to experiment to see just what exactly I can create. This same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress.Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.As each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent. \\"Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.\\" Mentally reviewing past experiences I can see and understand the correlation between thoughts I had chosen to entertain and my circumstances. Looking at my present situation I can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality I see before me. At an ever increasing pace I am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present, my future and my past. The more I practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way.Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to \\"drift\\" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.Reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives. Through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody. If there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created.2. Can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships, your beliefs, your goals, your values, etc? Explain.Since reading As A Man Thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me, as I can, to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions. Embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society. I believe this would push us all in a more positive direction. I can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework, frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box. If our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking. If we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality, and even learn to positively influence reality, then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking. My goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision I see of a world that works for everybody into a reality.Reading \`As a Man Thinketh' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet, which is that there is no such thing as chance. Looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined. I do, however, think we co-create every situation in our lives through our thinking. Our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don't pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the \`chance' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience. Realizing I have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life. The idea to me makes life in my mind fair. At least for the experiences I can vouch for.When I read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and I had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences. About three years ago, just before I left England, I fell out with my best friend Huw who I had been friends with for ten years. One weekend in the summer of '02 after I had just come back from a holiday with Huw and some of our other friends. In the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place. The crux of the story is that Huw decided to take somebody else's word over mine with regards to a then recent situation. The information Huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being. At first the situation seemed like a chance happening and I was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about, having arisen from decisions based on what I knew to be a fabrication. I felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary. I really didn't understand how such a situation could have come about. Could it be that sometimes life was unfair? For days I was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts, searching for the cause of the situation. I started with thinking that the person who had lied to Huw was to blame and that Huw had had issues anyway. I came to various conclusions, however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over. This stirred more confusion in me as it was something I did not wish to believe. After really stepping out of the picture, leaving the country for Cambodia, which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life, and then thinking about my relationship with Huw retrospectively I came to see that just as 'Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship. I asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant. If I had been a good enough friend to Huw then trust would have gone without question. I had lost the trust and faith of a friend. The deterioration of my relationship with Huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where I was forced to pay attention. The situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important. It wasn't anything to do with one situation. I had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues I should have paid attention to, until finally it was right in my face and I had to pay attention.A man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity, its strength and weakness.3. What are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book? Please Explain.One of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances.After reading As a Man Thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it's supposed to, indeed quite perfectly, and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules. James Allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way.If there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer? My understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer, it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow. It is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another. I believe we all have what I can at best describe as a magical force inside us. Ever seen starwars? I feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force, or whether it controls us. Where does cancer come from? I think we create it. I think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to... and through our neglect of certain areas of our life, that we cause such a thing as cancer, and indeed everything else, to manifest.We all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good, or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse. I think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness. I think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world - all the conflicts of the world, or the cancers of the world, so to speak. Take for example the conflict in Iraq or the Israeli situation, the problems in South Asia... I believe it's all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us. We are in control... you, me... everybody. And we all have blood on our hands.Paul Sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become. There is no fixed human nature, no predestination, no God that determines our course. And we suffer because we cannot handle this burden.The power to think, feel, express, believe, will, do and progress is, from the start, all within our hands. This is an extremely dangerous distribution of power, and on some level we all know it. As a result, most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off-load that responsibility.And we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity. Life in orthodoxy is comfortable, familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency. We sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment.The world around us is an extension of the world inside of us. When we do wrong, we are only doing it to ourselves. I think our whole world has got cancer... and it could even look as thought it's dying, although I hope its getting better. If you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them, our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it.Thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully. Ever since reading As A Man Thinketh I've been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality. I think As a Man Thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race. The more I think about it the more it makes sense.4. Has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way? If so, explain how?This book has entirely changed my thinking and now I look at life from a totally different standpoint, one where I can see how I am in complete control of my circumstances. Now when I look at seemingly problematic situations I ask myself why and how I have created the situation and I ask what can be learned from the situation. Reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended, I think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody. Why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened? If we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us, no matter what they are.I now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts I allow myself to entertain. Oftentimes I am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from, but now when I find myself thinking something less than constructive I stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling.He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is my husband's favorite book. It's an old book yet its wisdom still applies. A great read and a great gift for people who have everything. Don't be fooled by the low price. This is of tremendous value."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"There is a simple yet challenging message to this book: Whatever you are experiencing is what you have created in your mind. This is not a message for those who believe strongly in Fate. And it is even challenging for those of us who claim to believe in Free Will. For ALLEN TRULY BELIEVES THAT BY CHANGING OUR THOUGHTS, WE CAN CHANGE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.That is very different from most self-help books, which allow for circumstances beyond our control. In those books, the best we can do is to choose our response. Allen goes beyond that. He writes, &quot;Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions. But when he realizes that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes the rightful master of himself.&quot;Allen is not some alchemist. If he was, he'd be hocking his book as a get-rich-quick scheme on an infomercial. No, the key to the mastery of circumstances for Allen is very difficult. We cannot be master of ourselves if all we do is react to circumstances. We must give ourselves to wholeness, to fulfillment in our relationships, to our ideals and dreams. These are the best parts of ourselves.THIS IS NOT A SELF-HELP BOOK. IT IS A MEDITATION. There are no steps to follow. It deserves to be read and re-read for years. And in conjunction with reading this book, I recommend that you write out your true-self thoughts. Who are you when you're at your best? How do you treat other people? How are you living and what are you accomplishing? Then commit yourself to meditate on those until they are so true that you can no longer not act upon them."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The basic assumptions of this book completely contradict sociological theory established by C.Wright Mills and others. Throughout the text there are many assertions put forth at \\"true\\" which seem to be no more than the author's opinion.Some of it is far fetched and in a few spots down right bunk. Still, with all that being said, I found about eight statements that are absolutely classic and feel very worthwhile to me. Worth reading for those with open minds who can think for themselves. First read will take less than an hour, but if you are anything like me you will continue to think on the precepts for many days to come. LJB"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I received this thin little book as a gift and have appreciated the positive power of the bromides contained within. The statements are meant to empower the individual. If you believe, or can be convinced, that man is the agent of his own destiny, than this book is for you. The observations are concise, uplifting and well crafted. In real life, of course, there are exceptions to many rules, but I have found that quotes and sayings have a wonderful way of crystallizing situations, feelings and suggested courses of action. This is the type of little book that one can repeatedly turn to for guidance and inspiration."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes,And Man is Mind, and evermore he takesThe tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills,Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills: --He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass:Environment is but his looking-glass.by James AllenJames Allen was the first to fully recognize the power that resides in us all, in that our thoughts are what manifests our reality. Most people have difficulty in recognizing that thoughts are things, and as Ella Wheeler Wilcox writes, \\"their airy wings\\"...\\"bring you back whatever went out from your mind.\\"Allen was the pioneer, the forbear of such notables as Norman Vincent Peale and Maxwell Maltz; he was the profoundly insightful messenger who made us realize the potent power we possess to affect our lives, rather than the proverbial leaf in the wind to be strewn about at the whim and storms of life, as was once accepted, internalized, and surrendered to. The only person to reach this truth before James Allen, was the father of psychology, William James when he stated, \\"The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.\\"In developing his philosophy, Allen said, \\"I looked around upon the world and saw that it was shadowed by sorrow and scorched by the fierce fires of suffering. And I looked for the cause. I looked around, but I could not find it. I looked in books, but I could not find it. I looked within, and found there both the cause and the self-made nature of that cause. I looked again, and deeper, and found the remedy.\\"James Allen was born in Leicester, Central England in 1864. He wrote nineteen books--his most famous being, As a Man Thinketh, written in 1902, translated into five major languages. The title was influenced by a verse in the Bible from the Book of Proverbs chapter 23 verse 7, \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" Even though it was his most concise and eloquent work--the book that best embodied his thought--he somehow failed to recognize its value, and his wife Lily persuaded him to publish it. James Allen tells us how thought leads to action, and he shows how to turn dreams into realities. His philosophy is said to have brought success to millions. His words induce the realization, helping us internalize, that circumstance is not the designer of our future, but rather, at the mercy of the intention of our thoughts.Can this small book change your life? It can. For some the words may be frightening, perhaps unwelcome, because his discovery informs us we are in control of our lives and strongly implies the resposibility is ours; we can change our habitual thoughts, the very things that govern our destiny. For many, his truth will spell liberation, as he so eloquently writes in the book as no other can:\\"Men and women are makers of themselves by virtue of the thoughts they choose and encourage. The mind is the master weaver, both of the inner garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have been hitherto woven in ignorance and pain, they may now be woven in enlightenment and happiness.\\"Joe ArrigoAuthor of, Fostering Cooperation: Power and Harmony through Peopleand, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I wish I would have read As A Man Thinketh before reading The Secret.

It is a good book to read not only for its content and information but because of its structure. Because it was written many decades ago, the writing style is quite formal and maybe antiquated. It is because of this structure I had to pay attention and carefully read the book. It is a short book (less than a 100 pages). But it is a book that can change your thoughts and thus your life.Reading this book on a regular basis is conducive to improving your thoughts thus your life.Thoughts precedes emotions which precedes action which precedes accomplishing goals or dreams which precedes impacting your life.

For fans of 7 habits this is right along those lines (albeit stated much more simply and broadly). Essentially an argument is made that thoughts are under our control, are responsible for our happiness and indirectly affect our circumstances. Dale Carnegie has also often taken lines, it would seem, directly out of these pages.Very insightful, and although its short it encourages a lot of contemplation and therefore ends up taking a significant portion of time to read. My only gripe with this is that it may not be worth your while to pay 7 dollars for a great but short book.

As A Man Thinketh is a profound view of the cause and effect relationship between thoughts and experiences. It is short, but dense with ideas.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I enjoyed Allen's small book of thoughts, which some provoked me to reconsider my own life situation and being. It is so refreshing to hear somebody say that personal situation does not depend on the circumstances and fate but rather on one's own thinking and believes, for two many, this days, tend to blame everything on the genes. At the same time, it is much too easy to blame one's own lot on his/hers own fault, as easy as to blame one's lot entirely on the circumstances and situations rather than on people's actions/reactions. I would think that one's lot depends more on the combination of one's thoughts and reactions, and the circumstances one faces. Of course, different people react differently to different situations, and so two people when facing the same situation can make unlike choices, but it cannot be said that the one who made a bad choice done so because of his/her inner premeditated, or even unconscious, thoughts. Life is much more complex than that, and so I would argue that reaching a conclusion in regard to the causes of people's lots should be done more on a one-on-one basis rather than trying to do so for the whole. We cannot treat people like science and try to apply one formula to them all."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is my favorite book of all time!

Some have been printed into small books. \\"As A Man Thinketh\\" is one of his classics. It is a short book. It can be read in only a few hours. It is such a profound essay on human nature. Basically, if you think good thoughts, then you will become a good person, and if you think bad thoughts, then you will become a criminal. You have the control over what you will think. Your actions will follow whatever thoughts you have chosen to put in your head. The book goes into more detail and gives well reasoned arguments for this theory. As A Man Thinketh would be a good required reading assignment for a college philosophy class, but I would not recommend it for reading on the train going to work."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I bought 5 of these little books because I wanted to share them with friends. This is a book I am going to read once a year for the rest of my life and I hope as my children get older they will see the value in it too. It helps to put your head in the right place - awesome book, I loved it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"James Allen has captured the pure essence of the human mind and the unlimited potential each of us has if we simply will change the way we think. Having been written in the early 1900's, yet being preached today by the best teachers and philosophers of our time is a testimonial to it's power. A must read for everyone who wishes to be free."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Every young teenager and young adult needs to read this. Older generations need it for meaningful review to remind us of who we are. I like the pocket size better."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"If you've read The Secret or Think and Grow Rich, this book will be right up your alley. It actually served as the inspiration for both of those books and delivers the information in a very efficient way. We really do create our own reality and this book shows you how you can control what you create in yours."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mentor, who has been working with me in getting my \\"mindset\\" in order. I found it both inspiring and educational.The book is several (close to 100?) years old, so some of the language is a bit dated. The message is still as relevant as ever though.I like that the book is short. It's easy to read multiple times, when you get discouraged or need a reminder to keep on track. It's one of those books that you'll get something out of every time you read it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Very good book! Good for inspiration on life, relationships, and personal growth! buy 2, one for you and a friend..."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This product came pretty quickly and it was a great inspiring book to purchase.

It is short and easy to read, so you can go over it again and again. It's a good message that is as powerful today as it was when it was delivered decades ago.If you have enjoyed other books of this genre, such as Think and Grow Rich, Science of Getting Rich, and Master Key System, you will enjoy this book. It is an excellent reminder that we already have all we need and more."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"As a Man Thinketh is one of the best books i have ever read. It is very short. In fact, the very first copy I received as tiny and about the size of a book of cards, if not smaller.This is a nice version of As a Man Thinketh. It's perfect for a gift.If you enjoyed the Secret, you will love this book. It is very similar. In fact, I'm pretty sure this book influenced the Secret."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I dont know what more can probably be said about this book, but the fact is it is a classic that every school child should have to read and report on. The older you get you realize the truth in 'As a Man Thinketh, so is he\\" ... it is true. We make our own heavens and hells right inside our minds and James Allen says it so well. I try and read this little book a couple times a year just for good measure."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I read the kindle version. I don't know if that is the \\"original\\" version. It's very thought provoking. I would recommend it to someone who is just getting started in \\"changing their mind\\" as it is a fairly short read and holds your attention. If you have been wondering about all this--whatever you call it: self-help, metaphysical, new-age, spirituality, being positive, \\"The secret\\", Dr. Wayne Dyer, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra stuff is--well this is not new stuff, it's a revival of what great thinkers thought and wrote about before. There were great thinkers in the \\"middle\\" of the 20-century like Earl Nightingale, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, Dorthea Brande; but there were great thinkers before that in the 19th century like Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and James Allen. All of these writers are focused on self-fufillment and controlling your thoughts--at least in their mainstram self-help books. The books written by these people are not strictly philosophical or religous and that is what is so great about them, but you do have to be at least a little open-minded because how can you think about fulfillment without considering spirituality, philosophy, or religion? You don't have to be a devout muslim, christian, or jew to appreciate them, in fact it would probably strengthen your religion if one of your goals is to be more religious. I think you can benefit if you are atheist or aganostic as well because one of the themes of all these great authors and their books is that you can control your fate and that much of your happiness or lack of happiness or how you view yourself depends upon your perception of yourself and your abilities. This is nothing new in psychology or personal performance in hobbies, work, sports, etc. Everything else aside, and whether or not this is the best or worst review on amazon, the only way great books like this cannot help you is if you believe that every single event in your life had already been pre-planned and you have no possible way to change your own future, which is simply ridiculous because sometime today or tommorow, you will have an important choice or a very unimportant choice to make. And when you make a choice, you are in fact determining your future. How you choose to think is a choice, but learning to control your thoughts is very tough, but the most rewarding thing you can do for yourself."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I had remembered that old expression, \\"As a man thinketh,\\" from many years ago and was curious as to where it came from.I discovered that it was the title of a book wrtten by an Englishman in the 1800's.I had just been reading another book along the same lines by an author born in the 1800's and thought it fascinating.So I purchased it. It can be a tough read, even though it's small, because of the old fashioned lingo (written in the 1800's) and the fact that it was written in England. But it is a good mental exercise to push yourself through it and there are many truths therein.So often folks seem to think that the power of your thoughts is a \\"New Age\\" concept, proliferated only in recent times. This book will help you get clear that it is not..... that there is nothing new under the sun. Good stuff."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book helps an individual understand the need to think 'positive' and to realize that 'what you think is who you are.'

By all means, everyone should read the essay at least once in their life. In my case, it has changed my life. Therefore, I recommend the essay in all its editions. But this edition is great for its presentable appearance and quality."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I have read this book many times over. It is an incredible book which has tested the time with simple advice. The book does justice to the title \\"As a man thinketh\\". We are what we think. Just as discipline with physical aspects of our health and well-being, so is discipline required mentally and psychologically to ensure that we focus on productive thoughts and positive thoughts and feelings. Ultimately the invisible and unseen manifests into the physical and very real aspects our lives.In a number of chapters the author argues his case clearly about the impact and effect of thought of man. I consider this book to be the forerunner of The Secret. It deals with the law of attraction and the law of action. We will attract in our lives the things we focus on most and we will achieve based on our action. This book brings it all together, the physical, the spiritual and the mental. I recommend it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"If you want to learn to control your temper, your thoughts, or increase in life, this is an excellent tool!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I reset my goals after reading it.

As a Man Thinketh provides so many solutions for all phases and stages of life. Reading this book made me realize two very important things. The first being that the mind is the most vital tool God has given us all. The question I pose is what are we allowing our minds to conquer, create, and produce? Is it for the greater good or not? Lastly, imagine if 25% more of the people residing in the United States could simply shift their thought process from negative to positive during these economically challenging times? Good things may not appear over night however, things would eventually begin to turn around simply because of one speaking it, and feeling it come to fruition prior to it change happening.Adra YoungAuthor of: The Everyday Living of Children & Teens Monologues series"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is an excellent book.

Good book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"James Allen proves that it is possible to pack dozens of valuable nuggets in a small package. The language is often lofty and dated, which in other works detracts from the material. In this case it reads like the writings of a wise old scholar, enhancing the content and its weight.If you enjoy highlighting key points, keep the cap off your highlighter while reading this. More than just an essay on positive thinking, Allen walks the reader through applications for personal growth, putting thought into action, using personal gifts to achieve right purposes, persevering to develop character, sacrificing and putting forth your full effort.Powerful nuggets in a tiny package.

Every sentence packs a punch. There are no frivolous words wasted in this short book. All the great modern motivational speakers have taken the advice from this book and simply reworded it. Just goes to show you that the same advice has been floating around for ages. It's up to you to do something about it!The main message reverberated throughout the book:\\"You and your circumstances are a product of your thoughts.\\""},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Wonderful, thought-provoking book. The info on the author on the dust jacket is a valuable addition."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"James Allen was one of our great thinkers.

Instead, it reveals in detail how our thoughts shape our lives, and how we can master our thoughts to become better people and make a positive impact on the world."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The metaphor (or Truth) presented in this book is that the mind is like a garden or field. Whatever is planted and cultivated in this garden, either deliberately or by accident, will eventually be harvested. Fruit trees or weeds. This idea comes from The Bible. When we think that \\"circumstances\\" are bad, it is because (on average at least, in my opinion) we have set ourselves up for these bad circumstances with bad prior decisions. An example is: \\"I don't have enough income because I made some bad choices in the past or I don't work to increase my earning potential, not because it's someone elses fault\\".From my life experience this is all true. People already have everything they need for this life when they are born. Often we forget that it's really just a matter of religiously tending the garden.It's a real short read too, which is great for ADD people like myself. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The title says it all.

It was like my bible for many years and it shaped my thought processes while creating self awareness throughout my entire life. I have given it as a gift to friends and acquaintances for over 30 years. I currently use all of the principles in my coaching practice, \\"Business and Life Management Coaching\\" at [...] for well over 20 years. They say what's old becomes new again.....James Allen set the stage in the 1900's for all the current personal development authors and motivational speakers to teach the same simple principles through different mediums.

A spiritual awakening from a man who was ahead of his time. What a brilliant mind. written in straight forward language and really makes one think. A mighty strong little book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The book of the week was As Man Thinketh by James Allen. It's a good little book. It is written very artistically has a very important main point. The concept emphasized throughout the book is the power of positive thinking. The book has been read for many generations and most recently it inspired the writing of The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.The power of positive thinking is incredible. I marvel at how powerful the brain is all the time! There is very few things that you have complete and total control over in life and one of those things is how you think about things and what you think about. You can think about things positively or negatively. If you think positively about things you will be happier, healthier, and all around more successful, and if you think negatively... well your life will suck.Your happiness can greatly be affected by thinking positively. If you wake up in the morning and tell yourself \\"This is going to be an awesome day!\\" then it will, in fact, be an awesome day. You mind subconsciously pulls out all the stimuli around you that makes that day awesome. Your mind thinks... it's warmer than it was yesterday, I feel rested, I have a wonderful family, I look great today, and so on, in a subconscious effort to make your day \\"awesome\\"... and again... with negative thinking you'll only pull the negative stimuli. Stick to the positive thinking, why not focus on the good stuff in life?And health... you will be healthier with positive thinking. Many common health problems are stress induced and a lot of stress will manifest from negative thinking. What health problems? Migraines, Ulcers, Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, Muscle Tension, and the list goes on... Doctors say that thinking positively about an existing illness will even make you heal faster.Overall, success is widely dependent on your attitude. If you are positive about your surroundings and you visualize your goals, you will be more successful in what you do. If you are into the classics you might want to check this book out, but the writing is pretty old school and it's not for everyone. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book was a very unusual read. The idea sounded very convincing, and the state of mind I was in after completing the book was clearly quite close to what the author intended. His reasoning was clear and made a lot of sense, despite the unscientific and metaphysical claims of the subject.I'm a bit perplexed as to why the bad English didn't bother me or get in the way. The author has an extremely limited vocabulary, and the book is full of mistakes (I don't know whether those are specific to this edition, or were retained from the original). Perhaps the amusing language actually makes the reading experience less serious and helps make the subject matter more accessible. It's hard to tell."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"It was so suprising to read something written a century ago that seems just as applicable today as it did back then.It's a short book with a positive message that certainly is good for everyone to hear.

I would recommend it to anyone, and will definitely be reading it again."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The principles taught in this book are true. It is not a book written to replace scripture or attempting to mind force future events in your life. It is a book written to explain how to have a happy and productive life, to have control over your own emotions and thoughts, and yes, it is proven that good things do happen when one goes through life with faith, hope, and a good attitude. The precepts taught in this book are not radical and are beneficial to anyone who applies them, and are completely free of bigotry towards other ideas and theories.Very pleasant and interesting reading, thought provoking and easy to understand.

In As A Man Thinkith, Allen lays out the mind body connection. He uncovers how sheer power of focus, and thought shape and mold your circumstances. Allen covers: Vision, how thoughts affect reality and how what you dreams about affects your future.I was amazed to find almost the exact message that I have devoured from several of the 20th century pundits laid out and gift wrapped by James Allen.Want a mental boost, start out with this book.

If I have good thoughts and actions; it will produce only positive results and if I have bad thoughts and actions; it will produce only negative results.

You're better off buying the book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I first read this book about eight years ago when our high school math teacher made the suggestion. Reading it again now (much like my recent experience rereading Lord of the Flies after an equally long time) makes me realise how much depth I initially missed. Perhaps it was the formal English that made it tempting to skim through. Or perhaps I was just a few years too young to fully grasp what was being said. In any case, I now realise this book contains a wealth of insight and understanding if you're prepared to take your time. Yes, it can feel a little repetitive when Allen keeps churning out analogy after analogy to belabour the same point, but his vivid and beautifully described images are stressed for a reason.The biggest criticism of the book is that it doesn't offer any proof. Even though Allen mentioned upfront that he'd avoid the technicalities on exactly how these principles works, the book still managed to squeeze in too many ideas that made leaving out said technicalities feel like cheating. He talks about how this \`law' applies like those in the physical world (as the plant springs from the seed, as the wheel follows the ox) but basically stops there. And even though he does offer a few casual observations (the lazy schemer who remains wretchedly poor, the rich glutton who can't pay his way out of sickness, the cheapskate employer who eventually goes broke), these aren't enough. It's like having a child ask why something is the way it is and simply answering \\"because\\".He also mentions that there is no element of chance. If life is conveniently complex enough for these principles to work, isn't it an oversimplification to assume good people can't have random misfortune or that bad people can't stumble upon luck? Apparently not. Allen's reasoning as to why people get what they don't deserve is that they do in fact deserve it: \\"The dishonest man may have some admirable virtues which the [honest man] does not possess; and the honest man obnoxious vices which are absent in the other. The honest man reaps the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings upon himself the sufferings which his vices produce. The dishonest man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness.\\" Does that mean the people in Libya and Japan deserve what they're going through now? That seems absurd.The main problem with the law of attraction (especially as bludgeoned by authors like Rhonda Byrne) is that too much emphasis is placed on thought. If good things happen, it's because they were somehow manifested; if they don't, it's because our thoughts weren't strong enough. Once again, it could all be nothing but chance, but this fact is often ignored. It's no wonder many sceptics have dismissed this as more new age garbage. How on earth can you simply sit on a cushion, picture good things, and have them magically bang down your door? And how can thinking happy thoughts make your cancer go away? Even though it's been shown that stress (which is mostly in our heads) can weaken our physical defences and leave us susceptible to disease, we still need medicine to treat the body because good thinking alone isn't enough.And that right there is the key. Action alone can be misguided while thought alone will just leave you buzzed. But when used together, they produce great results. Thought forms a clear vision of what you want while action goes out to make it happen. That's why we need both and that's why both must be aligned. You need to believe that you're capable of achieving whatever you want (think the right thoughts) and be prepared to work hard to get it (do the right things). As Allen in fact says: \\"Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonise with his thoughts and actions.\\" Nobody can deny the power in that."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I picked up this book because of the title, how we think and why is an interesting subject, but this book goes beyond that. I loved how the book immediately went to the point of it's subject. It explains how we as human thinking machines can alter our lives for the better just through our thought process, James Allen gives a simple explanation on how what we think is what we are. As deep and way out there as it may sound, he doesn't just babble, he gets to the point with examples and explanations of why this is so. The book just gives you the key to this power we all have and can easily develop by just changing our thoughts. There's a chapter for different aspects of our lives, and it's easily read in a short time, I've read it 5 times myself, and love it everytime. It's a very positive and inspirational book, and written decades ago by a man &quot;I Beleive&quot; really cares, and was not out just to make money on this &quot;New Age Generation&quot; (with no offense to other authors, there are good ones out there)"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I have to say, that I was ready for the content, so it was particularly impactful. I just finished reading \\"Ask and It Is Given\\" and had most recently read through the chapter titled \\"Accurate Thought\\" in the book titled \\"The Law of Success\\" published by Orne Publishing. In fact, the day I was introduced to \\"As a Man Thinketh,\\" I had just read about \\"Accurate Thought\\" the night before. I was walking through my office building, and this guy I know, totally unprompted and in a random manner, pops \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" out of his pocket and thrusts it toward me and said, \\"Hey, man, have you ever read this book.\\" I looked at the title and laughed out loud. Sometimes God talks to us in such an overt manner that it's scary (in a good way). I downloaded the book immediately to my Kindle and read it that same night. I'm probably going to read it again tonight. And will continue to re-read it. After reading it, I woke up the next morning with such a sense of certitude and confidence. The ability to shape my destiny through accurate thought gives me a refreshing sense of freedom, because I can create that which I choose to experience. Awesome book!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is the type of book that is short and \\"to the point.\\" Allen basically emphasizes that you come to be and are, based on what and how you think. My first impression of this book after the first chapter was that there were way too many elaborate and confusing words. I felt overwhelmed and just wanted to forget about the book; it wasn't worth looking up all the words I didn't know just to try to possibly comprehend what the author was trying to get across. However, once I did decide to read further, I admit that the book eventually grew on me. I began to see the validity of many of the author's very important and yet basic points. Based on what I learned from this book, I think that this is very educational and \\"mind-expanding,\\" as the author takes you on an adventure, exploring another incredible skill of the human mind. In addition to this, I think that it would be very beneficial for anyone and everyone to read it, as it gives you a very different perspective afterwards about how one's thoughts are able to create and destroy many aspects of your ever-developing life.As A Man Thinketh is book that shows and guides - not dictates and demands - someone how to change their way of thinking so that it is positive and fruitful. Allen writes, &quot;Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions. But when he realizes that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes the rightful master of himself.&quot; This statement itself could sum up the entire book. However, there are many ways to look at and decipher the meaning of this quote.As stated in the book, the majority of people today have many negative outlooks about different things for different reasons. That's human. However, what all these people who think negatively don't know, is that by their negative and unconstructive thinking they are inevitably just hurting themselves and unconsciously bringing negative situations upon themselves. What this book repeats over and over again is that for good to come to you, you must have good and positive thoughts. If you breed and harness negative thoughts, chance is, it will be highly unlikely for much good to come your way. As said in this book, the fruits and misfortunes of your thoughts clearly show by the type of person you have come to be, and what you have and don't have.At first I thought this book as kind of a hoax. I kept thinking, \\"yeah right, like I'm going to be rich if I think it.\\" But then once I continued reading this book, I realized it was true. Let me give you a smaller and less high profile example than becoming rich: if someone always thinks they are sick and is always fearing the thought of becoming sick, they will usually be sick. It seems that the more you think of something, the more it is prone to being drawn towards you. This book just teaches you how to bring forward the good-not the bad.After completing this book, I would definitely say it has had a positive influence on me. I am now always conscious of what I am thinking and constantly analyzing many of my thoughts, considering the possible benefits of each one. I would definitely read more of this author's books, as I have no doubt that the lessons I learn from them will positively help me for a long time, as did the many lessons I learned from this book."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Very good book.It's a classic and really teach you the power of your mind"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book is very insightful. I've read it a number of times now, and each time I couldn't put it down. This is one of the best self improvement books ever written. It's so simple, yet so profound. &quot;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&quot; We can try to deceive others and ourselves about who and what we are, or we can blame others and/or circumstances for our problems and weaknesses, but when it comes right down to it, &quot;the divinity that shapes our ends is in ourselves.&quot;"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books ever written. James Allen explains in his \\"easy to read\\" way, how we are the ones responsible for the present state of our own lives (not someone else or some circumstance in our life). As he says, \\"Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself\\". That's why two different people can see the same event and view it in a totally different way. He also stresses that fighting the outer circumstance or \\"effect\\", will not help, since the real \\"cause\\" is in our hearts. He makes it very clear that if we wish to change the world, we will have to start with ourselves. And a big part of the work, will be to realize that we aren't usually even aware of our thoughts (which means we don't know what we're asking for). If you truly want to change your life, for the better - this book is a good place to start. James Allen wrote several other books, that are sometimes difficult to find, but well worth looking for. \\"Out From the Heart\\" is one of my favorites, as it gives \\"more basic\\" instuctions for those of us who have a lot to learn about ourselves. If you like James Allen's books you may also like books written by Vernon Howard, Guy Finley, Maurice Nicoll (who studied with P.D. Ouspensky and G.I. Gurdjieff), and J. Krishnamurti."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Ever feel like your life is out of control? Got a bad attitude that you can't get rid of? Do you find yourself complaining a lot? Maybe you think it's your circumstances or the people around you that are responsible. James Allen doesn't believe it for a minute. It's all in your head. Literally.Allen writes, \\"Out of a clean heart comes a clean life and a clean body. Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life and a corrupt body.\\" We ARE what we think. It's not mind-over-matter. The mind IS matter. You can improve your circumstances, your surroundings, your station in life...but until you conquer your thoughts, nothing will really change. When your mind is pure, your body, your language, your actions...all will follow.Whether you choose to believe Allen or dismiss him, AS A MAN THINKETH will occupy your mind far beyond the time it takes you to read its 72 pages. Read it. And think about it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I feel compelled to defend this book against the ignorant remarks by previous reviews like that by A. Brown below. This is NOT a new-age book. Had he read the book he would know that the book was written by a shy, humble man named James Allan in the year 1904. Last I checked 1904 wasn't the peak of new-age thought.The author never asserts that if you think \\"rich rich rich\\" you will become rich any more than thinking \\"unicorn, unicorn unicorn\\" will turn you into a mythical creature. The premise of this short yet remarkable book is that you can shape your destiny simply choosing to think positive thoughts. If you preoccupy yourself with your fears and self doubt, you will most certainly be a slave to these negative thoughts. These self defeating thoughts only serve to prevent you from success. If you think positive thoughts, you're putting yourself on the path of success. Focus on your strengths, don't let thoughts of self-doubt harbor in you. The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all.James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book \\"He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.\\" Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure.Read some books by Rick Patino, Jack Welch, Vince Lombardi, Sammy Davis Jr (on a side note, Sammy Davis jr's book is even called \\"Yes I Can\\" which is what he would tell himself whenever negative thoughts crept in his head) or anyone who overcame the odds to be a huge success and you will see that they live their lives exactly as James Allan advises, they think only positive thoughts, they visualize their success rather than being fixated with their weaknesses. Nothing new age about it folks."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"\\"They themselves are makers of themselves.\\"This book is quiet and gentle, and has a lot of power. Mr. Allen in the introduction states that this book \\"is not intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject of the power of thought\\" but that the book is \\"the result of meditation and experience\\" and that \\"it is suggestive rather than explanatory.\\"This small book has 68 pages and seven chapters. Mr. Allen has a gift of language: it is simple without being simplistic, and artful without being gaudy. You savor his sentences as he quietly, calmly and peacefully explains different aspects of thought.I think mental discipline is a long lost art. That may be the reason why the world is in the shape it is. After all, Socrates was known as a great thinker, not a great crier, or a deep moper. And that is why we still study him thousands of years later. Christianity believes that we should love God not only with our hearts, but also with our minds (Matt. 22:37). Karl G. Maeser, the second president of Brigham Young University said, \\"Not only will you be held accountable for the things you do, but you will be held responsible for the very thoughts you think.\\"Moreover, Thomas Aquinas speaks of sins of thought, word and deed, and points out the progress of thoughts to action: \\"For the angry man, through desire of vengeance, is at first disturbed in thought, then he breaks out into words of abuse, and lastly he goes on to wrongful deeds; and the same applies to lust and to any other sin.\\" (ST I-II, 72,7)Since what we believe determines what we do, we can change what we do by changing our thoughts. Our bodies are added to us at birth, but beneath it all is our mind. That is the genius of this book.Favorite quotes from the book are:\\"Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals it to himself.\\"\\"Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.\\"A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.\\"The only odd thing about this book, besides its awesome focus and startling profundity is that Mr. Allen never mentions that the source of his book's title is from the Bible: \\"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" (Psalms 23:7) Mr. Allen seems to be a Thoreau-esque type of free spirit and freethinker, and was an admirer of Buddha (See chapter 6). He may not have known the source of his idea, which is too bad, since there the Bible is full of good thoughts like this one."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is a warning to people who are considering buying the tape version that was recorded by John Zaremba. The book, As a Man Thinkith, is a wonderful classic about the power of thought. However, the tape recording is so bad I had to laugh.

The main topic is that you can achieve any goal you want by having the right philosophy.

Since we don't, however, Cognitive therapy (that of changing the \\"current\\" thought processes) is the way to go.

Nonetheless, I do. I just don't think this is a 4 or 5 star book for its kind.There are many good statements in the work that are obviously true, but there are also more than a few statements and claims that are obviously just not true.

I bought this book based on the recommendation of writes who I have a lot of respect for, including Tony Robbins.I knew that the general essence of the book was that a positive attitude leads to an improved life. I was hoping for some empirical evidence and/or some practical advice. I found neither. Just paragraph after paragraph of rehashing and restating the same exact thing over and over again. The only thing that changed was the analogy - a ship on the sea, a seed growing into a beautiful tree, mining for gold... I never would have thought that a 40 page book (more of a pamphlet) could be further condensed, but all of what was said could have been said in a couple of paragraphs.Furthermore, the whole premise behind the book is questionable. As I said, the author does nothing to back up his point, which is basically that our present state is a product of our thoughts and our thoughts only. Our current manifestation has absolutely nothing to do with out diet, our DNA, chance, circumstance, exercise, education...I give it only one star. The idea of the book is good, and this guy put his ideas down a long time ago. I give him credit for that. But there are much better books on the subject that give both practical advice and inspirational evidence. In my opinion this book is a waste of money and and waste of time."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This forty-page book is worth more than an entire library of other so-called \\"self-help\\" books out there.\\"Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace.\\"I only wish someone would have forced me to read this book when I was a teenager, or even a young boy.

I bought it and have read it many, many times since then. It's one of my favorite books.We often fail to realize how much affect our thoughts can have upon our entire life. Allen draws a picture that shows the direct connection between the events in your life and the thoughts in your mind that helped to manifest them.This idea has been presented before, but Allen explains exactly how thinking about something habitually will lead to action that turns the thought into reality, whether you want it to or not. Eventually habitual thought leads to habitual action, which soon shapes your life and creates the person you are. In other words, you are what you think about.If you have lazy or excuse-making thoughts, you become a lazy, excuse-making person.If you have positive, generous, ambitious thoughts, you will become that person instead."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I say \\"addition\\" even though this book is one of the original, the additions followed in it's footsteps.

I read it at least once a year."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The main message here is that you are responsible for your own life and your circumstances, however difficult they may be, can only be overcome by you. No one else is responsible for your shortcoming or failures.You are the only person who can move your life in a particular direction.

It is full of gems of wisdom, in a classic that is more than a century old. It revolves around the idea that it is a man's thoughts alone that drive his life. James refutes all notions of fatalism and determinism. The book is composed of a number of essays: Thought and Character, Effect of Thought on Circumstances, Effect Of Thought on Health and the Body, The Though-Factor In Achievement, Vision and Ideals, Serenity. While I agree with the author at a high level, there is much left to be said about execution and taking action. While thought is a necessary pre-requisite it is the implementation that drives results.A recommended bed-side quick read. I will conclude with some of my favority quotes from the book:\\"A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.\\"\\"Self-control is strength; Right Though is mastery; Calmness is power.

Your higher thoughts pull you toward what is pure and real and your base thoughts draw you into immoral conduct and inhibit your spiritual release to fulfillment. This relationship of thought upon action impacts the companions with whom you associate and determines who is drawn to you and whom you repel. This edition destroys the simple read and truth of the words by pulling text out and seeking to emphasize portions to an extent not intended in the original version. The result is a spotty, distracting read that detracts from the power of the original work. While the photographs are attractive, the emphasis of certain text in the photographs is an overall distraction that ruins this work and makes the message banal."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Would that the world could follow the teaching of this book, would be a very different place than that in which we live."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"very thought provoking although not easy to read due to the \\"old english\\" style of writing."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Inspired by God and written by Solomon, this proverb is simple and to the point.

Start with this book to learn how to control your thoughts and create your life."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I was introduced to this great work by James Allen over 32 years ago in the form of an audio tape narrated by Earl Nighingale. Shortly thereafter, I bought the book and read it everyday. It is a short easy read, only 73 pages and 7 chapters:1) Thought and Character2) Effect of Thought on Circumstances3) Effect of Thought on Health and the Body4) Thought and Purpose5) The Thought-Factor in Achievement6) Visions and Ideals7) SerenityEach chapter is short and to the point. The book is thought provoking and stimulating.Here is one of my favorite quotes from As A Man Thinketh:\\"Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes,And Man is Mind, and evermore he takesThe tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills,Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills :-Enviroment is but his looking glass.\\"Here is another one.......\\" You will be what you will to be,Let failure find it's false contentIn that poor word, 'enviroment,'But spirit scorns it, and is free.\\"It masters time, it conquers space;It cows that boastful trickstar, Chance,And bids the tyrant CircumstanceUncrown, and fill a servant's place.\\"The human Will, that force, that force unseen,The offspring of a deathless Soul,Can hew a way to any goal,Though walls of granite intervene,\\"Be not impatient in delay,But wait as one who understands,When spirit rises and commands,The gods are ready to obey.\\"Some interesting thoughts from this book.-A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve by lifting up histhoughts.-Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results;bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.-He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.This is a small book with giant sized inspiration and thoughts.I recommend reading it every day for the first few weeks and see if you notice a substantial difference."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"He has a good message, but the book is too short and has no practical aspect.

It has sat on the shelf for years without me reading it. I picked it up the other day and read it in about half an hour. I now understand the significance of this book, even though it was written long ago. This book truly makes one look at how they've lived their life, their thoughts, and actions. Each of us has room for improvement, that's what life is about. We have all undoubtedly errored in our judgement, or in how we have treated others, and had to live with the consequences. This book brings contemplation of these subjects and others to the surface of our minds. This is not a how-to book. It is also not a hell-fire and brimstone, shame inducing book. Rather, it is just a reminder, letting us know that we can reach for, and achieve a higher level of being. I love this book! You will love it as well!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"You may read this once but you're likely to re-read this book many times. Beyond the message, the writing is beautiful and poetic.

His book blesses my life. You will be blessed too."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I was so excited to receive my copy as it's been ages since I've read this book.

That's what I am off to do now!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I read this book many times. That was in my twenties. And at the time, I believed every word. As a result I applied all the principals I learned in this book to my life. And in spite of the fact that I have always been a person who has a great deal of faith and a positive attitude, I still had many problems through out my life. Just as we all have problems through out our lives. The problem with this book is that it tries to convince the reader that all of their problems are THEIR fault. That THEY are in control of God, not the other way around. The only thing that is simular between this book and the bible is the title, \\"As a man thinketh, so is he.\\" Those words come from the bible. However, there are also hundreds of scriptures and stories that teach us that God is not under our control but we are under His. Jesus did not want to suffer. The gospels say that Jesus feared suffering (not death) so much that He sweat great drops of blood. Before His passion was to begin Jesus prayed, \\"Father, let this cup pass from me. Never the less, let your will be done not mine.\\" THAT is how God wants you to pray.

It has some good ideas but I was expecting more."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Certainly no masterful and insightful philosophical treatise on the mind or the nature of thought - in fact, it can barely be considered philosophy at all.While not as pitifully self-righteous and downright manipulative as so-called \\"self help\\" authors and speakers of the current age, Allen's work simply tries as hard as it can to use language itself - rather than well expressed ideas - to cover up it's naive world view and simplistic understanding of consciousness. I also find it quite bizarre that not only does Allen not make the link between the micro and macro self-identities, he actually denies environmental roles in shaping the consciousness. To clarify what I mean by this, rather than simply making the \\"positive\\" affirmation of \\"don't accept\\", Allen makes the naive mistake of suggesting \\"don't acknowledge\\".I can certainly see why young \\"Donald Trump wannabes\\" lap this stuff up and given that the vast majority of humanity steps through life playing make-believe anyway, I guess it doesn't hurt to at least play positive make-believe. However, if you're looking for an actual discourse on thought, consciousness, and being, then give this one a wide berth."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book was sold as used but came practially new - Great condition and a Book I use daily for insperation."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is a new-age book. Before you buy this book, I recommend doing an advanced search on Amazon for all books by the publisher \\"DeVorss\\" (which is this book's publisher). You'll find that DeVorss publishes nothing else expect books just like this one. The reason I suggest this is so that you don't buy this book thinking that it's one-of-a-kind.

The next day, the Proverbs Man set out to do an honest day's work, with a determination to grow his assets, and to return an honest service for every man's dollar. He exercised the fruit of the spirit, and was careful to show love and be patience wherever he went. When his strength and wisdom failed him, he prayed to God, and God always came through with the help he needed. The As-a-Man-Thinketh guy set out the same day to think his way to success. He happily locked himself into his room and began to repeat the same thing over and over again in his head, \\"rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, RICH!\\" And climbing into bed, he began to toss and turn, as a door upon it's hinges. Before long, his room began to get messy, so he thought, \\"clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, CLEAN!\\"\\"By much slothfulness the building decayeth, and through idleness of hands the house droppeth through.\\" - Ecclesiastics 10:18\\"The slothful desireth, but has nothing\\" - Proverbs 13:4, \\"because his hands refuse to work.\\" - Proverbs 21:25Don't use this book as a substitute for any of the following:1) Hard work2) Determination3) Wisdom4) Faith in God5) Prayer6) The fruit of the Spirit7) Salvation through Christ Jesus8) The presence of the Holy Spirit\\"For without me ye can do nothing.\\" - Jesus"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is a good book, but I expected more depth from the Bible."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book can be summed up in 3 sentences:'If you think bad, bad's what you'll get.''Do the right thing.''You have the power to control your mind.'If you're looking for self help, I recommend Dr. Laura.

He makes a point about the enslaver and the enslaved; comparing them equals; co-operators in the slaves' victimization. This man was born in the 1800's and died in the early 1900's when slavery was still practiced outright.Slaves then and those around the world are compelled and forced into slavery by various forms of violence. Death and mutilation are just some of the practices that compell people to remain in conditions that they would rather escape from. For most people, the will to live is stronger than the will to die in order to gain freedom. That is not being a co-oprater with the enslavor. Yes I agree with the information provided in this book about changing our conditions, but the opportunities for change and help are not always readily available for some people as there are for others, especially those in enslaved conditions. There is always a way for divine intervention and that I believe is through prayers and the worship of Almighty God and that is usually the only way for real help for people in enslaved conditions."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The book in such a short space provides the same insight and life lessons as several 200-300 page books.

Once read, your life will never be the same."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"James Allen's work titled As a Man Thinketh/As You Think is a \\"classic\\" in the truest sense of the word. Unfortunately, these days the word \\"classic\\" is an often overused descriptive used by marketers to elevate a piece of work for profit. However, in the case of Allen and his writings, it is quite a different story and a fitting word. It is no exaggeration to suggest that his writings are on par with such notables as the Buddah, Confucious, Laozi, Mohammed, and Jesus.When looking at the state of the world, it is no wonder that Allen and his writings are a virtual unknown. Today it is in vogue to blames others, play the victim, and scream foul. Allen teaches personal responsibility for one's life, the laws of cause and effect, and how one can harness true personal power. He will teach the seeker that they are the master of their own fate. The root of all problems lies within the mind. There are no slaves in this world. There are only oppressors. Allen speaks directly to the reader. This is not for the faint of heart. If one is looking for excuses then look elsewhere.Allen's work is more than a century old yet it needs to be heeded now more than ever. Anthony Robbins, Norman Peale and all the other \\"gurus\\" of the time move aside. Do not waste valuable time and money on these and others' self-help tapes, books and motivational seminars. If one is earnest in their desire to learn from Allen's works then cost should not be a factor. His work can be found in public libraries, bookstores and can even be viewed for free on certain web sites. Whether one is a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist, a Muslim, an Atheist, rich, poor, black, white, yellow and/or brown, Allen's writings need to be heard and read."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"What an awesome book. Some of the greatest things in life come in the smallest packages. This book explains how thought leads to attitude leads to action leads to habit leads to character which leads to destiny. It is my belief that this simple but powerful truth is one of the most overlooked principles in the world. This book is literally a gold mine of awesome aphorisms and quotes including one of the greatest statements of all time: \\"Men do not attract what they are but that which they are\\". This is one the most important pieces of writing to grace the planet earth. I do not leave home without it."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"You are what you think. You are literally the sum of your thoughts. Action only comes once the seeds of thought have been planted and sowed.

Highlight, make notes, etc. It is easy to read and gets right to the point without any ambiguity. But do not just read the words. Actually take the time and think about what the author is saying and think about how it is true in your life and how accurate and relevant it is that one's thoughts make a man: hence the title of the book As a Man Thinketh.While the message is beautiful, lovely, and accurate to a T, it is not always easy to control your thoughts and avoid the evil and malicious ones entering your psyche which prove disastrous to one's health, future, endeavors, the relationship he has with the world and himself. And the author makes it a point to have a goal in your life , a passion, and aim straight ahead to attain that goal and not be distracted from negativity and base thoughts and sooner or later he will be awarded accordingly.This is truly one of the best self help books I have ever truly read.

The basic idea is not new. It is contained in Proverbs 23:7, \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\"However the Bible verse is so short that many people miss the depth of wisdom contained in those few words. James Allen explores and guides you through the thought process. By reading this book, you will come to understand that \\"Man is the maker of his character, the molder of his life, and the builder of his destiny.\\"\\"Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves;\\" As soon as you understand and accept the concept that unless and until you change, nothing in your world will change, then you are on your way to positive change in your life.The book is very short, but word for word is one of the most valuable books of our time.

This book attempts to explain what many of us are too stubborn or too lazy to hear, WE CONTROL OUR OWN DESTINEY! Unfortunately, some people live their lives from the generosity of others. Expecting charity, government handouts, luck, religion, or something else to the carry them along. Many people wine and moan about the unfortunate circumstances that seem to constantly follow them around. \\"WHY ME, WHY?\\" many ask. Well (according to James Allen) it's because of the way you think. If you want control of your life then take it. If you want to be happy and successful then do it. It's easy to fall into the trap of, \\"Well my days are short with work and...(you know the rest).\\"If a person can begin to understand why they have the thoughts that they have and they can process these considerations, then they can realize that their world is a direct result of the way they think. We are not a product of our circumstances, our circumstances are a product of us. If a person understands this they can then begin to make up their own mind and make up their own destiny. As a Man Thinketh claims nothing that isn't true and claims no more that what can be understood. If you think you are afraid then you are afraid. If you truly think you are happy then you are happy. But that is just the tip of the iceberg! In the garden of our mind if we plant the seeds of beautiful flowers then beautiful flowers will grow, if we plant nothing then weeds will surely grow instead.It is not easy to understand every thought premeditated or not that comes to our mind. The author protests that once a person understands why and how they have come to think the way they think they can then understand how to think differently, if it's necessary for them to do so.Why read or recommend such a book? I would answer because, &#65533;I want to become a better person. If we all could become better people, we all could make a better world. The world we live in is the way it is because of what we collectively make of it. I can't control you and you can't control me, but we each can control ourselves.\\"Please read this very short book.

This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone seeking to improve their world by imporoving themselves."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This excellent compilation of essays by James Allen truly holds the key to success, amongst other things! I feel so inspired after reading this book, so ready to put into practice what this powerful, little book is teaching. This \\"classic\\" has been around since the turn of the century and it seems to be even more relevant in today's stressful and competitive society. I underlined so many wonderful and inspiring passages that I intend to refer to on a daily basis. As Allen states, \\"a man is literally what he thinks\\", or as the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out! Or put another way, \\"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.\\"I have learned that I cannot blame others for my life, or my state of affairs - they are my creation, the end product of my thoughts and actions. Allen states that man makes or unmakes himself by the thoughts he keeps and cultivates. Man is truly is his own worst enemy!I really resonated to his quote on fear, \\"Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplish anything, and never can. They always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in.\\" How profound and how true. How we let fear run our lives - again proving how powerful our thoughts can be. Allen further expounds by saying, \\"He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.\\"The garden of our mind is only cultivated by us. What kind of crop we want to consistently yield is solely determined on our positive, enriching, and encouraging thoughts or on our doubting, destructive and negative ones. We alone hold the key to our future, and our success, and our attainments in life. We can either have a feast or a famine - it is only up to us.This highly inspirational book cannot help but to motivate you in some degree. I feel like I have been given the keys to a door that was once rusty and would not open, but now will yield freely in my hand. Another great quote is, \\"The Vision that you glorify in your mind, the Ideal that you enthrone in your heart - this you will build your life by, this you will become.\\" This is one book that you will want to keep constantly by your side, especially for those times when you get discouraged, or when the road seems rough. Just reading one page will have you having a change of heart, with its motivation putting you back on that right path.This book is a MUST read if you are desiring to change your negatives into positives! The power of the mind is incredible - in all areas of our life!"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"The one star has NOTHING to do with the content of this wonderful publication, it goes without saying that anyone who has stumbled upon the genius of Allen's masterpiece knows full well that the truth is what it is, i.e. this book is sublime mastery. No, my one star simply refers to this DeVorss imprint, this veritable 'mini-book'. Sadly nowhere on the page was it explained that this was a MINI version, a pamphlet indeed. My advice, pay the extra 2~300 yen and get yourself a 'proper' copy - one that will stand up in your bookshelf. Thank you."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This little book, filled with much wisdom, can be summed up in this one sentence:\\"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts\\".Overall, this book is about taking responsibility for your lot in life - the good and the bad - as it can all be traced to the thoughts you entertain day in and day out. It also shows how our thoughts directly impact our character - we are what we think - How true!!!I would recommend this book to everyone interested in changing some aspect of their life. It is less than 70 pages & can be read in less than an hour, but its effects could last a lifetime."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \\"A man is what he thinks about all day long...\\" We are...we really, really are. But the sad fact of the matter is, most of us do not really know what we are thinking. In fact, I would say that most of us aren't really thinking at all. Most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things.Does this make your butt twitch?Does this make you a little nervous?It should...but...don't get too nervous...don't go too much in a panic. If there is something from this review that I want you to remember the most, is this:WHAT THOUGHT HAS DONE, THOUGHT CAN UNDO!!Think about this for the next 25 years of your life. Meditate upon this powerful Truth. Who you are is simply the residual effect of what you have thought about in the past. This is is a new day! This is a new opportunity for you to turn EVERYTHING around! If you have been ill or sick, now is your time to claim health and wellness. If you have been experiencing lack or limitation, now is the accepted time to claim wealth and abundance. You see, the universe never holds anything back from you. Never! There is only a stream of well-being in the universe...you just need to come into alignment with it...and we do this with our thoughts...we do this with our feelings...we do this with the images we are holding in mind.Think about only that which you desire to attract. Feel the feelings of how it would be to have those things you want to attract. Imagine having those things, those experiences, that beautiful, abundant, healthy, well-lived life now! And I guarantee that you will! It is always done unto you as you believe.This book is incredibly inspirational and so well worth it. The book, however, won't change your life. Only you can do that.

I found it right after I finished high school and have read it no less than 100 times. It is like an old friend who reminds me that my life is what I make it, without exception. It helped me learn that I could not blame anyone else for the condition of my life, I was sololy responsible and therefore only I could change it. I finished high school in 1984 with a C average (I thought I was quite stupid) and in 1997 I finished my Ph. D. in Computer Science with an A average. I believe the ideas that James Allen wrote in this short Masterpiece with all heart and these ideas helped me change my life, drasticly. James Allen was a very wise man, anyone could learn something from him! I will close with some of my favorite quotes from this Masterpiece, &quot;You can not travel within and stand still without.&quot;, &quot;There is effort and there are results, chance is not.&quot;, &quot;Dreams are the seedlings of reality.&quot;, and &quot;You will receive exactly what you earn, no more, no less.&quot;"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I ran into this little book in a bargain bin.

It also made me think of the people I have known who have inspired me or brought me down, what kind of person they were, and how they thought about life. Negatives will get you nowhere! Although I'm in my 60's now, I wish I had read this book as a teenager. The precepts in this book can only help you to be more fulfilled, successful, giving, centered, wise, and happy to be you! Buy this book, or even more to give away, because you won't want to let yours go. I just keep going back to mine.

I have already seen how this works in my life. Years ago I was sick with negative self sabotage and thinking. Then I came upon some books especially Harold SHerman's &quot;TNT-The Power Within You&quot;, Joseph Murphy's &quot;The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind&quot;, etc and this one.

More of a long essay than a proper book, it was first published in 1902 and it brought its author James Allen enough of a success that he was able to dedicate all of his energies to writing from then on. The book's title is an allusion to a verse in King James Bible \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" (Proverbs 23:7) However, the context in which the verse was written differs somewhat from the main theme of this book. The verse was meant to war the reader not to be deceived by the outward appearances but to pay attention to one's true motives. However, Allen used it a springboard into the discourse over the way that our internal states of mind determine our actions and situations in life - almost the exact opposite of what the biblical verse was implying.This book is a gem of virtue ethics and personal responsibility. Too many self-help books aim to work on external manifestations of deeper internal problems, but this book firmly aims to change our actions through changing the underlying thoughts that lead to those actions. This is a difficult task, but it is something that is admirable and worth striving for. The book reinforces this point in many well-written and accessible ways. In fact, \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" is a beautiful example of clear and straightforward writing that has stood the test of time. The book is truly inspiring without being maudlin. It is very short, and therefore easy to read in a single sitting. Nonetheless, much of its charm lays in the fact that it can be read and reread over and over again.

This book speaks to everyone regardless of race, religion or gender. Probably the best self help book I've come across, short and to the point, no fluff, everything can be digested easily.

Mental exertion is the way to a happy and healthy life regardless of external circumstances or setbacks.Highly recommend buying this very short and simple, yet powerful book. It's dozens of pages speak volumes."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I say \\"addition\\" even though this book is one of the original, the additions followed in it's footsteps. If you can pick up on concepts easily without a lot of droning on or lengthy examples, you will love this book. It's the entire message without all the fluff. Excellent book. I read it at least once a year."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"but it was a little overly simplistic for my taste. Some good points and a thread of truth, to be sure."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"A nice book for someone who wants to step out of the Chrisitian binds of philisophical thinking and move ahead (or across) to a more humanistic or individual approach, instead of worldly, and use a philosophy that has practicality. This book does not neccesarily subscribe any specific school of thought, runs it down in a very simple matter-of-fact manner which is essentialy for any human to begin thinking for themselves. The aim of this little book is to allow the student to become a practictioner in the awareness of his surroundings, speech and actions and to learn, benefit and change any process that one deems unacceptable, namely the individual. A good book, to the point and reccomended for anyone looking for a change and needs a place to start."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Great service! Very reliable.

A man is literally what hethinks, his character being the complete sum of all histhoughts.As the plant springs from, and could not be without,the seed, so every act of a man springs from the hiddenseeds of thought, and could not have appeared withoutthem. This applies equally to those acts called\\"spontaneous\\" and \\"unpremeditated\\" as to thosewhich are deliberately executed.Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and sufferingare its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet andbitter fruitage of his own husbandry.Thought in the mind hath made us. What we are bythought we wrought and built. If a man's mind hathevil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes the wheelthe ox behind ... If one endure in purity of thought joyfollows him as his own shadow - sure.Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice,and cause and effect is as absolute and undeviating inthe hidden realm of thought as in the world of visibleand material things. A noble and Godlike character isnot a thing of favor or chance, but is the natural resultof continued effort in right thinking, the effect of longcherishedassociation with Godlike thoughts.Anignoble and bestial character, by the same process, isthe result of the continued harboring of grovelingthoughts.Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armory ofthought he forges the weapons by which he destroyshimself. He also fashions the tools with which hebuilds for himself heavenly mansions of joy andstrength and peace. By the right choice and trueapplication of thought, man ascends to the DivinePerfection; by the abuse and wrong application ofthought, he descends below the level of the beast.Between these two extremes are all the grades ofcharacter, and man is their maker and master.Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul whichhave been restored and brought to light in this age,none is more gladdening or fruitful of divine promiseand confidence than this - that man is the master ofthought, the molder of character, and maker andshaper of condition, environment, and destiny.As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and thelord of his own thoughts, man holds the key to everysituation, and contains within himself thattransforming and regenerative agency by which hemay make himself what he wills.Man is always the master, even in his weakest andmost abandoned state; but in his weakness anddegradation he is the foolish master who misgovernshis \\"household.\\" When he begins to reflect upon hiscondition, and to search diligently for the Law uponwhich his being is established, he then becomes thewise master, directing his energies with intelligence,and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. Such isthe conscious master, and man can only thus becomeby discovering within himself the laws of thought;which discovery is totally a matter of application, selfanalysis,and experience.Only by much searching and mining are gold andiamonds obtained, and man can find every truthconnected with his being if he will dig deep into themine of his soul. And that he is the maker of hischaracter, the molder of his life, and the builder of hisdestiny, he may unerringly prove: if he will watch,control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effectsupon himself, upon others, and upon his life andcircumstances; if he will link cause and effect bypatient practice and investigation, utilizing his everyexperience, even to the most trivial, as a means ofobtaining that knowledge of himself. In this direction,as in no other, is the law absolute that \\"He that seekethfindeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened\\";for only by patience, practice, and ceaselessimportunity can a man enter the Door of the Temple ofKnowledge."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"I am very busy.

I have heard it was a classic and wanted to see what all the buzz was about. I purchased the book free of charge through the Kindle store and found it to be very insightful and uplifting. The language particularly is one of the strongest parts of this book. It is written in the style of early philosophers like Plato and Aristotle which means lengthy sentences, highly quotable phrases(I Tweeted several of those quotes), and musings on timeless issues like morality and character. If you are looking for a \\"Top Ten\\" or \\"Be Happy in ...Days\\", you won't find it in this book.

Personally it has changed my life in more ways than I can describe. It took me from a place of struggle and helped me turn my life into one of victory.\\"As a Man Thinketh\\" is the type of book you can read over and over, and every time, discover a new angle on the subject of \\"Right Thinking\\" and how your thoughts control your life and your circumstances -- and how you are the master sculptor of your realities and your destiny.James is also a tremendously talented poet, who truly brings out the wonders of what your life can be.My favorite passage out the book is:\\" Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your Vision is the promise of what you shall one day be. Your Ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities. \\"And I've seen this passage fulfilled in my own life...Finally James expresses his thoughts in a way that is compatible with those who wonder what role God has to play in our destiny.The answer is God allows us to choose our fate and our Destiny... we do this by the thoughts we think.Thought mastery is truly one of the most important life skills of all... and \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" is one of the best books there is to get you started.If you want a quick tutorial on how to master your thoughts, be sure to seem my guide:\\" So you'd like to... master your thoughts \\"Where I explain how you can use \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" to master your thoughts.In Everything Truth, Faith and LoveDestin"},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This book is full of all the advice you'd ever need to create a life of wonder."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"If you liked Master Key or Master Key Arcana by Charles F.

It is indeed an eye opener to understand that until thought is linked with purpose as James Allen says, \\"there is no intelligent accomplishment.\\" He further says, \\"strength can only be developed by effort and practice!\\" Practicing personal responsibility and feeding the thought process true concentration is a starting point for future power and success.

Interesting results have come from the research on prayer. Even more amazing is the idea that deep within us is a field that can allow us to create our own world. I've meditated for over 30 years and I've been fascinated by the research done on what's called The Maharishi effect. It's how mass consciousness can positively or negatively influence many factors in our life like : weather,crime rate,hospital admissions,road accidents,violent incidents etc.James Allen way back at the turn of the last century told us the basics. Our thoughts influence our world.This is the message that Jesus taught. The Kingdom of heaven lies within.Read the wisdom of James Allen but most of all act on it.Many writers have used his inspiring message to write equally inspiring books.May I recommend a new one:Wisdom From The Heart by Radha Singh."},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"Small enough to carry in your pocket.

Can't blame the author, but for 30-somethings, I think there are better choices if you really want them to listen (or read) something.What I really like about the book is that the message of visualization rings true.

Only at the end of your life can others look back and see what you have done. &quot;You will be what you will be&quot; By the thoughts you choose to encourage.

This book is considered a classic among success and personal development literature and will remain one for years to come. The principles of success in life will always be the same: we become what we think about. Allen covers the effects of thought on life circumstances, achievement, health, character, peace of mind, and more.Each chapter is short and sweet--sometimes almost a meditation on success. A necessary read for those who follow the belief that thoughts are things. Allen put's it best with: \\"As a being of power, intelligence, and love, and the master of our own thoughts, we hold the key to every situation, and contain within ourselves that transforming and regenerative agency by which we may make ourselves what we will.\\""},{"Title":"As a man thinketh","review":"This is a great book and CD and well worth it.

It's an insanely funny parody of superheroes, but also has a genuine emotional heart. You feel for the plight of David Brinkley, the novel's protagonist, once the world's greatest hero, now just a middle-aged suburbanite nobody with only the faintest echo of his once mighty powers. He's an alien, feeling all alone, yet somehow this makes him even more human. A good example of something that is at once funny and terribly human is, as a teen, David develops \\"gamma-eye vision\\" that lets him see through walls and also, if he concentrates, girl's clothes. He tries to resist the temptation to use the power, not just because of the dubious morality of being a peeping tom, but also because when he's using this superpower, he can't see where he's going with his normal eyesight. You know he's given in to temptation when under David's photo in his yearbook, it reads, \\"Clumsiest Boy in School.\\"The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the book is filled with 1970's pop-culture references that haven't aged terribly well. Bella Abzug jokes were probably funnier in 1977 than they are now. On the other hand, some of the political satire still feels dead on. In the book, the people who really run the country are based out of Dallas and steer the country via the vice-president, while the president is left out of the loop on many of the nasty schemes being cooked up by his administration."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"I understand they are going to reissue this.

Robert Mayer's writing is clever, funny, and humane-- as witty as the book is, as much as it plays (havoc) with the genre, it never veers all the way toward parody; in fact, its protagonist is more painfully human than any of his avatars ever were. I won't assume that all of the current greats (besides Morrison, obviously) have read this, but it's easy to imagine the humanity of some of Moore's, Bendis's, Morrison's, Robinson's and Gaiman's \\"flawed\\" gods to have been inspired by Mayer's book.There's also a bonus for readers over 40, especially New Yorkers and those who came of age in the New York metropolitan area in the countless sly references to people and events that made up the fabric of the early 1970s here in Metropolis. But don't be put off if you don't fit that profile-- those particular pleasures of recognition aren't in any way crucial to the reading experience, and there's a whole lot to savor besides them."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"Fun, twisted, hip. This little book's got it all. Written twenty years ago, but fresh as new born razor blade. SUPERFOLK was a fast enjoyable read. I'm old enough to get a lot of the pop culture references, and I can see where this little book might have sparked Grant Morrison's budding imagination. Fans of THE INCREDIBLES, pop culture, political humor, human nature, and just plain good writing will want to snap this baby up. I applaud St. Martin's for resurrecting this sleeper hit. Up, up and a way up yours, Hollywood, this is the movie you should have made!"},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"I understand they are going to reissue this.

This is a wonderful satire of the hero-genre, a humorous tale of a super mid-life crisis written long before The Incredibles made animation history. Mayer skillfully creates a fantasy-pulp world chock full of pop culture's infamous and iconic, with enough cameos to make any child of the 60's and 70's grin with wicked delight. But overall, he is able to transform the stuff of comics - that brilliant combination of noir and sensationalism - into a delightful yet adventurous novel."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"I'll try not to repeat too much of what everyone else here has said. Yes, this is a wonderful and groundbreaking book. It's also a very quick read. I naturally read most books, even fiction, very slowly. Not this book. I found myself turning pages so fast that I had to intentionally slow myself down so it wouldn't end too soon. The author draws you into his world very easily in all the right ways.A bit of advice: I recommend stopping every so often to remind yourself of context. How would this book be seen by someone reading it back when it was written -- before The Watchmen, The Tick, The Incredibles and just about everyone else has re-done the genre of placing superheroes into the everyday world. The satire is that much funnier when you see it from this perspective. Also, there are tons of contemporary pop-culture references which are funnier when you remind yourself of the era in which this was written.If you think my advice is over-analyzing what should just be fun pop fiction, ignore me. It's still a great book on its own merits."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"After an over two year search I finally located and read Superfolks. The book was worth every minute of the wait.

A good satire makes the subject new through a different perspective, while this book just digs a deeper groove in an already-beaten path. There's no laughs here.The hero comes from the planet \\"Kronk\\". The Kryptonite-analog that steals his powers is \\"Kronkite\\". Are you laughing yet? Ha-ha! Ha-ha! So clever! But wait, there's worse. The parents who sent him from his exploding birth-world were Archie and Edith.Yes, THAT Archie and Edith. Laughing yet? Or worse yet, are you mildly intrigued? Don't be, because all they get is a couple of really cringe-worthy lines (of course, Archie tells Edith to \\"Stifle\\" herself). There's plenty more cringes where that came from.Meyer does that name-dropping a lot. He crams in real names like Candice Bergman and Nelson Rockefeller along with a ton of comic book creations (conveniently, they're all mostly deceased, so his weak protagonist won't suffer in comparison) or they're really thinly-disguised, like Captain Marvel becomes \\"Captain Mantra\\" (retired). I can't imagine why DC didn't sue the polyester leisure suit off this hack, unless they were too wary of giving him publicity and increasing his sales.This was written in 1977. Was it relevant, clever and cool back then? It's not just that all the 'hip' references are dated, I can't imagine this was entertaining back when Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth. I can listen to Disco this long after the millennium and some of it sounds quite hummable. But of course, some disco songs make you wonder just how much cocaine they were all snorting to have bought such tripe.Well, this is the \\"novel\\" to read while you're listening to the worst music of the Disco era. Put on Morris Albert's \\"Feelings\\" and read this and you'll probably want to kill yourself.This is bad news.

I never understood why this book wasn't a hit, but if you read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"Yes, Watchmen and the Incredibles have similar stories, and the author of this book has staked a claim to being the originator of this idea. Doesn't make it better just because it came first. Shakespeare's plays are amalgamations of other earlier works, and few remember those original, inferior works. Same thing happened here. Alan Moore (along with many others) revitalized the comic industry, creating epic stories that will be remembered for ages. Superfolks is Superman with a color swap, clinging onto one idea for the brief length of the story. Read the author's review of Watchmen to glimpse a bitter, failed author who wants a little attention. It's only going to get worse with the empending release of the movie."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"&quot;Superfolks&quot; is an excellent novel.It has everything you might want in a Super-Hero novel: Action,Satire,SEX,Intrigue,Comedy,A True Suprise Ending.

Potentially a grim concept, it's somewhat lightened by the existentially humorous tone taken by Morrison.If I have one gripe with the book, it's with the occasionally pretentious narration. At times the author oversells the reader, becoming unintentionally funny. Fortunately, this occurs in only a few spots in the book."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"An entertaining book about the life of your average superhero.

Now I am not saying I have read EVERY book, or new EVERY character story line, but I consider myself quite well versed in the history of comics. So imagine my surprise when I was introduced to Robert Mayer's Superfolks here in 2013... 36 years AFTER it was released!!! I had never ever even heard a peep of this book, and the fact that this is the case is a travesty on itself. The book is fantastic... so why wouldn't comic book writers, artists, and fans extolling its virtues? Probably because most of the writers & artists in the comic industry have 'borrowed' (or outright stole) most of the ideas that Mayer had put forward in his book. It is amazing how much has been lifted from Mayer's pages, and I can only believe that the lack of popularity of this book in a world that depends on word of mouth recommendations can only be tied to the fact that it is apparent that people have stole from it.The book focuses on a retired Superman type hero who has hung up his cape. All the other heroes have also done the same. (Sounds a bit like Kingdom Come). Now all of the sudden there is a crime wave and he gets the urge to get out there and fight crime again... but in this case the crime wave is just a ruse to get him to go back to work as a hero so that he can be killed by his enemies (very similar story lines to Watchmen). This is the first time I can tell where superhero characters were portrayed as broken human beings, with regular vices like alcohol (Demon In the Bottle), drugs, and even inappropriate sexual actions. This is not the cookie cutter super hero stories that we were used to back in the 70s... and would usher in a new era of super heroes being less than perfect (and even greatly flawed) in their stories.The book also features a ton of literary cameos of pop culture figures throughout the book. Actors, actresses, politicians, gangsters, musicians, artists, sports figures... all of them are well represented in Superfolks. Same for heroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc... they are all mentioned. Even the similarities of elements of the story (the main characters weakness, his alien origin, the villains, etc) are all taken from comic, but then taken to a whole new level of depravity never seen in comics up until that point. The book takes you to the edge of what you would expect from a hero story... and than takes it way past that!!!If you want to see where the root of the current era of comics was ushered in, look no further than Mayer's hidden masterpiece of superhero fiction. Trust me, you will never be disappointed!!!!!"},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"Superfolks was one of my favorite sleaze ball reads this year; it's a must for people that enjoy Christopher Moore's satire and the odd ball approach to Superheroes that writers like Grant Morrison deliver with a side order of Disney porno.-Cockshit, Creepbox.com"},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"Superhero comics have created their own mythology. Actually, like the Greeks and the Norse, there are actually two mythologies, that of Marvel and DC (any other publishers have had a significantly lesser impact on the public). And with myths and legends come the eventual deconstruction of those myths and legends. For the superheroes, this deconstruction really took off in the 1980s with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, but they were hardly the first: a decade earlier, Robert Mayer provided his own take in Superfolks.Part reinterpretation, part Mad-magazine-like parody, Superfolks follows David Brinkley, a former superhero who has retired after losing his powers. His Superman like origin has him as the last survivor of the planet Cronk, having come to Earth as a child and raised by a childless couple. His only weakness: remnants of his homeworld called Cronkite. Now in his forties, Brinkley has settled into a middle-class life with a wife and two and a half kids (she's expecting).Brinkley (whose superhero name is never revealed) is the last of his breed, with Superman, Wonder Woman and others having either died or given up the game. But with his powers almost non-existent, he is not sure he can face a new challenge: there is anarchy in New York City, a major crime spree that seems designed to bring Brinkley out of retirement. It's part of a plot that involves international conspiracies and strange supervillains.This is a book that would be enjoyed most by those familiar with superhero comics, particularly those from the DC universe, and even more so, the life of Superman. It's not perfect; with all the gags Mayer attempts, it's not surprising some may fail, and the story itself sometimes comes off muddled. Nonetheless, this is a fun book with its fair share of laughs."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"A satire that is the story of an aging Superman analogue. The various major dc heroes perhaps do exist in his world, but analogous versions abound, as well, particularly a warped Marvel family analogue, complete with allies and enemies - some of whom were produced inc*stuously and recorded on the Saturn s*xometer.The protagonist almost discovers that there is a dangerous conspiracy at work, and he has to summon the enthusiasm to get out of suburbia and do something about it, whether his costume fits or not.This book obviously had some influence on Busiek, Moore, Morrison, etc., and writers of that type, and what they ended up doing with Astro City, Miracleman, Watchmen and other titles.When I first read this as a kid I had no idea who Walter Cronkite was, or other such American pop culture references, so that sort of thing may detract a little from the work now, but at least you can look 'em up on the internet, easily.Definitely worth a look as a seminal work, even though obviously satirical."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"Robert Mayer did. Other than that, all I have to say is that it is an entertaining quick read and as others have sad, many ideas and themes present in this book are present in later works by Alan Moore, Rick Veitch, and even Grant Morrison himself (who is my all time favorite comic writer). Some of the satire is a bit dated, but some still applies today."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"This is a great novel. I didn't find it funny so much as clever, interesting and involving. Many of the plot elements have been taken from this novel and incorporated into later comics work by Alan Moore Frank Miller and Rick Weitch, to name just a few.

I find that really interesting, considering, until I noticed the spine at Borders, I had never heard of it before. But he's right.The book is written in the style I try to emulate, which is to say, I wish I wrote like this. The entire thing keeps a hallucinatory, unreal edge, facilitated by strange tropes- like the appearance of a variety of famous people in strange ways; Martin Van Buren is the head of the CIA, Marylin Monroe shows up as a nurse, and Joe Dimaggio is mentioned in passing as a limo driver. None of them are actually those famous people, but in the same way comic book artists will sneak real faces into their panels, these deceased pop culture references move the book out of reality. There's more to it though- word play. For example, our hero is an alien superman from the planet Cronk, which was destroyed. The meteorites from that planet, which are the hero's only weakness are called \\"Cronkite\\".But there's an earnestness in the story, and understanding... a fleshing of all of the characters that brings a real concern to the story- it's not just absurdity. The absurdity moves you out of this world and into theirs, it ropes you in and holds you against the story.Which brings us back to modern comic books, and the quote above, which really sums up the whole thing. Comics have become more self aware, in part because of increased cynicism overall. Heroes are pass&eacute;, so to keep the characters alive, we need to move away from tights and capes and into angst and introspection. Tortured heroes. Flawed men and women in a decaying world has become the norm. This mode peaked in Alan Moore's The Watchmen (which will be massacred in film form sometime soon), which featured some pretty dysfunctional heroes in a world where superheroes were outlawed. Today, we see the same trend in Powers, which focuses on normal people living in the wake of superheroes, and deconstructionist adventures like Rising Stars.So, in short, if you're a comic book fan, this is a great book. If you hate comic books, this is a fantastic book. If, like me, you can't help but get caught up in the metaphor of superheroes- the mythical aspect of it- well, this is pretty much the perfect book on the subject."},{"Title":"Superfolks","review":"I read this book almost 3 decades ago & have been looking for it ever since.

She gets more affection from her dog Zeus than she does from any human in her life. Kelly is an executive at Impact Music in New York. She's always been uptight, all business, slightly shocked by the rock musicians she represents. Secretly, she's often yearned for a bigger slice of life, and daydreams about finding true love and passion. She's never considered acting on her daydreams until she finds her cold, condescending husband romping with their nanny. Kelly files for divorce, then sets out to change her life.While arranging a national tour for the band Checkered Past, Kelly meets Brett Blaine, lead singer. Brett is the quintessential bad boy and far more appealing than media hype makes him out to be. Blessed with smoldering eyes and a roguish way with the ladies, Brett falls for Kelly from their first meeting. He asks her to tour with the band as back up singer. Before too long, Kelly discovers that elevator music and her cold fish husband Brad just don't cut it for her any more.While touring, Kelly learns the business as an insider. Wild parties, alcohol and drugs to keep her going, and exhausting treks from one play date to another become her new reality. Life on the road with Brett is intense, exciting, and sometimes frightening. When a crazed stalker harms band members, Kelly's life is on the line.Wild Side is a tidy little thriller in addition to portraying the best and worst of fame's rewards.

At that time I was only passingly familiar with Chesterton and, despite faithful attendence in class, only noddingly familiar with Aquinas. Since that time I have come to understand both men in more depth, and since that time this little book has grown and shimmered until, much to my surprise, it has became one of my favourite books of all.All of the usual caveats about Chesterton's writing apply here: he cannot resist a digression, he cannot resist an alliterative allusion, he cannot resist a pun. He is so full of life that he is constantly threatening to spin out of control. He is not a scholar, he is not writing a sober appraisal, he is probably not sure of most of the biographical details of his subject (and he candidly admits to this dearth of dates and details).In spite of these defects, the book is a triumph. Toast it with your best wine. Chesterton, for me, is the embodiment of &quot;A Man in Full&quot;; he is the polar opposite of C.S. Lewis' &quot;Men without Chests&quot;. He is so full of good sense, penetrating insight, sound moral judgement, and the joy of life that it is all spilling out in every direction. This is criticism in an old key; it is appreciative criticism; it is an encounter with a writer by an entire man, and not just by a theory. It is wonderfully refreshing. I don't know of anyone writing today in a similar vein.He brings all of his larger-than-life presence to bear on this account of the life (sort of) and thought of one of history's great minds. And on just what aspect of Thomas' thought does he focus? In one diabolically politically incorrect section near the end of the book he bellows out that &quot;on a map like the mind of Aquinas the mind of Luther was barely a speck&quot;, and I'm sure that he would hasten to add that his little book suffers the same ignoble comparison. There is a great deal to Thomas that he, of necessity, leaves out. But what he does include is very astutely chosen, for he understands the basic structure of Thomas' thought and emphasizes the essentials. Thus there is a chapter on Thomas' argument with the Manicheans and his affirmation of the goodness of the world. He treats with great aplomb Thomas' notion of &quot;being&quot; and its relation to God. He does great honor to Thomas' mode of argumentation, to his sober balance and fair treatment of opponents. He is appreciative of the devotional side of Thomas, which does not come through explicitly in his philosophical writings but is important for an understanding of the man.I suppose it must be granted that the book is as much about Chesterton as it is about Aquinas. Those wanting a more straight-forward treatment should seek out one of Josef Pieper's books on Aquinas. But if you have any adventurous spirit, by all means read this book. It is written by a man who loves and understands his subject in his very bones, and who brings his subject to life in a way that is most uncanny. Five stars."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"One of Chesterton's highly acclaimed short biographies, writing just before WWII he called this 'a popular sketch of a great historical character who ought to be more popular'. St Thomas Aquinas (1226-1274) was born into an aristocratic Italian family and forsook his privileged position, took a vow of poverty, and became a Dominican monk. A brilliant thinker, and revolutionary in his day, he proceeded to become one of the most influential philosophers and theologians that has lived. It explains how Aquinas' influenced thinkers in his day and how that thought is an influential strand in our modern worldview.Several experts on Aquinas have acclaimed this very enjoyable book as the finest introduction to the man and his works. It introduces the man himself and some of his philosophy, which is modern and scientific in tone. This is not to be surprised at when we consider that his university professor was Albertus Magnus, who paved the way for modern science by taking certain elements of Aristotle more seriously than anyone before. Aquinas' theology is not covered on grounds of space and complexity. Chesterton is writing at his best, and while he assumes a fair degree of knowledge on the part of the reader he covers a great deal of ground in a short space. His usual paradoxical sense of fun and wordplay is to the fore. Chapter seven, 'The Permanent Philosophy' is excellent, and at only twelve pages would serve as a good primer of philosophy, something to read before and alongside Bertrand Russell's 'The Problems of Philosophy' perhaps."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"Chesterton displays his genius for insight forcefully in this distillation of St. Thomas's thought. He focuses on a very few key ideas of St. Thomas's and shows how these underly a philosophy that could encompass common sense, reason, intuition, and Christian revelation. You will probably not find another such introduction, as it represents distinctively Chesterton's views and does not aim for comprehensiveness or the slightest pedantry--the quoting of other critics, for example. But his views have withstood the scrutiny of many scholars.The manner of its writing shows Chesterton's genius. According to his biographer Maisie Ward, when Chesterton decided to write a book on Thomas Aquinas he simply began to dictate it aloud to his secretary, as he had so many other books. Then he asked her to go to the library to borrow some books on St. Thomas. \\"Which books?\\" she asked. Any books, he replied. She brought him a stack. \\"He flipped them rapidly through\\" and then dictated the second half of the book. Of the result, Thomist scholar Etienne Gilson said \\"Chesterton makes one despair. I have been studying St. Thomas all my life and could never have written such a book.\\""},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"This is an insightful exploration of Thomas Aquinas the man and his philosophy.

There is no table of contents, no breaks for chapters or chapter titles. You can get a download with all the above elsewhere on the internet. Amazon it is not right to call this a book."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"G. K. Chesterton has written a brilliant introduction to a medieval philosopher who used to give me the horrors (for no particular reason other than youthful ignorance.) Whether you love him or hate him, it is clear that Thomas Aquinas was one of the towering geniuses of human history -- right up there with Einstein and Newton. In addition to that, this \\"Dumb Ox\\" seems to have been a genuinely sweet and friendly man, who couldn't be too friendly because his mind was always beckoned back to the enchanted fields of philosophy. There seems no doubt that he was the greatest philosopher since Aristotle, and maybe the greatest ever.He's also highly reliable, much to my surprise. Mortimer Adler has published an interesting book called \\"Ten Philosophical Mistakes,\\" and it's interesting to note the first one, too complex to explain here, is a mistake which Aquinas DOES NOT MAKE. Unlike amateurs such as the Baron d'Holbach, Thomas is well aware that man has free will, a conscience, and a moral duty. Again, unlike Holbach, Aquinas is quite sure that God exists, that man has a soul, and that the soul is immortal. Unlike the Baron, however, Aquinas explains why he believes each of these things, in impeccably clear language. (If he gets too complicated for you to understand, that's because he is discussing extremely complicated things.) He is so good that one is tempted to throw in the towel and regard all subsequent philosophy as a lot of egotistical, academic, boring chatter. And, amazingly enough, you can reach this conclusion without even being a Christian! (I'm not.)Chesterton manages to deal with all this in a short, fascinating book. The only complaint I have is about this particular Kindle edition, which is riddled with typos generated by the lousy OCR software used, plus evidently a complete lack of editorial overview. These typos average as high as three or four to a page, which is really kind of ridiculous. I finally ordered the book,St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Francis of Assisi: With Introductions by Ralph McInerny and Joseph Pearcejust to have these two small masterpieces as a book for my library."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"Chesterton had converted to Catholicism in 1922 and in 1923 had published a book on St Francis of Assisi. He is clearly a partisan for Catholicism against Protestantism and the modern world; for the \`living' Middle Ages against the Renaissance \`which was a resurrection of old things discovered in a dead thing'; and for the Aristotelian view against the Platonic, neo-Platonic, and what he calls the neo-neo-Platonic view of the Renaissance. And he lays about himself lustily against thinkers with whom he disagrees: Francis Bacon, for example was \`third-rate' and Hegel was \`mad'. Soberly abstract though St Thomas often is, his abstractions, according to Chesterton, are never cloudy nonsense and are always rooted in Common Sense.The brilliant opening chapter of the book is built around a comparison between St Francis and St Thomas - very different in character, appearance and in the aspects of Christianity which they developed; but Chesterton stresses that, though they were both accused by their detractors of corrupting Christianity by importing into it a pagan goddess (Nature) or a pagan sage (Aristotle), both actually expanded the possibilities and implications of Christian doctrine from within, \\"depending on external things only as every living and growing thing depends on them; that is, it digests and transforms them, but continues in its own image and not in theirs\\", so that \\"St Thomas did not reconcile Christ to Aristotle; he reconciled Aristotle to Christ.\\"The book is sometimes quite difficult: it assumes some familiarity with philosophy and theology (though it delights in showing that those who think they are familiar with them often labour under vulgar misconceptions). Actually it even assumes that the reader is familiar with St Thomas' ideas; for this is no way a text-book that gives a clear or methodical account of what St Thomas actually wrote. It occasionally makes comparisons with modern times with which a reader of the 1930s was perhaps more familiar than a reader of today. Many pages are a bit windy. But Chesterton's style is a delight to read: it is mixture of Carlyle and of a more modern version of Gibbon in that it delights in apparent paradoxes and in witty confrontations of opposite verbal phrases. His admiration for St Thomas is unbounded; but even those who do not share the faith of St Thomas (or that of Chesterton) will still find some formulations throughout this book which are as wonderfully happy as they are wise, insightful and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"I can't say this is a bad book because I didn't understand it well enough to make that judgment. The parts I did understand were wonderful and suggest that any lack of appreciation for the book is the fault of the reader and not the text. So I'm giving it 5 stars. However, this is certainly not a \\"biography\\" in the standard sense of the word, and is certainly not a good introduction to Aquinas unless you're already a philosophy student (or a student of philosophy, not quite the same thing). Chesterton jumps right into explaining Aquinas' positions without providing sufficient (or sometimes any) context for the uninformed, even if intelligent, reader. There were some gems in the text, Chesterton writes well, but be prepared to do a lot of outside reading if you're not already well-versed in the philosophy of Aquinas and his opponents and want to make sense of the book."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"You can squabble with some of the formatting (as some of the reviewers do), but this is the great thing about Kindle - $0.99 and you get one of the english language's greatest social and religious commentators thoughts on one of the world's greatest thinkers. Great book. Slam dunk. Buy it. Buy it now. How can you go wrong with GK on Aquinas? You can't."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"I've been always interested in the history of this St. I am looking forward to read more,on his history and his writings."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"This book constitutes the simplest approach to a difficult subject. A great thinker of medieval times comes alive in his perennial relevance thanks to the controversial yet clear thinking of Chesterton. I would advise anyone who wants to learn philosophy or give his opinion about religion to consider this book. Thomas Aquinas is largely misunderstood, and this book could help many a doubter to consider him an ally of rationality."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"Easily the best biography/summary of thought of the Angelic Doctor that is available in the English language. When I studied philosophy in college the translations of Aquinas were a sure cure for insomnia. Chesterton has made the Saint's thought very accessible to all. A wonderful book and a necessary addition to any Chestertonian library."},{"Title":"St. Thomas Aquinas","review":"Not as appealing as I had hoped. I had expected more would have been written regarding his relationship with St. Bonaventure. There is only one short mention concerning a particular journey into ecstacy which I understand were frequent. His most famous work the \\"Summa theologica\\" barley gets a mention and nothing is written about his many alleged physical fights with Satan."},{"Title":"Cat and the Countess","review":"&quot;Round and full and plump...&quot; With these words, Casey Claybourne lets the reader know that Lady Elizabeth Pemsley is not your average heroine. But if you are a little weary of stories populated by lean, brave women, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this gently flawed, but lovable, Countess, and her reluctant protector, American &quot;half-breed&quot; Wildcat MacInnes.As the story opens, Lady P's hands are - literally - in Wildcat's pants, though not in search of erotic release. Elizabeth, you see, is bedevilled by keptomania. Married at an early age to a man old enough to be her father, she has been left to fend for herself in London society after his death. Elizabeth has lots of secrets and is beset with terror at the prospect of having to function on her own and on behalf of her young son, amongst London's elite. She is turning too quickly to another marriage with the noble, uninspiring, Marquess of Cresting, Peter Ballatine; she is also turning to food, to the detriment of her stays, and to the unconsious comfort of &quot;pinching&quot; things. She has amassed a veritable treasure trove of useless items filched from one person or another over the months since her husband's death. When her path crosses with MacInnes, however, she is in trouble: she takes his most valued possession, a bandolier bag made for him by his Delaware mother. Wildcat is intent on retrieving it, and Elizabeth is dead-center in his crosshairs as he single-mindedly pursues his goal. To go any further in a description of the plot, would be to reveal too many delightful surprises. Suffice it to say that CC develops an ingenious subplot involving Elizabeth's future in-laws and MacInnes, who ultimately has to make several choices about what's really most important to him. The surprises at the end leave the reader feeling sympathetic to ALL the characters, which is also quite a feat.The dialog is just plain funny in an un-self-conscious way; the sexual scenes are understated but provocative; and all the characters are developed with empathy and depth (even the dragon mother-in-law-to-be). I especially found staid Peter Ballantine to be a kind, thoughtful, and ultimately generous man. This is a different kind of story, and I recommend it without reservations - for me, it's definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Cat and the Countess","review":"I'm torn when it comes to this book.The Pros: completely unique characters with an equally unique plot. A fat kleptomaniac lady of the court hooking up with a hottie Native American? Dang, count me in! Could she BE more creative? I'm so impressed that not only did she make this an interacial couple, but she also made the heroine full-figured, and that alone would make me fall head over heels in love with Casey Claybourne.On top of this the love scenes are nothing less than inspired. I actually have them underlined for the occasional erotic pick-me-up or simply to make me feel good about my own body.The Cons: It pains me to admit that the author's writing style is weak and wishy washy. The character developement, as fascinating as the characters were, was especially bad in the case of Cat, the hero. In addition, the relationship between the two stars of the book was shallow. The boundless potential of this book, in both it's characters and plot line, fizzled. To be fair, it would be difficult to pack these larger-than-life characters into a regularly sized romance novel.Regardless, it's on my top bookshelf proudly displayed and it was worth the price and time to read, so I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Cat and the Countess","review":"Heroine: plump/voluptuousA desperate Elizabeth Langham is harboring a terrible secret. She's possessed of a nervous tendency towards relieving the people around her of their personal effects. Should the ton ever find out, her chances at landing her suitor, a bland yet wealthy Marquis, will become nil. Worse still, she and her young son will be drummed out of polite society completely.A trip to the stationer's to buy a pen set for her darling offspring, before he leaves home to attend a young gentleman's school in the countryside, has Elizabeth feeling particularly agitated. On this outing she \\"pinches\\" a bit more than just a trinket, she also pats down the well-formed backside of the tall man in line before her!Visiting American Wildcat MacInnes realizes too late that his cherished bandolier bag has gone missing, and is certain the soft gentlewoman from the stationer's knows something about it. But of what use would such a thing be to a genteel women like that? The handsome Lenape warrior quickly becomes convinced that like the other aristocratic lovelies he's encountered, Elizabeth is just trying to lay the foundation for a tryst with him.Wildcat searches out the pale beauty, bent both on retrieving his prized possession as well as taking the lady up on her offer. But he never expected their brief liaison to soften his stoic heart, and soon finds himself willing to do anything for Elizabeth, even if it means going to Newgate prison in her stead!What worked for me:Elizabeth's \\"sticky fingers\\" issue was very unusual and made for some creative plot twists. The opening in particular was an excellent example of this, employing both a bit of humor and a hint of sensuality in the way Elizabeth picked Cat's pocket.Size-wise Elizabeth was quite plump and had no qualms about it other than the pain of trying to keep her stays laced as tightly as possible.What didn't work for me:Elizabeth was sweet, but a bit on the dependent side, which really didn't make much sense given her history. (I also didn't particularly care for her other dangerous secret, and found it difficult to see how she managed to move about in Society, even with an Earl on her arm.)I couldn't quite get into Wildcat either. His character was a bit underdeveloped and just didn't ring true to me, or at least his experiences in London didn't. A 6'9\\" Lenape brave, even if he's half Scot, doesn't seem likely to be accepted by the haute ton.And how did Elizabeth's best friend and almost sister-in-law Valerie have the opportunity to get herself into so much trouble? You would have thought that despite her ripe old age of twenty-two, Valerie's dragon of a mother would have been keeping her gimlet eye on her wild daughter at all times. Or at least would have employed a duenna who would have kept her in line...Another case of tumbling into bed before a declaration of love...Overall:A solid read for fans of sensual Regency-settings or Native American heroes.Warning: there are some steamy scenes in this book..."},{"Title":"Cat and the Countess","review":"This was my first Ms. Claybourne book. I found Elizabeth's &quot;Vice&quot; to be original and quirky, and her hero to be strong and sexy. But the best part was that Elizabeth wasn't your typical Barbie Doll figure that are in most books. She was a normal, full figured woman with flaws like the rest of us. And she manages to snare a hunky Half Indian with a personality any woman would love. If you love a fast paced, wonderful read, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Cat and the Countess","review":"I picked up this book because of the cute cover. I kept reading to see how the story could ever end happily with these odd characters staying true to themselves. It did end happily for all concerned.This is just average little Regency romance with a couple of little twists. The heroine is a kleptomaniac. The hero is a Native American/Scottish in full native costume. In London, this draws a few stares &amp; causes him a few problems along the way. The two meet because she tries to pickpocket him. How do an heiress &amp; a man from a totally different culture &amp; part of the world melt their worlds together? That is what I wanted to find out...."},{"Title":"Moving The Mountain - The Women's Movement In America Since 1960","review":"This was the first text on women's history that I read back in Junior high, and I absolutely loved it. Until this point, I dod not realize how complex and developed the women's movement had become by the 1970's. Being born in 1979, I always assumed that feminism was perpetually around.Since it's a safe bet there are more young people (and future generations) who will also believe that way, this book should be required reading for anybody who wants to learn how the women's movement really impacted America. Unfortunately, women's histrpy is underrepresented in public schools and we are paying dearly for the gap in knowllege.My only reservation about this book, is that there are no pictures of the various protests and deomstrations in the 1960's and 1970's. Considering feminism:the career was not really feasabile until the 1980's (monetary and logistic reasons)it neverless would be inspiring to see women (and men) changing the system with what they did have.

The author does a great job of bringing you back to that-&quot;so in lust you could die&quot; feeling as well as the angst of trying not to fall in love and risk heartache.I will look for more of Gerri Hill's books. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"One Summer Night is a first novel for Gerri Hill and is a promising beginning. Her romantic encounters are powerfully erotic and may prompt many readers to return to this story. However her characterization is rather flat and the plot is thin. Some women are portrayed rather one dimensionally and Hill, however unintentionally, sometimes falls victim to using some negative stereotyping.An educated, thirty something college instructor, Johanna Marshall suffers from the loss of her parents as a child -- despite having been raised by loving grandparents who have accepted her lesbianism without strife -- and the betrayal of (in hindsight) a clearly inappropriately matched lover. For the last several years, Jo has climbed into her ivory tower and shut the door.Dragging herself out to watch friends play in a softball tourney, Jo is drawn to a ringer brought in to boost the team she supports. The former college ball player is the attractive, intelligent Kelly Sambino. The two women are drawn together by an almost overwhelming attraction and end up spending a tremendously charged night together. The next morning Jo awakes to find Kelly, who had a game to play in the morning, gone. Despite their backgrounds in writing and communication the two women prove to be very poor communicators. Almost annoyingly so. Jo, confused and embarrassed by the night's impulsively, does not go to the ball field. Thus adding to the miscommunication particularly since Kelly lives in another town.After the tournament, some of Jo's friends suggest that Kelly has a reputation as a \\"Don Juan.\\" Thus Jo returns to hide in her academic tower, though the memory of their passion remains. Fall semester brings a new faculty member to Jo's department and it's Kelly. Still interested in Jo, Kelly tries to court Jo as well as clarify their earlier miscommunication. Jo spends lots of energy trying to keep Kelly at arm's length but calls on her for solice when her grandfather dies suddenly. Kelly is the more likeable of this hit-and-miss couple, although her willingness to put up with Jo's passive-aggressive behavior is rather masochistic.Perhaps more annoying is the treatment of secondary characters. One of the few short and over weight dykes (most are lean, althetic, and beautiful) is depicted as insensative, desperate, and mean spirited with her attempts to trash Kelly to Jo in an effort to woo Jo for herself. As some of Hill's writing is quite moving, one hopes that her future novels will explore characterization and plot in a more complex manner."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This book was excellent!

When fall classes begin, Jo is as surprised as anyone to find that Kelly has been hired to teach at the same college. She denies her attraction and refuses to be swayed by Kelly's considerable charm, vowing never to repeat their night of passion. But Kelly insists she is not the womanizer others claim her to be. She pursues Jo, breaking down her resistance, professing her love, only to have her reputation come between them again and again. But Jo turns to Kelly in her moment of need, the stirrings of her heart stronger than the warnings of her friends. - END OF BACK COVER TEXTThis is the typical story of two emotionally-fragile women who meet and try to resist their growing attraction. However, it's told by Gerri Hill - an author who is able to make any story exciting and engaging. Here she brings us college professor Johanna Marshall - a conservative woman who doesn't do one-night-stands. One summer day while watching her friends play softball, she notices a new player - Kelly Sambino - who owns the field with her skill. After going out with the team for after-game eats and drinks, Jo finds herself frantically enjoying Kelly in bed.Later, Jo is surprised to find Kelly teaching a class at her college. Although the athlete tries to get to know Jo better, the professor resists. The attraction is too strong to ignore and Jo is torn between the woman in front of her and the reputation she brings in tow. Something doesn't add up for Jo and Kelly doesn't give up easily.There are many scenes in this book the reader doesn't expect, many pairings that don't make sense on the surface, and a lot of angst for the protagonists. Hill pulls this all together into a great book that will be on my shelf for many years to come."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I actually read later Gerri Hill books prior to reading this one. I can see how her work improved. But in saying that, I really liked One Summer Night. It's fun, sexy reading! And definitely a book that you'll open up to the \\"good\\" pages to reread. Gerri Hill is definitely a \\"go to\\" for entertaining stories. I can't wait for a new book to come out."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This book is HOT! I've been reading these types of novels for a few years and there are only a few I've found so good I couldn't put them down and this is definately one of them. The love scenes are wonderful and the plot is fulfilling. Gerri Hill is extremely talented &amp; should definately write more books. One of my other favorites is &quot;Room for Love&quot; by Frankie J. Jones."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I have owned this book for two days and I have already read it twice. I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. last night reading this book, because I couldn't put it down. I was exhausted tonight, but I picked it up again and I again was engrossed. The characters were touching and real. I hope that Gerri Hill continues to write about Kelly and Jo!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I am so happy I bought this book, it was my first lesbian novel but definitely not the last. I loved both characters especially Kelly Sambino whom I thought was great and very understanding about the whole situation with Jo. I think the way she stayed by Jo\`s side even when she rejected her so many times was just amazing.The story was awesome!! The sex was just hot, hot, hot! the minute I finished it I borrowed it to my girlfriend. I think Gerri Hill wrote a wonderful book..."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"One Summer Night is a story of Jo Marshall a lecturer who, although constantly being pushed by friends to 'get out more' is wary of falling in love due to having her heart broken. Enter Kelly a stunning looking woman from out of town to join some of Jo's friends for a softball tournament. Lots of lust, lots of sex and of course a happy ending. I enjoyed this book so much that 2 days after I read it I picked it up and re-read it."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I was trully touched by this book. I laughed, I cried, and I was left craving more. I'm not a book reader at all, but once I started reading this book, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down, and I didn't until the very last word even though it was 3:30 in the morning.Being that the story took place in my home state made it all the better for me. No one but a Texan can trully understand a Texas Summer. ;)I was able to identify with Jo from the start. She so desperately wanted to love Kelly, but wouldn't allow herself, until she couldn't take it any longer. I had a young woman persue me just like Kelly did Jo. I finally submitted to her a couple months ago, and they have been the happiest of my life. When I was done with the book, I immediately sent her an e-mail and told her that I loved her.This is a book that I will cherish for a long time. You will love reading it. Ohhh... and the love-making scenes were HOT! How Ms. Hill was able to capture the desire before the actual love-making scenes is beyond me. I was just as hot as Kelly and Jo were. And how she described the scenes is just amazing. She made it so soft, slow, and sensual. It wasn't all raw and fast. I loved it. And you will, too."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"this is the first lesbian romance novel i've read. wow, a fanastic book that kept me on toes that i nearly finished it in two days.to be honest, i'm heterosexual yet i still find this book as one of the great romance novels ever."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"loved it loved it loved it. great writer, wonderfull book! I've read it three times now, lovely read."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"HOT,HOT,HOT. Loved the ending... felt like I was reading my life story. I am Kelley."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"When Jo saw Kelly it was love at first sight! I could not put this book down and my girlfriend read it faster than I did. We absolutely thought this book was really good. I really felt close to the characters not only because it was set in Texas (which is where I am from) but because to me that is how attraction is. You see someone you can't take your eyes off! It's intense passion and the author, Gerri Hill gives you plenty!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Romantic story of how Jo hesitates to get into a relationship with a steamy young woman whose feelings for her are more than Jo can manage. I found the story a little slow and \\"going around in circles\\": repetitions of how Jo was hurt by her ex Nancy, how she is lonely, has very few friends, and keeps rejecting a persistent Kelly. Not the best lesbian love story out there."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This is the first Lesbian novel I've read. WOW, I couldn't put it down. One warning: You'll never want to read a novel about straight couples again :)!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I have to admit One Summer Night was a page turner, no doubt it kept me interested. The one thing I didn't like is the characters. Jo and Kelly were shallow and I didn't have any feelings for them. I thought that they lacked real love, all they had in common was they enjoyed making love. Making love is good when its between two people who really love each other, and Kelly and Jo didn't. They didn't have time to grow into their relationship, it was based on how many times they made love, and they made love a lot. Never saw so many love scenes in my life, after a while it was typical of them. I didn't find this a true love story at all."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I found that I liked Johanna and Kelly very much. The story held my attention quite well. This was an easy read. That is until I got to the love scenes. I found that the run-on sentences connected with &quot;and&quot; broke my concentration enough that I was editing it in my head and losing the thread of Hill's narration, as well as the intensity of the love scenes. Get this one second-hand or borrow a friend's."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This book was a very easy one sitting read. Though you can tell the author is or was not a softball player with some of the descriptions, but the books love story over shadowed the obvious. The characters are well developed and the love scene descriptions are good. Some other parts of the book brought tears to my eyes but the ending was not sad."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I love this book!! Absolutely a keeper!! The length of time it for the book to get to me was very short. I am very satisfied"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Johanna Marshall finally caves in and goes to watch her friends play in a softball tournament. Her friends have brought in a ringer, which is ringing all of Johanna's bells.Kelley Sambino knows she's ringing Johanna's bells, but can't seem to get close to her. If it wasn't bad enough Kelley has a reputation of being a womanizer, but as the fall semester starts, she finds herself working in the same department as Johanna at the college.Pick up the book and walk the hall of a romantic academia."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This is the fourth book by this author I have read (Gulf Breeze, Sierra City and Dawn of Change were all super). This is a wonderfully paced book that I read in two days. The love scenes were very sexy and were perfectly plotted into the novel, each one different and advanced the story in some way.I especially liked seeing characters that weren't perfect. Jo is lucky that Kelly stuck around for the long haul. Jo made a number of bad judgement errors and doesn't always treat Kelly or her own friends nicely.Very Entertaining. Don't miss this book.This is from the publishers site - Embarrassed after their night of passion, Jo hopes to never see Kelly Sambino again, especially when friends warn her of Kelly's reputation as a runaround. When fall classes begin, Jo is as surprised as anyone to find Kelly has been hired to teach at the same college. She denies the attraction and refuses to be swayed by Kelly's considerable charm, vowing never to repeat her summer indiscretion. Kelly insists she is not the womanizer others claim. She pursues Jo, breaking down her resistance and professing her love, only to have her reputation come between them again. In a moment of need, Jo turns to Kelly, accepting the physical comfort Kelly offers, while still denying her own heart . . . denying the love that has grown between them."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I love this book! The characters felt so real and relatable. Hill's writing kept the plot interesting and sexy. I couldn't put it down until i was done!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Fun and light with lots of sexy tension between the two main characters.

The two lead characters are sizzling together, the romance is hot, and the plot is a surefire winner! Nice job by this firstimer author..."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Wow! An amazing book and very true to real life! A must read. So much passion. Thank you for such an amazing story - to find that love affair - I can only wish."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This book is certainly hot. Gerri Hill generates a lot of steam and delivers a lot of what we all seem like in our romances. Definitely pages to re-read.The plot, however, is weak. Girl is seduced by a reputed Lothario and vows no repeats, but turns to her seducer for succor in a moment of crisis. Misunderstandings and gossip abound. It's not cutting edge and I hope that Hill's next book (which I will eagerly look for) has more stretch in the plotting."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Jo and Kelly share one night of unbridled passion - something which Jo has never done in her life. She vows never to do so again and feels safe considering that Kelly lives out of town. She has been hurt by a former relationship and has vowed to keep her heart to herself. In addition, some &quot;friends&quot;, especially one who wants Jo for herself trash Kelly as a womanizer. Imagine Jo's surprise when Kelly is hired as a teacher at her school. Kelly trys to reach out to Jo but Jo is afraid and rebuffs her. Finally, a personal tragedy brings the two together and Jo no longer believes the stories she has heard about Kelly;however, she still can't bring herself to tell Kelly she loves her even though in her heart, she knows she does. Fortunately, Jo awakens before she loses Kelly forever and &quot;One Summer Night&quot; will turn into a lifetime of love.The erotic scenes were &quot;hot&quot; but even though Kelly didn't seem the masochistic type how she could show so much patience was unbelievable and even though Jo had been hurt, you wanted to scream at her. How much more did Kelly have to do to prove herself? It seemed that after every hurdle she passed, Jo threw another one in front of her. I fear that in real life, Jo's fear would have lost her the love of her life but fortunately this is not real life so she comes to her senses in time."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I have read more lesbian fiction than I care to admit. One Summer Night was certainly not the worst of the bunch, nor was it the best. I am not sorry I read it, nor would I have been sorry I bought it (my girlfriend actually made the purchase).I found the last 40 or so pages of the book to be tiresome. It was the same old back-and-forth, will they or won't they that every romance novel incorporates to an extent. The trouble was that I feel like Hill ran out of things to say and so she dragged out the ending with the on-again, off-again. It got old. When it came to the actual end of the book, it felt rushed to me.Still, I found the characters to be enjoyable, the scenarios realistic, and it was a quick, easy read."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I would have to say that this novel is totally based on true love! the story line was not at all boring or long winded, it portrayed two different lives and not once did it show the straggles of love as an issue. I recommend this book to anyone who has a love at heart - and who will not let there love disappear.Great story loved it! Just wonder what happens now to Kelly and Jo after there trip."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"as usual,gerri hill does not disappoint her reader-all and more.such cool escapism at an equally cool price.buy the book,y'all!"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"This is clearly one of Gerri's early works. Fortunately, the author has grown in her craft, learning to develop her characters and pace plots. But what is clear, the sex scenes have always been sizzling and this was certainly no exception. If you're looking for a light read with an interesting plot and lots of great sex scenes, then this is the book. Though I personally tend to love her later work because it has the whole package, this book was still good for a nice, leisurely afternoon read."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"Johanna was betrayed by her lover three years before this story begins. She has strenously guarded her heart since then - telling herself that she was content, even happy. Then, one summer night, she met and fell for Kelly only to be told that Kelly is a womanizer much like the woman who hurt her so badly.While the characters in this book both teach college, one is a jock, the other not. How they come together is the theme of this story.The plotting on this book is thin - paper thin. But the characters, even the secondary characters, are people the reader would like to know. But after a while, you just want to shake Johanna and tell her to get over herself or find a counselor to help her resolve her fears.Hill has the talent to bring her setting - almost a character in itself - to life for the reader - in her descriptions of the heat of an Austin, Texas summer, you can almost feel the sweat beginning to form on your forehead. She can also bring you to tears in her descriptions of a dying relative.If you're new to Hill's books, do start with this one - you'll have the enjoyment of watching Hill's talents grow with each new book so that by the time you get to, say, The Killing Room, she will knock your socks off. But regardless of where you start, do not judge this writer by her early books."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I loved this book for #1:the two women in this book were actual lesbians(there was no I sleep with my bf until I met you, and now I only sleep with chicks) and #2:It was a good romance.I liked the love scenes in this book(all except the one on P.185) and I liked how Jo was afraid to have feelings Kelly but Kelly still stuck by her and didn't leave."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"I loved this book. I am quite new to reading lesbian fictions, but this has definately become my favourite to date. I couldn't put it down. That is actually the truth because I had a day off from work (I was unwell) and that morning this book arrived. I read the whole book that afternoon! Likable characters and a good plot leave you wanting more. I didn't want the story to end. Gerri Hill is an excellent writer and I suggest her and her books to anyone. Especially those at the beginning of reading this genre."},{"Title":"One Summer Night","review":"one word.......fabulous! Great story line....great sex! Hot!

In a nicely scattered array of chapters, DeLuca poses his argument that image events can do things (make change) while also being appropriated and rendered inert in various ways. Reading this book, one can only wonder how it would have been changed if the anti-WTO protests of N30, 1999 would have been considered -- but that is not a shortcoming: the book is thorough and very well written. Great scholarship!"},{"Title":"Image Politics: The New Rhetoric of Environmental Activism","review":"Through a plethora of filters including cultural studies, rhetoric, political economy, postmodernism, critical studies, media studies, activism, and environmental studies, DeLuca strongly introduces the image event, an ideograph of profound political and social implications. The author explores these image events through the tactics and strategies of radical environmental and environmental justice groups. Expertly, he deconstructs the notion of a public sphere, as grounded in today's televisual mass mediated society. Rebuffing an ideal Habermassian public sphere in which all parties and sides can equally and civilly debate issues of any interest, DeLuca questions whether all individuals are welcome to enter into that debate, a debate which today occurs in the mass media. Looking at four nonviolent environmental and environmental justice groups, DeLuca argues that the success of their protests against hegemonic forces now lies in the image event itself rather than the immediate cessation of the offense in question. Success comes about through a direct action: Forcing people (audiences) out of comfortable ignorance into a questioning of the status quo (pp. 1-3). The violent counterresponses (pp. 8-9) from the corporations and governments being protested, in light of the failed (inability to stop the present offense) direct actions by the environmental groups, underscores the author's contention of the redefinition of success. Through this challenge of the mainstream discourse (industrialism and progress) (p. 6), the direct actions of the groups DeLuca analyzes become symbolically charged, expected to fail in immediate terms. Success instead comes through increased visibility and public support. By challenging the legitimacy of the establishment&quot; (p. 15), the groups are, according to DeLuca, considering &quot;the implications for rhetoric of extralinguistic confrontational activities&quot; (p. 15). To critical rhetorical scholars, DeLuca becomes one of the vanguards who asserts that the visual realm, which has for too long been ignored by the field, is not only as important, but more so than spoken or written rhetoric in the political public sphere. Through this analysis, DeLuca explores how radical environmental groups are reconstituting the identity of the dominant culture (p. 16) rather than forming their own. In conclusion, this work is of great importance to the academy, especially the field of rhetoric. DeLuca's book begins to fill the dearth of work on media and the environment. It begins anew the research of social movements in this postmodern era. Importantly, it gifts the activist groups legitimacy and credence, which does have the potential to greater effect social change, an ideal conditional for every work in the academy."},{"Title":"GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE AND SCHOLASTICISM","review":"This book is a sublime example of scholarship in its highest form. That being said it is not a book for the casual reader. Panofsky does not insult your intelligence but expects you to think. This book would be an excellent addition, indeed an mandatory one, for any library of history. I would also recommend this book to anyone studying the 12th-13th centuries. I have read and re-read this book again and again soaking up Panofsky's prose and relishing his intensity of thought regarding a shadowy period in our history. It is a mindopener to the mystery of why gothic architecture looks like it does."},{"Title":"GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE AND SCHOLASTICISM","review":"The book was in good condition. It took a while to get here though..."},{"Title":"Divide and rule","review":"This is one of those books that will haunt you forever. It's not exactly a laugh a minute - if you like your fiction up-beat and your endings joyful this is not the book for you. It makes you think, it makes me cry every time I read it. Being by Jan Mark it is, of course, exceptionally well-written - her (pre-industrial) world is totally believable as are the characters. The story concerns Hanno, a thoughtful, gentle, honest and amiable young man of 18 who is an outsider in his town because he doesn't believe in &quot;the god&quot; and choses to ignore the social norms for his class (becoming a boatman rather than taking up a more respectable trade like his brother Ivo). To his shock he is chosen to serve as &quot;The Shepherd&quot; for a year at the temple, acting as the powerless figurehead of the religious rites. However, the devotion of the townspeople is dwindling rapidly and the power-hungry &quot;Dwellers&quot; in the temple decide something must be done... Over the course of the book Hanno becomes more and more the helpless pawn of the temple system and, as the year wears on, he is gradually stripped of everything - right down to his identity. It's a chilling and appalling story and the end left me shaking the first time I read it, but it's also one of the most rewarding books you'll ever come across."},{"Title":"Divide and rule","review":"Jan Mark has never been afraid to tackle big issues in her award-winning novels and short story collections. This early novel takes on one of the biggest issues of all, the inherently evil nature of organized religion--- a hard fact citizens of the US currently are having their noses rubbed against almost daily.Mark's protagonist, Hanno, lives in what might well be Middle Earth... clearly England, but in no known time period. The town he lives in is dominated by a huge Temple, which every year choses a young man to be the \\"Shepherd,\\" a living link between ordinary men and a distant, silent god. Hanno is keeping secret his deteriorating eyesight, by avoiding the family business of pottery and working as a river boatman. Despite his total disbelief in the city's religion, Hanno is chosen as the new Shepherd. Over the next year he is held as a virtual prisoner within the Temple; his health and eyesight deteriorate precipitously, as he is mentally and physically tortured by the Temple guards; and, coincidentally, attendance at the Temple services plummets nearly to zero. There's a harmless lunatic living in the ceremonial space with Hanno, and the mysterious death of the lunatic creates a new religious cult which is immediately incorporated within the Temple's teachings, causing a huge revival of public interest in religion and attendance at Temple services... all according to someone's plan.All truth is in The Book, which sits chained to an immobile lectern by the Temple altar. But Hanno makes a horrifying discovery about this handwritten document... and he also finds evidence that animal sacrifice used to be part of the Temple's ritual... so he begins to wonder if human sacrifices occurred before an animal was substituted. As the Temple rituals begin to change rapidly, to incorporate the lunatic Prophet's supposed future visions and nonexistent \\"teachings,\\" Hanno justifiably wonders if the end of his year's tenure as Shepherd will end with his own sacrifice!The novel has some defects. Hanno is a bit too helpless and passive to be a truly worthy focus for the reader's attention; and, the core teachings and internal organization of the Temple never really emerge, with even the little that is seen not making much anthropological sense to me, although this is probably a deliberate choice of the author's. My copy of the book is ex-library, and does not appear to have ever been checked out."},{"Title":"Batman: Mitefall","review":"Bob Overdog is a petty villain locked up in Arkham Asylum. When Bane attacks and blows up the Asylum, Bob manages to escape. While on the lam he meets Bat Mite who turns to him for help. His home dimension is being taken over by Bane Mite and he needs a hero. Bob becomes that hero.Action moves to Bat Mite's world and we see how Bane Mite is taking over. But while Bob manages to overcome Bane Mite and save an entire dimension, in our home dimension he dies without anyone knowing he had reformed and become a hero.To really appreciate this story you have to be able to tolerate Bat Mite and have a knowledge of the Knightfall sequence in Batman. The parallels are well done and the story manages to not be too cute. It is actually quite dark. Bob's position as the unknown hero is a classic in literature and is handled very well in this tale."},{"Title":"The Orion Nebula: Where Stars Are Born","review":"I feel a bit disappointed because i was expecting a book devoted (and specialised) at the famous ORION NEBULA and instead of that i've read a book covering general astronomy knowledge. The final taste that this book left me is that of a fair, easy-to-read book, but away from the main subject."},{"Title":"The Orion Nebula: Where Stars Are Born","review":"This relatively short book covers a lot of material on astronomy and in a very understandable and thoroughly entertaining way. Mr. O'Dell, a noted scientist who played a big role in the development of the Hubble space telescope, does a beautiful job of blending the facts and history of astronomy into this fascinating tale of the Orion Nebula.He covers some interesting history of astronomical observations and of the telescope, astrophotography and other detectors. He then goes into many details of the birth and evolution of stars from their initial gravitational collapse inside a molecular cloud to their achieving the nuclear fusion state and reaching hydrostatic equilibrium and then their long life on the main sequence. He also discuses some interesting objects such as brown dwarfs and rouge planets (star wantabes that didn't have the initial mass to ignite fusion). He has a very interesting coverage of the Hubble space telescope's history including the details of the infamous mirror problem and how it happened.As he gets into the description of the Orion Nebula itself, he covers (and documents with beautiful pictures) many of the amazing features of this relatively nearby young stellar nursery. He discusses the dominant stars such as Theta1C, the numerous proplyds, the visible shock waves and the high speed particle jets emanating from the circumstellar disks.A particularly thought provoking passage in this book was when Mr. O'Dell described what it would look like to an observer who was within the Orion Nebula Cluster - he painted a spectacular picture inside my mind!In the latter chapters, he covers topics like planet formation, the possibility of life in the universe, and how scientist are more accurately refining some of the terms of famous Drake equation.He concludes with a short description of the scientific process and how we have gained more and more understanding of our universe from the works of Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and Einstein. As each added to our knowledge, sometimes we had to let go of older ideas. As Spencer Tracy said in the movie, Inherit the Wind, \\"Progress has never been a bargain. You have to pay for it. You can have a telephone, but you lose privacy and the charm of distance. You may conquer the air, but the birds will lose their wonder and the clouds will smell of gasoline.\\" As science reveals more answers to the origin of the universe, we sometimes have to abandon the simpler (and perhaps more confronting) explanations.This is a book that will make you think, open your mind to the beauty of the cosmos, and appreciate the work of those giants on whose shoulders we stand as we gaze to the future and unravel the past of this amazing universe we inhabit."},{"Title":"The Orion Nebula: Where Stars Are Born","review":"I was a little put off at first because it seemed like this book was aimed at a more general audience than I had hoped, but I soon found it very interesting and well edited. (Something very unusual nowadays!) The Orion nubula is used as an example to explain much of the physics involved in the formation and evolution of stars and the observational techniques that are used to deduce those processes. The photographs are wonderful and the overall quality of the book (print, paper and editing) is exceptional.The level of discussion is such that both non-technical readers and those with scientific backgrounds will find it a rewarding read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Century of Nature: Twenty-One Discoveries that Changed Science and the World","review":"1953 - Watson & Crick compromised on their famous understated sentence: \\"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\\" Crick would have elaborated on this concept.

Newspaper headlines talked about \\"death rays,\\" and many suggested the laser was a \\"solution looking for a problem.\\"1963 - \\"The accepted way of writing scientific papers gives only a veiled glimpse of the heated arguments behind the measured prose, and even then these are visible only to those who know the subject well.\\" - Dan McKenzie commenting on the article that put the nail in the coffin opposing the modern theories of continental drift, plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. This article showed the \\"magnetic stripes\\" laid down in emerging molten rock (lava) as it created new ocean crust, documenting earth's polarity reversals over time. Wegener's ideas from 1915 were only partially right, and his uncongenial arguments and uncritical advocacy delayed tweaking and final acceptance of this theory for almost 50 years.1970 - One of the \\"Central Dogmas\\" of Evolution is that genetic information only goes one direction. To go backward would reek of genetic transfer of acquired traits (Lamarckism). Certain viruses, however, can copy their RNA \\"backward\\" into DNA of unsuspecting hosts, thus their name \\"Retroviruses.\\" Blocking the enzyme these viruses use (reverse transcriptase) is a major target for attacking HIV.1973 - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) should be called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). It was not because of the fear that the patients might be worried about radioactivity, where none exists. Lauterbur proposed the name \\"Zeugmatography\\" for his new technique, which also didn't catch on. His theory used the hypothesis that the orientation of the hydrogen proton might be altered by the magnetic field and used to produce 3D images of internal structures. It took a decade to work out the details.1977 - Sanger worked out the entire genome of a virus with 5375 DNA rungs. He stated \\"In considering the sequence of ThetaX174 as a functional unit...\\" \\"Until this moment, research scientists had always accepted that they must necessarily be ignorant of parts of the biological problem that they studied...then the human genome, in 2000 & 2001...someday the 'transcriptome' and the 'proteome.' One day, someone will write in a paper, 'In considering the sequence of the human body as a functional unit'...That will be the sound of the crashing palace gates.\\" - Peter Little1980 - Drosophila development had been studied to death, but 90% of them were lethal, and some Hox genes (developmental control genes) had already been identified. Nusslein-Volhard & Wieshaus instead of limiting themselves to adults, included the larvae. They painstakingly studied 40,000 matings which opened up 90% of the genome to investigation. This showed segmental control by only 15 Hox genes. Suddenly, hoards of molecular biologists appeared to work out the molecular analysis of developmental patterns. This fusion of 2 major subspecialties has shown that the basic developmental mechanism in animals is all the same, making this paper arguably the most influential paper in its field during the 2nd half of the 20th century.1985 - Fans of Crichton and his conspiracy theory book \\"State of Fear\\" should read this chapter on the discovery of the misnamed \\"ozone hole\\" in the Antarctic, and the painstaking science that worked out the chemistry of this phenomemon.1985 - Buckyballs are carbon molecules with 60 carbon atoms naturally formed along with the elements and other molecules during the life cycle of stars.

Each paper is prefaced by a short essay written by an expert in the field, outlining the background and impact of the paper. Some of these introductions cover all of the information necessary to allow someone with even a minimal high school science background to read the following paper with full understanding; others make slightly higher demands. Most of the papers are quite short. As a current reader of Nature, I can testify that Garwin et al. chose papers that are far easier to read than the average.Is this a complete history of science in the 20th century? No, it is very selective, and reflects the fact that much of the best work in theorectical physics prior to World War II appeared in German, while more recent theoretical particle physicists have favored &quot;Physical Review&quot; over &quot;Nature&quot;. You can, however, find the discovery of the neutron here, and the discovery of nuclear fission that paved the way for the atom bomb just a few years later. Plate tectonics and sea-floor spreading, pulsars and planets, DNA and T cells, buckyballs and Dolly, the cloned sheep- all are included.This book has the richness of actual science, with narrative skills of good science popularization. I am afraid I must disagree with the earlier reviewer's ciriticism. While Steven Weinberg's Foreward is a bit patronizing, the other introductions are all helpful. While some of the papers demand attention, they are all so short that they don't demand your attention for very long. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Century of Nature: Twenty-One Discoveries that Changed Science and the World","review":"During a recent lunchtime outing, I was stunned to find this book in a pile of used books at a public library! The familiar font of the word \\"nature\\" tells me the book is related to the magazine, and YES, I find the 1938 paper by Kapitza on liquid helium study. I still remember the pure joy when I first read it: both the physics experiment and the reasoning are so beautiful and elegant!For those who are really interested in science, this book is full of gems. How lucky I got it, for just $1. It's been in the *public* library for more than one year and still remains spotless, that, tells me another story."},{"Title":"A Century of Nature: Twenty-One Discoveries that Changed Science and the World","review":"I had hoped this chonicle of twenty-one discoveries would be pentetrable by the intelligent, but not specialized reader.I was disappointed.The introductions to the articles reprinted from Nature are sometimes more dense then the articles themselves - and occasionally nothing more than songs of praise for Nature having printed the article.Many of the Nature articles are simply beyond the comprehension of the reader who is untrained in the subject.Probably a fine book for those with deep scientific credentialing, but not necessarily so for the intelligent layperson.Jerry"},{"Title":"Noose of Laurels the Discovery of the No","review":"It could be said that the very pride of Americans in their country was born on the day Commander Robert E. Peary discovered the North Pole in 1909. Sadly, Peary's own secretive style and his refusal to submit his logbooks for scrutiny allowed doubts to overshadow that monumental achievement. For seventy five years those private logbooks remained locked away from public gaze and, as is always the case with those who achieve greatness, those who are unable to rise to such heights are only too willing to chip away at any well-deserved reputation until there is nothing of the meal left on which to feast.Then, 80 years later, renowned polar explorer Wally Herbert was given permission to study those previously unseen logbooks and private letters and, based on his own 30+ years of exploring the arctic, could question the great Peary at his leisure. Throughout the following years of research in which he sought the answers to the most demanding questions, Wally Herbert reached a much needed conclusion as to exactly what Peary did or did not achieve. In order to reach that final determination, Herbert had peeled away Peary's very faade to reveal him as an ordinary man with ordinary frailties. It is, however, always the ordinary man who is able to achieve greatness.In putting together his research and findings into this excellent and most readable book, Herbert has provided the reader with an historic work greater than a work of fiction.NM"},{"Title":"The Cineverse Cycle","review":"The cycle is a comedy /fantasy /sci-fi series. If you are not into that sort of book, I really can't recommend it. The actual premise of the cycle is fairly absurd. The author at least had the good sense not to try and explain it in detail. Once you accept the premise you can quickly get into the story, which is also amusingly absurd. The author did not take the plot seriously either, so it does come across well in a B-movie sort of way. Character development is barley detectible and only useful for comedic device. Some of the dialog appears a bit contrived, but some of the imagery is well described and will stick in your mind for a long time - this is both a good thing and a bad thing depending on which scene comes to mind.Slaves of the Volcano God is the first book and lays the foundation well. The characters are introduced, the plot is hinted at, subplots are introduced, the powers that be are identified, and the inevitable girl being meets boy being which will eventually be complicated by an outsider theme is set. A quick read with some good chuckles - probably would not be better with beer.Bride of the Slime Monster is the second book and introduces the main plot elements, contains most of what serves as plot development, identifies the interloper in the girl being/boy being/outsider threesome, hints at where the big showdown will be, and nails down the real nature of the evil against which the heroes will have to struggle. You have to pay attention a little bit more with this one. I would recommend a nice pilsner to go along with it. If you got through Slaves, you won't be disappointed by Bride.Revenge of the Fluffy Bunnies is the action-packed, thrilling conclusion to the epic Cineverse Cycle. In this near-perfect conclusion to the cycle you find the hideout of the archenemies, the myriad of subplots come to a head supporting the main plot, the characters reach the peak of their development, the three way romance comes to crisis and is resolved, the hero lives down his demons, and of course the final confrontation between the evil and good plays out, and everyone lives happily ever after (except of course for the evil.) All in all, a good margarita or a nice sipping tequila would go well with this book.One frightening thing about the cycle is that it comes across as if it was adapted from a screenplay. The thought that this might have originally been a movie idea scares me... and I am a B-movie fan.Summary: Plot - B, character development - C, imagery - B, gratuitous use of gender - B, gratuitous use of an alien's different anatomy as a plot device - A, use of imaginary technology to accomplish some impossible feat required for the plot - B, use of bizarre and inexplicable coincidence to keep the main characters alive - B, gratuitous intercourse - F (complete lack of...), recycling overused or clich&eacute; themes from prior books along the same line - B.On a B-movie scale, a solid B. Consider reading this if you are looking for something different or if you have a rabbit fixation."},{"Title":"The Road to Happiness Is Full of Potholes","review":"I felt like Tim O Connor was sitting right next to me, talking to me. Reading this book is like having a conversation with an older, wider friend. It's an enjoyable, but not particularly memorable read. If you've read many personal development books, then you won't find anything new or remarkable in this book. It does serve as a good reminder of what you already know, but may not be applying in your life."},{"Title":"The Road to Happiness Is Full of Potholes","review":"Certainly different, I found the author's style annoying and arrogant and made the decision to put this book down half way through. I felt much better and happier after that!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns","review":"This dude knows how to write. Throughout the book, his passion, respect and sometimes joy as he describes life's adventures and the amazing people he has met permeate his writing. He brings the events to life, makes them very real.In particular, his horrific account of the death of Caryl Chessman brought tears to my eyes. How could it be that in a so-called civilised country such deaths continue? I was outraged and appalled to learn from Lapierre that of the 500 death executions since 1977, 'seventy-five concerned men and women whose innocence was proven after their death.' 75 innocent people killed! Mon dieu! Er no, actually -- I've since found out from various anti-death penalty web sites that in fact 75 (or now around 85) people were released (ALIVE) from death row after their innocence was proven. The distinction, I think, is rather important!He also claims that 'California has remained faithful to its gas chambers' as a manner of execution. As far as I could find out from various government and anti-death penalty web sites, California uses primarily, if not solely, lethal injection to dispose of its unwanted citizens.Lapierre's account of 'tarantulas as hairy as apes' in Africa would excite ecologists -- who perhaps foolishly think wild tarantulas exist only in the Americas -- as much as his (unfortunately mistaken) sighting of a rhinoceros excited his host in the Ivory Coast.Characterising Mohatma Gandhi with temporal accuracy, if somewhat dismissively, as 'an elderly half-naked Indian...living in poverty' no doubt adds credence to his amazement at the 'miraculous alchemy' and mutual understanding that existed between Gandhi and Lord Mountbatten. But is it really so miraculous when one considers that the middle-class Gandhi had studied for and received a law degree from London University and practiced as a barrister in South Africa for 20 years? Is it so miraculous that two educated men with experience in and a good understanding of each other's cultures could then understand each other?Obviously any account of events is going to carry some subjectivity, like his rather derogatory characterisation of Gandhi, but it's disturbing when things presented as facts, like the huge number of innocent death row victims, are blatantly incorrect. It made me wonder how many other factual errors I'd inadvertantly absorbed as truth.Nevertheless, it is great read, lively and interesting, and his contribution to the welfare of the poorest of the poor in India goes beyond admirable. Just take the 'facts' with a grain of salt!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns","review":"1. 'A Thousand Suns', a fascinating book by Dominique Lapierre, famous author of books like \`Is Paris Burning' and \`City of Joy' takes its title from and Indian proverb that the author chanced upon during his stay in South India. It comes from (as indicated by the author) \\"Behind every cloud, there are a thousand suns\\". A perfect message for life in present day's gloomy outlook of life.2. It goes without saying that the book, which has such a beautiful and motivating title ought to be full of life energy and epitomize everything that is the very essence of meaningful life. This book actually is a byproduct, but a beautiful and useful one. It consists of 15 independent well researched real life stories, which the author encountered in the run up to doing a specific assignment mainly related to the prime characters or places related to these stories, initially as a news correspondent and later as a writer.3. At the end thus, he filed his reports / wrote his books, but the enduring beauty of life enshrined in the background of these reports / books remained. The author has really done a wonderful service to mankind by writing this book; else such beautiful pearls of human endeavor, wisdom, perseverance and enterprise would have been lost forever.4. Written in a simple style with stress on delivering the message right, the author might have not achieved perfection of narrative, but what needed to be achieved i.e. delivery of the essentials of beauty of life has been achieved with perfection.5. It is rightly said that \`make your hobby your profession and you would not have to work for a day'. It is evident from reading this book that Mr Lapierre seems to have not worked for a day but have thoroughly enjoyed this life following his passion for writing.6. All those who have faith in life and mankind and all those whose faith on these is wavering for some reasons must read this book to derive the requisite benefit."},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns","review":"The events Dominique experienced in his professional and personal life are related in a very witty and soulful manner.

He takes us across many continents and interviews many people, throwing in anecdotes about his life and interests.However what stops me giving this book a 5 star rating is the fact that I feel that some of the topics are given superficial treatment (despite the lengths of the chapters), and there is too much emphasis on the author's own involvement. Fair enough, you might say, it is his book about his experiences, but I feel it is these experiences which should take central stage.This is however only a small criticism, and it is a VERY interesting book, about interesting people in interesting times."},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns","review":"This wonderful series of adventures and relationships brings the reader into the fascinating world of Dominique Lapierre.

Anyone who has ever read &quot;City of Joy&quot; and was moved by the story of Calcutta slums will really be interested in the background stories he provides which lead the writing of the book. I was only familiar with the author through his &quot;City of Joy&quot; book but after finishing &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; I am anxious to read his other books.

He includes some of the encounters behind his joint works with Dominique Lapierre, such as his interview with Ehud Avriel, who helped Jews to escape Hitler's infernos to get to the Holy Land, and gathered together arms to help the fledgling State of Israel survive the overwhelming military force of six Arab armies who attacked the tiny state, as soon as the United Nations agreed to partition of Palestine.He also describes the starvation and misery of Jerusalem's Jewish inhabitants during the siege of that city by Arab armies intent on massacring all of Jerusalem's Jews.Some of the events described in his article about Avriel, who Lapierre was a good friend of are recorded inO Jerusalem!He also recounts his interviews with Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was instrumental in negotiating the independence of India and it's aprtition into the two states of India and Pakistan.Lapierre was with Mountbatten a few days Mountbatten's assassination by IRA terrorists in 1979.He also recounts his meetings and interviews with the men behind the assasination of Mahatma Ghandi, as result of Gandhi's favorable policies towards India's Moslems.These events form part of the bakground toFreedom at Midnight.Lapierre details his relationship with the man who was executed for somebody else's crimes, Caryl Chessman, and Chessman's campaign from prison against the death penalty.He describes the refusal by General Dieter Von Choltitz refusal to obey Hitler's orders to completley destroy Paris but ignores the evidence that Von Choltitz had been involved in the massacre of Jews in Russia.He also writes of his interview with the evil terrorist murderer Kozo Okamoto from the Japanese Red Army Faction, who together with two other psychopathic Communist terrorists murdered 26 Puerto Rican pilgrims in 1972.Interesting that even then those hellbent on murder and destruction chose Israel as their first target for butchery.But the world made a lot more sense then, as most the world reviled these horrible terrorists acts, unlike the macabre Orwellian nightmare we are living through today, were so much of the world supports terror against the tiny nation of Israel.Interesting even that the first tHe also writes of his encounters with the great conservationist Rafael Matta in the Ivory Coast, and the authoir's first car and how he acquired the foal of a prize horse in San Tropez France, by the name of Preferido.Most touching is Lapierre's recounting of work in Calcutta, which the author was involved in with Indian leper and other orphan childrenLapierre donates half of his royalties to the foundation set up to save these childrenIt is heartbreaking to read of their plight and uplifting to read of their joy in life despite their suffering and death all around them.

Anna born free, outside of slavery. A woman destined to live and love, but for her she chose a husband that could not give her all of himself. Ottillie a 1/2 Jewish & 1/2 Christian woman, not american is also free, well it depends how you describe freedom. These 2 women have some things in common and they don't realize it. Anna content on being a good wife, a good mother, provider is trapped by the vows of marriage and the vows of her heart. Anna is scholastically uneducated, but far more intelligent than she is recognized for. She is a strong independent, God fearing Black woman with morals. Ottillie is a scholastically very well educated and intelligent, White woman, she has found a desire love for a runaway slave. She believes she is so intelligent and his equal and she convinces him that she is more suitable for him than his own wife. The question here is does she trap this man, or is she the one that is caught? The author has shown 2 women involved with one high profiled man in society and who has an agenda to make a change in the world. Jewell Parker Rhodes takes you inside the house, the bedroom the minds of Anna Murray Douglass, Ottillie Assing, Frederick Bailey Douglass. You learn that even with no formal education, Anna Murray Douglass is very intelligent. Ottillie Assing with her formal education and ability to speak many languages and being a white woman, in all actuality is not very smart. Frederick Douglass has forgotten or never knew Anna Murray. Reading this novel, please have an open mind and read it by placing yourself in the time of this era. I give it 5 stars because it is well written."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"When I looked for a scintilla of evidence of the diaries and quotes attributed to Attilie, or an iota of historical documentation to substantiate a romantic relationship between Douglass, all I found was an alleged fact that she left her valueless estate to him.

Except for the short visits which left her pregnant. I can actually see why she wouldn't want to learn to read, she wanted to at first because she admired Freddy, but later on she despised it.

It is an imaginary journey through the author's delightful style into the minds of people we can never know. If you must have true history, there are some things concocted for the mere pleasure of story. BUT, if you want delicious reading, thoughtful insight, memorable characters, this book is a treasure. I found Anna to be not whiny but torn by her own sense of right, her desire for happiness and her acceptance of reality. Ottilie was brazen and a snob, typical of the bourgeoisie of any age, who believe that because they grew up wealthy, pampered and indulged, the world owes them continual pampering and indulgence of any flight of fancy... on top of that, the &quot;world&quot; owes everybody pampering and indulgence, without realizing it is the Annas of the earth that sustain us all and make life tolerable. Douglass himself is portrayed as bigger than life, the kind of man who can do dynamic things both good and evil. He seems true of mind as so many in public life, where the bounds of right and wrong cross and fade in trying to solve the &quot;big&quot; questions of humanity. In pursuit of his goal and by the grace of his own unmeasurable ego, he walks on some plane above everyone in his life, never seeing them as anything but stepping stones and stumbling blocks. We can't know if the man was truly of that disposition, but judging from others of that ilk, it seems plausible. Wonderful work.

Her research is nearly flawless, attest to her citations at the end of the book. Her added fiction builds a passionate, emotional story.\\"Douglass' Women\\" is about two very different women loving the same strong, ex-slave, abolitionist, a writer. I believe Ms. Rhodes knew Frederick Douglass had to be included in the story to understand his women. He is an escaped slave afraid of being enslaved again, even by the women in his life. Consequently, he juggles them, accepting their love with little emotional return.Anna Murray Douglass is a free black woman. She's the stronger of the two women, the realist. She gives her hard-earned money to Freddy to escape his slave master. He later marries her. Anna says Freddy is \\"Samson-man, standing, perched on the edge of his horizon.\\" She does not like the name Frederick Bailey Douglass, feels it beyond her as his mate. Anna is steadfast in her loyalty and self-confidence and suffers his infidelity.Ottilie Assing, a German-Jewish woman, teaches him to read and write, and uses his ego and hatred of bondage to keep him near. He becomes Frederick to Ottilie. She is indispensable with her money and time helping him pursue his career. She clearly has a way out of the mistress role, but is too much of a romantic in love to accept the reality of her situation.Both women suffer the pains of unreciprocated love, heartache from their \\"great man.\\" Anna says, \\"Freddy never really learned to love.\\"I can only conclude that Frederick, husband, lover, and abolitionist is mentally disturbed as a result of his years as a slave. Freedom is the only thing he seems to focus on. This proves to create both bad and good events in his life. Nevertheless, he needs sexual love, takes it wherever he can get it, when he wants it. Yet, it does not interfere with his plans, in spite of the fact that he fathers five children with Anna.Every page kept me immersed, kept me wondering what next. Jewell Parker Rhodes penned vivid fictional pictures of strong characters, which reflects her ability to understand humankind. It left me wanting to learn more about Douglass, in his words. What an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"A friend recommended this book and I am glad I decided to read it.

I wish there were more!"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"In this wonderful piece of work, Ms. Rhodes takes a look at a less familiar aspect of Frederick Douglass's life...that of the personal. Based on historical fact, Ms. Rhodes weaves the tale of Anna Murray--a free woman of color who meets the strapping young slave in Baltimore, and funds his escape to freedom in the North. As promised, he sends for her; they marry and she is soon pregnant with the first of their many children. Upon arrival in the town of New Bedford, Douglass aligns himself with White abolitionists and soon becomes known for being a great writer and orator. It is during these activities that he meets the German Ottilie Assing. Educated, well-bred, and Jewish, the blonde-haired Ms. Assing is fascinated by Frederick Douglass; she soon finds herself falling in love and beginning a decades long affair with the famous abolitionist.Steeped in historical fact, this novel takes an in-depth look at Frederick Douglass the man--and his relationships with the two main women in his life; his wife and his mistress. Undoubtedly invaluable to the cause of abolition, the story drives home that beneath it all Frederick Douglass remains simply a man--with all of the frailties and imperfections that make him thus.DYB"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"The author was able to make words become pictures.

This was ingenious."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"Frederick Douglass, known to many as an escaped slave that spoke on the injustice of slavery and worked with abolitionists to stop slavery, is PORTRAYED as a self-centered man - remember this is fiction. For Douglass, the women in his life are good for sex, bearing children to proudly carry the Douglass name, working on his cause, and taking care of the house. His egocentricity grows as he becomes more popular around the world; building a man who loves nothing more than the cause for which he's fighting.Douglass' Women is a novel about the love between Frederick Douglass and his free, uneducated Black wife, Anna and the love between him and his educated, well-to-do, German mistress, Ottilie Assing. Though the novel is fiction, it uses actual letters from Douglass, Ottilie, and Rosetta (Douglass' daughter) as preludes to each section in the book.The author, Jewell Parker Rhodes, makes great use of the letters that serve as a foundation for the book. The reader's journey begins with the slave, Frederick Bailey, meeting Anna Murray then moves on to the escaped slave activist renamed as, Frederick Douglass, meeting Ottilie Assing and ends with the death of each woman. The book alternates between Anna and Ottilie giving her perception of Douglass' interaction with her, the other woman, and his work.Throughout the book each woman states their belief of love, for Anna \\"love be true\\", for Ottilie \\"love be free\\". Ironic for both women Frederick Douglass denied true love to Anna by committing adultery with Ottilie and denied free love to Ottilie by sharing himself with her only when appropriate for him.Douglass' Women is an intriguing work of fiction, based on real people that shaped African American history. The key word is fiction, so of course there are drawbacks that I found in the story that I was able to overcome as I read more. First, I was a bit annoyed by Anna's grammar and her understanding about the world, but I quickly realize that Anna just enjoyed the simple things in life. For her to meet and become Mrs. Frederick Douglass was far larger than she anticipated when she first met the slave. Also, I thought Ottilie's forwardness and seduction of Douglass, along with their sexual escapades, was a bit stereotypical. Despite that, Rhodes did a remarkable job at showing how two distinct women in love can have the same outcome.Along with Douglass, the main characters include:Anna Murray Douglass - Douglass' wife who he refers to as \\"a black log\\"; though born free, she's illiterate with no desire to learn to read; she's easily fulfilled by a life where she can care for her man, bear healthy children, and maintain a clean and happy home; understanding of love = love be trueOttilie Assing - Douglass' mistress with European features (blond hair and blue eyes) which she uses to her advantage as necessary; determined and knows what she wants; well-educated artist and editor, but nave to think education and intelligence makes everyone equal and the world will accept it; understanding of love = love is freeOther important characters:Mam - Anna's mother; teaches Anna that love is shown in the \\"little things\\" that people do, say, and giveOluwand - slave girl that \\"escapes\\" as Ottilie watches on; despite the women being opposites during this era, they choose the same means of escape to leave a man that will never show love in returnRosetta Douglass - Anna and Freddy's oldest daughter; taught by her father that \\"she is Frederick Douglass' daughter and she should not embarrass him\\"; represents the balance between her parents, she has her mother's features (which she considers ugly) and is well-educated as her father desiredAnnie - Anna's youngest daughter; like her sister, she represents a balance between her parents, she has her father's features and her mother's domestic skills"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"In her latest novel, Jewell Parker Rhodes gives a voice to the woman who was Frederick Douglass' first wife, Anna--- the wife he referred to as \\"an old black log.\\" She wanted to know who was this woman and what role she played in his life. Anna is enamored of Freddy as she calls him. He is a slave working on the Baltimore docks when she meets him. A captured man in the body of a proud, fiery man struggling to break the restraints society and life has placed on him. Self-taught, intelligent, well read, he and Anna, an illiterate domestic servant conspire for his freedom.Freddy is everything to Anna and she risks all to be with this handsome man. She comes to the marriage giving everything she possesses both financially and emotionally, older than he, and a little overweight. She realizes that his abolitionist friends and others think she is not fitting as his wife and then there is Otillie. Otillie is a German Jewess from Europe who is well traveled and educated, blonde, beautiful, slim, and white and she wants Anna's husband. She too risks everything, including her reputation to be with the man she loves------ despite the fact he is married.I had the pleasure of hearing Parker Rhodes read from her book as she put me in the heads of both Anna and Otillie. I felt Anna's pain as she grappled with being married to a man larger than life, adored by many, both black and white, hunted by slave catchers, and knowing she could never make him completely happy. Though Otillie was an unlikable character--- she scoffed as Anna's plain looks and unsophisticated ways--- it was difficult to place her in the role of villain at times because she was also a pawn in Douglass game as Anna was. In this fictionalized account of the women who loved him, Douglass is seen as no more or no less than a man. Yes, he was a great orator, gifted writer, statesmen, and abolitionist but still, just a man, albeit a black man with all the foibles and warts of any other man. An entertaining story this book was one of my top ten favorite books of 2002 and will go on my list of all-time favorites.

She stretches the imagination by exploring the psyche of Anna, a free woman of color, who loves Douglass almost to a fault and Ottilie Assing, a European, free-spirit who is attracted to the polished and principled Douglass.The novel, told in chronological alternating chapter format, provides the reader a glimpse into the character and upbringing of each woman. Anna is a quiet, hardworking homemaker, devoted wife and mother who clings to the belief that love conquers all. She has a strong sense of family and has witnessed unconditional love between her parents and siblings. Her one wish is to have the same love returned to her from Douglass. Unfortunately, Douglass, a self-taught ex-slave, has been elevated to a level of celebrity and lifestyle that pushes Anna to the background where she reluctantly finds comfort. While her husband is recognized as a skilled orator and accomplished author, Anna is regarded as a recluse and intentionally remains illiterate (despite Douglass' urging otherwise) which creates an erudite chasm between them that widens as the years progress. Ottilie Assing, a genteel woman of German-Jewish ancestry, works as Douglass' interpreter. She fills the intellectual void and accompanies Douglass on many engagements. They grow fond of each other and a lifetime love affair begins.Rhodes writes very vividly so the reader clearly understands the similarities, differences, jealousy, envy, and anger each woman feels toward each other and Douglass. Rhodes also parallels the societal prejudices of Jews in Europe to Africans in America which justifies Ottilie's attraction to Abolitionist views. She also subtly touches the issues surrounding interracial relationships through her character's dialogue and thoughts. Although this is a work of historical fiction, she carefully follows the actual timeframe of events to effortlessly blend in factual people, places, and excerpts from speeches, which lends credibility to the novel. From a literary standpoint, her use of the \\"water-death-freedom\\" symbolism was handled expertly and was used as the unifying thread for both women's tales. This reader believes that fans of Rhodes will not be disappointed; this is a good story from an accomplished author!Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO Bookclub, The Nubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"As president of the New Bedford Historical Society and steward of the first free home of Frederick and Anna Douglass, I am appalled at the errors in the facts contained in this book..starting with the date they met to the name of the city that embraced them.Anna married Frederick and travelled to New Bedford in 1838 and was NOT pregnant. They were guests of black abolitionist Nathan and Polly Johnson in New Bedford, not Bedford, and remained in NB until 1842 or 1843,as documented by City records.When married in NY by Pennigton, Garrison was not present. They had not even met...These are just a few of the errors in the beginning of this book. I realize this is not a text book but to dishonor the memories of Anna and Frederick Douglass to sell books is unacceptable"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"Jewell Parker Rhodes Douglass' Women Book Reviewby Jeanine J. JonesDr. Jewell Parker Rhodes takes us to new heights as she reveals the infidelities of a prominent Black abolitionist of the 1800's; we all know him as the late great Frederick Douglass. In her historical fiction novel Douglass' Women, Rhodes brings the stories of two women to life. Anna Murray Douglass is a free illiterate black woman and Ottilie Assing is a well to do German-Jew woman who passed as a white woman. Anna is the wife of the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass and Ottillie Assing is his mistress.Although as different as night and day, these two women both come from dual parent, loving family house holds, both doubt Douglass' faith in God, and the ultimate similarity they share is an undying love for Fredrick Bailey Douglass. Ironically, Douglass does not share that same love with his loyal wife and seducing mistress even though they were both very instrumental in his reign of success, serving as domestic and secretarial staff as well as financial supporters of his escapes.Douglass never confessed his love to either of these women although they remained subservient to him and his cause, from love making, (or the lack of) to abolition work. Although in the novel, these women view Douglass as strikingly handsome, Douglass is also ever so clever. He uses both women to his economic advantage, by tapping into and taking over their monetary gain to live and carry on his life's work. Both women die tragically without ever hearing the words \\"I love you\\" from their mysterious companion. He never says nor displays any loving emotion toward either of these women. This historical patriarch continued the rest of his life in the companionship of yet another white woman whom he married.Dr. Rhodes admits that her work was inspired by anger. I must too admit that my interest in Douglass' Women was inspired by anger. Exposure to this work has intrigued me to research the Famous Abolitionist Frederick Bailey Douglass extensively as well as other black leaders.This beautifully written novel sheds new light on a man that has been deemed as one of the \\"Greats\\" of African American History and Society. His intolerance for illiteracy and his omission of acknowledging his Black counterparts who helped him in his struggle was quite surprising. Douglass refuses to accept his daughter Rosetta's choice of love when she tries to get his approval on her love, Lucias, a run away slave who could not read. This was a bit disturbing since Lucias was presented as a young Frederick Douglass.Today Black women agonize over Black men dating, marrying, and sleeping with white woman, but Dr. Rhodes shows us that history repeats itself over and over again in more ways than one: Kobe Bryant, Damon Dash, Marcus Dixon, O.J., need I say more?Whether it is modern day history or present day history in the making, there are many front men of the African American race who lose sight of their cause, because they are too busy getting dressed up for the limelight to stand with white counterparts, who could very well be looking for that token house nigger that will do whatever it takes to be in the spotlight. They neglect their families, wives, and children and begin a journey of deceit when eventually they are the ones being deceived by the master's oh, excuse me, I mean the masses or majority race. All this only to be dropped like a hot potato when Sally screams RAAAAPE! Or when he wants to break away from his white counterparts (chains) and declare independency and do his own thing.Written with a vivid countryside view, this colorful novel, black and white in text and page only, is beyond measure of gratitude. The typed written pages of imagination and reality cannot be deciphered therefore Douglass' Women are real to me, and every black woman I know. Black women all over should stand up right now wherever you are and applaud Dr. Jewell Parker Rhodes for inviting and taking us on an amazing journey, and while you are up, take a bow for being who you are, the savior of the black race. Saluting Anna Murray Douglass goes without saying."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"I came to Douglass' Women having been previously introduced to the author through her book VOODOO DREAMS and her participation in a C-Spann panel on Black Books.

I left this book with a profound empathy for both women-- one black, one white. This novel goes beyond simplistic explainations and anlayses of inter-racial love and infidelity.

Born a slave himslef, he broughthis experiences of the unjust treatment of slaves to the world's podium.But is it true what they say about &quot;behind every great man, there is a greatwoman?&quot; In Douglass' case there were two.Rhodes has dramatized the stories of Anna Murray Douglass, Mr. Douglass'first wife, whom he referred to as &quot;a black log,&quot; and his perpetual mistressOttilie Assing, a German woman. She carefully weaves the tales of these twowomen by switching perspectives, allowing the reader to hear both sides ofthe story. A stirring tale of love unrequited, love undemarcated, and loveunresolved, Douglass' Women is one of those books where you find yourselfwalking alongside the characters, sharing in their pain, in their joy, andin their longing.Rhodes says in the afterword that &quot;My intention was not to diminishDouglass but, rather, to 'lift the veil,' to 'reimagine' the emotional truthof two women loving Douglass in an era of sweeping social change.&quot; Rhodes&quot;lifted the veil&quot; on the events surrounding the Tulsa Riots in Magic City.She &quot;reimagined&quot; the life of the legendary Marie Laveau in Voodoo Dreams.The queen of fictional history has easily accomplished her goal withDouglass' Woman, another beautifully written weaving of history and legend.~Reviewed by Candace K"},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"Although I am not particularly a fan of historical fiction, the title and subject of this book intrigued me. I was in for a real treat as I felt the pain of both women who loved Douglass. I found myself unable to put this book down.Married to the illiterate woman who bought his freedom, Frederick met Ottilie Assling, a German Jew who felt her religion gave her insight into the plight of the Black American slave during one of his speeches. I wanted to choke that woman when she immediately decided that Anna wasn't a suitable wife for Frederick. I wanted to beat him with the book when he invited Ottilie to spend the summers at his home (with his wife and kids) in Rochester under the guise of translating his writings into German. I wanted to slap Ottilie when she became jealous each time Anna carried Frederick's child. And I'm not a violent person.The women have a meeting at the kitchen table, sharing their thoughts, hopes, fears and insecurities, both learning who Frederick truly loved most.Jewell Parker Rhodes has done an exceptional job of conveying the range and depth of emotions felt by both women who loved Douglas."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"Like all historical fiction, this book conveys the author's vision of what might have happened, not what actually happened. Hard historical details of the lives of Frederick Douglass's black wife and white mistress are patchy. However, the reader feels that Jewell Parker Rhodes is probably near the mark with her characterization of Douglass as an ego-driven man, handsome and charismatic, who knew how to charm women both in and out of bed. You feel the power of his first wife Anna, a black woman with every disadvantage except her inner strength, moral character, and love. And Ottilie is like many white women whose sails unfurl and mast crumbles when their man abandons them. (I used to be one of them.) This engaging story is believable as a metaphor for the truth even though it's not the literal truth. I couldn't put the book down until I'd finished it. Since then, I've searched the web for images of Anna and Ottilie without much luck. I'd love see photos of Ottilie's paintings. The author brought these women to life for me."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"More often than not, extraordinary lives are shrouded in obscurity, especially when measured against time and magnified beyond proportion if it's subjective to a historic figure for comparison. Adequate research allow us to reach across time and get a second look at abolitionist Frederick Douglass and the women behind his success..and what a story they have to tell! Jewell Parker-Rhodes' awe-inspiring account of this story is told within the pages of her new book, The Douglass' Women. Insightful and profound, we get a chance to witness the trials and tribulation of two women conveying the range and depth of emotions felt loving the same man...or reveling in the skill of the author displaying the idiosyncracies of polar opposites. These are differences underscored by the constant jockeying for position, with both of them longing for the answers of who belongs. This book is more than a story of love and passion. It gives a different view of Frederick Douglass beyond his fight for the abolition of slavery and his eloquence for public speaking. It reveals his emotions and human side to fragile interpretations of the heart, and why he made the decisions concerning the need to have these women beyond amorous liasions. A good case can be made for this novel in assessing interesting ways to look at how a man trreated love and passion, what made him do the things he did for love, and what drove him to continue when it was evident that it was not to his best interest . It's more in my opinion too, about innuendo gone awry...about the extremes present with a man hell-bent on espousing the importance of his life's work in lieu of guaranteeing matrimonial happiness at the expense of two that thrived on (his) acceptance.The book ascertains from the beginning and builds to heightened awareness of what led to Ottillie's presence, and sustained reasons why he chose to stay married. Reasons supplied in the book tell why they were as influential to him despite, if not because of, the circumstances attributing to his persona. It was written in the style of alternating perspectives of distaff Anna Murray Douglass and Ottilie Assing, with occasional reference to Frederick Douglass' daughter Rosetta. Let's look at the personas of each: Anna Douglass was a plain and simple free black who did more for Douglass than portray the duties of a wife. If not for her, Douglass would not have made it up north. She suffered in her own rebellous way, demanding answers that wasn't given to her until a fateful meeting with her antagonist, Otillie (if you can depict her as such). Ottilie Assing was a well-educated abolitionist Jew from a well-to-do family, who not only became his constant companion, speech writer, public relations guru, translator, but also his...lover. Rosetta Douglass loved and revered her father, but felt inferior to the point of always needing the wherewithal to please him, and to live up to being a child of the great Frederick Douglass. Add all of the intrigue and dialogue from both Anna and Ottilie, you get adjectives such as passion, jealousy, resentment, and envy. It's stories like this that are not always in the public domain, but may elicit a situation where in one person's mind there's reason to perpetuate an uneasy solidarity in sharing love, in an unrequited way. It's important when reading this book that you're mindful of how the author was able to weave it in a way where telling a good story is equal to the parts rendered. What these ladies poured out of their souls made this book what it is, and how parallels were were drawn for constrast. I imagined without recourse that their character makeup via how these thoughts were conveyed, gave Ms Rhodes all the ingenuity needed to make this a poignant and compelling read. She did it by allowing us a seat in each of their imaginations, displaying all of the anst, anger, and anticipation of any type of reciprocality. I felt that the rotating narratives were extremely functional in making a case for it to be a two-sided tale.When reading this novel, there are questions to be answered: Did he really love these women, and to what extent? Was his decision(s) motivated by practicality or real passion? And, how were they able to come to terms with the situation? For this reviewer, reasons were evident that the black vs. white issue was irrevelent as opposed to what each woman got out of the relationship, and what lessons were learned. It should be evident too, about how Jewell Parker-Rhodes expertly made the picture bigger by applying the canvas with enough color to paint the passions and tensions in the lives of these women, each giving reason and implied rationale to belong. Display this book among the other Duglass collectibles. Buying and reading this book is a must if you want to get yet, another view of one of history's prolific men."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"I bought this book because the entry I read in &quot;Gumbo&quot; was too good to pass up! And I wasn't dissappointed. This is a prime example of how someone's personal life doesn't necessarily affect a person's view on their political life (ex. Clinton).

Instead we get the story of pitiful Ottile, who in real life was imbalanced and probably carried on the affair in her own head rather than real life. The chapters on Anna Douglass, however are superb. This is a tender portrait of a woman who loved a man who, despite their marriage, never really was in her grasp. My only real gripe is the on the final paragraphs of the final Ottile section. I can't describe it without giving the ending away but unless this is a ghost story, the ending doesn't make sense."},{"Title":"Douglass' Women : A Novel","review":"Frederick Douglass's love life was quite complicated.

In exchange, his marries her. However, as Douglass' fame grows, he meets a German woman named Ottilie Assing. This book potrays Frederick as a scum-bag who just wanted women to be submissive to him. Anna is whiny and annoying, even as we DO feel a bit bad for her being left all alone (usually pregnant) while Frederick is away, many times with Ottilie. Ottilie is a stuck-up snob, so it's hard to care about her. I couldn't really connect with eithier woman. Nice use of putting quotes at the beginning of each chapter, but that couldn't save the book."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I am a Principal RF Engineer/ Program Manager, with a graduate degree in the field of RF / Microwave and more than a decade of experience working with it.There are some books which are classics, pozar for basic microwave, Gerd Kaiser for basic optic fibers, balanis and K D Prasad for antennas, matthaei- young-jones for filters, Steve cripps for Power amplifiers and Guilermo Gonzales for low noise amplifiers.This book treats the whole concept of desinging low noise amplifiers in a very comprehensive manner. It starts off by describing and establishing a understanding of the basics, such as S parameters, smith charts,etc. It doesnt assume anything, but strives to teach right from the begining. So it is a great reference book.Then it progessively teaches you the various steps of amplifier design, right from determining the stability considerations, design as per gain, VSWR, noise figure etc. Each successive design is more complex than the previous, and it is a wonderful experience reading and understanding each and every minute detail about tansistors, matching networks, dc bias, etc. It deals with practical transistors and components as used in the industry and it gives thorough equations and design tips for a step by step procedure towards design amelioration.The way you trade off the noise figure for VSWR and gain is a tricky business for LNA's. The way this book describes the method to do so on the smith chart with the Gain, VSWR and Noise figure circles is easy to understand and great to implement.It has become a trend these days to blindly use simulation softwares. After reading this book, you will no longer be dependent on the trial and error method of microwave circuit design. But you will be able to move with confidence towards cutting down design time, NRE, and your designs will be more robust and repeatable.I carry this one book with me whenever going on a technical meeting or conference. Be it a meeting with regards to antennas, or filters or any other microwave component or systems design issue. This book is so beautifully written you will find use for it as a reference even in these other fields.The power amplifier section is not written too well, and the author merely touches on balanced amplifiers, push pull amplifiers, etc. The chapter about oscillators is good. But this book is primarily for those who wish to learn and establish expertise on Low Noise Amplifiers.I would thoroughly recommend this book for graduate level school work, for beginners and experienced industry professionals and for hobbyists interested in learning about LNA design and creation.Regards,KL"},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"One phrase that some use to describe this text, &quot;Alot of smith-charts.&quot;The mass behind this book starts at the absolute foundations of RF circuits.

Currently, I am a graduate student in microwave engineering close to graduation. I have read many RF and EM books and by far this book is one of the best. Many textbooks provide lots of theories, equations and derivations, but few took the time to provide a lot of examples and for me examples is the easiest and fastest way to learn.This text provides a GREAT amount of examples on how to build amplifiers with discrete components and show how to do it exactly in actual planar circuits (microstrip circuits.) From biasing, stability, simultaneous matching, to low noise amplifier design is covered. This book is also happen to be one of the few books that also include bilateral amplifier design techniques. Most other microwave amplifier books only consider unilateral techniques.The last chapter is devoted to microwave frequency oscillator design technique including one and two port negative resistance and voltage controlled oscillator. Radio frequency oscillator design such as Colpitts, Hartley, and Clapp oscillator is also discussed."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I have used this for an Active class (at U-M) and found it very easy to comprehend the concepts presented. The book is not too meaty, but has plenty of detail to allow the user to follow derivations. Also covers advanced topics with some illustrative design examples. It is an excellent book that anyone doing LNAs, Oscillators or PAs needs to have to review."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This is a perfect book for power amplifier design.I used this book when I was designing a class AB power amplifier in UHF band and I found it very helpfull. this book is among the few books that includs bilateral design techniques while most of the books only deals with simpler case of unilateral design.It includes wide band and power amplifier design in a more practical way than the other books. I found the answer to my question about large signal impedance measurement methode in this book. It also includes plenty of equations concerning scattering parameters, reflection,transmission and other theoretical issues as well asoscillator design using DRO technique in last chapter."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I read the first edition, half the size, half the examples, and had to polish up on the calc. The second edition makes up for this and more. This is the definitive reference for all who are interested in microwave amplifier design with no previous experience. The Smith Chart approach follows the more academic derivations, which proves to be fast and easy. There is enough informatation to get one started on basic narrow band small signal gain, basic power configurations, and limited oscillator circuits. Buy this book before venturing on to more complex designs. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I read most of this book for a graduate-level course in electrical engineering at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. While I learned a great deal, I found the instructors supplemental materials were necessary to being able to do most of the problems, particularly those having to do with lumped element and/or waveguide impedance matching. The examples in the book were, in some cases, wrong, according to my professor (Amir Mortazawi, now a researcher at UNC) who disagreed with the solutions presented in some cases. In other cases, the examples were highly illustrative and facilitated learning well. I did not purchase this text, but checked it out of the library and renewed it so I wouldn't have to pay $91 for it, and I'm glad I didn't. I actually noticed discrepancies between my version of the text (which was a second edition) and the same second edition others purchased in the area of end-of-chapter problems. Weird, hard-reading, inconsistent, I'm told the first-edition wasn't nearly as vague, and if so, I would gladly shell out the $90 or so it would cost to have one."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I recently took an RF course that was using this book. The examples that were provided were excellent. The theory that was presented wasn't hard to follow, and if the reader was motivated enough, they can test it out using a CAD program. I myself used ADS. This is a must have book if you're going into the RF profession."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I had this book because of the graduate course I took. Because the instructor followed the book so closely so I had the chance to thoroughly read through the book.I was impressed with the examples the author gave in the book. They are all useful to show the readers how to design a microwave/RF amplification circuit through the gain circles, stability and noise circles.Overall, I highly recommend this book for those people who design the wireless circuit at the board level."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I found this text to be indispensable enough to purchase it after having used the First Edition outside of class while obtaining my MSEE. It has been a constant companion throughout my professional career.If I had to choose one text for the design and analysis of microwave amplifiers, this would definitely be the one. I especially appreciate the material added for the Second Edition.Along with a straightforward version of the standard treatment of amplifier design for noise, gain, and stability, Mr. Gonzalez touches on design for broadband and high power operation. A section on oscillator design is also included.The &quot;ground-up&quot; explanations of transmission line theory and S-parameters help round out the text as a good reference, and I personally found the inclusion of amplifier DC bias techniques and a slightly simplified simultaneous conjugate match solution to be delightful."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This book is one of the best written books on RF/Microwave transistor amplifier design. It is very methodical, well organized and easy to follow, if you have a solid background in Smith Charts. An excellent intro text for RF graduate students or practicing RF engineers. Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This is a very great book for small signal amplifier design. The contents are well organized. The hundreds of examples in books help me understand concept and also teach me how to solve the problems."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This book covered extensive techniques in amplifier design, mostly for small signal amplifiers (LNA), but less for PA. The content in this book follows a systematic way, which is good to the people who want to start from 'zero'. Examples are rich in 2nd ed., and explanations are clear. I found this book quite useful for learning basic techniques in amplifier design. As stated in the book, the techniques are applicable to not only microwave frequency, but other frequency ranges as long as S-parameters are available. There are 'huge' amount of smith charts involved in this book, so it's good for people who prefer graphical design approaches, which basically rely on the use of smith chart. For those who are interested in more specific kind of design, like broadband LNA design, this book may not be the first choice.The only annoying thing about the book is the binding. I paid the price for a hardcover only to get a paperback. Besides, the binding quality is quite poor (loose page after regular use, printed on wrong paper grain direction,...), and I sent my copy to have it rebound eventually."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This book is a good one .All the major equations involved in amplifier design process are derived, concepts don't stay hazy after reading .The derivations are very clear, the purpose of the book is very analytical .There are many examples, that are quite repetitive actually .It's as detailed as an academic course .The text layout is very dense, that's not very pleasant .Every technique proposed is thouroughly detailed,thus even if I am quite unexperienced in this domain and have not yet read the book entirely, I have the impression that this point of view restricts the themes of the book .Anyway this is a nice book that settles really seriously the principles of design, but that should not be recommended to someone that is allergic with maths ."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"This book gives concise equations and design routines for RF amplifier design. However, it's maybe too concise for a beginner. I believe it's a good reference book for experienced RF engineers."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"I used this book as a reference and it has helped me. This book is loaded with equations. It also has an abundance of practical examples. The delivery of subject material in this book needs improvement. It would help if a more clear understandable presentaion was incorporated in the book. I could not give it five stars. Someone has said that the first edition is better - might be worth checking out."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"Had a new hardcover for the paperback price.

I found myself using Pozar's Microwave book and papers/class notes since they were more clear. With that said, it does provide information beyond the Pozar book (since that is an introductory text) and isn't the worst book I've used. I guess if I didn't have the resources given to me in class I might have used it more."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"The book was in excellent codition for a book for being published in 1984, and that is the information that would have been very useful. This is a first edition, and I was looking for the expanded 2nd Edition, but the book will still serve it's intended purpuse."},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","review":"Some examples hard to follow. Some problems unrelated to previous study material. Very spotty book in the way it relays information.
