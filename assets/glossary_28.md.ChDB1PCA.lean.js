Behind her trademark sunglasses and under the fringe of her Louise Brooks bob she determines whether miniskirts are in or out, whether or not it's politically correct to wear fur. She influences designers, wholesalers, and retailers globally from Seventh Avenue to the elegant fashionista enclaves of L'Avenue Montaigne and Via della Spiga. In the U.S. alone a more than $200 billion fashion industry can rise or fall on Anna Wintour's call. And every month millions of women-and men-read Vogue, and are influenced by the pages of the chic and trendy style wish-book that she has controlled with an iron hand in a not-always-so-velvet glove since fighting her way to the most prestigious job in fashion journalism. Anna Wintour's fashion influence extends to celebrities and politicians: because of it, Hillary Clinton underwent a drastic makeover and became the first First Lady to strike a pose on the cover of Vogue in the midst of Monicagate; Oprah Winfrey was forced to go on a strict diet before Wintour would put her on Vogue's cover. And beauties like Rene Zellweger and Nicole Kidman follow Anna Wintour's fashionista rules to the letter. Now in her mid-fifties, as she nears her remarkable second decade at the helm of Vogue, comes this revealing biography that will shock and surprise both Anna's fans and detractors alike. Based on scores of interviews, Front Row unveils the Anna Wintour even those closest to her don't know.

Lee Gutkind has assembled a reunion of sorts with writers from across the nation, as well as the up-and-coming stars on the local scene each of whom has a Pittsburgh connection. Many grew up in the region, others attended college here: all of them have an association with the city. The resulting collection of essays is both gentle and jarring, eclectic and persuasive, covering a range of topics from a stripper's work ethic to West Virginia's famed Matewan shootout, Atlantic City's Boardwalk before Donald Trump, and the uses of poetry to better understand one's own life.

For decades, young men and women endured degrading and dangerous rituals in order to join sororities and fraternities while college administrators blindly accepted their consequences.

In Destroying Young Lives: Hazing in Schools and the Military, Hank Nuwer assembles an extraordinary cast of analysts to catalog the evolution of this dangerous practice, from the first hazing death at Cornell University in 1863 to present day tragedies. This hard-hitting compilation addresses the numerous, significant, and often overlooked impacts of hazing, including including sexual exploitation, mental distress, depression, and even suicide.

Dr. Juli Slattery applies that biblical framework to the practical challenges in sexual intimacy. Godly sexuality extends far beyond sexual purity and calls us to sexual integrity. God invites every couple to view their sexual relationship, including their greatest struggles, as an avenue to learn about the nature of His covenant love. It s God desire to make us more like Himself and sex within marriage is often a powerful training ground for godly character.

Before it is over, Paula is thrown from a deliberately spooked horse and trapped in a burning building. These physical pains cannot match the pain of her broken heart when she learns of Bruce's betrayal. And when Bruce tries to rescue her from the fire and is critically injured, she must decide whether to forgive Bruce and restore her marriage or leave him and learn to love again with Ike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UkKuGNEzESoC&dq=Shadow+Chase:+Mystery,+Suspense+and+Romance+at+a+Hill+Country+Dude+Ranch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen Flowers: Contemplation through Creativity","description":"All the universe is contained within a flower...this is the essence of Zen-Buddhism and also all the universe is contained within a flower.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3UWhPAAACAAJ&dq=Zen+Flowers:+Contemplation+through+Creativity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King John and Henry VIII (Bantam Classic)","description":"Presents the texts of two of Shakespeare's historical dramas, with notes on the text","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7WZUPwAACAAJ&dq=King+John+and+Henry+VIII+(Bantam+Classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HydroRobics - 2nd Ed.","description":"HydroRobics will help anyone improve flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, and cardiovascular conditioning with 50 different water exercises for all parts of the body.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V6hOAAAAYAAJ&dq=HydroRobics+-+2nd+Ed.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL PROBLEMS","description":"This thoroughly revised edition of Mooney, Knox, and Schacht's text uses a theoretically balanced, student-centered approach to provide a comprehensive exploration of social problems. UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL PROBLEMS, Tenth Edition, progresses from a micro to macro level of analysis, focusing first on problems related to health care, drugs and alcohols, families, and crime, and then broadening to the larger issues of poverty and inequality, population growth, aging, environmental problems, and conflict around the world. The social problem in each chapter is framed in a global as well as a U.S. context. In addition, the three major theoretical perspectives are applied to the problem under discussion, and its consequences -- as well as alternative solutions -- are explored. Pedagogical features such as The Human Side and Self and Society enable students to grasp how social problems affect the lives of individuals and apply their understanding of social problems to their own lives.

Not much is known about his life except that he lived in thirteenth-century Anatolia (now Turkey), had a great spiritual friendship with a wild man called Shams, brought an adopted daughter into his family, and was distraught when Shams finally disappeared. Rumi's Daughter is the delightful novel about Kimya, the girl who was sent from her rural village to live in Rumi's home. She already had mystical tendencies, and learned a great deal under Rumi's tutelage. Eventually she married Shams, an unusual husband, almost totally absorbed by his longings for God. Their marriage was fiery and different and, in the end, dissolved by Kimya's death - after which Shams vanished. Rumi's Daughter tells Kimya's story with great charm and tenderness. Well written and thought-provoking, it is sure to draw comparison with Paolho Coelho's The Alchemist, and also to add something fresh and new to what is so far known about Rumi.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7rwofn_u3-YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preface to critical reading","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ogrcvgEACAAJ&dq=Preface+to+critical+reading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crystal Star","description":"Princess Leia embarks on a perilous quest in search of her kidnapped children, a quest that takes her, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker to a strange crystal star, home to a charismatic alien.

To those who looked merely to their orthodox beliefs, the Puritans pointed out that the demons are orthodox in their creeds, but not in their conduct. Ever mindful not to stir up unnecessary doubts in weak believers, the Puritans, nevertheless, felt it imperative to awaken the carnal hypocrite out of his undeserved security. In this book, Matthew Mead shows twenty ways that a person can be deceived into thinking he is a Christian when he really is just an \\"almost Christian.\\" Mead also explains important topics like the need for self-examination, signs of the unpardonable sin, and reasons for a believer's lack of comfort. He concludes with three matters that every reader must be convinced of: the evil and filthy nature of sin, the misery and desperate danger of the unregenerate, and the utter insufficiency and inability of anything other than Christ Jesus to minister relief. This Puritan classic is meant to shake nominal believers out of their complacency and to comfort true believers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vG4IwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Almost+Christian+Discovered+(Puritan+Writings)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the Study of Hindu Doctrines","description":"Study of various Hindu schools of thought, with emphasis on the notion of tradition and esoterism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KmhvNFW_OmoC&dq=Introduction+to+the+Study+of+Hindu+Doctrines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dont Call Me Boss: David L.

What is a claim of power for ones who defy death? Call your damnable hunt. We shall see whom I drag screaming to hell with me.

Each country faced the challenge of holding on to territory that was poorly known and sparsely settled, and each responded by sending out military mapping expeditions to set boundaries and chart topographical features. All three countries recognized that turning terra incognita into clearly delineated political units was a key step in empire building, as vital to their national interest as the activities of the missionaries, civilian officials, settlers, and adventurers who followed in the footsteps of the soldier-engineers. With essays by eight leading historians, this book offers the most current and comprehensive overview of the processes by which Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. soldier-engineers mapped the southwestern frontier, as well as the local and even geopolitical consequences of their mapping. Three essays focus on Spanish efforts to map the Gulf and Pacific Coasts, to chart the inland Southwest, and to define and defend its boundaries against English, French, Russian, and American incursions. Subsequent essays investigate the role that mapping played both in Mexico's attempts to maintain control of its northern territory and in the United States' push to expand its political boundary to the Pacific Ocean. The concluding essay draws connections between mapping in the Southwest and the geopolitical history of the Americas and Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MRTUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Klee: Colour Library (Phaidon Colour Library)","description":"An introduction to the work of Paul Klee.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qEBQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Klee:+Colour+Library+(Phaidon+Colour+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditation","description":"Introduces a series of practical, step-by-step guides to ancient and modern techniques of meditation, from Buddhist and Sufi practices to Osho's own Dynamic Meditation and Mystic Rose Meditation, along with suggestions to help readers select the techniques that are most appropriate to personal lifestyles.

His career also traces the transatlantic engagement of modern painting with the materials of its own making, a relationship that is perhaps still not completely understood. In these interrelated narratives, Hofmann is a central protagonist, providing a vital link between nineteenth- and twentieth-century art practice and between European and American modernism. The remarkable vitality of his later work affords insight not only into the style but also the literal substance of this formative period of artistic and material innovation. This richly illustrated book, the fourth in the Getty Conservation Institute s Artist s Materials series, presents a thorough examination of Hofmann s late-career materials. Initial chapters present an informative overview of Hofmann s life and work in Europe and America and discuss his crucial role in the development of Abstract Expressionism. Subsequent chapters present a detailed analysis of Hofmann s materials and techniques and explore the relationship of the artist s mature palette to shifts in the style and aging characteristics of his paintings. The book concludes with lessons for the conservation of modernist paintings generally, and particularly those that incorporate both traditional and modern paint media.

A powerful blend of history, biography, and adventure, Orphan Trains fills a grievous gap in the American story. Tracing the evolution of the Children s Aid Society, this dramatic narrative tells the fascinating tale of one of the most famous and sometimes infamous child welfare programs: the orphan trains, which spirited away some two hundred fifty thousand abandoned children into the homes of rural families in the Midwest. In mid-nineteenth-century New York, vagrant children, whether orphans or runaways, filled the streets. The city s solution for years had been to sweep these children into prisons or almshouses. But a young minister named Charles Loring Brace took a different tack. With the creation of the Children s Aid Society in 1853, he provided homeless youngsters with shelter, education, and, for many, a new family out west. The family matching process was haphazard, to say the least: at town meetings, farming families took their pick of the orphan train riders. Some children, such as James Brady, who became governor of Alaska, found loving homes, while others, such as Charley Miller, who shot two boys on a train in Wyoming, saw no end to their misery. Complete with extraordinary photographs and deeply moving stories, Orphan Trains gives invaluable insights into a creative genius whose pioneering, if controversial, efforts inform child rescue work today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z57iBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradise lost,: Samson Agonistes [and] Lycidas (A Mentor classic)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3qQ4zwEACAAJ&dq=Paradise+lost,:+Samson+Agonistes+%5Band%5D+Lycidas+(A+Mentor+classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tibetan Mandalas","description":"Every one of these Tibetan mandalas is rich in spiritual meaning and the accompanying quotations and sayings will deepen your knowledge of this very special culture.

'I committed a crime to win you eighteen years ago, and I must die for it ... I have acted over this scene a million times in my imagination, but never in all those times parted from you with a jest as I did in reality just now. Wife, mistress, darling, my joy, my life, you cannot hate me...' Rich and clever, happily married and apparently respectable, Paul Ferroll keeps apart from his country neighbours, who think it may be because his first wife was horribly murdered long ago. They admire his selflessness during a cholera epidemic and his bravery in controlling a violent mob bykilling the ringleader; they admire his beautiful wife and daughter, and his brilliant literary reputation; they don't understand his jokes. But then gossip about the murder circulates, and an old woman is summoned to trial . . . A highly unusual Victorian crime novel, Paul Ferroll has been out of print for more than sixty years.

Robert DeLong, Christopher Gillberg, Yoshiko Nomura, Lorenzo Pavone, Martin Ruggieri, and Michele Zappella use the tools of neurological analysis to address a number of the major questions that have arisen in the study of autism. The answers they present have important implications for the direction of future autism research, diagnosis, and treatment. What are the neurological signs and symptoms of autism? The latest information is presented here in an in-depth discussion of epilepsy, cranial circumference, changes in muscle tone, stereotypies, and mutism found in children with autism. In addition, a template is provided for practitioners to follow when conducting neurological examinations of a child with autism. What are the best options for the treatment of autism? The current medical, educational, and alternative therapies are thoroughly reviewed and evaluated. Is autism reversible? The question is explored for syndromic autism, where diseases may have a transient autistic phase, and reviewed in detail for nonsyndromic autism. Is autism primarily a single disease, as originally described by Leo Kanner? Research presented here suggests that autism is, instead, a syndrome involving many disease entities. Has the incidence of autism been increasing in recent years? A sophisticated, historical review of autisms prevalence rates suggests that it has never been rare. What is the relationship between autism and Asperger syndrome? The latest evidence presented here sheds light on the degree to which both syndromes share more than clinical characteristics; they also have some similar findings in imaging, neuropathological, and genetic studies. Which components of the brains neural networks need to be impaired to cause the appearance of autistic symptoms? Although there are many candidate regions, dysfunction of the cerebellum and its circuits is noted to be of great interest. Student and professional researchers, practitioners, and parents will find this book to be a valuable resource for both the latest information from basic-science research and its application to the diagnosis and treatment of autism. \\"[This book] includes up-to-date genetic evidence, underlining the complexities of genetic/environmental influences...I recommend this easy and informative read.\\" -European Journal of Pediatric Neurology \\"...authoritative.\\" -The Lancet Neurology \\"Coleman's new book is an absolute must-read for anyone interested in the progress made in understanding the causes of autism.

The book is well referenced, provides helpful tables throughout, and includes a summary of relevant points at the end of each chapter.The authors are to be commended for presenting a very balanced view of current knowledge; they also indicate what we do not yet understand about brain functioning in autism and provide an important road map for ongoing exploration.\\" -Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp in The New England Journal of Medicine \\"At last it is recognised that developmental neurology is the appropriate context in which to explain autism. The authors of this volume, all pioneers in the field, consider new ideas on autism in this context. They succeed in making surprising and illuminating comparisons between autism and neurological disorders whose origin is already known. This work is a significant step towards understanding the causes of autistic disorders.\\"-Uta Frith, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Department of Psychology, University College London \\"When and if the secret of autism is teased from the myriad disease states that exhibit the syndrome, it will be through efforts such as are represented in this volume.

Yet scholarly and public understanding lags far behind recent events. Barry Rubin's historical and political summation of the region shows how events and ideas have both shaped and altered its character. Three interlinked themes are crucial to the book. First, a reinterpretation of the era of recent upheaval the Middle East has just passed through, which the author calls the Era of Radical Expectations. During that period, many Arabs believed that some leader, country, or radical movement would unite the region, solving all its problems. Second, an evaluation of how the historical experience of the period between the 1940s and the 1990s undermined the old system, making change necessary. Third, an analysis of the region today that explains future developments, in what the author terms the Era of Reluctant Pragmatism, as the Middle Eastern societies determine their relationships to the West. Barry Rubin is Director of the Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herziliya, Israel, and editor of the Middle East Review of International Affairs.

Among the things I do pretty well at this point I d have to list darts, re-closing Stay-Fresh boxes, and staying out of the way. This is the self-eulogy offered early on by the unwilling hero of the opening story in this collection, a dazzling array of work in short fiction from a master of the form. The stories in Love and Hydrogen familiar to readers from publications ranging from McSweeney s to The New Yorker to Harper s to Tin House encompass in theme and compassion what an ordinary writer would seem to need several lifetimes to imagine. A frustrated wife makes use of an enterprising illegal-gun salesman to hold her husband hostage; two hapless adult-education students botch their attempts at rudimentary piano but succeed in a halting, awkward romance; a fascinated and murderous Creature welcomes the first human visitors to his Black Lagoon; and in the title story, the stupefyingly huge airship Hindenburg flies to its doom, representing in 1937 mankind's greatest yearning as well as its titanic failure. Generous in scope and astonishing in ambition, Shepard s voice never falters; the virtuosity of Love and Hydrogen cements his reputation as, in the words of Rick Bass,  a passionate writer with a razor-sharp wit and an elephantine heart  in short, one of the most powerful talents at work today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0Jvv2DvjXFAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Reader in Animation Studies","description":"The Animation Studies Reader brings together both key writings within animation studies and new material in emerging areas of the field.

New material is also introduced in this section specifically addressing questions raised by the nature, style and materiality of animation. The second section outlines some of the main forms that animation takes, which includes discussions of genre. Although this section cannot be exhaustive, the material chosen is particularly useful as it provides samples of analysis that can illuminate some of the issues the first section of the book raises. The third section focuses on issues of representation and how the medium of animation might have an impact on how bodies, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity are represented. These representations can only be read through an understanding of the questions that the first two sections of the book raise; we can only decode these representations if we take into account form and genre, and theoretical conceptualisations such as visual pleasure, spectacle, the uncanny, realism etc.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uDN1DwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Reader+in+Animation+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sshhh!","description":"\\"Leadership is an art and not a science.

In it, he describes his search for a place in the natural world, beginning with an afternoon spent tracking down a lost crew member who cracked up on the job and concluding with his supervising a group of at-risk teenagers on a backpacking trip in the Escalante wilderness. In between, he depicts a range of experiences in and outside nature, including hostile barroom encounters between surveyors and tourists, weekends spent climbing Navajo Mountain and floating what remains of Glen Canyon, and late-night arguments concerning the meaning and purpose of nature with the eccentric polygamist who ran the town in which the surveyors parked their bunk trailers. Although this work is autobiographical, Shooting Polaris is so much more. It is a reflection on man s relationship to nature and work, American history and the movement into the West, the desire to impose order and the contrary impulse for unmediated experience, the idealistic legacy of the sixties, the influence of the Mormon Church, and the often-antagonistic relationship of American capitalism to sound ecological management. Along the way, Hales introduces engaging characters and reveals the art, science, and history of surveying, an endeavor that turns out to be surprisingly profound.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RAOgHXtD6fEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manga: 60 Years of Japanese Comics","description":"Japan's output of manga is massive, accounting for a staggering forty percent of everything published each year in the country.Outside Japan, there has been a global boom in sales, with the manga aesthetic spreading from comics into all areas of Western youth culture through film, computer games, advertising, and design.

Through an often-revisionist lens, contributors to this volume focus on topics such as civilian expectations for the campaign, morale in the two armies, and the generalship of Lee, Grant, Philip H. Sheridan, Richard S. Ewell, A. P. Hill, James Longstreet, and Lewis A. Grant. Taken together, these essays revise and enhance existing work on the battle, highlighting ways in which the military and nonmilitary spheres of war intersected in the Wilderness.

Now that she s moved out of the world s most famous bachelor pad and into her own delightfully chaotic world on Kendra as wife to NFL star Hank Baskett and mother to their newborn son, we ve watched her hilarious antics as she adjusts to domestic life. But how much do we really know about the fun-loving star? In this humorous and optimistic, sometimes heartbreaking, but always unfailingly honest memoir, Kendra reveals the highs and lows of her extraordinary journey. She wasn t always the quintessential girl next door. Before she was a reality television superstar, Hugh Hefner s girlfriend, or one of the most popular Playboy cover models ever, Kendra was an athletic tomboy whose father walked out on her family when she was a little girl. She grew into a rebellious teenager with a serious drug habit before she quit cold turkey and beat the odds to graduate from a high school that almost didn t give her a second (or third, or fourth) chance. Following her rocky teenage years, an out-of-the- blue phone call from Hugh Hefner changed everything. Kendra dishes candidly about life in the Playboy Mansion: the sex, the parties, the show, and even her relationships with her Girls Next Door costars Hef, Holly, and Bridget. She tells the true story about how she and Hank met and built a relationship in secret while she was still Hef s girl- friend and a public face of Playboy. Finally, she reflects on the slew of unexpected changes in the short space of a year that have brought her sliding into home from Playboy party girl to wife and mother with a blooming Hollywood career. If you think you ve seen all of Kendra, think again. She s only warming up. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zF6v7bX__SQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of College Chemistry","description":"Used by over 750,000 students, Foundations of College Chemistry is praised for its accuracy, clear no-nonsense approach, and direct writing style.

If the writer is Nora Ephron, the answer is a resounding yes. For in this inspired confection of adultery, revenge, group therapy, and pot roast, the creator of Sleepless in Seattle reminds us that comedy depends on anguish as surely as a proper gravy depends on flour and butter. Seven months into her pregnancy, Rachel Samstat discovers that her husband, Mark, is in love with another woman. The fact that the other woman has \\"a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs\\" is no consolation. Food sometimes is, though, since Rachel writes cookbooks for a living. And in between trying to win Mark back and loudly wishing him dead, Ephron's irrepressible heroine offers some of her favorite recipes.

The twentieth century has witnessed the uncertain link between business need, political will and personal greed exploding into acrimony and corruption. This book examines the tenuous links from the Yom Kippur war in 1973 through the mid-1990 s. It follows the exploits of one corporation, Global Corp, and its management as they drive on to make their company dominant. The book also analyses the buyers and the sellers, the intermediaries and the promoters of exports. The military-industrial complex has been with us for centuries. With weaponry now of a global dimension, it has never been more important that we understand the drivers behind the people, the companies and the Governments of buying and selling nations. Right and wrong often blur as tides of opinion change overnight, but there is no consensus for those involved to rely on. Every democracy has to continuously seek to ensure that it keeps its international interests secure while maintaining jobs within the country or state. Corruption is continuous, though, and the sale of military equipment to many nations means always drawing a fine line between what is right and what is expedient. \\"Last Line of Defense\\" shows the strains that always affect this business. It draws down deep into the minds of the people that work this marketplace and those around them. It follows the career of one man, Lionel Curtis, taken from obscurity to the top of one of the most powerful businesses in the nation. His rise is propelled upon the actions and misfortunes of others. As he \\"goes with the flow\\" of history, will he be ready when the river s flow alters course? Behind him lurks the seedier side of the business, one he knows is there but would rather not. These are the deal-makers that make sure business is successful. They are always there as companies come and go. Whether acting on their own, within large corporations or even within the Government, they are oil that greases the wheel of the military-industrial complex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f2ZZVk0KaUAC&dq=Last+Line+of+Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to Sender: The Secret Son of Elvis Presley : A Novel","description":"When an eighteen-year-old New Jersey boy questions his true identity, his search for his roots leads him to Elvis Presley","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TZbnPAAACAAJ&dq=Return+to+Sender:+The+Secret+Son+of+Elvis+Presley+:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knife Sharpening","description":"The ideal guide for knifemakers, collectors, culinary professionals, and more, this book teaches multiple methods for making your blades as sharp as new or even sharper.

The Wolverine Way reveals the natural history of this species and the forces that threaten its future, engagingly told by Douglas Chadwick, who volunteered with the Glacier Wolverine Project. This five-year study in Glacier National Park  which involved dealing with blizzards, grizzlies, sheer mountain walls, and other daily challenges to survival  uncovered key missing information about the wolverine s habitat, social structure and reproduction habits.

In this penetrating and tightly argued manifesto, French philosopher Alain de Benoist seeks to answer this question with passionate intellectual vigor and a tremendous erudition. Arising out of the \\"monotheism vs. polytheism\\" debate that reverberated through Parisian intellectual circles in the late 1970s, this is neither a survey of ancient, pre-Christian religions, nor is it an argument on behalf of any modern neo-pagan sect. On Being a Pagan draws on Nietzsche, Heidegger, ancient philosophy and mythology, and biblical hermeneutics to articulate a pagan theology based on a common Indo-European foundation. In keeping with the critical tradition which hearkens back to the Greek philosopher Celsus, Benoist contrasts the heroic pagan worldview with Christianity's attempts to hobble everything that is beautiful and strong. He compares the cyclical pagan conception of time to the de-mythologizing, linear understanding of history favored by the prophets. Most disturbingly, he traces the roots of modern totalitarianism and intolerance--of both the left and the right--to the leveling ideology of ancient Judeo-Christian monotheism, with its underlying rejection of diversity and diff rence. Originally published to wide critical acclaim in 1981, Benoist's text is as relevant today as it was when it first appeared--and perhaps even more so for the English-speaking world. This newly revised translation now features an extensive interview with the author, and includes his reflections (both positive and negative) on the various groups and individuals that have attempted to resurrect the pagan spirit. Rather than simply dissecting the 2,000-year Christian interregnum, Benoist's greater purpose is to point the way forward to a world that could have been, and which may only now be in the first stages of being reborn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MT56swEACAAJ&dq=On+Being+a+Pagan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trial of Charles I","description":"Eyewitness accounts of the trial and execution of Charles I portray a revolutionary moment in English history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_iXxOS4o41wC&dq=The+Trial+of+Charles+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic Shades (Fortune Teller's Club Series)","description":"When Gena finds a pair of sunglasses in a thrift store, she discovered that the glasses shows her the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h3nHHxGVPBgC&dq=The+Magic+Shades+(Fortune+Teller%27s+Club+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song for a Shadow","description":"Recounts the extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow, whose sole, small habitat near Florida's Cape Canaveral was made unlivable by the development of the Kennedy Space Center, Disney World, and local real estate, in addition to government neglect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BeHBmAEACAAJ&dq=Song+for+a+Shadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Princess (Dragon Nimbus)","description":"The throne of Prince Darville is threatened by rogue magicians who try to take advantage when his dragon protectors depart, and the prince realizes that he and his bride are threatened by dark magic that threatens his kingdom and their lives.

Engaging examples and problems are drawn from a variety of topical areas in both human and physical geography and are fully integrated into the text. Without compromising statistical rigor or oversimplifying, the authors stress the importance of written narratives that explain each statistical technique. After introducing basic statistical concepts and terminology, the authors focus on nonspatial and spatial descriptive statistics. They transition to inferential problem solving, including probability, sampling, and estimation, before delving deeper into inferential statistics for geographic problem solving. The final chapters examine the related techniques of correlation and regression. A list of major goals and objectives is included at the end of each chapter, allowing students to monitor their own progress and mastery of geographic statistical materials. An epilogue, offering over 150 geographic situations, gives students a chance to figure out which statistical technique should be used for a particular situation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWobAAAAQBAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+Statistical+Problem+Solving+in+Geography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Gray Men: Roswell and the Rise of a Popular Culture","description":"Explores how the rumors of an alien spacecraft landing in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 led to American society's obsession with extraterrestrials and the rise in popularity of science fiction movies, television shows, and books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9qSxyR0i6goC&dq=Little+Gray+Men:+Roswell+and+the+Rise+of+a+Popular+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harry S.

Following the recently obtained structures of a variety of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes from plants and bacteria our interest in understanding the relation between structure, function and spectroscopy has strongly increased. These data demonstrate a short interpigment distance (of the order of 1 nm or even smaller) and/or a highly symmetric (ring-like) arrangement of pigment molecules in peripheral light-harvesting complexes of photosynthetic bacteria. Books which were devoted to the exciton problem so far mainly considered the spectral properties of molecular crystals. However, the small size of these pigment aggregates in the pigment-protein complexes as well as the role of the protein, which is responsible for the structural arrangement of the complex, clearly will have a dramatic influence on the pigment spectra and exciton dynamics. All these aspects of the problem are considered in this book. Exciton theory is mainly considered for small molecular aggregates (dimers, ring-like structures etc.). Together with the theoretical description of the classical conceptual approach, which mainly deals with polarization properties of the absorption and fluorescence spectra, the nonlinear femtosecond spectroscopy which is widely used for investigations now is also discussed. A large part of the book demonstrates the excitonic effects in a multitude of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes and how we can understand these properties on the basis of the exciton concept.

Can a cat expose a cheating husband? Can a research dog let his rescuer know he wants to be called 'Rexy\\"? Absolutely! And here are the stories to prove it. These are accounts of extraordinary interactions between people and pets. Stories that surprise, perplex and move us. But The Cat Who Read the Mail is not simply another collection of 'amazing\\" animal stories. Instead, animal writer and columnist Elinor Donahue explores the interaction between people and pets when it moves beyond amazing and becomes inexplicable, mysterious, profound. She's interviewed dozens of ordinary people who have anything but ordinary stories to tell. Here, told in a lively, journalistic style, are the most compelling encounters with the unexpected through an animal. Samson the cat began chewing and ripping the mail - selecting only the mail addressed to the husband of the house. He'd then deposit the remains at the front door where the wife would see it when she came home. Samson was on to something. Annie, the 12-pound therapy dog at Ground Zero, gathered the gazes of a circle of bereaved men a few days after 9/11 - whereupon each of them spilled out, one by one, whom they lost there. 'My mother.\\" 'My brother.\\" 'My sister.\\" When Malibu the dog died, her housemate cat, Whip, watched in fascination -- and the next day took on Malibu's daily habits, including opening the kitchen cabinets to forage for dog treats. While each story in this entertaining and fast-reading book stands on its own, the narratives gather momentum as acollection, suggesting there is more mystery and meaning here than our limited vantage can account for. However, Donahue does not attempt to explain or interpret. She simply showcases these special pets and the ordinary people who have glimpsed the extraordinary because of them. The Cat Who Read the Mail offers 16 stories that, in quick and glancing style, suggest that animals are in on the play of the universe in ways beyond our imagining. Still, each episode is real and occurred in the ordinary life of a grounded human being. The people in these stories never expected or sought the unexplainable event they experienced. Donahue has interviewed each of these individuals in depth, selecting the most compelling stories. Like Joel, the optometrist who dealt only in rational fact. He wasn't expecting that an eerie howl from the cat would precede the apparition of Baxter, his recently deceased dog. And a renowned dog trainer found that indeed it matters what you call your dog. When it hears the name it really wants, like 'Jazz,\\" the animal will respond far more readily than when the moniker is a misfit, like 'Daisy.\\" Though not sentimental heart warmers, these are stories for the good. That is their power. These occurrences can't be explained-and because of that they make their way into the crevices in our thinking. They take us to the moment of inswept breath-the aha! that catches us unaware. And they're fun to read!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cGPyQYIErb8C&dq=The+Cat+Who+Read+the+Mail:+Sixteen+Amazing+Stories+About+Our+Mysterious+Bond+With+Animals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snopes. The Hamlet, The Town, The Mansion","description":"Here, published in a single volume as he always hoped they would be, are the three novels that comprise William Faulkner s famous Snopes trilogy, a saga that stands as perhaps the greatest feat of this celebrated author s incomparable imagination. The Hamlet, the first book of the series chronicling the advent and rise of the grasping Snopes family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County, is a work that Cleanth Brooks called  one of the richest novels in the Faulkner canon.  It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes dominates the rural community of Frenchman s Bend and claims the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. The Town, the central novel, records Flem s ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi. Finally, The Mansion tells of Mink Snopes, whose archaic sense of honor brings about the downfall of his cousin Flem.  For all his concerns with the South, Faulkner was actually seeking out the nature of man,  noted Ralph Ellison.  Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics.

Mrs. Aubrey, a former concert pianist, struggles to keep the family afloat, but then she is something of a high-strung eccentric herself, as is all too clear to her daughter Rose, through whose loving but sometimes cruel eyes events are seen. Still, living on the edge holds the promise of the unexpected, and the Aubreys, who encounter furious poltergeists, turn up hidden masterpieces, and come to the aid of a murderess, will find that they have adventure to spare. In The Fountain Overflows, a 1957 best seller, Rebecca West transmuted her own volatile childhood into enduring art.

How You Can Survive When They're Depressed explores depression from the perspective of those who are closest to the sufferers of this prevalent disorder--spouses, parents, children, and lovers--and gives the successful coping strategies of many people who live with a clinical depressive or manic-depressive and often suffer in silence, believing their own problems have no claim to attention. Depression fallout is the emotional toll on the depressive's family and close friends who are unaware of their own stressful reactions and needs. Sheffield outlines the five stages of depression fallout: confusion, self-doubt, demoralization, anger, and finally, the desire to escape. Many people will find relief in the knowledge that their self-blame, guilt, sadness, and resentment are a natural result of living with a depressed person. Sheffield brings together many real-life examples from the pioneering support group she attends at Beth Israel Medical Center of how people with depression fallout have learned to cope. From setting boundaries to maintaining an outside social life, she gives practical tactics for handling the challenges and emotional stresses on a day-to-day basis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K-9OYhctSCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brian Wildsmith's ABC","description":"Presents a collection of animals, ranging from alligator to zebra, and offers facts about each creature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NIQeAAAACAAJ&dq=Brian+Wildsmith%27s+ABC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Ian Fleming","description":"From the author of All the Money in the World and The Profession of Violence comes the definitive biography of James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. It is now over fifty years since the premiere of Dr No, the very first Bond film, with Sean Connery introducing 007 as the glamorous secret agent who would become the single most profitable movie character in the history of cinema. But James Bond was invented by one man, Ian Fleming, a wartime intelligence officer and Sunday Times newspaper man who lived to see only the very beginning of the Bond cult. Pearson, who worked with Fleming at the Sunday Times, based this biography on his own memories of Fleming, on Fleming's private papers, and on a series of interviews with an extraordinary collection of Fleming's contemporaries  family, friends, enemies, teachers, colleagues, mistresses, and former spies from around the world. First published in 1966, John Pearson's famous biography remains the definitive account of how only Ian Fleming could have dreamed up James Bond, for he led a life as colourful as anything in his fiction, which in turn became a covert autobiography. Charming, debonair and a ruthless womaniser, globetrotting from wartime Algiers to beachside Jamaica, Fleming was as elusive and opaque as his imaginary creation. In his new introduction to this edition, Pearson examines the extent to which Fleming's character informs the movie portrayals of Bond, from Sean Connery through to Daniel Craig, and how Bond himself has achieved immortality beyond Fleming's wildest dreams.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zHXVds2Y3BgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rock plunged into eternity: Fourteen addresses delivered over The Catholic Hour, during the lenten season of 1950","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TWjESgAACAAJ&dq=The+rock+plunged+into+eternity:+Fourteen+addresses+delivered+over+The+Catholic+Hour,+during+the+lenten+season+of+1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Verses, Healing Sounds, Volumes I and II: The Bhagavad Gita, Hymns of the Rig Veda (Chopra, Deepak)","description":"Unshackle your mind and claim your spiritual birthright of freedom, wholeness, and joy through the perennial wisdom of ancient yoga There s a reason that the Vedas, a 5,000-year-old collection of celebrated verses from ancient India, have given rise to several world religions and influenced Western thinkers from Emerson to Ram Dass they provide us with a uniquely accessible and effective path to liberation and sovereignty.

And good taste is as necessary as good manners,\\" declared Elsie de Wolfe, the \\"first lady\\" of American interior design. Although de Wolfe decorated the homes of wealthy, socially prominent clients, she always maintained that her vision of elegant but comfortable living is attainable to all. This timeless 1913 book, written in a friendly, conversational tone, explains how to design, furnish, and decorate a house in order to make it a beautiful, useful, and livable home. De Wolfe pioneered the concept of the home as a representation of the owner's identity, and this book defines her decorating methods, philosophy, and approach to creating spaces for gracious entertaining. Part step-by-step manual and part aesthetic treatise, this volume advocates for simpler yet more refined decor. In contrast to the Victorian penchant for dark furniture, bric-a-brac, and heavy draperies, de Wolfe advised her readers to let in natural light, to replace gaudy colors with beige and ivory, and to abandon clutter. Her practical suggestions, illustrated by period photographs, illuminate the attitudes of a century ago while retaining their resonance for modern-day interior designers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OYo6DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+house+in+good+taste,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Swann (Reed Audio)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mc4PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mary+Swann+(Reed+Audio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Armies","description":"This book, first published in 1952, gives a detailed first-hand account by its commanding officer of the French First Army, from its successful landings in the South of France through its liberation of Marseilles and breakout across the Rhine and victory beyond the Danube.

Although the two topics are related, this unique text allows either topic to be presented independently, and it was specifically designed so that the data compression section requires no prior knowledge of information theory. The treatment of information theory, while theoretical and abstract, is quite elementary, making this text less daunting than many others. After presenting the fundamental definitions and results of the theory, the authors then apply the theory to memoryless, discrete channels with zeroth-order, one-state sources. The chapters on data compression acquaint students with a myriad of lossless compression methods and then introduce two lossy compression methods. Students emerge from this study competent in a wide range of techniques. The authors' presentation is highly practical but includes some important proofs, either in the text or in the exercises, so instructors can, if they choose, place more emphasis on the mathematics. Introduction to Information Theory and Data Compression, Second Edition is ideally suited for an upper-level or graduate course for students in mathematics, engineering, and computer science.

Can they impart to them the survival skills necessary to survive in the racially stratified United States? Concerns over racial identity have been at the center of controversies over transracial adoption since the 1970s, as questions continually arise about whether White parents are capable of instilling a positive sense of African American identity in their Black children. \\"[An] empathetic study of meanings of cross-racial adoption to adoptees\\"  Law and Politics Book Review, Vol. 11, No. 11, Nov. 2001 Through in-depth interviews with adult transracial adoptees, as well as with social workers in adoption agencies, Sandra Patton, herself an adoptee, explores the social construction of race, identity, gender, and family and the ways in which these interact with public policy about adoption. Patton offers a compelling overview of the issues at stake in transracial adoption. She discusses recent changes in adoption and social welfare policy which prohibit consideration of race in the placement of children, as well as public policy definitions of \\"bad mothers\\" which can foster coerced aspects of adoption, to show how the lives of transracial adoptees have been shaped by the policies of the U.S. child welfare system. Neither an argument for nor against the practice of transracial adoption, BirthMarks seeks to counter the dominant public view of this practice as a panacea to the so-called \\"epidemic\\" of illegitimacy and the misfortune of infertility among the middle class with a more nuanced view that gives voice to those directly involved, shedding light on the ways in which Black and multiracial adoptees articulate their own identity experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jDuhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autocad 2006 for Architecture","description":"Beginning with an exploration of the basic tools that control AutoCAD?, each subsequent chapter builds on the skills learned for a well-rounded exploration of each new command relating to 2D construction documentation.

Price asks why, among all the ominous technologies of weaponry throughout the history of warfare, chemical weapons carry a special moral stigma. Something more seems to be at work than the predictable resistance people have expressed to any new weaponry, from the crossbow to nuclear bombs. Perceptions of chemical warfare as particularly abhorrent have been successfully institutionalized in international proscriptions and, Price suggests, understanding the sources of this success might shed light on other efforts at arms control. To explore the origins and meaning of the chemical weapons taboo, Price presents a series of case studies from World War I through the Gulf War of 19901991. He traces the moral arguments against gas warfare from the Hague Conferences at the turn of the century through negotiations for the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. From the Italian invasion of Ethiopia to the war between Iran and Iraq, chemical weapons have been condemned as the \\"poor man's bomb.\\" Drawing upon insights from Michel Foucault to explain the role of moral norms in an international arena rarely sensitive to such pressures, he focuses on the construction of and mutations in the refusal to condone chemical weapons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OFpuDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Chemical+Weapons+Taboo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italia mia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bOfvzgEACAAJ&dq=Italia+mia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gabriel's Fire (Leisure historical romance)","description":"In the war of 1812, one woman risks the wrath of British authorities to save an American captain.

Fueled by mounting disdain for newspapers run by business tycoons and conservative editors, Sinclair self-published The Brass Check in the years after The Jungle had made him a household name. Despite Sinclair's claim that this was his most important book, it was dismissed by critics and shunned by reviewers. Yet it sold over 150,000 copies and enjoyed numerous printings.

Of course I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons. And yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which, I am not quite satisfied with you.  With this opening sentence in a two-page letter from Abraham Lincoln, Union general Joseph Hooker (181479) gained a prominent place in Civil War history. Hooker assumed command of an army demoralized by defeat and diminished by desertion. Acting swiftly, the general reorganized his army, routed corruption among quartermasters, improved food and sanitation, and boosted morale by granting furloughs and amnesties. His hour of fame and the test of his military skill came in the May 1863 battle of Chancellorsville. It was one of the Union Army s worst defeats; shortly thereafter Hooker s resignation was accepted. This definitive biography of a man who could lead so brilliantly and yet fall so ignominiously remains the only full-length treatment of Hooker s life. His renewal as an important commander in the western theater during the Chattanooga and Atlanta campaigns is discussed, as is his life before and after his Civil War military service.

As the community's demand for labor grew, the Moravian Brethren bought slaves to help operate their farms, shops, and industries. Moravians believed in the universalism of the gospel and baptized dozens of African Americans, who became full members of tightly knit Moravian congregations. For decades, white and black Brethren worked and worshiped together--though white Moravians never abandoned their belief that black slavery was ordained by God. Based on German church documents, including dozens of rare biographies of black Moravians, A Separate Canaan is the first full-length study of contact between people of German and African descent in early America. Exploring the fluidity of race in Revolutionary era America, it highlights the struggle of African Americans to secure their fragile place in a culture unwilling to give them full human rights. In the early nineteenth century, white Moravians forsook their spiritual inclusiveness, installing blacks in a separate church. Just as white Americans throughout the new republic rejected African American equality, the Moravian story illustrates the power of slavery and race to overwhelm other ideals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZPTGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instrument pilot flight training manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k55YJuX0dlsC&dq=Instrument+pilot+flight+training+manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Go and Let God","description":"Step by step, layman's terms, points out the way to a joyous affirmation of your spiritual faith--a soothing refuge in times of trouble and doubt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=580G4YfHiRwC&dq=Let+Go+and+Let+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Wreck-Diving Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PnQZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Ultimate+Wreck-Diving+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Garden State","description":"Phantom pirates, water monsters, and mythical snakes figure prominently in this collection of eerie tales from the Garden State.

Cilla preferred to keep her distance from the police, and she had her reasons. But there was something about Boyd Fletcher that made him difficult to ignore. He was strong, laconic, infuriating and clearly determined to watch over her every second of the day...and night. And the trouble was, the more Cilla saw of her unwanted bodyguard, the more she wanted him to share the night she loved... Night Shadow In a city ruled by fear, a solitary figure shrouded in black walked the night, determined to awaken a terrified metropolis from the nightmare of crime. There was nothing -- no bullets, and certainly not legal technicalities -- that could deter the man they called Nemesis from his mission. Deborah O'Roarke, an idealistic young prosecutor waging her own war against crime, owed Nemesis her very life. She shared his passion for justice, yet she could not accept his lawless methods.

While flower sellers, costermongers, shopkeepers, and hansom drivers ply their trades, the London police watch over all. Or so people believe. ... Early one morning, Thomas Pitt, dauntless mainstay of the Special Branch, is summoned to Long Spoon Lane, where anarchists are plotting an attack. Bombs explode, destroying the homes of many poor people. After a chase, two of the culprits are captured and the leader is shot ... but by whom? As Pitt delves into the case, he finds that there is more to the terrorism than the destructive gestures of misguided idealists. The police are running a lucrative protection racket, and clues suggest that Inspector Wetron of Bow Street is the mastermind. As the shadowy leader of the Inner Circle, Wetron is using his influence with the press to whip up fears of more attacks-and to rush a bill through Parliament that would severely curtail civil liberties. This would make him the most powerful man in the country. To defeat Wetron, Pitt finds that he must run in harness with his old enemy, Sir Charles Voisey, and the unlikely allies are joined by Pitt's clever wife, Charlotte, and her great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Can they prevail? As they strive to prevent future destruction, nothing less than the fate of the British Empire hangs in precarious balance. From the first sentence to the last, Long Spoon Lane is a miracle of suspense, of plot and counterplot, bluff and counterbluff, in a take-no-prisoners battle between good and evil. It is possibly the very best of all the wonderful Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels. In a Victorian-era London beset by anarchists, detective Thomas Pitt investigates the mysterious death of Magnus Landsborough, the young son of aristocrat Lord Sheridan Landsborough, during a violent gun battle between police and rioters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mQK1_QqQ8ccC&dq=Long+Spoon+Lane+(Charlotte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virginia City Trail (Trail Drive Series)","description":"Through a thousand miles of dust, fists, and guns, they found the courage to keep on driving.

The Black Death was a human tragedy that abruptly halved entire populations and caused untold suffering, but it also brought about a cultural and economic renewal on a scale never before witnessed. The World the Plague Made is a panoramic history of how the bubonic plague revolutionized labour, trade, and technology and set the stage for Europe s global expansion. James Belich takes readers across centuries and continents to shed new light on one of history s greatest paradoxes. Why did Europe s dramatic rise begin in the wake of the Black Death? Belich shows how plague doubled the per capita endowment of everything even as it decimated the population. Many more people had disposable incomes. Demand grew for silks, sugar, spices, furs, gold, and slaves. Europe expanded to satisfy that demand and plague provided the means. Labour scarcity drove more use of waterpower, wind power, and gunpowder. Technologies like water-powered blast furnaces, heavily gunned galleons, and musketry were fast-tracked by plague. A new  crew culture  of  disposable males  emerged to man the guns and galleons. Setting the rise of Western Europe in global context, Belich demonstrates how the mighty empires of the Middle East and Russia also flourished after the plague, and how European expansion was deeply entangled with the Chinese and other peoples throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FStaEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Black+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Loon Feather","description":"Set during the French fur trading days, the story of the Indian girl who, married to a white man, still tried to retain her own heritage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xQ4qSCHKoRoC&dq=The+Loon+Feather&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protestant Boy","description":"Geoffrey Beattie grew up in the notorious 'murder triangle' in North Belfast, where during thirty years of the Troubles more than six hundred people were killed. Many of his childhood friends ended up dead or in prison, while Beattie himself moved to England, at first to study and eventually to build a highly successful career as a psychologist. On a visit home to see his ailing mother, Beattie begins to explore his Ulster Protestant ancestry and to reflect on the unfashionable and little understood Protestant community. His search takes him to the trenches of the Somme, to the Plantation villages of Ulster, and to Drumcree for the Orange march. And it also takes him deeper into his mother's character: at the heart of the book is an extraordinarily vivid portrait of this opinonated, witty, exasperating Ulsterwoman. Protestant Boy is an honest, beautifully written book about the stories that families and cultures tell themselves, and about the silences that they leave behind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LyT8p4yR17oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonderings","description":"The author objectively and incisively asks questions of general interest about beliefs and practices of the major religions, and about phenomena in nature; and he uses his imagination to explore possible ramifications of the answers.

In heaven, are there strata whose benefits depend on how worthy their inhabitants are; and might hell be a stratum completely lacking God s benefits, rather than a place of severe torment; and purgatory a higher stratum with less severe torment? ?

For many years they were overlooked or not recognised for what they were. Today just about every UFO investigator has encountered these Men in Black during their research. The history of Demonology, Witchcraft and the Occult are filled with similar incidents leading one to speculate that the UFO phenomena is at least partly 'psychic' in nature. The Men in Black appeared during several UFO flaps in the last century. In 1864, a UFO dropped several artefacts over a small community in Texas. They were placed by the citizens of the town in the front window of a shop on the main street of town. The next day a travelling dealer stopped by and offered the shop keeper a 'good price' for the objects and carted them away with him. Several similar incidents happened in 1897 and 1898. Many of the occupants observed during this period were said to have oriental features, dark complexions slight stature and a heavy, indefinable accent -- identical to the features described by observers of the MIB, who continue to harass and frighten witnesses today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRDqPQAACAAJ&dq=Mystery+of+the+Men+in+Black:+The+UFO+Silencers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sins of the Blood (Vampire: The Masquerade)","description":"What are we?

Does true love really exist? I know how to be loved, but what does it mean to love another person? Do I have the capacity to love someone else? Everyone wants to experience love, yet it often seems that the people we most want to love become antagonists, and that the harder we try, the more distant we become from each other. God is the source of love, but it is obvious that at some point in human history, a vast gulf developed between man and God. High divorce rates, racism and terrorism, and animosity between religions are proof that we are far from realizing the ideal of love. If we truly met God, and felt deeply that God loves us, all loneliness and unhappiness, sickness, suffering and sorrow would vanish. We know this, but we can not find the experience we seek. This book is an investigation into the historical resentments that have interfered with love and come between men and women, parents and children, siblings, and friends, even when their deepest desire was to live together in harmony and mutual fulfillment. Learn how you can overcome the past, develop your own capacity to give of yourself, and see those around you with eyes of true love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDHD6gvF2lUC&dq=The+art+of+loving+(World+perspectives,+v.+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chad Hanna","description":"Story of a small business in competition with big business in the Erie Canal region in the middle 19th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eY8dAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chad+Hanna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indoor Grilling Cookbook: 100 Great Recipes for Electric and Stovetop Grills","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_KLAAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Indoor+Grilling+Cookbook:+100+Great+Recipes+for+Electric+and+Stovetop+Grills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eustace Clarence Mullins","description":"From the Foreword. In 1949, while I was visiting Ezra Pound who was a political prisoner at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Washington, D.C.

He then showed me a ten dollar bill marked \\"\\"Federal Reserve Note\\"\\" and asked me if I would do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve System which had issued this bill. Pound was unable to go to the Library himself, as he was being held without trial as a political prisoner by the United States government. After he was denied broadcasting time in the U.S., Dr. Pound broadcast from Italy in an effort to persuade people of the United States not to enter World War II. Franklin D.

Lyra knows something has happened to Raina Kirk, and tracks down her last known appearance at an exclusive hotel and health spa. The health spa is known for its luxurious offerings and prestigious clientele, and the wealthy, socialite background Lyra desperately wanted to leave behind is perfect for this undercover job. What Lyra lacks in investigative experience she makes up for in gut instinct, and her gut isn t happy that she s saddled with a partner by Luther Pell, Raina s dangerous lover, who wants to bring in someone with more experience to help. Instead of the suave, pistol-packing private eye she expected, though, Simon Cage is a mild-mannered antiquarian book dealer with a quiet, academic air, and a cool, remote gaze. Lyra suspects that Simon is much more than what he seems, and her instincts are confirmed when they arrive at the spa and pose as a couple: Simon has a unique gift that allows him to detect secrets, a skill that is crucial in finding Raina. The unlikely duo falls down a rabbit hole of twisted rumors and missing socialites, discovering that the health spa is a fa?ade for something far darker than they imagined.

In this book, two children, with the interesting Saxon names of Edred and Elfrida, aged 10 and 12 respectively, discover that due to the death of a distant relative, young Edred is now Lord of Arden. The estate consists of not much more than a little money, a crumbling castle, and an attached house. An old retainer tells them of a legend regarding the Lord of Arden and a buried treasure. Naturally they are eager to locate the treasure, which may help them restore the castle. They discover a way to summon up the mascot of the House, a white mole or  mouldiwarp,  who enables them to travel back through time in search of the treasure.

Free speech has long been one of American's most revered freedoms. Yet now, more than ever, free speech is reshaping America s social and political landscape even as it is coming under attack. Bestselling author and critically acclaimed journalist Ellis Cose wades into the debate to reveal how this Constitutional right has been coopted by the wealthy and politically corrupt. It is no coincidence that historically huge disparities in income have occurred at times when moneyed interests increasingly control political dialogue. Over the past four years, Donald Trump s accusations of  fake news,  the free use of negative language against minority groups,  cancel culture,  and blatant xenophobia have caused Americans to question how far First Amendment protections can and should go. Cose offers an eye-opening wholly original examination of the state of free speech in America today, litigating ideas that touch on every American s life. Social media meant to bring us closer, has become a widespread disseminator of false information keeping people of differing opinions and political parties at odds. The nation and world watches in shock as white nationalism rises, race and gender-based violence spreads, and voter suppression widens. The problem, Cose makes clear, is that ordinary individuals have virtually no voice at all. He looks at the danger of hyper-partisanship and how the discriminatory structures that determine representation in the Senate and the electoral college threaten the very concept of democracy. He argues that the safeguards built into the Constitution to protect free speech and democracy have instead become instruments of suppression by an unfairly empowered political minority. But we can take our rights back, he reminds us. Analyzing the experiences of other countries, weaving landmark court cases together with a critical look at contemporary applications, and invoking the lessons of history, including the Great Migration, Cose sheds much-needed light on this cornerstone of American culture and offers a clarion call for activism and change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jITEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain and Being: At the boundary between science, philosophy, language and arts (Advances in Consciousness Research)","description":"This book results from a group meeting held at the Institute for Scientific Exchange in Torino, Italy.

On every page I learned something new. Read it every night if you want to restore your faith in our country.\\"  James Mattis, General, U.S. Marines (ret.) & 26th Secretary of Defense The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and #1 New York Times bestselling author offers a revelatory new book about the founding fathers, examining their educations and, in particular, their devotion to the ancient Greek and Roman classics and how that influence would shape their ideals and the new American nation. On the morning after the 2016 presidential election, Thomas Ricks awoke with a few questions on his mind: What kind of nation did we now have? Is it what was designed or intended by the nation s founders? Trying to get as close to the source as he could, Ricks decided to go back and read the philosophy and literature that shaped the founders  thinking, and the letters they wrote to each other debating these crucial works among them the Iliad, Plutarch s Lives, and the works of Xenophon, Epicurus, Aristotle, Cato, and Cicero. For though much attention has been paid the influence of English political philosophers, like John Locke, closer to their own era, the founders were far more immersed in the literature of the ancient world. The first four American presidents came to their classical knowledge differently. Washington absorbed it mainly from the elite culture of his day; Adams from the laws and rhetoric of Rome; Jefferson immersed himself in classical philosophy, especially Epicureanism; and Madison, both a groundbreaking researcher and a deft politician, spent years studying the ancient world like a political scientist. Each of their experiences, and distinctive learning, played an essential role in the formation of the United States. In examining how and what they studied, looking at them in the unusual light of the classical world, Ricks is able to draw arresting and fresh portraits of men we thought we knew. First Principles follows these four members of the Revolutionary generation from their youths to their adult lives, as they grappled with questions of independence, and forming and keeping a new nation. In doing so, Ricks interprets not only the effect of the ancient world on each man, and how that shaped our constitution and government, but offers startling new insights into these legendary leaders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-hrQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Season to Be Wary","description":"This collection of three novellas provides poignant insights into the human condition with all its' moral and ethical dilemmas.

One may trace the origin of the problem of finding geodesics back to the birth of calculus. Many contemporary mathematical problems, as in the case of geodesics, may be formulated as variational problems in surfaces or in a more generalized form on manifolds. One may characterize geometric variational problems as a field of mathematics that studies global aspects of variational problems relevant in the geometry and topology of manifolds. For example, the problem of finding a surface of minimal area spanning a given frame of wire originally appeared as a mathematical model for soap films. It has also been actively investigated as a geometric variational problem. With recent developments in computer graphics, totally new aspects of the study on the subject have begun to emerge.This book is intended to be an introduction to some of the fundamental questions and results in geometric variational problems, studying variational problems on the length of curves and the energy of maps. The first two chapters treat variational problems of the length and energy of curves in Riemannian manifolds, with an in-depth discussion of the existence and properties of geodesics viewed as solutions to variational problems. In addition, a special emphasis is placed on the facts that concepts of connection and covariant differentiation are naturally induced from the formula for the first variation in this problem, and that the notion of curvature is obtained from the formula for the second variation.The last two chapters treat the variational problem on the energy of maps between two Riemannian manifolds and its solution, harmonic maps. The concept of a harmonic map includes geodesics and minimal submanifolds as examples. Its existence and properties have successfully been applied to various problems in geometry and topology. The author discusses in detail the existence theorem of Eells-Sampson, which is considered to be the most fundamental among existence theorems for harmonic maps. The proof uses the inverse function theorem for Banach spaces. It is presented to be as self-contained as possible for easy reading.Each chapter may be read independently, with minimal preparation for covariant differentiation and curvature on manifolds. The first two chapters provide readers with basic knowledge of Riemannian manifolds. Prerequisites for reading this book include elementary facts in the theory of manifolds and functional analysis, which are included in the form of appendices. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. This is the English translation of a book originally published in Japanese. It is an outgrowth of lectures delivered at Tohoku University and at the Summer Graduate Program held at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota. It would make a suitable textbook for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. This item will also be of interest to those working in analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OCHuOaYrTQ4C&dq=Variational+Problems+in+Geometry+(Translations+of+Mathematical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cold Hands, Dark Hearts: Big Eyes, Small Mouth RPG Supplement","description":"In this gothic horror setting for the Big Eyes, Small Mouth role-playing game, players take the roles of the supernatural monsters rather than the victims.

For thousands of years, people of all cultures have made and used clocks, from the city sundials of ancient Rome to the medieval water clocks of imperial China, hourglasses fomenting revolution in the Middle Ages, the Stock Exchange clock of Amsterdam in 1611, Enlightenment observatories in India, and the high-precision clocks circling the Earth on a fleet of GPS satellites that have been launched since 1978. Clocks have helped us navigate the world and build empires, and have even taken us to the brink of destruction. Elites have used them to wield power, make money, govern citizens, and control lives and sometimes the people have used them to fight back. Through the stories of twelve clocks, About Time brings pivotal moments from the past vividly to life. Historian and lifelong clock enthusiast David Rooney takes us from the unveiling of al-Jazari s castle clock in 1206, in present-day Turkey; to the Cape of Good Hope observatory at the southern tip of Africa, where nineteenth-century British government astronomers moved the gears of empire with a time ball and a gun; to the burial of a plutonium clock now sealed beneath a public park in Osaka, where it will keep time for 5,000 years. Rooney shows, through these artifacts, how time has been imagined, politicized, and weaponized over the centuries and how it might bring peace. Ultimately, he writes, the technical history of horology is only the start of the story. A history of clocks is a history of civilization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rgIDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h7xBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Castlevania:+Legacy+of+Darkness+(Prima%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sixteen Can Be Sweet","description":"This collection offers a poetic and heartbreaking guide to the trials and tribulations of today s teenagers a must-read for every teenager and their parents.

Hans Goebeler is known as the man who  pulled the plug  on U-505 in 1944 to keep his beloved U-boat out of Allied hands. Steel Boat, Iron Hearts is his no-holds-barred account of service aboard a combat U-boat. It is the only full-length memoir of its kind, and Goebeler was aboard for every one of U-505 s war patrols. Using his own experiences, log books, and correspondence with other U-boat crewmen, Goebeler offers rich and very personal details about what life was like in the German Navy under Hitler. Because his first and last posting was to U-505, Goebeler s perspective of the crew, commanders, and war patrols paints a vivid and complete portrait unlike any other to come out of the Kriegsmarine. He witnessed it all: from deadly sabotage efforts that almost sunk the boat to the tragic suicide of the only U-boat commander who took his life during WWII; from the terror and exhilaration of hunting the enemy to the seedy brothels of France. The vivid, honest, and smooth-flowing prose calls it like it was and pulls no punches. U-505 was captured by Captain Dan Gallery s Guadalcanal Task Group 22.3 on June 4, 1944. Trapped by this  Hunter-Killer  group, U-505 was depth-charged to the surface, strafed by machine gun fire, and boarded. It was the first enemy ship captured at sea since the War of 1812.

In 1997, the Scottish and Welsh both set up their own parliamentary bodies, while the tragic events in Northern Ireland continued to be a reminder of the Irish problem. These phenomena call into question widely accepted social theories which assume that ethnic attachments in a society will wane as industrialization proceeds. This book presents the social basis of ethnic identity, and examines changes in the strength of ethnic solidarity in the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries. As well as being a case study, the work also has implications, as it suggests that the internal colonialism of the kind experienced in the British Isles has its analogues in the histories of other industrial societies. Hechter examines the unexpected persistence of ethnicity in the politics of industrial societies by focusing on the British Isles. Why do many of the inhabitants of Wales, Scotland and Ireland continue to maintain an ethnic identity opposed to England? Hechter explains the salience of ethnic identity by analyzing the relationships between England, the national core, and its periphery, the Celtic fringe, in the context of two alternative models of core-periphery relations in the industrial setting. The \\"diffusion\\" model suggests that intergroup contact leads to ethnic homogenization, and the \\"internal colonial\\" model, suggests such contact heightens distinctive ethnic identification. His findings lend support to the internal colonial model, and show that, although industrialization did contribute to a decline in interregional linguistic differences, it resulted neither in the cultural assimilation of Celtic lands, nor the development of regional economic equality. The study concludes that ethnic solidarity will inevitably emerge among groups which are relegated to inferior positions in a cultural division of labour.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1zMrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latvian Mittens: Traditional Designs and Techniques","description":"Vejledning i at strikke vanter med traditionelle m?nstre fra forskellige egne af Letland","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kDsFAAAACAAJ&dq=Latvian+Mittens:+Traditional+Designs+and+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanics, molecular physics, heat, and sound (A treatise on general physics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mxlDAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon And The Thorn","description":"Grifflet, Gwenlliant of Mochdreff sets out on a perilous journey across the Shadow Lands to protect her adopted son, armed only with her failing gift for magic.

James Madison sent off this plaintive line to his wife Dolley: \\"Every thing around and within reminds me that you are absent.\\" In this inspiring collection of correspondence between U.S. presidents and their wives are hundreds of unguarded moments of affection, strain, grief, and triumph, revealing as never before the private thoughts and working partnerships of our most public figures. Culled from the holdings of the Library of Congress and various presidential libraries and private collections, it is the most comprehensive compilation of its kind ever put together. More than half of the letters included here have never before been published, making this a historic as well as a heartfelt volume that casts a warm, new light on our leaders at their most open-hearted and vulnerable. Gerard Gawalt, a curator of presidential papers at the Library of Congress for the past thirty years, has divided the book thematically into such topics as love, war, politics, travel, and sorrow. Each letter appears in its entirety, with the original spelling and grammar intact, and is set in historic context for a full sense of the moment that formed its backdrop. In most cases, exchanges are included, forming an enlightening dialogue between husband and wife. Throughout, historic photographs and artwork from the Library of Congress's collection enhance the text. Like its companion volume, First Daughters, My Dear President is bound to become a cherished gift for all those interested in American history for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nozBYUTptxwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bilbo's Last Song: At the Grey Havens","description":"Bilbo s Last Song is considered by many to be Tolkien s epilogue to his classic work The Lord of the Rings.

Instead he set up a laboratory in the attic of his father's house and unravelled one of the great mysteries of the universe. The result was the invention of wireless communication: the radio. At first only a few feet separated the transmitter from the receiver. In the days that followed, he carried his experiments into the garden, out to the fields, and behind a hill. Often disparaged by the scientific community of the day, he persisted - spanning the Atlantic, circling the world. At Signal Hill in Newfoundland, in 1901, he picked the first transatlantic communication: the three dots representing the letter S in Morse. The next year, from Table Head near Glace Bay in Nova Scotia, he transmitted the first message across the ocean by wireless. More than any other man, Marconi made the twentieth century possible. In My Father, Marconi his daughter, Degna, recounts his scientific achievements.

It analyses the significance of the dhow and how coastal communities interacted throughout their long tradition of seafaring. In addition to archival material, the work is based on extensive field research in which the voices of seamen were recorded in over 200 interviews. The book provides an integrated study of dhow activity in the area concerned and examines the consciousness of belonging to the wider culture of the Indian ocean as it is expressed in boat-building traditions, navigational techniques, crew organisation and port towns. People of the Dhow brings together the different measures of time past, the sea, its people and their material culture. The Arabian Gulf and Oman have traditionally shared a common destiny within the Western Indian Ocean. The seasonal monsoonal winds were fundamental to the physical and human unities of the seafaring communities, producing a way of life in harmony with the natural world, a world which was abruptly changed with the discovery of oil. What remains is memories of a seafaring past, a history of traditions and customs recorded here in the recollections of a dying generation and in the rich artistic heritage of the region.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0-crBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quartz family minerals: A handbook for the mineral collector","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bwIKAQAAIAAJ&dq=Quartz+family+minerals:+A+handbook+for+the+mineral+collector&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After Caroline","description":"Joanna Flynn was lucky to be alive. Twice in a matter of minutes she almost died on a patch of oil-slicked highway. But when the doctors told her that she would suffer no lasting effects, they were wrong. For that night the dream began... It was only of a house perched high above the sea, of a ticking clock and the lingering scent of roses. Yet night after night it awoke Joanna with a sense of panic. Its terror lingered throughout her days, urging her to do something but what? Then two strangers on the street called her Caroline, and Joanna knew she had to find an explanation for what was happening, or she'd lose her mind. What she finally uncovered was an obituary for a woman named Caroline McKenna a woman who looked enough like her to be her twin, a woman who was killed in a car accident on the same day Joanna should have perished. Now her torturous nightmares and a tenuous connection have brought Joanna three thousand miles across country to the town where Caroline lived--and died. Almost everyone has stories to tell about Cliffside's leading lady, and yet no one seems to have known her. Was she the shy wife or the seductress of men? The devoted mother or the selfish beauty? Too soon Joanna realizes that it's not her sanity at stake, but her life. For unraveling the mystery of Caroline means uncovering the secrets in this picturesque town, secrets someone may have killed to hide. And that someone appears all too willing to kill again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DZXo6qM6o_EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bubba Whartz Stories","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-obbQ9PaFRcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Treatments That Work","description":"Like its predecessors, this fourth edition of A Guide to Treatments That Work offers detailed chapters that review the latest research on pharmacological and psychosocial treatments that work for the full range of psychiatric and psychological disorders, written in most instances by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who have been major contributors to that literature. Similarly, the standards by which the authors were asked to evaluate the methodological rigor of the research on treatments have also remained the same. Each chapter in A Guide to Treatments That Work follows the same general outline: a review of diagnostic cues to the disorder, a discussion of changes in the nomenclatures from DSM-IV to DSM-5, and then a systematic review of research, most of which has been reported within the last few years, that represents the evidence base for the treatments reviewed. In all, 26 of the volume's 28 chapters review the evidence base for 17 major syndromes. Featuring this coverage is a Summary of Treatments that Work, an extended matrix offering a ready reference by syndrome of the conclusions reached by the chapter authors on treatments that work reviewed in their chapters. New to this edition are two chapters at the beginning of the book. Chapter 1 details two perplexing issues raised by critics of DSM-5: the unrealized potential of neuroscience biomarkers to yield more accurate and reliable diagnoses and the lingering problem of conflicts of interest in pharmaceutical research. Chapter 2 contrasts Native American and western ways of identifying effective treatments for mental and physical disorders, concluding that \\"evidence-informed culture-based\\" interventions sometimes constitute best practices in Native communities. Two chapters detailing pharmacological treatments for pediatric bipolar disorder (Chapter 9) and pediatric depressive disorder (Chapter 12) have also been added. More than three quarters of the chapters are written by colleagues who also contributed to most or all of the previous editions. Hence, this new edition provides up-to-date information on the quality of research on treatment efficacy and effectiveness provided by individuals who know the research best.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rRWCCQAAQBAJ&dq=A+Guide+to+Treatments+That+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_WV6CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Africa's Discovery of Europe 1450-1850","description":"\\"Examines the full range of African-European encounters from an unfamiliar African perspective rather than from the customary European one\\"--Publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LYkMAQAAMAAJ&dq=Africa%27s+Discovery+of+Europe+1450-1850&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebraic Geometry 2: Sheaves and Cohomology (Translations of Mathematical Monographs) (Vol 2)","description":"Modern algebraic geometry is built upon two fundamental notions: schemes and sheaves.

In the present book, the author turns to the theory of sheaves and their cohomology. Loosely speaking, a sheaf is a way of keeping track of local information defined on a topological space, such as the local algebraic functions on an algebraic manifold or the local sections of a vector bundle. Sheaf cohomology is a primary tool in understanding sheaves and using them to study properties of the corresponding manifolds. The text covers the important topics of the theory of sheaves on algebraic varieties, including types of sheaves and the fundamental operations on them, such as coherent and quasicoherent sheaves, direct and inverse images, behavior of sheaves under proper and projective morphisms, and Cech cohomology.

In 1837, Samuel Gridley Howe, director of Boston's Perkins Institution for the Blind, heard about a bright, deaf-blind seven-year-old, the daughter of New Hampshire farmers. At once he resolved to rescue her from the \\"darkness and silence of the tomb.\\" And indeed, thanks to Howe and an extraordinary group of female teachers, Laura Bridgman learned to finger spell, to read raised letters, and to write legibly and even eloquently. Philosophers, poets, educators, theologians, and early psychologists hailed Laura as a moral inspiration and a living laboratory for the most controversial ideas of the day. She quickly became a major tourist attraction, and many influential writers and reformers visited her or wrote about her. But as the Civil War loomed and her girlish appeal faded, the public began to lose interest. By the time Laura died in 1889, she had been wholly eclipsed by the prettier, more ingratiating Helen Keller. The Imprisoned Guest retrieves Laura Bridgman's forgotten life, placing it in the context of nineteenth-century American social, intellectual, and cultural history. Her troubling, tumultuous relationship with Howe, who rode Laura's achievements to his own fame but could not cope with the intense, demanding adult she became, sheds light on the contradictory attitudes of a \\"progressive\\" era in which we can find some precursors of our own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_GsX8DmDAUYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Stuff If You're Over 50","description":"There are benefits to getting older, and senior discounts and freebies are at the top of the list.

Johnson gives voice to the walls of the famous antebellum cottages that dot the city's historic district and examines the lives of the families that called them home. Who built these tiny dwellings? Who lived in their twelve hundred (or fewer) square feet of space? And what sort of world did they see when they gazed out their windows? This charming, meticulously researched book answers all these questions--and more. Who can resist the story of Dr. Samuel Furman, who was married to sisters, first Lucy and then Henrietta Williams? Or the sad tale of Edward and Jane Harden, who both died of bilious fever in 1804--he on her birthday, she on his--leaving their children in the care of slaves? Or the mystery of lively and conniving Eliza Howell, whose three husbands all died under the same circumstances?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MwNUvgAACAAJ&dq=In+a+Crooked+Little+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matched Pair (Harlequin Regency Romance)","description":"Matched Pair by Eva Rutland released on Mar 24, 1989 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vAFyo35UdQQC&dq=Matched+Pair+(Harlequin+Regency+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overtime","description":"Overtime is about the politics of time, and specifically the amount of time that we spend labouring within capitalist society. It argues that reactivating the longstanding demand for shorter working hours should be central to any progressive trajectory in the years ahead.

Will Stronge and Kyle Lewis examine the idea of reducing the time we all spend labouring for other on both a theoretical and political level, and offer an analysis rooted in the radical traditions from which the idea first emerged. Throughout, the reader is introduced to key theorists of work and working time alongside the relevant research regarding our contemporary  crisis of work , to which the authors' proposal of a shorter working week responds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMxAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Overtime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Economics, The Penguin: Sixth Edition (Dictionary, Penguin)","description":"Contains alphabetically arranged entries that provide definitions and descriptions of terms related to economics, and includes information about individual economists who have made significant contributions to contemporary economic thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0deyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Economics,+The+Penguin:+Sixth+Edition+(Dictionary,+Penguin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE RUBY COVER-UP","description":"A veteran newsman who witnessed Jack Ruby's killing of Lee Harvey Oswald throws light on Ruby's role in the Kennedy assassination and the Warren Commission findings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nDLldZhQSC8C&dq=THE+RUBY+COVER-UP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier","description":"A companion to the hit TV series ?

November 12, 2021: My name is Logan Cale though whoever finds this material will undoubtedly know me better as Eyes Only. In the years after the Pulse struck, greed, corruption, and cruelty exploded on a scale I never before imagined possible. Something had to be done. I began working as an investigative journalist to expose the truth, but the truth brought a lot of enemies out of the woodwork. So I went undercover, and EYES ONLY was born. For years, with the help of a lot of good people, we ve uncovered many wrongs and made them right. No matter what the dangers, this work needs to survive, and continue . . . especially some of the more explosive facts still need to be revealed. Facts concerning the Grand Coulee massacre, the secret government program known as The Phoenix Project, and the Conclave s breeding program, to name but a few.

Computer graphics technology is an amazing success story. Today, all of our PCs are capable of producing high-quality computer-generated images, mostly in the form of video games and virtual-life environments; every summer blockbuster movie includes jaw-dropping computer generated special effects. This book explains the fundamental concepts of 3D computer graphics. It introduces the basic algorithmic technology needed to produce 3D computer graphics, and covers such topics as understanding and manipulating 3D geometric transformations, camera transformations, the image-rendering process, and materials and texture mapping. It also touches on advanced topics including color representations, light simulation, dealing with geometric representations, and producing animated computer graphics. The book takes special care to develop an original exposition that is accessible and concise but also offers a clear explanation of the more difficult and subtle mathematical issues. The topics are organized around a modern shader-based version of OpenGL, a widely used computer graphics application programming interface that provides a real-time  rasterization-based  rendering environment. Each chapter concludes with exercises. The book is suitable for a rigorous one-semester introductory course in computer graphics for upper-level undergraduates or as a professional reference.

It is taught in American schools and regularly performed at sporting events. After the attacks on September 11th, it was sung on the steps of the Capitol, at spontaneous memorial sites, and during the seventh inning stretch at baseball games, becoming even more deeply embedded in America's collective consciousness. In God Bless America, Sheryl Kaskowitz tells the fascinating story behind America's other national anthem. It begins with the song's composition by Irving Berlin in 1918 and first performance by Kate Smith in 1938, revealing an early struggle for control between composer and performer as well as the hidden economics behind the song's royalties. Kaskowitz shows how the early popularity of \\"God Bless America\\" reflected the anxiety of the pre-war period and sparked a surprising anti-Semitic and xenophobic backlash. She follows the song's rightward ideological trajectory from early associations with religious and ethnic tolerance to increasing uses as an anthem for the Christian Right, and considers the song's popularity directly after the September 11th attacks. The book concludes with a portrait of the song's post-9/11 function within professional baseball, illuminating the power of the song - and of communal singing itself - as a vehicle for both commemoration and coercion. A companion website offers streaming audio of recordings referenced in the book, links to videos of relevant performances, appendices of information, and an opportunity for readers to participate in the author's survey. Based on extensive archival research and fieldwork, God Bless America sheds new light on cultural tensions within the U.S., past and present, and offers a historical chronicle that is full of surprises and that will both edify and delight readers from all walks of life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uLBi63QhmcQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man For Megan (The Ultimate ...)

This remarkably frank autobiographical diary and personal confession attempts to describe a difficult relationship as it reveals two tempestuous decades of the author's unhappy marriage and her growing indignation at rival wives and mistresses. Too impetuous to be satisfied as a subsidiary wife, this beautiful (and unnamed) noblewoman of the Heian dynasty protests the marriage system of her time in one of Japanese literature's earliest attempts to portray difficult elements of the predominant social hierarchy. A classic work of early Japanese prose, The Gossamer Years is an important example of the development of Heian literature, which, at its best, represents an extraordinary flowering of realistic expression, an attempt, unique for its age, to treat the human condition with frankness and honesty. A timeless and intimate glimpse into the culture of ancient Japan, this translation by Edward Seidensticker paints a revealing picture of married life in the Heian period.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gC_RAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By the Torch of Chaos and Doubt: Consciousness, Culture, Poiesis, and Religion in the Opening Global Millennium (Advances in Systems Theory, Complexity, and the Human Sciences)","description":"\\"This book relies on the insights of ancient and postmodern religious and noetic consciousness, continental philosophy, themes of critical theory, contemporary theorise of self-organizing systems and hermeneutic auto-poiesis, on Jean Gebser's ideas of consciousness structures and on related ideas from hermeneutic ontology and mythopoeia concerning the knack and practical wisdom of non-dualizingly ecopoetic-mind/language-as-nature.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zvXAAAAMAAJ&dq=By+the+Torch+of+Chaos+and+Doubt:+Consciousness,+Culture,+Poiesis,+and+Religion+in+the+Opening+Global+Millennium+(Advances+in+Systems+Theory,+Complexity,+and+the+Human+Sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reward Starter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Dv6zQEACAAJ&dq=Reward+Starter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primitive Wilderness Skills, Applied & Advanced","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jPePFI5tzcC&dq=Primitive+Wilderness+Skills,+Applied&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of the Psychic","description":"The X Files, The Haunting, The Sixth Sense, and The Blair Witch Project clearly show that the public has a tremendous fascination with the paranormal and the occult, and the media is all too eager to cater to people's wildest fantasies and fears. At a time when there is growing acceptance of pseudoscience and claims of psychic phenomena, this penetrating analysis of so-called psychic abilities is a long overdue and thorough refutation of the whole psi craze. In regard to ESP, the Ganzfeld research, and the extraordinary claims of \\"mentalists,\\" psychologist David Marks uncovers a long trail of deception, conjuring tricks, and scientific bungling. He also goes to great pains to examine the claims of serious parapsychologists such as Russell Targ, Harold Puthoff, Edwin C. May, the late Charles Honorton, Rupert Sheldrake, Jessica Utts, and Nobel Prize winner Brian D. Josephson. Not only does he provide an interesting account of what these leading figures think they have discovered, but he also offers lucid explanations of why they are mistaken. Included along with these fascinating investigations is a discussion of why so many people today are prone to believe in the reality of psi phenomena. In the final chapter, titled \\"The Art of Doubt,\\" the author explores the positive role of skepticism in the progress of genuine science. For all those who value science's ability to separate sense from nonsense, The Psychology of the Psychic will come as welcome relief. The devastating conclusions will shock those who believe that psi is a proven reality. This book gives psi the knockout blow!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6_x-AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Psychology+of+the+Psychic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirty-Two Basic Steps into Urdu Vocabulary: A Vocabulary Workbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ipBjAAAAMAAJ&dq=Thirty-Two+Basic+Steps+into+Urdu+Vocabulary:+A+Vocabulary+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (Audio Cassette Edition)","description":"Jeffrey Archer's collection of twelve spellbinding stories, A Twist in the Tale, will sweep you on a journey of thwarted ambition, undying passion, and unswerving honor that you'll never forget.

Each of the twenty-seven books, written by various authors, has its own theological emphasis and nuances. How do we elicit a coherent message from such theological diversity, especially given that some of the theological statements in the New Testament seem to be at odds with one another? Is such an endeavor achievable or even valid? Theology of the New Testament takes a balanced approach in response to these challenges. Frank Thielman presents a theology of the New Testament that is careful to take into account the cultural and historical circumstances surrounding each book and the New Testament as a whole. He not only examines each book s theological content individually, but also in relation to the rest of the New Testament, particularly within each of the three theological units that comprise the New Testament: the gospels and Acts, the Pauline epistles, and the general epistles and Revelation. This canonical and synthetic approach honors both the theological diversity of the various books and the theological connections between the books. In the end, Thielman finds a unified theological vision of the New Testament, anchored in the centrality of Jesus Christ. Frank Thielman s Theology of the New Testament is an outstanding achievement. The book is marked by scholarly depth, exegetical rigor, and theological profundity. Both students and professors will profit immensely from this lucid treatment of the theology contained in the New Testament documents. Thomas R. Schreiner Professor of New Testament, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary An accessible presentation of the key theological points of the New Testament books by an accomplished New Testament scholar and teacher. Its clear style, lucid organization, and sound theological insight make it a prime resource for serious students in both the academy and the church. Karen H.

In this collection we can see over two decades of the growth of a poet memorable for the clarity, strength, and urgency of her voice. Anderson s poems entangle a language, a history, and a group of belongings, and she is both at home and a foreigner in the places she invokes. Every place in these poems seems inhabitable, yet the tensions of these deceptively quiet lines develop out of the clear reluctance or inability of the poet to sit still. Maggie Anderson writes out of deep grief for the political losses of work and money, of life and limb and home in our dangerous times. She remembers and witnesses, and she also speaks eloquently for our private griefs the loss of family, vitality and self. These poems do not shout; we listen as if following a whisper in the dark. A counterpoint to the sorrows in these poems is a complex and often joyous music, as well as a wry, sometimes self-deprecating humor which saves the work from solemnity. Her rhythms are diverse and intricate; they move deftly from fiddle whine to saxophone, from fugue to blues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g7uwAAAAIAAJ&dq=Windfall:+New+and+Selected+Poems+(Pitt+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aesthetic Vedanta : The Sacred Path of Passionate Love'","description":"\\"Encyclopedia of World Religions\\" explores the major religions of the world, emphasizing the living faiths and their background.

This is the first book exclusively devoted to Wittgenstein's aesthetics, exploring the themes developed by Wittgenstein in his own writing on aesthetics as well as the implications of Wittgenstein's wider philosophical views for understanding central issues in aesthetics. Drawing together original contributions from leading international scholars, this book will be an important addition to studies of Wittgenstein's thought, but its discussion of issues in literature, music and performing art, and criticism will also be of interest to many students of literary and cultural studies. Exploring three key themes - the capacity of the arts to illuminate our lives; the nature of the particular responses involved in understanding and appreciating works of art; the role of theory and principle in artistic and critical practice - the contributors address issues raised by contemporary philosophers of art, and seek to make connections between Wittgenstein's work and that of other significant philosophies of art in the Western tradition. Displaying the best practice of modern philosophical writing - clarity, cogency, respect for but not blind obedience to common sense, argument illustrated with detailed examples, rejection of speculation and pretension - this book demonstrates how philosophy can make a valuable contribution to understanding the arts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oAkkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santorini","description":"When the Greek island of Santorini, classically known as Thera, erupted dramatically in 1613 BC (+/- 13 years), it produced one of the largest explosions ever witnessed, thereby possibly giving rise to the legend of Atlantis. This so-called 'Minoan' eruption triggered tsunamis that devastated coastal settlements in the region, and on Santorini it left behind a Bronze Age Pompeii, which is currently being excavated. Thriving Bronze Age settlements on the island - rich in colorful wall paintings and highly sophisticated pottery - were buried under thick layers of volcanic ash. The ejection of an immense volume of dust into the atmosphere also altered global climate for several years. The author, a well-known geologist, blends the thrill of scientific discovery with a popular presentation of the geology, archeology, history, peoples, and environmental settings of the island group of Santorini. He not only gives a comprehensive overview of the volcanic island and its past, but also reports on the latest discoveries: The finding, for example, of the olive trees which had been buried alive by the Minoan eruption has made it possible now to give a direct and precise radiocarbon date for the volcanic catastrophe. Furthermore, he seeks to assign certain geological structures, such as faulted rocks, red lavas and harbor sites, as depicted on the Bronze Age frescos from Santorini, to still-existing details in the Santorini landscape of today. Excellent color photographs and illustrations along with easily understandable scientific and historic details will make this book highly appealing to a wide audience. It will also be useful as a supplementary text for introductory courses in earth and atmospheric science, geology, volcanology, and paleoclimatology, as well as ancient history and archeology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U3gFzwEACAAJ&dq=Santorini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Management for Dummies, Briefcase Edition","description":"Do you have a habit of coming to work early, staying late, and working on your weekends?

Sex, Murder and a Double Latte Mystery writer Sophie Katz suspects that a crazed fan is sneaking into her apartment to reenact scenes from her books. And when a filmmaker friend is brutally murdered in the manner of a death scene from one of his movies, she's convinced that a copycat killer is on the loose and that she's the next target. The man who swoops in to save her is the mysterious new love interest Anatoly Darinsky. Of course, if this were fiction, Anatoly would be her prime suspect.  Passion, Betrayal and Killer Highlights When her brother-in-law turns up dead and her sister is accused of the crime, Sophie's priority is finding the real killer. With or without Anatoly's help. Her brother-in-law's secret life yields plenty of suspects, but the San Francisco police aren't taking any of them seriously. So Sophie does what comes naturally to her: she stirs up trouble (to lure the killer out, of course). Obsession, Deceit and Really Dark Chocolate Sophie's relationship with the irresistible and occasionally insufferable Anatoly is on the rocks when a friend recruits Sophie to decode her allegedly two-timing husband's strange behavior. Suddenly plunged into a crazy world of campaign mudslinging, dirt-digging and cover-ups, Sophie begins to uncover some pretty dirty secrets indeed.

Steeped in folklore and fantasy, it is a rich and diverse account of the part that fairies and fairy stories have played in culture and society. The pretty pastel world of gauzy-winged things who grant wishes and make dreams come true as brought to you by Disney's fairies flitting across a woodland glade, or Tinkerbell s magic wand is predated by a darker, denser world of gorgons, goblins, and gellos; the ancient antecedents of Shakespeare's mischievous Puck or J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. For, as Diane Purkiss explains in this engrossing history, ancient fairies were born of fear: fear of the dark, of death, and of other great rites of passage, birth and sex. To understand the importance of these early fairies to pre-industrial peoples, we need to recover that sense of dread. This book begins with the earliest manifestations of fairies in ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. The child-killing demons and nymphs of these cultures are the joint ancestors of the medieval fairies of northern Europe, when fairy figures provided a bridge between the secular and the sacred. Fairies abducted babies and virgins, spirited away young men who were seduced by fairy queens and remained suspended in liminal states. Tamed by Shakespeare's view of the spirit world, Victorian fairies fluttered across the theater stage and the pages of children's books to reappear a century later as detergent trade marks and alien abductors. In learning about these often strange and mysterious creatures, we learn something about ourselves our fears and our desires.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4JblNAAACAAJ&dq=At+the+Bottom+of+the+Garden:+A+Dark+History+of+Fairies,+Hobgoblins,+Nymphs,+and+Other+Troublesome+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hippopotamus Marsh: Lords of the Two Lands (Lords of the Two Lands, Vol 1)","description":"The first in a trilogy about the descendants of the last true king of Egypt who revolt against foreign rule.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=__UIAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hippopotamus+Marsh:+Lords+of+the+Two+Lands+(Lords+of+the+Two+Lands,+Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Technique of Health and Happiness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JuQ0HAAACAAJ&dq=Yoga:+The+Technique+of+Health+and+Happiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Demons in Denominations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"P.C.

For a passionate young Mormon who had grown up in the Church, finding authentic faith meant giving up all he knew: his community, his ambitions, and his place in the world. Yet as Micah struggled to reconcile the teachings of his Church with the truths revealed in the Bible, he awakened to his need for God s grace. This led him to be summoned to the door of the mission president, terrified but confident in the testimony he knew could cost him everything.

In the early 1990s, hopes for the eastward spread of liberal democracy were high. And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only there but also back in the heartland of the West. In this brilliant work of political psychology, Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes argue that the supposed end of history turned out to be only the beginning of an Age of Imitation. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized. Through this prism, the Trump revolution represents an ironic fulfillment of the promise that the nations exiting from communist rule would come to resemble the United States. In a strange twist, Trump has elevated Putin's Russia and Orb n's Hungary into models for the United States.

Globalization, migration, and the erosion of nationhood is creating far more linguistic minorities as society becomes increasingly pluralistic. One of the major sites of contact between languages is the school, and this book focuses on linguistic interaction within this educational context. Through a careful examination of the language practices in the daily life of a school, Monica Heller explores issues such as changing language policy, bilingualism, identity, power, ideology and gender from the point of view of the minority speaker. In so doing she provdies a fresh new insight into this important area of sociolinguistics. Linguistic Minorities and Modernity is written in an accessible and lively narrative style, and uses real-life examples and case studies to illustrate the discussions. The text has been revised throughout, and includes a new introduction by the author. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fPsRjx3TDpEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Consumer's Guide to Dog Food: What's in Dog Food, Why It's There and How to Choose the Best Food for Your Dog","description":"The wooftasticsecond edition.

Goriot's fate is intertwined with two other fellow boarders: the young social climber Eugene Rastignac, who sees a way to gain the acceptance and wealth he craves, and the enigmatic figure of Vautrin, who is hiding darker secrets than anyone.

This magical account of King Arthur s last night on earth, rediscovered in a collection of T. H. White s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, spent twenty-six weeks on the New York Times bestseller list following its publication in 1977. While preparing for his final, fatal battle with his bastard son, Mordred, Arthur returns to the Animal Council with Merlyn, where the deliberations center on ways to abolish war. More self-revealing than any other of White s books, Merlyn shows his mind at work as he agonized over whether to join the fight against Nazi Germany while penning the epic that would become The Once and Future King. The Book of Merlyn has been cited as a major influence by such illustrious writers as Kazuo Ishiguro, J. K. Rowling, Helen Macdonald, Neil Gaiman, and Lev Grossman.  Arriving from beyond the curve of time and apparently from the grave, The Book of Merlyn stirs its own pages, saying, wait: you didn t get the whole story. . . . It gives us a final glimpse of those two immortal characters, Wart and Merlyn, up close, slo-mo, with a considered and affectionate scrutiny.

This book offers a radical new perspective on the limits and the accomplishments of the modern traditions of textual criticism in classics. Sean Alexander Gurd takes as his starting point the case of a single Greek tragedy by Euripides, one of his last. According to ancient accounts, the Iphigenia at Aulis was produced at the city Dionysia, the great festival of Athenian tragedy, sometime after Euripides died (between 407 and 405 BCE). Whether the text performed then was entirely the work of Euripides, and whether the version that appears in the manuscripts reflects either that performance or its defunct author's design, are unknown. But since the mid-eighteenth-century the mysteries and conflicting evidence concerning Iphigenia at Aulis have given rise to an array of different attempts to reconstruct the original, and every generation has seen a version of the play that is radically different from those that came before. Gurd pioneers a literary philology comfortable with this textual multiplicity, capable of reading Iphigenias at Aulis in the plural. Regarding the dossier of successive editions of Iphigenia at Aulis as a symbol for the condition of modern textual reason, Gurd shows lovers of classical literature exactly how contingent the texts they read really are.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Euripides,+Iphigenie+in+Aulis+(Wiener+Studien)+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Physician's Guide to Domestic Violence: How to Ask the Right Questions and Recognize Abuse","description":"Despite the prevalence of battered women in the medical setting, many physicians fail to correctly identify and refer abused patients. The introductory chapter of this book discusses definitions of domestic violence, issues of power and control, the prevalence of the problem, the effect of domestic violence on the medical system, and reasons why physicians fail to identify abuse. The profile of domestic violence victims is discussed in terms of gender, ethnic and socioeconomic status, age, marital status, personality traits, sexual orientation, pregnancy, disabilities, immigration status, use of alcohol and drugs, family history, relationship variables, and abuse of children. Issues pertaining to abusers discussed here include substance abuse, critical risk factors, dominance of men over women, and secrecy and denial. Recognition of domestic violence can be improved through patient history and demeanor, companion's behavior, direct questioning, routine screening, and physical examination. When abuse is detected, the physician has many avenues for action: referrals to services and shelters, documentation, treatment, counseling, legal services, and follow-up care. Specific legal issues may include mandatory reporting, duty to warn, liability for reporting, and legal options for the patient.

In her practice as a psychologist, Margo Rivera has found this to be no coincidence. Confirming that the root of most severe dissociative conditions lies in severe trauma, most commonly child abuse, Rivera first discusses the general historical and social contexts of dissociation and proceeds through clinical theory, case vignettes, and recorded personal experience to provide practical guidance to assessment and treatment. Rivera covers such topics as 'therapeutic frame,' 'transference and countertransference,' and how to understand and make use of these concepts. She discusses the controversies around 'False Memory Syndrome' and ritual abuse, issues which currently divide professionals treating trauma survivors. Rivera makes a unique contribution to the treatment of lesbian and gay abuse survivors. She theorizes that all sexuality is a social construct, subject to change over an individual's lifetime, a reality that is nowhere more clear than in those with MPD who may experience themselves as alternately heterosexual female, homosexual male, lesbian, and heterosexual male. Insightful and provocative, this important therapeutic guide will be of interest to professionals who treat trauma survivors as well as to their clients.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pd85AQAAIAAJ&dq=More+Alike+Than+Different:+Treating+Severely+Dissociative+Trauma+Survivors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witchcraft An Alternative Path","description":"Readers will discover the beliefs and practices of the alternative path of Witchcraft.

Most importantly, it provides a common ground for children and their parents to talk about one of their most stressful daily rituals.

In a fresh and contemplative style, Arthur sits alongside Mom and helps her understand that God is in control . . . even when her life feels drastically out of control. This devotional will be a great companion for Mom during the small amount of time she gets to sit and be still and think of the truths of God's word, while relating it to her new favorite subject--her baby.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=viXAaAssJ3sC&dq=Devotions+for+a+New+Mother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Penguin Dictionary of Business (Penguin Reference)","description":"Clearly written, with up-to-the-minute information and packed with practical and relevant examples, The New Penguin Dictionary of Business is the perfect book for anyone-whether student or working professional-who needs to know the latest jargon in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gLRIAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+New+Penguin+Dictionary+of+Business+(Penguin+Reference)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Message of a Master","description":"The Message of a Master is the story of a seemingly miraculous change that takes place in a man after he meets a true master of life.

The interview was awkward and brief, but before it ended something had clicked into place. For the next two years, Valerie devoted her life to Hemingway and his wife, Mary, traveling with them through beloved old haunts in Spain and France and living with them during the tumultuous final months in Cuba. In name a personal secretary, but in reality a confidante and sharer of the great man s secrets and sorrows, Valerie literally came of age in the company of one of the greatest literary lions of the twentieth century. Five years after his death, Valerie became a Hemingway herself when she married the writer s estranged son Gregory. Now, at last, she tells the story of the incredible years she spent with this extravagantly talented and tragically doomed family. In prose of brilliant clarity and stinging candor, Valerie evokes the magic and the pathos of Papa Hemingway s last years. Swept up in the wild revelry that always exploded around Hemingway, Valerie found herself dancing in the streets of Pamplona, cheering bullfighters at Valencia, careening around hairpin turns in Provence, and savoring the panorama of Paris from her attic room in the Ritz. But it was only when Hemingway threatened to commit suicide if she left that she realized how troubled the aging writer wasand how dependent he had become on her. In Cuba, Valerie spent idyllic days and nights typing the final draft of A Moveable Feast, even as Castro s revolution closed in. After Hemingway shot himself, Valerie returned to Cuba with his widow, Mary, to sort through thousands of manuscript pages and smuggle out priceless works of art. It was at Ernest s funeral that Valerie, then a researcher for Newsweek, met Hemingway s son Gregoryand again a chance encounter drastically altered the course of her life. Their twenty-one-year marriage finally unraveled as Valerie helplessly watched her husband succumb to the demons that had plagued him since childhood. From lunches with Orson Welles to midnight serenades by mysterious troubadours, from a rooftop encounter with Castro to numbing hospital vigils, Valerie Hemingway played an intimate, indispensable role in the lives of two generations of Hemingways. This memoir, by turns luminous, enthralling, and devastating, is the account of what she enjoyed, and what she endured, during her astonishing years of living as a Hemingway.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9Tdm1_QKwbcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Log Parser Toolkit: A complete toolkit for Microsoft's undocumented log analysis tool","description":"Written by Microsoft's Log Parser developer, this is the first book available on Microsoft's popular yet undocumented log parser tool.

During the frontier days when Americans battled with and exiled native peoples from the East, Indiana was on the leading edge of America s westward expansion. As waves of immigrants swept across the Appalachians and eastern waterways, Indiana became established as both a crossroads and as a vital part of Middle America.

For five-year-old Greg, it was the memory of his ma walking back to the house after confronting his stepdad with a splintered, bloodied baseball bat in her hand. Greg Stier was raised in a family of bodybuilding, tobacco-chewing, fist-fighting thugs. He never knew his biological father because his mom had met his dad at a party; she got pregnant, and he left town. Though his mom almost aborted him, in a last-minute twist, Greg's life was spared for so much more. Unlikely Fighter is the incredible story of how God showed up in Greg's life--and how he can show up in yours as well. This is a memoir of violence and mayhem--and how God can transform everything.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N74-EAAAQBAJ&dq=Prayer+Changes+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer of the Gun","description":"2020 J. ANTHONY LUKAS PRIZE WINNER From the bestselling author of There Are No Children Here, a richly textured, heartrending portrait of love and death in Chicago's most turbulent neighborhoods. The numbers are staggering: over the past twenty years in Chicago, 14,033 people have been killed and another roughly 60,000 wounded by gunfire. What does that do to the spirit of individuals and community? Drawing on his decades of experience, Alex Kotlowitz set out to chronicle one summer in the city, writing about individuals who have emerged from the violence and whose stories capture the capacity--and the breaking point--of the human heart and soul. The result is a spellbinding collection of deeply intimate profiles that upend what we think we know about gun violence in America. Among others, we meet a man who as a teenager killed a rival gang member and twenty years later is still trying to come to terms with what he's done; a devoted school social worker struggling with her favorite student, who refuses to give evidence in the shooting death of his best friend; the witness to a wrongful police shooting who can't shake what he has seen; and an aging former gang leader who builds a place of refuge for himself and his friends. Applying the close-up, empathic reporting that made There Are No Children Here a modern classic, Kotlowitz offers a piercingly honest portrait of a city in turmoil. These sketches of those left standing will get into your bones. This one summer will stay with you.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FItfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pastor's Assignment (Heartsong Presents #641)","description":"When Laney Varner's pastor assigns his congregation to rid themselves of all regrets, Laney doesn't have to think about it; she knows what her regrets are.

Initially isolated from its Hindu and Muslim neighbors by social and religious barriers, the small Korlai community lost virtually all Portuguese contact as well after 1740. This volume is the first-ever comprehensive treatment of the formation, linguistic components, and rapidly changing situation of this exotic creole. The product of ten years of research, Korlai Creole Portuguese provides an exciting, in-depth diachronic look at a language that is now showing the strain of intense cultural pressure from the surrounding Marathi-speaking population. Framed in Thomason and Kaufman's 1988 model of contact-induced language change, the author's analysis is enriched by numerous comparisons with sister creoles, apart from medieval Portuguese and Marathi. This book contrastively examines the following areas: phonemic inventories, phonological processes, stress assignment, syllable structure, paradigm restructuring, paradigm use, lexicon, word formation, semantic borrowing, loan translations, grammatical relation marking, pre- and postnominal modification, negation, subject and object deletion, embedding, and word order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2qDqzm7-fcC&dq=The+Genesis+of+a+Language:+The+formation+and+development+of+Korlai+Portuguese+(Creole+Language+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing in the Dark","description":"To outsiders, Rikki Kasnett is a model student; co-dance head for the upcoming school production; a fun-loving friend.

Although he was little-known in his lifetime, in the mid-to-late 20th century A. W. Pink gained great renown for his simple yet resounding books.

Frank Baum: Creator Of Oz","description":"Since it was first introduced over a hundred years ago in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum's world of Oz has become one of the most enduring and beloved creations in children's literature. It has influenced numerous prominent writers and intellectuals, and become a lasting part of the culture itself. L. Frank Baum was born in 1856 in upstate New York, the seventh child of a very successful barrel-maker and later oil producer. However, Baum's own career path was a rocky one. Beginning as an actor, Baum tried working as a traveling salesman, the editor of a small town newspaper and the publisher of a trade journal on retailing, failing to distinguish himself in any occupation. His careers either failed to provide a sufficient living for his beloved wife Maud and their children or were so exhausting as to be debilitating. In the 1890's, L. Frank Baum took the advice of his mother-in-law, suffragist leader Matilda Gage, and turned his attention to trying to sell the stories he'd been telling to his sons and their friends. After a few children's books published with varying success, he published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900 and it quickly became a bestseller and has remained so ever since. In this first full-length adult biography of Baum, Rogers discusses some of the aspects that made his work unique and has likely contributed to Oz's long-lasting appeal, including Baum's early support of feminism and how it was reflected in his characters, his interest in Theosophy and how it took form in his books, and the celebration in his stories of traditional American values. Grounding his imaginative creations, particularly in his fourteen Oz books, in the reality of his day, Katharine M. Rogers explores the fascinating life and influences of America's greatest writer for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kxePw8MEs-oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Origins of the Gulag: The Soviet Prison Camp System, 1917-1934","description":"A vast network of prison camps was an essential part of the Stalinist system. Conditions in the camps were brutal, life expectancy short. At their peak, they housed millions, and hardly an individual in the Soviet Union remained untouched by their tentacles. Michael Jakobson's is the first study to examine the most crucial period in the history of the camps: from the October Revolution of 1917, when the tsarist prison system was destroyed to October 1934, when all places of confinement were consolidated under one agency -- the infamous GULAG. The prison camps served the Soviet government in many ways: to isolate opponents and frighten the population into submission, to increase labor productivity through the arrest of \\"inefficient\\" workers, and to provide labor for factories, mines, lumbering, and construction projects. Jakobson focuses on the structure and interrelations of prison agencies, the Bolshevik views of crime and punishment and inmate reeducation, and prison self-sufficiency. He also describes how political conditions and competition among prison agencies contributed to an unprecedented expansion of the system. Finally, he disputes the official claim of 1931 that the system was profitable -- a claim long accepted by former inmates and Western researchers and used to explain the proliferation of the camps and their population. Did Marxism or the Bolshevik Revolution or Leninism inexorably lead to the GULAG system? Were its origins truly evil or merely banal? Jakobson's important book probes the official record to cast new light on a system that for a time supported but ultimately helped destroy the now fallen Soviet colossus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5rEfBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kindly Ones","description":" Oh my human brothers, let me tell you how it happened.  Dr. Max Aue, the man at the heart of Jonathan Littell s stunning and controversial novel The Kindly Ones, personifies the evils of the Second World War and the Holocaust. Highly educated and cultured, he was an ambitious SS officer, a Nazi and mass murderer who was in the upper echelons of the Third Reich. He tells us of his experience during the war. He was present at Auschwitz and Babi Yar, witnessed the battle of Stalingrad, and survived the fall of Berlin   receiving a medal from Hitler personally in the last days of Nazi Germany. Long after the war, he is living a comfortable bourgeois life in France, married with two children, managing a lace factory. And now, having evaded justice, he speaks out, giving a precise and accurate record of his life. The tone of his account is detached, lapidary, and for the most part unrepentant, whether he is describing his participation in mass murder on the Eastern Front, his bureaucratic investigations of labour productivity in the death camps, his casual murder of civilians as he tries to break through Russian lines towards the end of the war, or his fervid and convoluted relationship with his twin sister. Over its course, by entwining Aue s life with those of historical figures such as Eichmann and Speer, Himmler and indeed Hitler, The Kindly Ones comes to depict the entire architecture of Nazism   from its grandest intellectual pretensions to its most minute, most chilling managerial details and executions. The Kindly Ones presents   with unprecedented realism, meticulous research that is both fascinating and compelling, and brilliant literary accomplishment   the greatest horrors imaginable.  War and murder are a question, a question without an answer, for when you cry out in the night, no one answers,  Aue says. In the same way, this powerfully affecting, powerfully challenging book confronts the reader with the most profound questions about history, morality, and art without offering any easy resolution. Written originally in French, and published now in English for the first time, The Kindly Ones has already sold to date well over a million copies in Europe. In France it won two prestigious prizes, including the Goncourt, and has been compared to War and Peace and other great classics of literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VphKmPlIBPAC&dq=The+Kindly+Ones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Rock - A Tale of the Selkirks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=REcgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Rock+-+A+Tale+of+the+Selkirks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karate in Action (Sport in action)","description":"Defines martial arts and different disciplies such as karate and judo, and discusses clothing, warming up, and basic moves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3IrARQQZp1sC&dq=Karate+in+Action+(Sport+in+action)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon III: Buffoon, Modern Dictator, or Sphinx?

These seminal ideas concern the nature of evolution itself, God, human beings, the relationship between God and us, our destiny, and the means by which we come to know God, our Selves, and attain that destiny. These ideas, and others, are considered in the light of both certain recent works purported to be revelations including the With God books of Neale Walsch, A Course In Miracles, and The Urantia Book, and through several older spiritual traditions. Emphasis is given to the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with their impact on the scientific basis of spirituality. Also explored are the ramifications of these ideas on our understanding of reality, knowledge, health, social progress, and world peace. The evolution and nature of scientific knowledge is reviewed demonstrating the growing convergence between scientific and spiritual truth.

THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eKo12pRg-gIC&dq=La+Catastrophe:+Mount+Pele+and+the+Destruction+of+Saint-Pierre,+Martinique&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spades and Rednecks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H6b1wAEACAAJ&dq=Spades+and+Rednecks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jesus Prayer","description":"\\"'To pronounce the name of Jesus in a holy way is an all-sufficient and surpassing aim for any human life...We are to call to mind Jesus Christ as until the name of the Lord penetrates our heart, descends to its very depths...The Name of Jesus, once it has become the center of our life, brings everything together.\\" So writes the \\"Monk of the Eastern Church\\" in the course of the present work. To those who wonder how such claims can be advanced on behalf of the Jesus Prayer, and how it is that this particular way of praying continues to appeal so powerfully to contemporary Christians, Eastern and Western, Orthodox and non-Orthodox, this short book provides an answer. Starting with the veneration of the Holy Name in the Old and the New Testament, the author traces the gradual development of the Jesus Prayer first in Byzantium and then in the Slav lands. He concludes with practical suggestions for its use today, showing how it is a prayer not only of the past but equally for the twentieth century. Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that the \\"way of the name,\\" as he calls it, is being followed by more Christians in our own day than ever before - a striking sign of hope in an age of anxiety. Simple yet profound, this book reveals to us the secret of the continuing attraction exercised by the Jesus Prayer. Since its first appearance some thirty-five years ago, it has become a minor \\"classic\\" of the spiritual life, and it still remains the best introduction to the subject\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EmpxW57jm7IC&dq=The+Jesus+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Feminism and Psychoanalysis","description":"In this landmark collection of original essays, outstanding feminist critics in Britain, France, and the United States present new perspectives on feminism and psychoanalysis, opening out deadlocked debates.

The staunchest of Federalists in the 1780s, Madison would turn on his former allies shortly thereafter, renouncing their expansive nationalism as a threat to the Constitution and to popular government. In a study that combines penetrating textual analysis with deep historical awareness, Gary Rosen stakes out important new ground by showing the philosophical consistency in Madison's long and controversial public life. The key, he argues, is Madison's profound originality as a student of the social compact, the venerable liberal idea into which he introduced several novel, and seemingly illiberal, principles. Foremost among these was the need for founding to be the work of an elite few. For Madison, prior accounts of the social compact, in their eagerness to establish the proper ends of government, provided a hopelessly naive account of its origin. As he saw it, the Federal Convention of 1787 was an opportunity for those of outstanding prudence (understood in its fullest Aristotelian sense) to do for the people what they could not do for themselves. This troublesome reliance on the few was balanced, Rosen contends, by Madison's commitment to republicanism as an end in itself, a conclusion that he likewise drew from the social compact, accommodating the proud political claims that his philosophical predecessors had failed to recognize. Rosen goes on to show how Madison's idiosyncratic understanding of the social compact illuminates his differences not only with Hamilton but with Jefferson as well. Both men, Madison feared, were too ready to resort to original principles in coming to terms with the Constitution, putting at risk the fragile achievement of the founding in their determination to invoke, respectively, the claims of the few and the many. As American Compact persuasively concludes, Madison's ideas on the origin and aims of the Constitution are not just of historical interest. They carry crucial lessons for our own day, and speak directly to current disputes over diversity, constitutional interpretation, the fate of federalism, and the possibilities and limits of American citizenship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5t6GAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Compact:+James+Madison+and+the+Problem+of+Founding+(American+Political+Thought+(University+Press+of+Kansas))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clowning through baseball,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=66-yAAAACAAJ&dq=Clowning+through+baseball,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bonhoeffer's the Cost of Discipleship (Shepherd's Notes.

America's ability to remain oblivious to these new movements ended on September 11, 2001. The Islamist fanatics in the global Salafi jihad (the violent, revivalist social movement of which al Qaeda is a part) target the West, but their operations mercilessly slaughter thousands of people of all races and religions throughout the world. Marc Sageman challenges conventional wisdom about terrorism, observing that the key to mounting an effective defense against future attacks is a thorough understanding of the networks that allow these new terrorists to proliferate. Based on intensive study of biographical data on 172 participants in the jihad, Understanding Terror Networks gives us the first social explanation of the global wave of activity. Sageman traces its roots in Egypt, gestation in Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war, exile in the Sudan, and growth of branches worldwide, including detailed accounts of life within the Hamburg and Montreal cells that planned attacks on the United States. U.S. government strategies to combat the jihad are based on the traditional reasons an individual was thought to turn to terrorism: poverty, trauma, madness, and ignorance. Sageman refutes all these notions, showing that, for the vast majority of the mujahedin, social bonds predated ideological commitment, and it was these social networks that inspired alienated young Muslims to join the jihad. These men, isolated from the rest of society, were transformed into fanatics yearning for martyrdom and eager to kill. The tight bonds of family and friendship, paradoxically enhanced by the tenuous links between the cell groups (making it difficult for authorities to trace connections), contributed to the jihad movement's flexibility and longevity. And although Sageman's systematic analysis highlights the crucial role the networks played in the terrorists' success, he states unequivocally that the level of commitment and choice to embrace violence were entirely their own. Understanding Terror Networks combines Sageman's scrutiny of sources, personal acquaintance with Islamic fundamentalists, deep appreciation of history, and effective application of network theory, modeling, and forensic psychology. Sageman's unique research allows him to go beyond available academic studies, which are light on facts, and journalistic narratives, which are devoid of theory. The result is a profound contribution to our understanding of the perpetrators of 9/11 that has practical implications for the war on terror.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iCoYDUv63L8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solo Faces: A Novel","description":"A novel about a lonely mountain climber from the author of All That Is:  Beautifully composed . . . will remind readers of Camus and Saint-Exup ry  (The Washington Post).

Conceived as a major contribution to postcolonial studies, cultural studies, cultural anthropology, and regional studies of the Caribbean and the Americas, Cross-Cultural Studies illuminates the interrelations between and among Europe, the Caribbean islands, Africa, and the American continents from the late fifteenth century to the present. Scholars from five continents bring to bear on the most salient issues of Caribbean literature theoretical and critical positions that are currently in the forefront of discussion in literature, the arts, and public policy. Among the major issues treated at length in Cross-Cultural Studies are: The history and construction of racial inequality in Caribbean colonization; The origins and formation of literatures in various Creoles; The gendered literary representation of the Caribbean region; The political and ideological appropriation of Caribbean history in creating the idea of national culture in North and South America, Europe, and Africa; The role of the Caribbean in contemporary theories of Modernism and the Postmodern; The decentering of such canonical authors as Shakespeare; The vexed but inevitable connectedness of Caribbean literature with both its former colonial metropoles and its geographical neighbors. Contributions to Cross-Cultural Studies give a concrete cultural and historical analysis of such contemporary critical terms as hybridity, transculturation, and the carnivalesque, which have so often been taken out of context and employed in narrowly ideological contexts. Two important theories of the simultaneous unity and diversity of Caribbean literature and culture, propounded by Antonio Ben tez-Rojo and +douard Glissant, receive extended treatment that places them strategically in the debate over multiculturalism in postcolonial societies and in the context of chaos theory. A contribution by Ben tez-Rojo permits the reader to test the theory through his critical practice. Divided into nine thematic and methodological sections followed by a complete index to the names and dates of authors and significant historical figures discussed, Cross-Cultural Studies will be an indispensable resource for every library and a necessary handbook for scholars, teachers, and advanced students of the Caribbean region.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OUNIAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Perfect Scoundrel (Lords of Love)","description":"In the follow-up to For All Eternity, a perfect scoundrel finds perfect love Lord Quentin Somerville is smitten with society s most sought-after beauty.

Eliciting reverence for its grace and independent nature, it also triggers fear when it comes into contact with people, pets, and livestock or competes for hunters  game. Mystery, myth, and misunderstanding surround this remarkable creature. The cougar s range once extended from northern Canada to the tip of South America, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic, making it the most widespread animal in the western hemisphere. But overhunting and loss of habitat vastly reduced cougar numbers by the early twentieth century across much of its historical range, and today the cougar faces numerous threats as burgeoning human development encroaches on its remaining habitat. When Maurice Hornocker began the first long-term study of cougars in the Idaho wilderness in 1964, little was known about this large cat. Its secretive nature and rarity in the landscape made it difficult to study. But his groundbreaking research yielded major insights and was the prelude to further research on this controversial species. The capstone to Hornocker s long career studying big cats, Cougar is a powerful and practical resource for scientists, conservationists, and anyone with an interest in large carnivores. He and conservationist Sharon Negri bring together the diverse perspectives of twenty-two distinguished scientists to provide the fullest account of the cougar s ecology, behavior, and genetics, its role as a top predator, and its conservation needs. This compilation of recent findings, stunning photographs, and firsthand accounts of field research unravels the mysteries of this magnificent animal and emphasizes its importance in healthy ecosystem processes and in our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZSDUxT3fSYEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Damnations: The Humorists' Tour of Personal Hells","description":"The world's top humor writers are featured in a collection of essays, rants, anecdotes, lists, and pet peeves about the things that drive us crazy, with contributions from Kurt Anderson, Patricia Marx, Calvin Trillin, Christopher Buckley, and many others. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RMA8xmAqls8C&dq=101+Damnations:+The+Humorists%27+Tour+of+Personal+Hells&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Convenient Bride (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"Lady Briana has adored Lord Clayton since she was a child.

When the river flows in its fullness, unimpeded from head to toe, we feel successful, happy, fulfilled and awake to our true nature as eternal, timeless beings. Unfortunately, often the river is merely a trickle. Returning to Oneness reveals the limitations that restrict the flow of light in the body and mind and shows us how to awaken more permanently to our full potential by using a series of simple keys, which are based in the ancient teachings of non-duality.Presented here in a clear, easy, user-friendly form, the Seven Keys (now Eight) offer a path out of our confusion and angst.

When I use the word trauma, I am talking here about the often debilitating symptoms that many people suffer from in the aftermath of perceived life-threatening or overwhelming experiences. Recently, trauma has been used as a buzzword to replace everyday stress, as in,  I had a traumatic day at work.  However, this use is completely misleading. While it is true that all traumatic events are stressful, all stressful events are not traumatic. Unique to Each Individual When it comes to trauma, no two people are exactly alike. What proves harmful over the long term to one person may be exhilarating to another. There are many factors involved in the wide range of response to threat. These responses depend upon genetic make-up, an individual s history of trauma, even his or her family dynamics. It is vital that we appreciate these differences. Simply knowing that certain kinds of early childhood experiences can severely diminish our ability to cope and be present in the world may elicit compassion and support rather than harsh judgment, both for ourselves and for others. Perhaps the most important thing I have learned about trauma is that people, especially children, can be overwhelmed by what we usually think of as common everyday events. Until recently, our understanding of trauma was limited to  shell-shocked  soldiers who have been devastated by war, victims of severe abuse or violence, and those who have suffered catastrophic accidents and injuries. This narrow view could not be further from the truth. The fact is that, over time, a series of seemingly minor mishaps can have a damaging effect on a person. Trauma does not have to stem from a major catastrophe. Some common triggering events include: ? Automobile accidents (even fender benders) ? Routine invasive medical procedures ? Loss of loved ones ? Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes Even falling off a bicycle can be overwhelming to a child under certain circumstances. We will discuss those circumstances later. For now, I will simply say that almost all of us have experienced some form of trauma, either directly or indirectly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=coF5CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Writing, 2e","description":"This brief rhetoric introduces the essential reading and writing strategies students need to succeed in courses across the curriculum.

This volume offers a wide ranging exploration of the business aspects of American religious organizations. The authors analyze the financing, production, marketing, and distribution of religious goods and services and the role of wealth and economic organization in sustaining and even shaping worship, charity, philanthropy, institutional growth, and missionary work. Treating religion and business holistically, their essays show that American religious life has always been informed by business practices. Laying the groundwork for further investigation, the authors show how American business has functioned as a domain for achieving religious goals. Indeed they find that religion has historically been more powerful when interwoven with business. Chapters on Mormon enterprise, Jewish philanthropy, Hindu gurus, Native American casinos, and the wedding of business wealth to conservative Catholic social teaching demonstrate the range of new studies stimulated by the business turn in American religious history. Other chapters show how evangelicals joined neo-liberal economic practice and right-wing politics to religious fundamentalism to consolidate wealth and power, and how they developed marketing campaigns and organizational strategies that transformed the American religious landscape. Included are essays exposing the moral compromises religious organizations have made to succeed as centers of wealth and influence, and the religious beliefs that rationalize and justify these compromises. Still others examine the application of business practices as a means of sustaining religious institutions and expanding their reach, and look at controversies over business practices within religious organizations, and the adjustments such organizations have made in response. Together, the essays collected here offer new ways of conceptualizing the interdependence of religion and business in the United States, establishing multiple paths for further study of their intertwined historical development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wW4sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buried Roots and Indestructible Seeds: The Survival Of American Indian Life In Story, History, and Spirit","description":"Nine essays present traditional and modern Native American stories and narrative and analyze such aspects as circularity, perceptions of the environment, tricksters, comedy and tragedy, treaties, and tribal survival, sovereignty, and tradition.

Narayan than this remarkable collection of stories celebrating work that spans five decades. Characters include a storyteller whose magical source of tales dries up, a love-stricken husband who is told by astrologers he must sleep with a prostitute to save his dying wife, a pampered child who discovers that his beloved uncle may be an impostor or even a murderer. Standing supreme amid this rich assortment of stories is the title novella. Told by the narrator's grandmother, the tale recounts the adventures of her mother, married at seven and then abandoned, who crosses the subcontinent to extract her husband from the hands of his new wife. Her courage is immense and her will implacable -- but once her mission is completed, her independence vanishes. Gentle irony, wryly drawn characters, and themes at once Indian and universal mark these humane stories, which firmly establish Narayan as one of the world's preeminant storytellers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hLAkAMiGR7IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (2 Audio Cassette Tape Set)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Fourth+Protocol+(2+Audio+Cassette+Tape+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fons & Porter Presents Quilts from the Henry Ford: 24 Vintage Quilts Celebrating American Quiltmaking","description":"Presents basic information about the steps involved in making star quilts and provides instructions for twenty-seven projects for all skill levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c8TVjwEACAAJ&dq=Fons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plant Reproductive Ecology: Patterns and Strategies","description":"This collection of reviews by leading investigators examines plant reproduction and sexuality within a framework of evolutionary ecology, providing an up-to-date account of the field.

Cave diving is the natural evolution of caving, where cavers and open-water divers overcome the challenges of water-filled passages by using specialist breathing apparatus to explore further and deeper than ever before. The challenges are many ? distance, depth, temperature, visibility, rockfall and simple restriction in passage size ? together with the physical and mental demands placed on an individual in an environment where, despite meticulous preparation, equipment can malfunction and one cannot expect to be rescued if something goes wrong. Early cave dives were made using Standard Equipment diving suits, before \`frogman? equipment was adopted by British and Italian divers in the 1940s. Around the same time, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and  mile Gagnan designed the compressed-air aqualung, the first scuba equipment. The development of breathing apparatus has continued, alongside solutions to evermore challenging projects, especially those at extreme depth. British cave divers, including the author, have been at the forefront of many developments, such as the explorations at Wookey Hole in the Mendips, Keld Head in the Yorkshire Dales and Pozo Azul in Spain. Cave diving today is a truly international endeavour, and Farr gives detailed and engaging accounts of developments in Europe, the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Southern Africa and more. Farr introduces cave diving?s pioneers and chronicles their achievements. Among a cast of many are the Britons Graham Balcombe and Mike Boon; the American Sheck Exley, who died while attempting to establish a new depth record in the Zacat n sinkhole in Mexico; and the outstanding German cave diver and equipment innovator Jochen Hasenmayer. The stories of their adventures are charged with courage, danger and excitement, and some have led to tragedy. First published in 1980, this 2017 edition of The Darkness Beckons has been fully revised and updated to reflect the latest developments. Featuring over 400 breathtaking photographs and illustrations, and with a foreword by renowned American cave diver and explorer Bill Stone, it is an inspirational read for anyone with an interest in exploration and adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wlZIMQAACAAJ&dq=Darkness+Beckons:+The+History+and+Development+of+Cave+Diving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call it Sleep","description":"A 20th century American novel about a Jewish immigrant family living in the New York City slums","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MR0gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Call+it+Sleep&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Change Leaders: How You Can Create Growth and High Performance At Your Company","description":"A team at McKinsey & Company set out to discover why some companies were able to change and go on to higher performance levels while most others got bogged down.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQzhwWqrM44C&dq=Real+Change+Leaders:+How+You+Can+Create+Growth+and+High+Performance+At+Your+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peacock feathers","description":"Warren French and Anne Eager were married in 1841.

In the fall of 2000, when the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision that effectively decided a Presidential election, the Court's role in political life suddenly was thrust onto center stage. But, as legendary attorney and activist Martin Garbus argues, the Court has been a hotbed of politics for years, and it's time we took off our blinders and stopped treating the justices as the protectors of objective truth. For more than a generation, the Supreme Court has been quietly but aggressively rolling back legislation that has been fundamental to our justice system and economy since the days of Franklin Roosevelt. Although they remain on the books, laws concerning everything from abortion to the rights of suspects have been all but eviscerated. Most of the legal principles involved are subtle and technical, and often are lost on the general public. But in Courting Disaster Garbus brilliantly explicates the ways in which seemingly small decisions by the Court can preciptate radical change in American law, and then in American society. Ultimately, Garbus issues a passionate, well-argued wake-up call to liberal forces, urging the restoration of the Court's bipartisanship and objectivity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BPWUzQEACAAJ&dq=Courting+Disaster:+The+Supreme+Court+and+the+Unmaking+of+American+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conservation Now.: An article from: Farm Journal","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8x9RhJlUzKgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"July's People","description":"For years, it has been what is called a 'deteriorating situation'.

It is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skilful manipulation. He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to cause his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to believe they are shipwrecked and marooned on the island. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's lowly nature, the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand. The story draws heavily on the tradition of the romance, and it was influenced by tragicomedy, the courtly masque and perhaps the commedia dell'arte. It differs from Shakespeare's other plays in its observation of a stricter, more organised neoclassical style. Critics see The Tempest as explicitly concerned with its own nature as a play, frequently drawing links between Prospero's \\"art\\" and theatrical illusion, and early critics saw Prospero as a representation of Shakespeare, and his renunciation of magic as signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. The play portrays Prospero as a rational, and not an occultist, magician by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax: her magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Beginning in about 1950, with the publication of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni, The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory exemplified in adaptations like Aim  C saire's Une Temp te set in Haiti and there is even a scholarly journal on post-colonial criticism named after Caliban.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ccx4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Canons : Books of the Bible","description":"The publication of the King James version of the Bible, translated between 1603 and 1611, coincided with an extraordinary flowering of English literature and is universally acknowledged as the greatest influence on English-language literature in history.

We know her today primarily as a saintly character, perhaps as a heroic reformer of Britain s health-care system. The reality is more involved and far more fascinating. In an utterly beguiling narrative that reads like the best Victorian fiction, acclaimed author Gillian Gill tells the story of this richly complex woman and her extraordinary family. Born to an adoring wealthy, cultivated father and a mother whose conventional facade concealed a surprisingly unfettered intelligence, Florence was connected by kinship or friendship to the cream of Victorian England s intellectual aristocracy. Though moving in a world of ease and privilege, the Nightingales came from solidly middle-class stock with deep traditions of hard work, natural curiosity, and moral clarity. So it should have come as no surprise to William Edward and Fanny Nightingale when their younger daughter, Florence, showed an early passion for helping others combined with a precocious bent for power. Far more problematic was Florence s inexplicable refusal to marry the well-connected Richard Monckton Milnes. As Gill so brilliantly shows, this matrimonial refusal was at once an act of religious dedication and a cry for her freedomas a woman and as a leader. Florence s later insistence on traveling to the Crimea at the height of war to tend to wounded soldiers was all but incendiaryespecially for her older sister, Parthenope, whose frustration at being in the shade of her more charismatic sibling often led to illness. Florence succeeded beyond her wildest dreams. But at the height of her celebrity, at the age of thirty-seven, she retired to her bedroom and remained there for most of the rest of her life, allowing visitors only by appointment. Combining biography, politics, social history, and consummate storytelling, Nightingales is a dazzling portrait of an amazing woman, her difficult but loving family, and the high Victorian era they so perfectly epitomized. Beautifully written, witty, and irresistible, Nightingales is truly a tour de force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bDmPvJ1M0pYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonder Safaris","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vkLbvAEACAAJ&dq=Wonder+Safaris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property : Whose Culture?

The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, which obliterated the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, was a disaster that resounds to this day. Now palaeontologist Charles Pellegrino presents a wealth of new knowledge about the doomed towns  and brings to vivid life the people, their last moments, and the aftermath. The lessons learned from modern scrutiny of that ancient eruption produce disturbing echoes in the present. Dr Pellegrino, who worked at Ground Zero in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, shares his unique knowledge of the strange physics of volcanic 'downblast' and 'collapse column', drawing a direct link from past to present, and providing readers with a poignant glimpse into the last moments of the 'American Vesuvius'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WDO--jvrsBQC&dq=Ghosts+of+Vesuvius:+A+New+Look+at+the+Last+Days+of+Pompeii,+How+Towers+Fall,+and+Other+Strange+Connections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard's New Bicycle Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7U5zvQEACAAJ&dq=Richard%27s+New+Bicycle+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man in the Brown Suit","description":"After her father s death, young Anne Beddingfeld moves to London with her meagre inheritance, hopeful and ready to meet adventure. She witnesses a fatal accident at a Tube station and picks up a cryptic note dropped by the anonymous doctor who appeared on the scene. When Anne learns of a murder at the estate that the dead man was on his way to visit, it confirms her suspicion that the man in the brown suit who lost the note was not a real doctor. With her clue in hand she gains a commission from the newspaper leading the search for the  man in the brown suit,  and her investigation leads her to take passage on a South Africabound ocean liner. On board, she meets a famous socialite, a fake missionary, a possible secret service agent, and the M.P. at whose estate the second murder occurred. She learns about a secretive criminal mastermind known only as the Colonel and of stolen diamonds connected to it all. During the voyage, she evades an attempt on her life, and in South Africa she escapes from a kidnapping and barely survives another attack on her at Victoria Falls. She falls in love, finds the diamonds, and discovers the truth about the two deaths in London that started it all. Finally, she confronts the mysterious criminal mastermind, the Colonel. Published in 1924 by the Bodley Head, The Man in the Brown Suit is Agatha Christie s fourth novel. Unlike the classic murder mysteries that made her famous, The Man in the Brown Suit, like her second novel The Secret Adversary, is an international crime thriller.

Her controversial, breakthrough book offers evidence that in many cases true recovery from addiction should end in graduation from addiction programs into a life of autonomy, self-reliance and independence. \\"The premise of this intelligently written title is bound to cause some controversy. Recommended for popular psychology, self-help and recovery collections\\" - The Library Journal. \\"Offers strategies that can help people struggling with addictions develop the skills and abilities they need to make clear, effective choices about their own lives - with or without the continuing support of a formal recovery group.\\" - Yoga Journal \\"A therapist's prescription for avoiding addiction to a recovery group.\\" - New Age Journal \\"Hope of freedom, self-confidence and completion to people in self-help or 12-step recovery programs who have been told they will never be fully recovered.\\" - American Bookseller \\"A manual for those in self-help programs\\" - Publisher's Weekly Despite the millions who've found relief from addictive and compulsive habits through 12-step programs, these same programs' insistence that members always keep coming back unwittingly fosters attitudes that can undermine the foundations of a successful, healthy life. The Real 13th Step refutes the bedrock recovery principle that some people are just born with addictive personalities. Instead, therapist Tina Tessina identifies the underlying cause of addiction as learned dependency, and teaches readers how to develop the three central skills of true independence: risk-taking, problem-solving, and coping with failure. Her book then offers practical advice about applying these principles in every aspect of life: relationships, work, decision-making, and managing the continuing temptations of addiction. Readers will learn how they can take control of their own lives and remain free of the fear of relapse or setback in their recovery. If you are a successful member of a recovery program and feel you've benefited enormously from it, but are also beginning to sense that your progress toward functioning independently in the outside world may be hindered by the program itself, then the time has come for you to Read The Real 13th Step and graduate from your dependence on the group's help. The last recovery book you will ever need. This is the paddle you don't want to be up the creek without\\"- Don Fultz, recovery expert \\"The Real Thirteenth Step contains a wealth of astonishingly practical information. Very few therapists can provide better tools for personal growth\\" -San Francisco Bay Guardian \\"A well written, important book that provides an invaluable corrective to the dependency orientation of the recovery movement. It lucidly points the way to the next step: the cultivation of independence and personal autonomy.

Narayan, hailed as \\"India's most notable novelist and short-story writer\\" by the New York Times Book Review. In his usual winning, humorous style, R. K. Narayan shares his life story, beginning in his grandmother's garden in Madras with his ferocious pet peacock. As a young boy with no interest in school, he trains grasshoppers, scouts, and generally takes part in life's excitements. Against the advice of all, especially his commanding headmaster father, the dreaming Narayan takes to writing fiction, and one of his pieces is accepted by Punch magazine (his \\"first prestige publication\\"). Soon his life includes bumbling British diplomats, curious movie moguls, evasive Indian officials, eccentric journalists, and \\"the blind urge\\" to fall in love. R. K.

It also shows how grateful living is central to the good life and to attracting abundance. Filled with motivational quotes, resources, and exercises, The Grateful Life helps readers on their journey to creating the life they ve always wanted.

In the first part of the handbook, the major genres of war writing and film are addressed, including of course poetry and the novel, but also the short story; furthermore, it is shown how our conception of the Great War is broadened when looked at from the perspective of gender studies and post-colonial criticism. The chapters in the second part present close readings of important contributions to the literary and filmic representation of World War I in Great Britain. All in all, the contributions demonstrate how the opposing forces of focusing and canon-formation on the one hand, and broadening and revision of the canon on the other, have characterised British literature and culture of the First World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgZGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Occam's Razor","description":"When ancient artifacts discovered in the Great Pyramid of Giza shed new light on a DNA pattern identified by a world-renowned molecular biologist, venture capitalist, James Anderson, is thrust into an action-packed road of scientific exploration and discovery.

The Science of Memory Dr. Paul Pimsleur's research on memory was one of his most significant achievements: he discovered that if reminded of new words and information at gradually increasing intervals of time, the learners would remember the words or information for increasingly longer periods. Dr. Pimsleur documented that the acquisitions would actually move from short-term into long-term, or permanent, memory. The Reading Program Pimsleur Language Programs use the same revolutionary learning Method to teach you to read, as well as to speak. You will start by sounding out Spanish, learning to associate the new sound system to the English alphabet you know. Gradually you will learn to look at the words and see them with \\"Spanish eyes.\\" And you will learn to read Spanish without an English accent.

Now, for the first time, Eric Arnesen gives us an untold piece of that vital American institution--the story of African Americans on the railroad. African Americans have been a part of the railroad from its inception, but today they are largely remembered as Pullman porters and track layers. The real history is far richer, a tale of endless struggle, perseverance, and partial victory. In a sweeping narrative, Arnesen re-creates the heroic efforts by black locomotive firemen, brakemen, porters, dining car waiters, and redcaps to fight a pervasive system of racism and job discrimination fostered by their employers, white co-workers, and the unions that legally represented them even while barring them from membership. Decades before the rise of the modern civil rights movement in the mid-1950s, black railroaders forged their own brand of civil rights activism, organizing their own associations, challenging white trade unions, and pursuing legal redress through state and federal courts. In recapturing black railroaders' voices, aspirations, and challenges, Arnesen helps to recast the history of black protest and American labor in the twentieth century. Table of Contents: Prologue 1. Race in the First Century of American Railroading 2. Promise and Failure in the World War I Era 3. The Black Wedge of Civil Rights Unionism 4. Independent Black Unionism in Depression and War 5. The Rise of the Red Caps 6. The Politics of Fair Employment 7. The Politics of Fair Representation 8. Black Railroaders in the Modern Era Conclusion Notes Acknowledgments Index Reviews of this book: In this superbly written monograph, Arnesen...shows how African American railroad workers combined civil rights and labor union activism in their struggles for racial equality in the workplace...Throughout, black locomotive firemen, porters, yardmen, and other railroaders speak eloquently about the work they performed and their confrontations with racist treatment...This history of the 'aristocrats' of the African American working class is highly recommended. --Charles L. Lumpkins, Library Journal Reviews of this book: Arnesen provides a fascinating look at U.S. labor and commerce in the arena of the railroads, so much a part of romantic notions about the growth of the nation. The focus of the book is the troubled history of the railroads in the exploitation of black workers from slavery until the civil rights movement, with an insightful analysis of the broader racial integration brought about by labor activism. --Vanessa Bush, Booklist Reviews of this book: [An] exhaustive and illuminating work of scholarship. --Publishers Weekly Reviews of this book: Arnesen tells a story that should be of interest to a variety of readers, including those who are avid students of this country's railroads. He knows his stuff, and furthermore, reminds us of how dependent American railroads were on the backbreaking labor of racial and ethnic groups whose civil and political status were precarious at best: Irish, Chinese, Mexicans and Italians, as well as African-Americans. But Arnesen's most powerful and provocative argument is that the nature of discrimination not only led black railroad workers to pursue the path of independent unionism, it also propelled them into the larger struggle for civil rights. --Steven Hahn, Chicago Tribune","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WE8s2pn2wxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legendary Model A Ford: The Complete History of America's Favorite Car","description":"If you love cars, you will love this incredibly exciting social history of Ford's Model A.

Cory Doctorow, New York Times bestselling and award winning author of Homeland Acclaimed short story writer and editor of the World Fantasy Award-nominee Three Messages and a Warning eerily envisions an American society unraveling and our borders closed off from the other side in this haunting and provocative novel that combines Max Barry s Jennifer Government, Philip K. Dick s classic Man in the High Castle, and China Mieville s The City & the City The United States of America is no more. Broken into warring territories, its center has become a wasteland DMZ known as  the Tropic of Kansas.  Though this gaping geographic hole has no clear boundaries, everyone knows it's out there that once-bountiful part of the heartland, broken by greed and exploitation, where neglect now breeds unrest. Two travelers appear in this arid American wilderness: Sig, the fugitive orphan of political dissidents, and his foster sister Tania, a government investigator whose search for Sig leads her into her own past and towards an unexpected future. Sig promised those he loves that he would make it to the revolutionary redoubt of occupied New Orleans. But first he must survive the wild edgelands of a barren mid-America policed by citizen militias and autonomous drones, where one wrong move can mean capture . . . or death. One step behind, undercover in the underground, is Tania. Her infiltration of clandestine networks made of old technology and new politics soon transforms her into the hunted one, and gives her a shot at being the agent of real change if she is willing to give up the explosive government secrets she has sworn to protect. As brother and sister traverse these vast and dangerous badlands, their paths will eventually intersect on the front lines of a revolution whose fuse they are about to light.

Abingdon Press would like to congratulate Kenneth Collins on this honor. John Wesley remains a seminal figure, not only for \\"the people called Methodist, \\" but also within the larger Protestant tradition. Understanding his theology is a requirement for understanding the development of the Western Christian tradition in the modern period. In recent years much work has been done to grasp the intricacies of Wesley's theology. However, most of this work has been thematic in organization, studying Wesley's thought according to a topical or systematic outline. The weakness of this approach, argues Kenneth J. Collins, is that it fails to demonstrate the evolution and changes of Wesley's theology. What is called for is a historical presentation--one that examines the development of Wesley's theology across the span of his long and eventful theological career.

Can what you eat determine how long, and how well, you live? The clinically proven answer is yes, and The Longevity Diet is easier to follow than you'd think. The culmination of 25 years of research on ageing, nutrition, and disease across the globe, this unique combination of an everyday diet and fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) to be done only 3-4 times per year lays out a simple solution to living to a healthy old age through nutrition. FMD does away with the misery and starvation most of us experience while fasting and helps you reap all the beneficial health effects of a restrictive diet while avoiding the negative stressors, like low energy and sleeplessness. Valter Longo, Director of the Longevity Institute at USC and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, developed THE FMD after making a series of remarkable discoveries in mice and humans indicating that specific diets can activate stem cells and promote regeneration and rejuvenation in multiple organs to reduce the risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease. Longo's simple pescatarian daily eating plan and the periodic, fasting-mimicking techniques can both yield impressive results. Low in proteins and sugars and rich in healthy fats and plant-based foods, The Longevity Diet is clinically proven to help you: Lose weight and reduce abdominal fat Make simple changes which can extend the healthy lifespan Prevent age-related muscle and bone loss Build your resistance to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and cancer Longo's healthy, life span-extending plan is based on an easy-to-adopt pescatarian plan along with the fasting-mimicking diet 4 times a year, and just 5 days at a time.

This challenging exploration discusses the reasons that seclusion may not be as oppressive as is presently generally accepted, and, in fact, may be an empowering force for women in both the West and East. Readers are taken on a controversial, belief-bending journey deep into the surprising origins and diverse aspects of female seclusion to find solid evidence of its surprising use as a defense against monolithic cultural exploitation. The author uses her extensive knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, language, and even archeology to provide a convincing assertion challenging the Western view that seclusion was and is a result of women s oppression. A History of Women s Seclusion in the Middle East goes beyond standard feminist rhetoric to put forth shocking notions on the real reasons behind women s seclusion and how it has been used to counteract cultural exploitation. The book reviews written evidence, domestic and sacred architecture, evolution, biology, the clan, the environment for seclusion, trade, capital and land, slavery, honor, and various other aspects in a powerful feminist argument that seclusion is actually a valuable empowering force of protection from the influence of today s society. The text includes thirty black and white figures with useful descriptions to illustrate and enhance reader understanding of concepts. A History of Women s Seclusion in the Middle East discusses at length: prehistoric evidence of seclusion the sense of honor in the Middle East a balanced look at the Islamic religion the true nature of the harem the reasons for the oppression by the Taliban the positive aspects of  veiling  seclusion as a defense against capitalist exploitation and other challenging perspectives!

The importance of the theme requires no demonstration. Since labor first organized for its own protection it has passed through no period more prolific in soul-stirring events and significant developments than that extending from July to November, 1892, and including the lock-out at the Carnegie mills, the battle with 300 Pinkerton guards, the military occupation of Homestead, the trial of labor leaders on capital charges and the ultimate collapse of the Amalgamated lodges for lack of funds to continue the struggle against non-unionism. This was a conflict of far more than local interest. It was watched with anxiety by both friends and foes of organized labor on both sides of the Atlantic; it claimed the attention of leaders of thought in all departments of human activity; it stirred up the British House of Parliament and the United States Congress, agitated the newspaper press of both continents, became an issue in the election for President and is said to have contributed more largely to the defeat of Benjamin Harrison by Grover Cleveland than any other influence. The injection of partisan considerations into public discussion of the Homestead affair led naturally to a vast amount of misrepresentation, and even at this late day the causes and character of the struggle are widely misunderstood. It has been the mission of the author of this history to sift out the truth, to make clear the motives and methods of the disputants on both sides, and to recount in detail the events of the contest without sacrificing historic accuracy to romantic effect. Personal observations in the course of visits to the \\"seat of war\\" while hostilities were in progress, and subsequent conversations with the leaders has made the task a comparatively easy one. Little attempt is made to philosophize on the varying phases of the labor question as presented at Homestead. It is left largely to the reader to form his own deductions from the facts set forth and from the opinions of recognized authorities, not forgetting Mr. Carnegie himself, which are liberally cited. That through the perusal of \\"Homestead\\" new light may be borne in upon some of the many who persist in regarding the American workingman as a mere piece of mechanism, deservedly at the mercy of his employer, is the earnest hope of","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_uL-CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off-Shoring the Middle Class: Managing White-Collar Job Migration to Asia","description":"Globalization and the off-shoring of middle-class jobs will be one of the most important forces shaping the 21st Century.

Destined to become a guidebook to thriving in the 21st Century, Off-Shoring the Middle Class outlines the prompt action required on many levels as governments, corporations, and individuals are all drawn into the battle to remain competitive, to move up the value chain, and to succeed in a world gone flat. \\"Off-Shoring the Middle Class\\" explains how off-shoring affects society and workers at every level and outlines a course of action for each, including a mix of better public policy, more innovation, more relevant education, and substantially expanded entrepreneurship, following the Silicon Valley model.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HrekTqF8St8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BLOOD AND MONEY a True story of Murder, Passion, and Power","description":"New York Times Bestseller: The  gripping  true story of a beautiful Texas socialite, her ambitious husband, and a string of mysterious deaths (Los Angeles Times).

Is Anyone Listening? Essays and Poems by Partners, Parents and Family Members...","description":"'This short book, a collection of essays and poems, looks at the loneliness, frustration and sadness experienced, not by the person with the syndrome, but by their partners, parents and other family members: it is they who have to cope with the absence of communication, affection and empathy expected from a reciprocal loving relationship.' - Irish Journal of Medical Science The difficulties faced by people with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) cannot be underestimated, but the emotional problems experienced by those who support them - partners, family and friends - are often over-looked. Focusing on what is referred to as the Cassandra phenomenon, where the neurotypical partner often needs more emotional guidance than the AS partner, this volume gathers together letters, thoughts and poems to give voice to the loneliness, frustration and love felt by many individuals who are close to one or more people with AS. Assembled by FAAAS Inc. (Families of Adults Afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome), a well-known support group specifically for family members, friends and loved ones of people with AS, this collection will provide the emotional support, insight and understanding needed to deal with the emotions that AS evokes within close relationships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FbgZSv3m6XoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Placebo Effect (Doctor Who Series)","description":"It is the year 3999.

The Artistic part of my thesis consists of five artificial skins made on my body, and a series of video tapes of the performance of me making those skins. A number of devices have been built into these skins to provide my body and self with messages and stimuli from the outside. Through the action of rebuilding myself and exposing some of the elements that form me I am physically and materially exploring the nature of subjectivity and constructed self in our society. The video tapes of the performance are representations of both the act of rebuilding myself and my body. They are reflections and criticism of the way women are taught to see and present themselves in our culture. They are the product of my perspective and of a culture of surveillance, pornography and empirical observation. The written part of my thesis deals with the sanctity of making through the two categories of \\"SKIN\\" and \\"FLICKS\\". The \\"SKIN\\" part consists of analysis of the physical properties of skin, its ability to be imitated and its role in material making. It relates our attempt to recreate ourselves to the \\"rebuilding\\" of the natural world. It explores through the physical material skin, the value and purpose of material making. The \\"FLICKS\\" section of my document explores and examines some of the history of the representation of skin in visual art. This history includes some classical works, Renaissance works, nineteenth century nudes and contemporary films. It also questions the ability of images to represent anything other than skin through a discussion of iconoclasm and its relation to some contemporary critical practices in the arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rb7tgAACAAJ&dq=Skin+Flicks,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing in the Light","description":"Running a 1990s Cape Town travel agency in spite of her private hatred of traveling, Marion shares a complex relationship with an African employee and eschews national politics, until the exposures of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission reveal dark family secrets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PW0RBAAAQBAJ&dq=Playing+in+the+Light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Huh Huh for Hollywood Mtvs Beavis and Butthead","description":"MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head describe the things they like and don't like about movies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=246jF-DSz-UC&dq=Huh+Huh+for+Hollywood+Mtvs+Beavis+and+Butthead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traffic Engineering Design, Principles and Practice","description":"A concise introduction to traffic engineering, this work covers practical design considerations as well as management, social and environmental aspects of the subject.

The mere mention of the R-word is a surefire conversation-stopper. In this book about America?s most divisive social issue, Dominic J. Pulera offers a compelling roadmap to our future. This accessible and penetrating analysis is the first to include detailed coverage of America?s five \\"racial\\" groups: whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. The author contends that race will matter to Americans during the twenty-first century because of visible differences, and that differences in physical appearance separating the races are the single most important factor shaping intergroup relations, in conjunction with the social, cultural, economic, and political ramifications that accompany them. Pulera shows how, why, when, and where race matters in the United States and who is affected by it. He explains the ongoing demographic transition of America from a predominantly white country to one where nonwhites are increasingly numerous and consequently more visible. The advent of a multiracial consciousness has tremendous implications for America?s future, because the racial significance of almost every part of the American experience is increasing as a result. The author concludes on a note of cautious optimism as he explores whether the visible differences dividing Americans are reconcilable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HifUAwAAQBAJ&dq=Visible+Differences:+Why+Race+Will+Matter+to+Americans+in+the+Twenty-First+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E-Commerce User Experience","description":"Lien","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aUxqAAAAMAAJ&dq=E-Commerce+User+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The light of learning: An illustrated history of the Los Angeles Public Library","description":"In the most comprehensive investigation of the Los Angeles Public Library s early history and architectural genesis ever undertaken, Kenneth Breisch chronicles the institution s first six decades, from its founding as a private library association in 1872 through the completion of the iconic Central Library building in 1933. During this time, the library evolved from an elite organization ensconced in two rooms in downtown LA into one of the largest public library systems in the United States with architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue s building, a beloved LA landmark, as its centerpiece. Goodhue developed a new style, fully integrating the building s sculptural and epigraphic program with its architectural forms to express a complex iconography. Working closely with sculptor Lee Oskar Lawrie and philosopher Hartley Burr Alexander, he created a great civic monument that, combined with the library s murals, embodies an overarching theme: the light of learning.  A building should read like a book, from its title entrance to its alley colophon,  wrote Alexander a narrative approach to design that serves as a key to understanding Goodhue s architectural gem. Breisch draws on a wealth of primary source material to tell the story of one of the most important American buildings of the twentieth century and illuminates the formation of an indispensible modern public institution: the American public library.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=22olDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+light+of+learning:+An+illustrated+history+of+the+Los+Angeles+Public+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry James: The Master, 1901-1916 v. 5","description":"\\"No one, among American writers, was more contemporary or had a more powerful grasp of American history and American myth,\\" writes Leon Edel of Henry James.

James is relaxed and informal as he writes of Emerson, Hawthorne, Lowell, Godkin, Norton, and Howells: he is fondly recalling--but also criticizing--the cultural orthodoxy in which he was reared. The American Essays remarkably prefigures current efforts to revise and challenge the aesthetic idealism of the Emersonian tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SE3_EV8ID_8C&dq=Henry+James:+The+Master,+1901-1916+v.+5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orphan Trains to Missouri (MISSOURI HERITAGE READERS)","description":"Discusses the use of orphan trains to place orphaned or abandoned children in homes in nineteenth-century Missouri.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_ydkMyk17wC&dq=Orphan+Trains+to+Missouri+(MISSOURI+HERITAGE+READERS)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As I Pass, O Manhattan: An Anthology of Life in New York","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L0VEAAAAIAAJ&dq=As+I+Pass,+O+Manhattan:+An+Anthology+of+Life+in+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music's Modern Muse: A Life of Winnaretta Singer, Princesse de Polignac (Eastman Studies in Music)","description":"A biography of Winnaretta Singer-Polignac, heiress to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune, who befriended and subsidized some of the most important musical and literary artists of the 20th Century, including Stravinsky, Proust, Ravel, Cocteau, and Colette.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6aAPgAACAAJ&dq=Music%27s+Modern+Muse:+A+Life+of+Winnaretta+Singer,+Princesse+de+Polignac+(Eastman+Studies+in+Music)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Butterflies in the Wind: The Truth about Latin American Adoptions","description":"The book chronicles not only the adoption of their three children abroad, but follows each of their children (including their biological son) into young adulthood.

A must for birders planning a trip to this friendly patch of Central America.   The Curious Naturalist With nearly six hundred identified species of birds and an average of five  new  species discovered annually Belize is becoming a birding hotspot for amateur and professional birders from around the globe. Thousands of birders visit the country each year to enjoy Belize s amazing abundance and variety of both temperate and tropical birds in natural habitats that remain largely unspoiled. But until now, despite the growing need for an authoritative identification guide, birders have had to rely on regional field guides that offer only limited information on Belizean birds. Birds of Belize provides the first complete guide to the identification of all currently known species 574 in all. The birds are grouped by families, with an introduction to each family that highlights its uniquely identifying characteristics and behaviors. The species accounts include all the details necessary for field identification: scientific and common names, size, plumage features, thorough voice descriptions, habitat, distribution, and status in Belize. Full color, expertly drawn illustrations by noted bird artist Dana Gardner present male and female, juvenile and adult, and basic and alternate plumages to aid visual identification throughout the year, while 234 range maps show the birds  distribution and seasonality in Belize. A comprehensive bibliography completes the volume.  A first-class book that will enable users to identify any bird they encounter in Belize.

He's fed by a local cafe owner, he earns some cash as a barrow-boy in Covent Garden, and sleeping in the Underground air-raid shelters is cosy - if a bit smelly. Things get more complicated for Bill with the arrival of Julie. She's a runaway too, and although she's a bit posh, she's just as determined as Bill to stay free of interfering parents and 'the social'. But although it's fun for a while to duck Jerry missiles and camp out in bombed-out houses, the reality of living through the Blitz quickly begins to set in. Winter is coming, and Bill and Julie will discover that playing at being grown-ups can be a very dangerous game....

In the clear, readable, entertaining style that brought acclaim for his best-selling Age of Diminished Expectations, Krugman explains what real economic analysis is. He discusses economic terms and measurements, like \\"value-added\\" and GDP, in simple language so that readers can understand how pop internationalists distort, and sometimes contradict, the most basic truths about world trade. All but two of the essays have previously appeared in such publications as Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, and the Harvard Business Review. The first five essays take on exaggerations of foreign competition's effects on the U.S. economy and represent Krugman's central criticisms of public debate over world trade. The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom. The third group of essays highlights misconceptions about competition from less industrialized countries.

It is very accessible ad easy to read, bolstered by the clarity of its language and organisation.' History Teaching ReviewThe period immediately following the First World War was one of great turbulence in Germany. The widespread dislocation throughout the country left morale crushed, and the economy crippled by Allied demands for reparations. Russia was in the hands of the Bolsheviks and Germany seemed on the brink of falling to working-class revolutionaries. Writing between 1919 and 1923 as special correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, Price was one of the very few British journalists in Weimar Germany during these important years. His unique position as an outsider allowed him to record what he saw with an objective eye, and his sympathy with the Bolsheviks gave him an understanding of the deeper implications behind the unfolding of events. These remarkable writings, reprinted for the first time in 80 years, cover the key events in postwar Germany. Price witnesses the establishment of the Weimar Republic, the emergence of Hitler and the Nazi Party, the inflammatory violence in the south of the country, which threatened civil war, and the signing of the Versailles Treaty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JYUiAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Weimar+Republic:+Versailles+and+German+Facism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Is Only Now - A Simple Guide to Spiritual Awakening, Unconditional Love, Liberation and Transformation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIMHAAAACAAJ&dq=There+Is+Only+Now+-+A+Simple+Guide+to+Spiritual+Awakening,+Unconditional+Love,+Liberation+and+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Global to Metanational: How Companies Win in the Knowledge Economy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hard-Core Collections: Brutal But Effective Techniques For Getting The Money","description":"Learn from a pro the secrets of collecting back child support, court judgments and other \\"uncollectible\\" bills by balancing legal issues with street realities.

Instead, we have enlisted hundreds of millions of people into a war we can't win.\\" What s the secret to losing weight? If you re like most of us, you ve tried cutting calories, sipping weird smoothies, avoiding fats, and swapping out sugar for Splenda. The real secret is that all of those things are likely to make you weigh more in a few years, not less. In fact, a good predictor of who will gain weight is who says they plan to lose some. Last year, 108 million Americans went on diets, to the applause of doctors, family, and friends. But long-term studies of dieters consistently find that they re more likely to end up gaining weight in the next two to fifteen years than people who don t diet. Neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt spent three decades in her own punishing cycle of starving and regaining before turning her scientific eye to the research on weight and health. What she found defies the conventional wisdom about dieting:  Telling children that they re overweight makes them more likely to gain weight over the next few years. Weight shaming has the same effect on adults.  The calories you absorb from a slice of pizza depend on your genes and on your gut bac-teria. So does the number of calories you re burning right now.  Most people who lose a lot of weight suffer from obsessive thoughts, binge eating, depres-sion, and anxiety. They also burn less energy and find eating much more rewarding than it was before they lost weight.  Fighting against your body s set point a cen-tral tenet of most diet plans is exhausting, psychologically damaging, and ultimately counterproductive. If dieting makes us fat, what should we do instead to stay healthy and reduce the risks of diabetes, heart disease, and other obesity-related conditions? With clarity and candor, Aamodt makes a spirited case for abandoning diets in favor of behav-iors that will truly improve and extend our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-ef1CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short Season and Other Stories (Johns Hopkins: Poetry and Fiction)","description":"Call it Kmart magical realism.-Washington Post Book World","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EcJ-lc4ZjusC&dq=Short+Season+and+Other+Stories+(Johns+Hopkins:+Poetry+and+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Shot (Goldy Bear Culinary Mysteries)","description":" Today s foremost practitioner of the culinary whodunit.

Featuring a 2018 foreword by the Pulitzer Prizewinning political historian that celebrates a reappraisal of Lyndon Johnson s legacy five decades after his presidency, from the vantage point of our current, profoundly altered political culture and climate, Doris Kearns Goodwin s extraordinary and insightful biography draws from meticulous research in addition to the author s time spent working at the White House from 1967 to 1969. After Johnson s term ended, Goodwin remained his confidante and assisted in the preparation of his memoir. In Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream, she traces the 36th president s life from childhood to his early days in politics, and from his leadership of the Senate to his presidency, analyzing his dramatic years in the White House, including both his historic domestic triumphs and his failures in Vietnam. Drawing on personal anecdotes and candid conversation with Johnson, Goodwin paints a rich and complicated portrait of one of our nation s most compelling politicians in  the most penetrating, fascinating political biography I have ever read  (The New York Times).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tv8QCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kosher Sex","description":"In Kosher Sex, Rabbi Boteach pioneers a revolutionary approach to sex, marriage, and personal relationships, drawing on traditional Jewish wisdom. Using his experiences counseling individuals and couples, the author breaks down sexual taboos and openly, yet respectfully, discusses the meanings, emotions, and the hidden power of sex. With his unique anecdotal style, Rabbi Boteach illustrates each and every point, using real couples who have discovered the joys of \\"kosher sex\\"--sex based on love, trust, and real intimacy. He profiles the two most common types of couples--best friends and passionate lovers--and suggests ways of synthesizing the best that each type has to offer. Rabbi Boteach also has advice for singles on finding the right partner; for individuals either willing to take their long-term relationship to the next level or unsure about doing so; and for married couples who may be experiencing problems in their sex life. At a time when three out of every five marriages fail, Kosher Sex will have an astonishing and positive impact. With a no-holds-barred conversational style and keen insight, Rabbi Boteach breaks all the taboos and pioneers a new approach to sex, marriage, and personal relationships. He not only brings traditional Jewish wisdom into the twentieth century but makes it relevant to everyone searching for a deeper, more meaningful, and more satisfying love life. --> From the Trade Paperback edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4NKU_nIJm-gC&dq=Kosher+Sex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Television Sitcoms","description":"This new edition of Writing Television Sitcoms features the essential information every would-be teleplay writer needs to know to break into the business, including: - Updated examples from contemporary shows such as 30 Rock, The Office and South Park - Shifts in how modern stories are structured - How to recognize changes in taste and censorship - The reality of reality television - How the Internet has created series development opportunities - A refined strategy for approaching agents and managers - How pitches and e-queries work - or don't - The importance of screenwriting competitions","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ypJVXEF6bWQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marx (Past masters series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DUwdzQEACAAJ&dq=Marx+(Past+masters+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plum pie","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pXxbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Plum+pie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ubuntu: Seeing Oneself Through the Eyes of Others","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SFOUNAAACAAJ&dq=Ubuntu:+Seeing+Oneself+Through+the+Eyes+of+Others&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Support Your Local Wizard (So You Want to Be a Wizard, Deep Wizardry, & High Wizardry)","description":"A mysterious library book opens the door to a world of magic and danger in the first book in the beloved Young Wizards series.

From the moment when the dsitute Prussian Adolph Coors stows away to America in 1868, through the creation of the Heritage Foundation, to the global expansion of the billion-dollar Coors Brewing Company, the Coors family triumphed by iron-willed commitment to its own values -- values that ironically prove the family's undoing on both the business and political fronts. Acclaimed writer Dan Baum captures it all, from Adolph's Prohibition-provoked suicide to the banishment of an heir-apparent for marrying without permission.

It is, for some, a personal struggle; for others, it is a disease posing scientific and environmental challenges; and for others it is a highly charged and politicized issue around which policy wars rage. Beyond Slash, Burn, and Poison brings a unique perspective to breast cancer by recognizing the overlapping relationship of all these realities. Drawing on the writings of Rachel Carson, Betty Ford, Rose Kushner, and Audre Lorde, this book explores the various ways in which patient-centered texts continue to leave their mark on the political realm of breast cancer and, ultimately, the disease itself. Ordered chronologically, the selections trace the progression of discussions about breast cancer from a time when the subject was kept private and silent to when it became part of public discourse. The texts included are personal accounts, written by women struggling to play an active role in their healing process and, at the same time, hoping to help others do the same. Knopf-Newman also shows us how these writings eventually changed public opinion and the underlying tendency to blame women for their illness. She argues that changes in medical practice and public policy are linked to textual interventions, and makes a case for the politicization of cultural studies of disease through personal and literary expression. Passionately written and well-researched, Beyond Slash, Burn, and Poison transforms how we think about breast cancer. Rather than facilitating forums for separate discussions, this book brings conversations into dialog with each other. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with breast cancer and its history, as well as for those interested in the effect of the environment on public health and the role that literature plays in public policy and medicine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5YkEtAEACAAJ&dq=Beyond+Slash,+Burn,+and+Poison:+Transforming+Breast+Cancer+Stories+into+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TEACHER IN AMERICA","description":"To find more information on Rowman & Littlefield titles, please visit us at www.rowmanlittlefield.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jv98PwAACAAJ&dq=TEACHER+IN+AMERICA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft ASP.NET Step by Step (Step by Step (Microsoft))","description":"Teach yourself the fundamentals of Web development with ASP.NET 4-one step at a time.

The his-torian Theodor Mommsen described it as \\"a work which has remained unsurpassed in the conciseness and vividness of its account.\\" Eight decades after its appearance, it remains fresh and informative. It has not been surpassed, and is as invaluable as ever.Haskins traces the rise of the mediaeval university as one phase of the intellectual awakening in Europe in the late Middle Ages, in an effort to broaden our understanding of \\"the ancient and universal company of scholars.\\" In the depth and breadth of its analysis, there is no better portrait of universities during their infancy in the Middle Ages. With great detail and preci-sion, Haskins describes the university's curriculum, teaching, teachers, and students. Drawing deeply on his knowledge as one of the leading mediaeval scholars of his day, he provides an exceptionally vivid picture of student life of tht time, through his analysis of their manuals, letters, and poetry. The Rise of Universities goes far beyond its central subject to offer a broad description of the social conditions in which universities took root and flourished. At the same time, one cannot read Haskins without seeing the influences of the mediaeval university on contemporary institutions of higher learning. The Rise of Universities reminds us that the univer-sity has not only been a crucible fostering intellectual inquiry and creativity, but continues after eight hundred years to be a center of teaching and learning.In his new introduction, Lionel S. Lewis develops Haskins' passing observation that \\"the university of the twentieth cen-tury is the lineal descendant of mediaeval Paris and Bologna,\\" and considers the question of why universities came into being at the particular time in history when they did.

Martha Vicinus explores all-female communities, husband-wife couples, liaisons between younger and older women, female rakes, and mother-daughter affection. Women, she reveals, drew upon a rich religious vocabulary to describe elusive and complex erotic feelings. Vicinus also considers the nineteenth-century roots of such contemporary issues as homosexual self-hatred, female masculinity, and sadomasochistic desire. Drawing upon diaries, letters, and other archival sources, she brings to life a variety of well known and historically less recognized women, ranging from the predatory Ann Lister, who documented her sexual activities in code; to Mary Benson, the wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury; to the coterie of wealthy Anglo-American lesbians living in Paris. In vivid and colorful prose, Intimate Friends offers a remarkable picture of women navigating the uncharted territory of same-sex desire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DqBBkgv_6x4C&dq=Women+who+loved+women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Therapy of Desire","description":"The Epicureans, Skeptics, and Stoics practiced philosophy not as a detached intellectual discipline but as a worldly art of grappling with issues of daily and urgent human significance. In this classic work, Martha Nussbaum maintains that these Hellenistic schools have been unjustly neglected in recent philosophic accounts of what the classical \\"tradition\\" has to offer. By examining texts of philosophers such as Epicurus, Lucretius, and Seneca, she recovers a valuable source for current moral and political thought and encourages us to reconsider philosophical argument as a technique through which to improve lives.

Some are cranky and stern, and others can be weak or indifferent. Some grapple with alcohol or sensuality, and others are controlled by money. In our day, thousands of priests have been exposed for committing the gravest of sins: abusing those who have been entrusted to their care. In these searingly honest and insightful pages, EWTN host and author Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J., brings consolation to all those who have been abused, wounded, or scandalized by the wickedness of priests and bishops. He takes you on a reassuring exploration of the Gospels to show how Christ anticipated the sins of the clergy and the hierarchy and gives us examples of how to deal with them spiritually emotionally, rationally, and practically. Fr. Mitch reinforces what Christ s parables teach us: that good and evil will co-exist in the Church, and that spiritual blindness will affect the moral life of the clergy and the lay faithful alike. The solution, he says, lies in the power of Jesus  Death and Resurrection and the Apostles  response to the Risen Lord: authentic conversion to faith in Jesus, which reorients our lives toward selfless service of others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AQf2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buck Meets the Monster Stick","description":"Revisit West Virginia with Bil Lepp as he tells the story behind the greatest-and most dangerous-fishing rod ever and Buck, who simply \\"ain't no ordinary dog.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aGfaoQEACAAJ&dq=Buck+Meets+the+Monster+Stick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dozen a Day Book One (Technical Exercises For the Piano to be Done Each Day Before Practicing)","description":"(Willis).

He combined classical European training with Eastern spirituality to produce an American amalgam of such vitality and originality that it continues to define what we mean by avant-garde. His influence has touched generations of artists, including Philip Glass, David Byrne, and his longtime collaborator Merce Cunningham. His work and ideas have influenced not only the world of music but also dance, painting, printmaking, video art, and poetry. The Roaring Silence documents his life in unrivaled detail, interweaving a close account of the evolution of his work with an exploration of his aesthetic and philosophical ideas, while placing these in the greater perspective of American life and letters. Paying due attention to Cage s inventions, such as the prepared piano, and his pioneering use of indeterminate notation and chance operations in composition (utilizing the I Ching), David Revill also illuminates Cage the performer, printmaker, watercolorist, expert amateur mycologist, game show celebrity, political anarchist, and social activist. Arnold Schoenberg once called Cage  not a composer, but an inventor of genius.  This revised edition presents never-before-seen correspondence between Cage and other luminaries of his day, as well as new analysis into his legacy. The Roaring Silence celebrates the life and work of this true American original.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4juCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING","description":"Waging a losing war with the Money God, Gordon Comstock lives in a small bed-sit and works in a bookstore.

Irwin Shaw was a star of the New Yorker s fiction pages in the 1930s and  40s. His prose helped shape the landscape of post-war fiction, and his work drew from a remarkable life that spanned from American football fields to European battlefields, Broadway to Hollywood, Depression-era saloons to the McCarthy hearings. Among these sixty-three stories are iconic works such as  The Eighty-Yard Run,  a tale of an American dream crippled on Black Monday, and  Main Currents in American Thought,  in which a hack radio copywriter is tormented by the glitz of show business. Through the decades, Shaw s writing  as demonstrated in these pages maintains the clear-eyed moral purpose, rich in wit and startling insight, of a tough kid with a philosopher s soul.

He was considered by Lord Macaulay to have had greater influence on the life of the church than any primate. Soundly converted in his first term at King's College, he was appointed Vicar of Holy Trinity in 1782, combining the incumbency with a Fellowship and various academic posts. Highly unpopular at first on account of both his message and his manner, scorned and abused for many years, he carried on regardless of other's opinions until in the end he became perhaps the best known and best respected name in Cambridge. Hot-tempered but warm-hearted, impetuous but infinitely patient, a man of imposing, even remarkable appearance, he was a \\"character,\\" about whom the most entertaining stories are eagerly recounted. As a Christian of independent mind and strong convictions, he found his spiritual strength in a lifetime of deep devotion and strict personal discipline; as a biblical preacher he was the first for many generations to see the possibility and importance of teaching others how to expound the Scriptures; as a pastor and evangelist his work with both town and gown was marked by a rare faithfulness and zeal. Limited all his life to the one center of spiritual activity, he yet was the moving spirit in the formation of the Church Missionary Society, and an enthusiastic supporter of the Bible Society and of work among the Jews.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wkdNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Henry Holmes and the Rediscovery of the American West","description":"\\"William Henry Holmes is the biography of post-Civil War America's most brilliant western artist.

Some, such as the Magnolia Service Station in Kansas, have been preserved on the National Historic Register; others, such as the Aztec Motel in Albuquerque, are still doing a thriving business; while others have simpy vanished from the landscape.Starting in Chicago, Route 66 Then and Now takes in the motels, cafes, gas stations, roadside attractions and key towns and sites along the route.

Thomas is lashed to the body of his beloved knight. Bound to a tree in the grove, both are burned. Before succumbing, Thomas hears dead Bertrand's voice, they will never be separated, but will return to help others, no matter how impossible. A thousand years later, handsome Tommy Angelo finds himself still looking for men at the edge, giving them sexual satisfaction and strength, hoping that he will gain the \\"favor\\" necessary to be reunited with Bert, his lover from another life. In 21st century gay Manhattan, with its own \\"barons, \\" Tommy comes across powerful Allan Hubris. Tommy fights Hubris's schemes, while giving himself to an array of adventurous men, who are also looking for that ultimate union and release. Angel Lust combines the mystical atmosphere we see in Ann Rice's classics of dark eroticism withBrass's more open, full-throttle gay sexuality. It will be a grabbed-off-the-shelves read from a master of gay literary erotica and story telling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HR5ncOStVywC&dq=Angel+Lust+:+An+Erotic+Novel+of+Time+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Struggle and the Triumph: An Autobiography","description":"Relates Walesa's rise from the Gdansk shipyard to the presidency and chronicles the history of Solidarity","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L4O-cDD3b7EC&dq=The+Struggle+and+the+Triumph:+An+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside C# (Microsoft Programming)","description":"This book has the same practical approach as the previous \\"Stack Frames: A look from inside\\" where the reader can find useful information on many of the topics addressed here. By focusing on the main subjects, it reviews some implementation details that are often overlooked or left out when studying the C language for the first time.This explains why there are so few chapters, which cover only the most important topics of the language and, often, long sections with poorly detailed definitions but rich with examples and tests to be carried out by the reader.Therefore, the book is addressed mainly to students who have already learned the language and wish to achieve a better understanding of it by observing how the source code is translated by compilers. It's a chance to explore a world so mysterious and exciting, whose importance is often undervalued.The trouble of looking at the assembly code and comparing it with the C source is amply repaid by the knowledge of how computers work and how to optimize code snippets that are responsible for slowing down the executable, assuming the proper algorithm and optimization options have already been chosen.The working environment will be a GNU operating system installed on a personal computer with a 64-bit x86 processor. The working tools will be two compilers (gcc, clang) and a debugger (gdb).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lWvntAEACAAJ&dq=Inside+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Postmodernism (Movements in Modern Art)","description":"This volume is an introduction to the intellectual movement known as Postmodernism and its impact on the visual arts. In clear, jargon-free language, Eleanor Heartney situates Postmodernism historically, showing how it developed both in reaction to and as a result of some of the fundamental beliefs underlying Modernism, especially its positivist, universalizing aspects. She then analyzes paradigmatic Postmodern works of art by artists such as Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, Jeff Koons and Robert Mapplethorpe. Postmodernism provides a concise and articulate overview of the Postmodern phenomenon. Eleanor Heartney is a contributing editor for Art in America, New Art Examiner, and Art Press. In 1991, she was the recipient of the Frank Jewett Mather Award for Distinction in Art Criticism. Heartney is a board member of the American section of the AICA. She is also the author of Critical Condition: American Culture at the Crossroads (Cambridge, 1997).

He reveals new details about her affairs with H.G. Wells (by whom she had a son); the press magnate, Lord Beaverbrook; the renowned journalist, John Gunther; the Nuremberg judge, Francis Biddle; Charlie Chaplin and others. In a life of extremes, she was seen as a feminist, an evil mother, an ardent anti-Communist, and a gossip.

Does it alter the quality of their consciousness, shape their imagery, influence their technique? For the Romantic writers of the nineteenth century, many of whom experimented with opium and some of whom were addicted to it, this was an important question, but it has never been fully answered. In this study Alethea Hayter examines the work of five writers - Crabbe, Coleridge, De Quincey, Wilkie Collins and Francis Thompson - who were opium addicts for many years, and of several other writers - notably Keats, Edgar Allan Poe and Baudelaire, but also Walter Scott, Dickens, Mrs Browning, James Thomson and others - who are known to have taken opium at times. The work of these writers is discussed in the context of nineteenth-century opinion about the uses and dangers of opium, and of Romantic ideas on the creative imagination, on dreams and hypnagogic visions, and on imagery, so that the idiosyncrasies of opium-influenced writing can be isolated from their general literary background. The examination reveals a strange and miserable region of the mind in which some of the greatest poetic imaginations of the nineteenth century were imprisoned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UdwpCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddha, Geoff and Me","description":"Ed is having a hard time - at work, in his love life and, well, generally.

Love, care, and concern is based on what a person has done for them, who that person is, or for what they can get out of a situation. We are self-centered in our love as a society. Against this kind of love comes unconditional love. It is the kind of love that expresses itself to everyone, no matter who they are, no matter what they have done, and expects nothing in return. When Jesus Christ walked the earth as the God/man this was the kind of love he exhibited to others. His death on the cross is God's ultimate expression of unconditional love. As we live Christian lives, the call is upon us to practice unconditional love just as God does. This generation desperately needs to experience genuine, unselfish, Godly love. In UNCONDITIONAL, the author chronicles his journey seeking to practice unconditional love, sometimes successfully, sometimes struggling. May his journey inspire the reader to be God's example of His unconditional love.This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

I don't know why I began writing, nobody asked me to write and I never considered writing as something I'd just do, but there I was clumsily, slowly but creatively pecking away. Writing down thoughts, ideas, streets, characters, chatter, dialogue and actions that actually made me laugh and or reflect. After some months had passed, I had finished my first complete story, which I never read again. But instead I threw it in a drawer unedited and unread by anyone. I began to write another story, which I eventually finished and again tossed it into another drawer, unedited and unread. Almost right away I wrote a play and again tossed it into another drawer. Talking about your closet writer! I continued to write short stories about events and relationships unplanned or outlined, letting the characters, times and places drive my way through each chronicle while piling story on top of story in my desk drawer. So what was it? Why did I continue to write? Hell, because I got off on it. I wasn't trying to make a name for myself as an \\"author\\" or try to become rich, but it was just for the time I spend alone in my writer's closet with not a soul around to tell me what to do or where to go, how things should be done, or the heartache of the world we live in. I have determined that if nobody reads a word, writing is just something I like to do. Now, we've finally come to this, Chronicles of a Nappi Head. ENJOYDo you know the secrets behind your church doors?Tori Braswell is a young and aspiring career woman who fell downon her luck in love.

Lock and others. This book will only carry full history as regards to when and how sisal came to Tanzania and its post independence development. It will also discuss how the industry was managed by both German and British Colonial regimes with emphasis on how sisal cutters were recruited within the country and deplorable conditions of their employment-which might lead one to suspect that the recruitment exercise was somehow another form of modern slavery in modern times when British, Greeks, and Asian nationals were managing sisal estates during the British colonial rule.The rain, which had sputtered across the landscape for a fortnight, had ceased. A brief spell of warmth and sunshine had bathed the gardens all morning, bringing the world into summer bloom.I have learned that creative activity can only take place when an inner voice compels one to write or compose. James Baldwin said that there were days when the muses simply were not speaking to him; therefore he could not write. I agree with that. The poems in this collection came to me as a result of things that profoundly affected me at the time. Thus, producing words in my mind that had to be put on paper. I particularly recall the day the Carolina wren pushed me to write The Carolina Wren Came Calling. My Lord What a Morning was composed after a memorable trip to Washington, DC and He Walked Away From Me, after the death of my partner. Life does change rapidly so set sail and enjoy. I have discovered through out my years in the ministry, that many pastors were having difficulty counseling their members. Basically because people do not only deal with the problems of mans sinful nature, but they also deal with psychological problems, that could be generic in their make up. Then there are the generational curses that may not have been broken. This is why I believe, that pastors need to be equipped to counsel the whole man, and to assess mental disorders from sinful nature behavior. The answer to problems and remedies used today show that the consumption of medicines is quite popular. However complete wholeness through the word of God should be as popular. The bible states in proverbs 24:6 (Amp), for by wise counsel you can wage your war and in an abundance of counselors there is victory and safety.This book is dedicated to all the victims who died on September 11, 2001.

Rolwing examines nearly all the major writers on our Basic Charter, most of whom repudiate it. He focuses on their manifold criticisms and rejections, reveals their multiple distortions and misunderstandings, rebukes their self-contradictions and inconsistencies, and pities their general theo-phobia. He argues that while America was Founded almost completely by Protestant Christians (the only two \\"deists\\" were not even \\"deists\\"), what was Founded was formally only a philosophical product, not a faith based or Christian one, although the philosophy had been more Catholic than Protestant. Rolwing makes a great deal of American history, law, ethics, politics, philosophy, and theology easily accessible to the average reader. Each 5 minute essay can give you a high for the whole day.\\"Certainly the Declaration is worth many an hour explaining and defending it. Mr. Rolwing seeks to make the problems brought up about the document capable of being understood by both scholar and ordinary citizen.\\"A Season in Prison\\" is a unique contribution to prison literature.

It tells the story of two aging computer experts who are forced out of retirement to try to combat an attack on America's computerized financial infrastructure. The terrorists have an unusual demand--that the United States establish a Department of Peace. There are moments of drama, humor and levity, and ultimately the story is critical of aspects of both Islamic fundamentalism and of the kind of dogmatic, tone-deaf American foreign policy that has characterized the Bush administration.The Ferrari Vendetta is a well written suspense\\\\ action packed novel. The author, Richard Jay, piques the interest of the reader with his colorful and descriptive writing style. He keeps the reader intrigued with the plot and it's a Can't put it down novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pT69ZqSlMmEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By Force of Arms (Legion)","description":"Having stopped a mutiny against Earth's government, General Bill Booly and his troops face an even greater challenge: a battle for the future of every living being in the universe, against a fanatical human and his killer technology. \\"Dietz's expertise in matters of mayhem is second to none.\\" --The Oregonian","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S-NAofylfXAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wavelet Theory and Its Applications (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","description":"The continuous wavelet transform has deep mathematical roots in the work of Alberto P. Calderon. His seminal paper on complex method of interpolation and intermediate spaces provided the main tool for describing function spaces and their approximation properties. The Calderon identities allow one to give integral representations of many natural operators by using simple pieces of such operators, which are more suited for analysis. These pieces, which are essentially spectral projections, can be chosen in clever ways and have proved to be of tremendous utility in various problems of numerical analysis, multidimensional signal processing, video data compression, and reconstruction of high resolution images and high quality speech. A proliferation of research papers and a couple of books, written in English (there is an earlier book written in French), have emerged on the subject. These books, so far, are written by specialists for specialists, with a heavy mathematical flavor, which is characteristic of the Calderon-Zygmund theory and related research of Duffin-Schaeffer, Daubechies, Grossman, Meyer, Morlet, Chui, and others. Randy Young's monograph is geared more towards practitioners and even non-specialists, who want and, probably, should be cognizant of the exciting proven as well as potential benefits which have either already emerged or are likely to emerge from wavelet theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LTnUBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"United States Submarines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ILTQoQEACAAJ&dq=United+States+Submarines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heaven Has No Favorites","description":"From one of the twentieth century s master novelists, the author of the classic All Quiet on the Western Front, comes Heaven Has No Favorites, a bittersweet story of unconventional love that sweeps across Europe. Lillian is charming, beautiful . . . and slowly dying of consumption. But she doesn t wish to end her days in a hospital in the Alps. She wants to see Paris again, then Venice to live frivolously for as long as possible. She might die on the road, she might not, but before she goes, she wants a chance at life. Clerfayt, a race-car driver, tempts fate every time he s behind the wheel. A man with no illusions about chance, he is powerfully drawn to a woman who can look death in the eye and laugh. Together, he and Lillian make an unusual pair, living only for the moment, without regard for the future. It s a perfect arrangement until one of them begins to fall in love.  The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.

First meeting as delegates to the Continental Congress in 1775, they initiated correspondence in 1777, negotiated jointly as ministers in Europe in the 1780s, and served the early Republic--each, ultimately, in its highest office. At Jefferson's defeat of Adams for the presidency in 1800, they became estranged, and the correspondence lapses from 1801 to 1812, then is renewed until the death of both in 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence. Lester J. Cappon's edition, first published in 1959 in two volumes, provides the complete correspondence between these two men and includes the correspondence between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. Many of these letters have been published in no other modern edition, nor does any other edition devote itself exclusively to the exchange between Jefferson and the Adamses. Introduction, headnotes, and footnotes inform the reader without interrupting the speakers. This reissue of The Adams-Jefferson Letters in a one-volume unabridged edition brings to a broader audience one of the monuments of American scholarship and, to quote C. Vann Woodward, 'a major treasure of national literature.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GDHqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Death, Run Spy Run, The Preposterous Theft","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1CQLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dr.+Death,+Run+Spy+Run,+The+Preposterous+Theft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cryptozoic","description":"A novel of time-traveling adventure from the author of the story  Supertoys Last All Summer Long,  the basis for the movie A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.

Does the confession of a general or universal revelation owe its existence to a flight, perhaps unconscious, from the sufficiency and absoluteness of the revelation in Christ? And is Christ to be regarded as but a special illustration of the general revelation of God in the world, a revelation richer and broader than simply that revelation in Christ?

In addition, the MCSA (Microsoft Certified System Administrator) certification will expand its program to include an additional upgrade exam for MCSAs wanting to become MCSEs. The launch of this new certification track means that all current MCSEs, representing an installed base of approximately 200,000 (source: MCP Magazine) will need to recertify under Windows Server 2003. In addition, any MCP looking to become an MCSE--estimates are about 1.2 million (source: MCP Magazine)--will also have to continue their certifications under the new program.

All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces.  The word  love  is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,  writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society s failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question  What is love?  her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the  100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.  All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A5ZDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management in Small Doses","description":"Fifty-two brief essays discuss the effectiveness of advertising, breaking company rules, corporate mission statements, productivity, and employee incentives","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6lpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Management+in+Small+Doses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sincerely, Peg","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oLyLtgAACAAJ&dq=Sincerely,+Peg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All quiet on the western front;","description":"Considered by many the greatest war novel of all time, All Quiet on the Western Front is Erich Maria Remarque s masterpiece of the German experience during World War I.

Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive.  The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.

In his absorbing new book, Robert Irwin, Arabist and novelist, examines its history and allure. The Alhambra is the only Muslim palace to have survived since the Middle Ages. Built by a threatened dynasty of Muslim Spain, it was preserved as a monument to the triumph of Christianity. Every day thousands of tourists enter this magnificent site to be awestruck by its towers and courts, its fountained gardens, its honeycombed ceilings and intricate tile work. It is a complex full of mysteries--even its purpose is unclear. Its sophisticated ornamentation is not indiscriminate but full of hidden meaning. Its most impressive buildings were designed not by architects, but by philosophers and poets. The Alhambra, which resembles a fairy-tale palace, was constructed by slave labor in an era of economic decline, plague, and political violence. Its sumptuously appointed halls have lain witness to murder and mayhem. Yet its influence on art and on literature--including Orientalist painting and the architecture of cinemas, Washington Irving and Jorge Luis Borges--has been lasting and significant. As our guide to this architectural masterpiece, Robert Irwin allows us to fully understand the impact of the Alhambra.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1XpJEAAAQBAJ&dq=THE+ALHAMBRA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The digging-est dog","description":"Scorned by his new dog friends because he never learned to dig, Sam suddenly discovers his inherent dog talent and turns the countryside into a series of ruts and holes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jxvEJ1jt3bQC&dq=The+digging-est+dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Hart Benton (American statesmen)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHNFzgEACAAJ&dq=Thomas+Hart+Benton+(American+statesmen)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to study the Bible: The Second Coming and other expositions","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q8c4AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wasteland,: A novel","description":"Los Angeles Times Book Prize Winner ?

Authors Ulrich, Zenger, and Smallwood--world-renowned experts in human resources and training--argue that it is not enough to gauge leaders by personal traits such as character, style, and values. Rather, effective leaders know how to connect these leadership attributes with results. Results-Based Leadership shows executives how to deliver results in four specific areas: results for employees, for the organization, for its customers, and for its investors. The authors provide action-oriented guidelines that readers can follow to develop and hone their own results-based leadership skills. By shifting our focus to the connection between the attributes and the results of leadership, this perceptive new guide fundamentally improves our understanding of effective leadership.

LeGuin and Philip Roth. No critic has better understood the ways writers influence one another how literary traditions are made and no writer has helped readers understand this better, than Harold Bloom. Over the course of a remarkable sixty-year career, in such bestselling books as The Western Canon, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, and How to Read and Why, Bloom brought enormous insight and infectious enthusiasm to the great writers of the Western tradition, from Shakespeare and Cervantes to the British Romantics and the Russian masters. Now, for the first time, comes a collection of his brilliant writings about the American tradition, the ultimate guide to our nation s literature. Assembled with David Mikics (Slow Reading in a Hurried Age), this unprecedented collection gathers five decades  worth of Bloom s writings  much of it hard to find and long unavailable including essays, occasional pieces, and introductions as well as excerpts from his books. It offers deep readings of 47 essential American writers, reflecting on the surprising ways they have influenced each other across more than two centuries. The story it tells, of American literature as a recurring artistic struggle for selfhood, speaks to the passion and power of the American spirit. All of the visionary American writers who have long preoccupied BloomDEmerson and Whitman, Hawthorne and Melville, and Dickinson, Faulkner, Crane, Frost, Stevens, and BishopDmake their appearance in The American Canon, along with Hemingway, James, O Connor, Ellison, Hurston, Le Guin, Ashbery and many others. Bloom s passion for these classic writers is contagious, and he reminds readers how they have shaped our sense of who we are, and how they can summon us to be better versions of ourselves. Bloom, Mikics writes,  is still our most inspirational critic, still the man who can enlighten us by telling us to read as if our lives depended on it: Because, he insists, they do.

High Treason challenges everything we have been told about the motives behind President Kennedy s murder. There is now convincing evidence that, from the fateful day in Dallas through four decades of speculation, a massive conspiracy ordered JFK s demise and sabotaged the investigations that followed. It is a cover-up that continues to this day. Bestselling author Harrison Edward Livingstone has written extensively on the Kennedy assassination and has long led the investigation into the murder of President Kennedy. Harrison Edward Livingstone reveals the dark heart of a deadly conspiracy through such evidence as the high level Texans that ran the conspiracy; Links between persons in the FBI, the CIA, and the Mafia; Lee Harvey Oswald s frame-up as the  fall guy  for the assassination; Startling connections between the JFK conspiracy and the Watergate scandal; Official autopsy photographs that are proven forgeries; The testimonies of over fifty eyewitnesses that were completely ignored by the Warren Commission; and shortly after the assassination on November 22, 1963, the FBI knew there was a bullet lodged in JFK s skull. The reasons why this was covered up are obvious. High Treason is investigative journalism at its best! For the first time, the New York Times bestsellerHigh Treason is presented as it was originally written in 1979-80. The new book is updated, annotated, and revised in this volume. Prominent JFK assassination researcher Martin Shackleford calls High Treason the best introduction to the evidence that has ever been written, and the book gives an overview of the case. It was the prelude to five more massive works by the author. The Guardian wrote that  Livingstone s monumental investigation makes an invaluable contribution to solving the mystery of Kennedy s death.   The Documentation is copious, the many photos  add intrigue and the general tone is of a thoroughly serious nature. A must.  The Booklist about High Treason.  Case reopened!

Baum maintains that by fostering trust, integrity and accountability at all levels within the corporation, managers can stop the erosion of employee loyalty, restore consumer trust in brands, products, and American business. Baum teaches executives fresh ways of managing Wall Street analysts, communicating with shareholders, and wading through the complex maze of social responsibility issues. As a member of six corporate boards, Baum offers unique insight into transparent leadership, including the advantages and pitfalls of corporate governance, and the pressures executives face in reporting earnings.

In politics there's absolutely nothing new. Again, out of impatience I feel myself beginning to fall into melancholy. There is really no way out of this for us.\\" This is Dawid Sierakowiak's final diary entry. Soon after writing it, the young author died of tuberculosis, exhaustion, and starvation--the Holocaust syndrome known as \\"ghetto disease.\\" After the liberation of the /L d'z Ghetto, his notebooks were found stacked on a cookstove, ready to be burned for heat. Young Sierakowiak was one of more than 60,000 Jews who perished in that notorious urban slave camp, a man-made hell which was the longest surviving concentration of Jews in Nazi Europe. The diary comprises a remarkable legacy left to humanity by its teenage author. It is one of the most fastidiously detailed accounts ever rendered of modern life in human bondage. Off mountain climbing and studying in southern Poland during the summer of 1939, Dawid begins his diary with a heady enthusiasm to experience life, learn languages, and read great literature. He returns home under the quickly gathering clouds of war. Abruptly /L d'z is occupied by the Nazis, and the Sierakowiak family is among the city's 200,000 Jews who are soon forced into a sealed ghetto, completely cut off from the outside world. With intimate, undefended prose, the diary's young author begins to describe the relentless horror of their predicament: his daily struggle to obtain food to survive; trying to make reason out of a world gone mad; coping with the plagues of death and deportation. Repeatedly he rallies himself against fear and pessimism, fighting the cold, disease, and exhaustion which finally consume him. Physical pain and emotional woe hold him constantly at the edge of endurance. Hunger tears Dawid's family apart, turning his father into a thief who steals bread from his wife and children. The wonder of the diary is that every bit of hardship yields wisdom from Dawid's remarkable intellect. Reading it, you become a prisoner with him in the ghetto, and with discomfiting intimacy you begin to experience the incredible process by which the vast majority of the Jews of Europe were annihilated in World War II. Significantly, the youth has no doubt about the consequence of deportation out of the ghetto: \\"Deportation into lard,\\" he calls it. A committed communist and the unit leader of an underground organization, he crusades for more food for the ghetto's school children. But when invited to pledge his life to a suicide resistance squad, he writes that he cannot become a \\"professional revolutionary.\\" He owes his strength and life to the care of his family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5XY8DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Diary+of+Dawid+Sierakowak&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange new gospels,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ic0WAAAAIAAJ&dq=Strange+new+gospels,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"xBase Programming for the True Beginner: An Introduction to the xBase Language in the Context of dBASE III+, IV, 5, FoxPro, and Clipper","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtcFAAAACAAJ&dq=xBase+Programming+for+the+True+Beginner:+An+Introduction+to+the+xBase+Language+in+the+Context+of+dBASE+III+,+IV,+5,+FoxPro,+and+Clipper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mama's kitchen goes to college","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AdtsHQAACAAJ&dq=Mama%27s+kitchen+goes+to+college&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"YOur Dream Dog: Guide to Choosing the Right Breed for You, A","description":"In a practical guide to the complexities of the human-canine relationship, the renowned dog trainer explains how to find the right dog to suit one's individual lifestyle, furnishing detailed descriptions and photographs of more than 140 officially recognized breeds.

But could the life she would never choose be better than the one she had planned? Bessie is shocked when she finds out that her sister Lenore has used her name to correspond with a soldier she's never met--and that she's actually married the man by proxy with Bessie's name. And if Bessie contests it, her sister could go to jail for forgery. Bessie has always felt responsible for her younger sister, and she believes she has no choice but to do the honorable thing and travel west to meet up with Jasper Mendenhall. With his sister Jessica's reprimand about marrying sight-unseen still ringing in his ears, Jasper is shocked when he meets the stagecoach. The little wren who meets him is not the beauty whose picture he holds in his hand. Jasper plans to annul the marriage and send Bessie back to Boston. She's a city girl and he's not sure she could even survive--much less be happy--at Fort Bowie. But Jasper's orders to return to Fort Bowie are moved up, and he has no choice but to take Bessie with him.

This volume examines Churchill's views about the rise of German and Japanese power, and how the growing armed strength of these two countries undermined the security of Britain and its empire. In addition, new technologies were transforming the international and strategic environment, not always to Britain's advantage. The growing importance of air power in modern warfare, for example, posed the grave danger of direct attacks by bombers on the British home isles. The authors also offer new appraisals of the foreign policy and strategic prescriptions advocated by Churchill.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sj94Q-874hEC&dq=Paradoxes+of+Strategic+Intelligence:+Essays+in+Honor+of+Michael+I.+Handel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Killed Palomino Molero?","description":"This wonderful detective novel is set in Peru in the 1950s.

We may say that the Bible is an important book, but few really understand how it came to be or what really it says, and some of us just think it is complete nonsense. Many of the stories seem archaic and out of touch with modern culture. Yet if we look closely, the Bible contains timeless wisdom and principles that are very much applicable. This book offers an easy-to-understand explanation of the origins and purposes of the Bible. It will give modern perspectives on how we might read and understand scripture today in light of all that we know (and don't know) about the world.

Donald E. Markle details the rapid advances in methods of covert communication via newspaper and telegraph, and their effects on the war front. Enemy newspapers, for instance, became a coveted asset for the spy. Spies often acted as newspaper couriers for their governments, or even provided a \\"clipping service\\" to swiftly convey information aiding military strategists and their supporters. In some rare but very effective cases, spies listened in on enemy communications and even acted as telegraphers for the enemy, distorting messages. Such activities prompted both the Union and Confederate forces to encode messages and develop cryptography skills. Markle brings to light the extensive participation of women in Civil War espionage. For the first time during an American war, women with a desire to take an active part in the war effort (in areas besides nursing) were able to spy on the enemy by relaying daily reports from the battlefields. This new phenomenon is due in part to the rapid movement of information; for the first time during a war, the civilian population received timely news of their armies, their losses, their victories, and their struggles. Information conveyed by both the Union and the Confederate spies was, inevitably, not always accurate. Markle details some of the havoc wreaked by the misinformed. Generals Van Dorn and Price, for example, experienced such misfortune when they were considering an attack on Corinth, Mississippi, in the fall of 1862. Based on the information of one of their spies, General Van Dorn grossly underestimated the number of Federal troops he faced. This miscalculation lead to a Confederate rout with a loss of over 5,000 of his 25,000 troops. Markle examines the spies' overall impact on the outcome of the Civil War, as well as on the modern world of intelligence. Some of the risky spying methods conducted during the Civil War could only have been productive in that era. Others laid the groundwork for the sophisticated techniques of the 20th century. His account also carries most of the stories beyond the Civil War itself, and describes the difficulties and experiences of spies trying to acclimate to normal life, finding that some did and some did not.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r0saAQAAIAAJ&dq=Some+Were+Spies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thyrza","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eg69hq2pohsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew","description":"\\"Birthdays may be difficult for me.\\" \\"I want you to take the initiative in opening conversations about my birth family.\\" \\"When I act out my fears in obnoxious ways, please hang in there with me.\\" \\"I am afraid you will abandon me.\\" The voices of adopted children are poignant, questioning.
