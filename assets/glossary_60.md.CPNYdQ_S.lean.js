It was not a replacement for the legendary E-type; its colours were uninspired; and its interior was drab. All credit, then, to those people at Jaguar who truly believed in the car and, over a period of nearly 20 years, turned the ugly duckling into a swan. From the moment the XJ-S HE arrived in 1981, there seemed to be renewed hope, and from then on, the car went from strength to strength to become the much-admirred grand tourer it always should have been. The book contains a timeline of the key events in the history of the XJ-S and an overview of the evolution of the XJS from the XJ27 prototype.

Urbino Macintyre, well-named urbane, an expatriate American and author who effectively functions as amateur detective when the situation requires. And the magical city that is a character in herself - Venice. These play the principal parts in Edward Sklepowich's brilliant series of neo-classic mysteries. We visit Venice and the delightful pair again in this sixth episode. Urbino has just returned from a long stay in Morocco, bringing with him a young painter named Habib. At their reunion, the first order of business is for the Contessa to bring her friend up on the latest gossip. Only after that does she enlist his help in a serious problem; she is being blackmailed, with the threat of a falsely scandalous revelation about her late husband. Urbino soon finds that the answers he seeks seem to be centered in Burano, the little island town outside of the city proper that has for centuries been the center of Venetian lacemaking. Recently, the picturesque village has been discovered by expatriate European and British artists and writers, whose lunches and cocktail gatherings give Urbino excuses to visit Burano for his investigations. But it is not the chic invaders whose actions are questionable. Urbino is much more interested in Burano's native inhabitants, and in particular one old lace maker (who Habib insists has the evil eye), her surly son, and in Giorgio, the Contessa's boatman. When the old lace maker is murdered, and diplomatic but troubling suspicion touches the Contessa herself, and dark clouds gather around Habib, Urbino has to overcome a reluctance to dig deeper and face whatever unwelcome discoveries he makes. In Deadly to the Sight, Sklepowich conjures up the spell of Venice, its beauty and its frightening dark alleys, and the color of Burano's island atmosphere. He wittily comments on a vivid canvas of characters --artists and artisans, aristocrats and their servants - an entire population swirling in the Mediterranean light and shadow of the Italian coast, providing opportunities for suspense and drama that will hold the reader from the first page.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0Qw3PwAACAAJ&dq=Deadly+to+the+Sight:+A+Mystery+of+Venice+(Urbino+Macintyre+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Place Of Men","description":"As teens, Otis and Terrell were lovers.

As the son of the general manager, Stephen Lewis grew up in this legendary hotel, living with his parents and younger brother in a suite overlooking the Roxy Theater. His engaging memoir of his childhood captures the colorful, bustling atmosphere of the Taft, where his father, the best hotelman in New York, ruled a staff of Damon Runyonesque house dicks, chambermaids, bellmen, and waiters, who made sure that Stephen knew what to do with a swizzle stick by the time he was in the third grade. The star of this memoir is Lewis's fast-talking, opinionated, imperious mother, who adapted so completely to hotel life that she rarely left the Taft. Evelyn Lewis rang the front desk when she wanted to make a telephone call, ordered all the family's meals from room service, and had her dresses sent over from Saks. During the Depression, the tough kids from Hell's Kitchen who went to grade school with Stephen marveled at the lavish spreads his mother offered her friends at lunch every day, and later even his wealthy classmates at Horace Mann-Lincoln were impressed by the limitless hot fudge sundaes available to the Lewis boys. Lewis contrasts the fairy-tale luxury of his life inside the hotel with the gritty carnival spirit of his Times Square neighborhood, filled with the noise of trolleys, the smell of saloons, the dazzle of billboards and neon signs. In Hotel Kid, lovers of New York can visit the nightclubs and movie palaces of a vanished era and thread their way among the sightseers and hucksters, shoeshine boys and chorus girls who crowded the streets when Times Square really was the crossroads of the world. \\"[T]his postcard from a vanished age nicely captures a special childhood rivaling Eloise's\\" Kirkus Reviews \\"A colorful and nostalgic snapshot of a vanished era.\\" Bloomsbury Review \\"Chockfull of history and wit, Stephen Lewis' account of his charming yet preposterous childhood spent in a suite at the Taft Hotel ordering from room service and playing games like elevator free fall is a five-star read. Hotel Kid pays tribute to an elegant time long ago that was very elegant and is very gone. It's a book we've been waiting for without realizing it: at long last, an Eloise for grown ups.\\" Madeleine Blais, author of Uphill Walkers: Portrait of a Family Stephen Lewis on Hotel Kid: \\"Raised in a loving cocoon of chambermaids, bellboys, porters, waiters, and housedicks, I led a fairy tale existence as the son of the general manager of the Hotel Taft, just off Times Square and Radio City. During the darkest days of the Depression, my younger brother and I treated our friends to limitless chocolate  clairs and ice cream sodas. Vague longings for a 'real American life' rose only occasionally   as rare as the home-cooked meals my mother attempted once or twice a year. From my privileged vantage point in a four-room suite on the fifteenth floor, overlooking the chorus girls sunbathing on the roof of the Roxy Theater, I grew into adolescence, both street-smart and sheltered by the hundreds of hotel workers who had known me since I was a baby.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1-rMcMDhlBwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Armchair Cogitations","description":"Armchair Cogitations is a collection of short stories, essays, and a play, in which the author reflects upon life, including his Air Force experiences, family events, mind trips, and coming to terms with his existence as a stroke survivor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gSUCvi0ZPdAC&dq=Armchair+Cogitations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christus victor: An historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement","description":"Gustaf Aulen's classic work, 'Christus Victor', has long been a standard text on the atonement. Aulen applies \\"history of ideas' methodology to historical theology in tracing the development of three views of the atonement. Aulen asserts that in traditional histories of the doctrine of the atonement only two views have usually been presented, the objective/Anselmian and the subjective/Aberlardian views. According to Aulen, however, there is another type of atonement doctrine in which Christ overcomes the hostile powers that hold humanity in subjection, at the same time that God in Christ reconciles the world to Himself. This view he calls the \\"classic\\" idea of the atonement. Because of its predominance in the New Testament, in patristic writings, and in the theology of Luther, Aulen holds that the classic type may be called the distinctively Christian idea of the atonement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nWyvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Maltese (Howell Book House's Essential)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Little Books of Wisdom)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"House of Invention: The Extraordinary Evolution of Everyday Objects","description":"Surprising history of ordinary things Learn the fascinating history and trivia you never knew about things we use daily from the host of The Story Behind podcast.

Originally supported by a bipartisan coalition, it purports to improve public schools by enforcing a system of standards and accountability through high-stakes testing. Many people supported it originally, despite doubts, because of its promise especially to improve the way schools serve poor children. By making federal funding contingent on accepting a system of tests and sanctions, it is radically affecting the life of schools around the country. But, argue the authors of this citizen's guide to the most important political issue in education, far from improving public schools and increasing the ability of the system to serve poor and minority children, the law is doing exactly the opposite. Here some of our most prominent, respected voices in education-including school innovator Deborah Meier, education activist Alfie Kohn, and founder of the Coalition of Essential Schools Theodore R. Sizer-come together to show us how, point by point, NCLB undermines the things it claims to improve: * How NCLB punishes rather than helps poor and minority kids and their schools * How NCLB helps further an agenda of privatization and an attack on public schools * How the focus on testing and test preparation dumbs down classrooms * And they put forward a richly articulated vision of alternatives. Educators and parents around the country are feeling the harshly counterproductive effects of NCLB. This book is an essential guide to understanding what's wrong and where we should go from here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zYJtKISzFqcC&dq=Many+Children+Left+Behind:+How+the+No+Child+Left+Behind+Act+Is+Damaging+Our+Children+and+Our+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How You Lose: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Business Plan Guide for Independent Consultants","description":"At last, a complete business plan guide just for independentconsultants! . . .

Eisenhower to George W. Bush","description":"...a helpful resource. -BooklistThis is a glorious America for the alert and resourceful, notes Daniel Friedenberg in this critical review of the American presidency during the last half of the 20th century. But he cautions, This is an unhappy America for the disadvantaged, the weak in body or mind, and those born without close family ties.The disparity between rich and poor in our immensely wealthy nation and the corrupting influence of money on politics to the advantage of the few over the many form the heart of his critique. Friedenberg emphasizes that the New Deal concern for the underdog - the major social achievement of the first half of the 20th century - has been gradually abandoned by presidents in the latter half of the century, along with tax policies that shifted wealth from the well-to-do to the less privileged. Though paying lip service to democracy, in fact recent presidents have upheld a system designed to maximize the influence of a powerful elite, a flexible plutocracy, as Friedenberg describes it. This has good and bad aspects. On the one hand, the innovations launched by powerful business leaders, such as Henry Ford, Thomas J. Watson (IBM), and Bill Gates (Microsoft), have resulted in millions of new jobs and advanced the overall prosperity of the nation. On the other hand, the system does little to help the poor rise to a higher level, and it has kept the middle class stagnating for the last thirty years. The effect of presidential policies is a divide between the haves and have-nots that today is every bit as stark as it was before the Great Depression.Friedenberg pleads for a new focus on improved education for all to narrow the widening gap between rich and poor, instead of the current folly of building gated communities for the wealthy and ever-more prisons for the law-breaking underprivileged. The vast technological resources unleashed by the computer revolution can and should be used to create a more equitable American future.Daniel M. Friedenberg (Greenwich, CT) is president of John-Platt Enterprises, Inc.; the author of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Land; and a former correspondent and feature writer for the New York Herald Tribune.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qVx_36eKqe4C&dq=Sold+to+the+Highest+Bidder+:+The+Presidency+from+Dwight+D.+Eisenhower+to+George+W.+Bush&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Lovey Hart, I Am Desperate","description":"When she takes on the advice column for her school newspaper, Carrie encounters more problems than she expects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zD95QlOcz8QC&dq=Dear+Lovey+Hart,+I+Am+Desperate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queensland Travel Map (Globetrotter Travel Map)","description":"This comprehensive, pocket-sized guide is crammed with useful information, travel tips and recommendations for the traveller.

Offers a complementary method of Flower Essence evaluation using physical conditions to access the emotions Bach flower essences provide excellent tools for balancing energetic disturbances generated by emotions. Yet people often have trouble clearly expressing their feelings and emotions, making selection of a specific flower essence difficult. Drawing upon the centuries-old relationships established in Chinese Medicine between emotions and physical disorders, Pablo Noriega shows how to use a person s descriptions of their complaints and chronic conditions combined with Flower-type personality traits to diagnose which flower essence to prescribe in each unique case. The author includes a full primer on Chinese Medicine, exploring in detail the main principles: Yin and Yang; the Five Elements and their associated Organs; Blood and Energy; the Virtues, the behaviors that can strengthen the Elements; and the Psyches, the energetic spirit of each Organ.

For Father Apostoli, these moments vividly captured the unspoken code of these heroic public servants: \\"We go in together, we come out together.\\" Christians, if they are to have any impact in today's world, have something of the same code: we fight the good fight, side by side, ready to lay down our lives for one another. Such heroism doesn't come naturally. As Walk Humbly With Your God points out, it is in the day-to-day training, in taking the simple steps to holiness, that heroism becomes second nature.

Who were they? What were their lives like? What thoughts, dreams, and desires might they yield up if we took the time to truly look at them? In this elegant volume Marilyn Chandler McEntyre asks these very questions, and she teases out intriguing possibilities in twenty poems arranged side by side with color reproductions of the paintings that inspired them. McEntyre has chosen eighteen of Vermeer's famous women - including The Lacemaker, The Milkmaid, Girl with a Pearl Earring, and The Girl with a Red Hat - to wonder about. Rich with imagined detail, each of these poems invites the reader to take a closer look at Vermeer's portraits, to celebrate not only Vermeer's artistry but also the significance of the women themselves. McEntyre thoughtfully imagines the personal lives of these women and attempts to capture what Vermeer himself saw in them - a contemplative exercise that illuminates the presence of grace in the ordinary moments of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o4CIPwAACAAJ&dq=In+Quiet+Light:+Poems+on+Vermeer%27s+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Church Is Bigger Than You Think: The Unfinished Work of World Evangelism","description":"Patrick Johnstone shares his passion for mission with us, showing us that the Church is bigger than we think in terms of Time, Size and Structure.

What kind of society could produce such spectacular treasures only to bury them forever? Lost in a frenzy of speculation--anthropological, scientific, and commercial--was Tutankhamen himself. Thirty-five hundred years ago, the mightiest empire on Earth crowned a boy as its king, then worshipped him as a god. Nine years later, he was dead. Despite the young monarch's almost universal recognition in death, Egyptologists know very little about his life. Traditional histories, founded on incomplete investigation and academic dogma, shed almost no light on the details of a life as complicated and as fascinating as it was short. In Tutankhamen: The Life and Death of the Boy-King, Christine El Mahdy finally delivers a coherent portrait of King Tut's life and its historical significance. Based on stunning tomb records, lost since their discovery, this revolutionary biography begins to answer one of the twentieth century's most compelling archaeological mysteries: Who was Tutankhamen?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ewpOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Being and Nothingness: An Essay in Phenomenological Ontology.","description":"\\"First published in French in 1943 Jean-Paul Sartre's L' tre et le N ant is one of the greatest philosophical works of the twentieth century. In it, Sartre offers nothing less than a brilliant and radical account of the human condition. The English philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch wrote to a friend of \\"the excitement - I remember nothing like it since the days of discovering Keats and Shelley and Coleridge\\". What gives our lives significance, Sartre argues in Being and Nothingness, is not pre-established for us by God or nature but is something for which we ourselves are responsible. Combining this with the unsettling view that human existence is characterized by radical freedom and the inescapability of choice, Sartre introduces us to a cast of ideas and characters that are part of philosophical legend: anguish; the 'bad faith' of the memorable waiter in the caf ; sexual desire; and the 'look' of the other, brought to life by Sartre's famous description of someone looking through a keyhole. Above all, by arguing that we alone create our values and that human relationships are characterized by hopeless conflict, Sartre paints a stark and controversial picture of our moral universe and one that resonates strongly today.

But what does one do with a major character who simplifies as a novel progresses, to the point where even this novel's other characters begin to disregard him? Flat Protagonists shows that writers have undertaken such formal experiments-which give rise to its titular \\"flat protagonists\\"-since the novel's incipience. It finds such characters in British and French novels ranging from the late-seventeenth to the early-twentieth century by Aphra Behn, Isabelle de Charri re, Fran?oise de Graffigny, Thomas Hardy, and Marcel Proust. Marta Figlerowicz argues that these uncommon flat protagonists challenge our larger views about the novel as a genre. Upending a longstanding tradition of valuing characters for their complexity, Figlerowicz proposes that novels, and their characters, should be appreciated for highlighting the limits to how much attention any particular person's self-expression tends to garner, and how much insight anyone has to offer her community. As invitations to consider how we might come across to others, rather than merely how others come across to us, flat protagonists both subvert and complement the more conventional approach to novels as, at their best, sites of instruction in interpersonal empathy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6PqSDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carcajou (Merit books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I'm Falling to Bits Hb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gutenberg Galaxy","description":"The Gutenberg Galaxy catapulted Marshall McLuhan to fame as a media theorist and, in time, a new media prognosticator.

Lofty thoughts, like dreams, are born and live overhead, just as they have been represented in Renaissance paintings and modern cartoons. Ceilings are often repositories of stories, events and otherwise invisible oneiric narratives. Yet environments that inspire innovative thinking are dwindling as our world confronts enormous challenges, and almost all of our thinking, debating and decision-making takes place under endless ceiling grids. Quantitative research establishes that spaces with taller ceilings elicit broader, more creative thoughts. Today, ceilings are usually squat conduits of technology: they have become the blind spot of modern architecture. The twenty essays in this book look across cultures, places and ceilings over time to discover their potential to uplift the human spirit. Not just one building element among many, the ceiling is a key to unlock the architectural imagination. Ceilings and Dreams aims to correct this blind spot and encourages architects and designers, researchers and students, to look up through writings organized into three expansive categories: reveries, suspensions and inversions. The contributors contemplate the architecture of levity and the potential of the ceiling, once again, as a place for dreaming.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=szuhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hypnosis in Dentistry: A Handbook for Clinical Use","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U89pAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hypnosis+in+Dentistry:+A+Handbook+for+Clinical+Use&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Few Words / En Pocas Palabras: A Compendium of Latino Folk Wit and Wisdom (NEA Heritage & Preservation Series, Book 1)","description":"The author of Drink Cultura gathered this generous bilingual compilation of Latino folk sayings--dichos.

This collection of stories, originally published in Lebanon as Ala La'ihat al-Intizar, is the most recent of her five publications. Her stories intimately reflect women's experiences in the chaotic worlds of the Lebanese civil war and the rise of Saadam Hussain as Iraq's leader. Set in Iraq, Cyprus, and Lebanon, the stories shed light on an unusual Middle East refugee experience that of a cultural refugee, a divorced woman who is educated, affluent, and alone. Al-Amir is also a poet and novelist, whose sensual prose grows out of a long tradition of Iraqi poetry. But one also finds existential themes in her works, as Al-Amir tries to balance what seems fated and what seems arbitrary in the turbulent world she inhabits. She deals with time and space in a minimalist, surreal style, while studying the disappointments of life through the subjective lens of memory. Honestly facing the absence of family and the instability of place, Al-Amir gives lifelike qualities to the inanimate objects of her rapidly changing world. In addition to the stories, two examples of the author's experimental poems are included.

It raises important issues and historical facts that restore the balance-of-power between non-verbal/visual creative thinking and verbal/math creative thinking. The book is a valuable tool that recognizes the potency of data-driven digital visualization and empowers our visual technological futures. It is a must read for any visualization educator.-Professor Donna Cox, Director, Visualization and Experimental Technologies, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of IllinoisThis book is a fascinating look at the history of the relationship between logical and visual thinking. There are aspects to this history that are both frightening and encouraging and, with the current pendulum swing back towards visualization as a respectable thinking tool, it provides an important guide to what has been done before and what can be done in the future.-Dr. James F. Blinn, Graphics Fellow at Microsoft Research, MacArthur Fellow, and columnist for IEEE Computer GraphicsAlbert Einstein once said that all of his most important and productive thinking was done by playing with images in his imagination. Only in a secondary stage did he translate - with great effort, he says - these images into the language of words and mathematics that could be understood by others.According to Thomas G. West, Einstein was a classic example of a strong visual thinker, a person who tends to think in images and visual patterns, and sometimes has difficulty with words and numbers. In his awarding-winning book, In the Mind''s Eye, West discussed the connections between highly talented, visually oriented persons like Einstein and certain learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Now, in Thinking Like Einstein, West investigates the new worlds of visual thinking, insight, and creativity made possible by computer graphics and information visualization technologies. He argues that, with the rapid spread of inexpensive and powerful computers, we are now at the beginning of a major transition, moving from an old world based mainly on words and numbers to a new world where high level work in all fields will eventually involve insights based on the display and manipulation of complex information using moving computer images.West profiles several highly creative visual thinkers, such as James Clerk Maxwell, Nikola Tesla, and Richard Feynman, pointing out that there is a long history of using visualization rather than words or numbers to solve problems. Citing the longstanding historical conflicts between image lovers and image haters, West examines the relationship of art, scientific knowledge, and differences in brain capabilities - observing how modern visual thinkers with visualization technologies seem to have learned how to cut through the problems of overspecialization in academia and in the workplace.West predicts that computer visualization technology will radically change the way we all work and think. For thousands of years the technology of writing and reading has tended to promote the dominance of the left hemisphere of the brain, with its linear processing of words and numbers.

The lives of some persons have been worth narrating because of their abounding in deeds of great merit, such as the lives of Washington, Gladstone, Frances E. Willard, and Joan of Arc. The lives of others have been thought worth narrating because of their great wickedness, as the lives of Nero and Queen Mary of England. But the church too has a history. This history differs from the history of the world, in that it does not record merely the doings of man, but the workings of God through man as his instruments. God is a jealous God who manifests himself only through those who are willing to give him all the glory. Hence not many names of the wise, powerful, talented men of the earth have been enrolled on the history of the church, since they were not humble enough to submit fully into God's hands.

Yet, there are essential differences between the portraits of Solomon that are presented in the Hebrew Bible. In this volume, Isaac Kalimi explores these differences, which reflect divergent historical contexts, theological and didactic concepts, stylistic and literary techniques, and compositional methods among the biblical historians. He highlights the uniqueness of each portrayal of Solomon - his character, birth, early life, ascension, and temple-building - through a close comparison of the early and late biblical historiographies. Whereas the authors of Samuel-Kings stay closely to their sources and offer an apology for Solomon's kingship, including its more questionable aspects, the Chronicler freely rewrites his sources in order to present the life of Solomon as he wished it to be. The volume will serve scholars and students seeking to understand biblical texts within their ancient Near Eastern contexts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L9Z7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Annapurna A Womans Place","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kids Stuff Italian: Easy Italian Phrases to Teach Your Kids (Bilingual Kids)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Le Corbusier (The Masters of world architecture series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KCY0ywAACAAJ&dq=Le+Corbusier+(The+Masters+of+world+architecture+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wetware","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gender in Third World Politics (Issues in Third World Politics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principles of statistics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bigfoot Pocket Field Manual","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"George Balanchine (The Library of American Choreographers)","description":"Presents the life and accomplishments of the choreographer who made over four hundred dance works and is considered to be the most important ballet choreographer of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tiUpXxpP2jcC&dq=George+Balanchine+(The+Library+of+American+Choreographers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Healing: That Amazing Mind-Body Miracle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Duey's Tale","description":"A maple seedling becomes separated from his mother tree, makes friends with a bottle and a log, and searches for his own place in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Td1xQgAACAAJ&dq=Duey%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come Again, Pelican","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No Human Involved","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Long Ago and Far Away an Encyclopedia for Successfully Using Literature With Youth/Grade 3-6","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Essential Shih Tzu (Howell Book House's Essential)","description":"Pet owners will enjoy this attractively priced, four-color series of books that are filled with useful information in an attractive design.The Essential Guides have all of the information that the new or experienced pet owner needs for a successful relationship with his or her pet.

The Pimsleur Method We make no secret of what makes this powerful method work so well. Paul Pimsleur spent his career researching and perfecting the precise elements anyone can use to learn a language quickly and easily. Here are a few of his  secrets : The Principle of Anticipation In the nanosecond between a cue and your response, your brain has to work to come up with the right word. Having to do this boosts retention, and cements the word in your mind. Core Vocabulary Words, phrases, and sentences are selected for their usefulness in everyday conversation. We don t overwhelm you with too much, but steadily increase your ability with every lesson. Graduated Interval Recall Reminders of new words and structures come up at the exact interval for maximum retention and storage into your long-term memory. Organic Learning You work on multiple aspects of the language simultaneously. We integrate grammar, vocabulary, rhythm, melody, and intonation into every lesson, which allows you to experience the language as a living, expressive form of human culture. Learning in Context Research has shown that learning new words in context dramatically accelerates your ability to remember. Every scene in every Pimsleur lesson is set inside a conversation between two people. There are no drills, and no memorization necessary for success. Active Participation The Pimsleur Method + active learner participation = success. This method works with every language and every learner who follows it. You gain the power to recall and use what you know, and to add new words easily, exactly as you do in English. The Brazilian Portuguese Language Portuguese is the mother tongue of about 230 million people, mainly in Portugal and the Portuguese islands in the Atlantic, Brazil, and Portugal s former overseas provinces in Africa and Asia.

Babcock's Private Fire: Robert Francis's Ecopoetry and Prose presents an introduction to and analysis of nearly six decades of nature-centered literature produced by one of America's most intriguing but tragically obscure writers. Private Fire tracks the steady trajectory of Francis's life and career, situates him among more visible twentieth-century writers, and presents a broad and eclectic explication of his contribution to American environmental literature. Specifically, readers will investigate the influence Dickinson and Frost exerted on Francis, Francis's traditional and experimental poetry, his satirical essays, his novel and wilderness sketches, and his published and unpublished ruminations on spirituality, homoerotics, vegetarianism, and pacifism during World War II and Vietnam. Major themes include poetry and political dissidence, aesthetics and poverty, sexuality and nature, environmental preservation, literature and over-mechanization, and conservation in the age of industry and information.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B90OvXveZFYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Field Study: Stories","description":"Winner of the 2020 James Laughlin Award from the Academy of American Poets \\"Layered, complex, and infinitely compelling, Chet la Sebree s Field Study is a daring exploration of the self and our interactions with others a meditation on desire, race, loss and survival.\\" --Natasha Trethewey, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Memorial Drive Chet la Sebree s Field Study is a genre-bending exploration of black womanhood and desire, written as a lyrical, surprisingly humorous, and startlingly vulnerable prose poem I am society s eraser shards bits used to fix other people s sh*t, then discarded. Somehow still a wet nurse, from actual babes to Alabama special elections. Seeking to understand the fallout of her relationship with a white man, the poet Chet la Sebree attempts a field study of herself. Scientifically, field studies are objective collections of raw data, devoid of emotion. But during the course of a stunning lyric poem, Sebree s control over her own field study unravels as she attempts to understand the depth of her feelings in response to the data of her life. The result is a singular and provocative piece of writing, one that is formally inventive, playfully candid, and soul-piercingly sharp. Interspersing her reflections with Tweets, quips from TV characters, and excerpts from the Black thinkers Audre Lorde, Maya Angelou, Tressie McMillan Cottom that inspire her, Sebree analyzes herself through the lens of a society that seems uneasy, at best, with her very presence. She grapples with her attraction to, and rejection of, whiteness and white men; probes the malicious manifestation of colorism and misogynoir throughout American history and media; and struggles with, judges, and forgives herself when she has more questions than answers.  Even as I accrue these notes,  Sebree writes,  I m still not sure I ve found the pulse.  A poem of love, heartbreak, womanhood, art, sex, Blackness, and America sometimes all at once Field Study throbs with feeling, searing and tender. With uncommon sensitivity and precise storytelling, Sebree makes meaning out of messiness and malaise, breathing life into a scientific study like no other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q1b2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fires of Nuala","description":"From the acclaimed author of Fire Sanctuary comes a fascinating novel of life on the poisoned planet of Nuala and its inhabitants' unique battle for survival.

Integrating everyday materials into dynamic, complex installations, Sze's work inhabits the boundary between art and daily life while eloquently finessing the lines between painting, sculpture, and architecture. Whether clustered on ledges, tucked in corners, or stretched across museums, Sze's sculptures transform the locations they conquer and disorient one's sense of time and place, shifting in scale from the humble to the monumental, the manufactured to the natural, and the mundane to the extraordinary. Often structural marvels appearing to teeter on the brink of collapse, the gravity-defying constructions struggle to soar beyond the boundaries of the spaces that contain them. Sze's iconic compositions have been commissioned for numerous solo and group exhibitions around the world. Sarah Sze is the first monograph to span the course of Sze's prolific career and include sculptures, site-specific installations, and works on paper. Art critic Arthur Danto's introductory essay discusses the nature of Sze's originality and its connections with poetry and meaning. In her essay, writer and curator Linda Norden addresses the underlying tension in Sze's work between its individual elements and its larger forms, and examines the question of how matter takes on value, both temporally and spatially.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w6RQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sarah+Sze&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Hamster (Essential (Howell))","description":"Offers information on how to choose a hamster, provide good nutrition, housing, and how to have fun with a hamster","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gLuZIXeGSjwC&dq=The+Essential+Hamster+(Essential+(Howell))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Structure of Social Theory","description":"This book integrates new and emerging aspects of sociological theory into a detailed treatment of theories and theorists, providing students with a framework for organizing the many types of sociological theory.

Determining that by age ten children s minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime inducted nearly all German juveniles between the ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization. The result was a potent tool for bending young minds and hearts to the will of Adolf Hitler. Baldur von Schirach headed a strict chain of command whose goal was to shift the adolescents  sense of obedience from home and school to the racially defined Volk and the Third Reich. Luring boys and girls into Hitler Youth ranks by offering them status, uniforms, and weekend hikes, the Nazis turned campgrounds into premilitary training sites, air guns into machine guns, sing-alongs into marching drills, instruction into indoctrination, and children into Nazis. A few resisted for personal or political reasons, but the overwhelming majority enlisted. Drawing on original reports, letters, diaries, and memoirs, Michael H. Kater traces the history of the Hitler Youth, examining the means, degree, and impact of conversion, and the subsequent fate of young recruits. Millions of Hitler Youth joined the armed forces; thousands gleefully participated in the subjugation of foreign peoples and the obliteration of  racial aliens.  Although young, they committed crimes against humanity for which they cannot escape judgment. Their story stands as a harsh reminder of the moral bankruptcy of regimes that make children complicit in crimes of the state.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IlIOP1O7H4wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Very funny, Charlie Brown","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BN8MwQEACAAJ&dq=Very+funny,+Charlie+Brown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow Man (Dangercom)","description":"A young Boston family is torn apart into parallel dimensions in this dark urban fantasy by the authors of The Map of Moments.

So begins Daniel Friedman's provocative discussion of American Judaism. Friedman, a rabbi for almost forty years, has counseled thousands of Jews on the meaning of being Jewish. From this wealth of experience he has created this fascinating series of fictional conversations, each of them a distillation of many actual conversations.Should Jews marry outside the faith, and if so, what are the likely consequences? How should Jews cope with anti-Semitism, or evaluate their tense historical relationship with Christianity? Can one be Jewish without being religious; without belief in God; indeed, without Judaism? Are all values relative if one does not believe in God?In contemporary society these timely questions are of great importance to both practicing and nonpracticing Jews. Each of the fictional conversations thoroughly explores these issues with sensitivity and offers much valuable advice culled from Rabbi Friedman's many years of thinking about what it means to be Jewish in a secular age.Daniel Friedman (Lincolnshire, IL) has served since 1965 as the rabbi of Congregation Beth Or, a humanistic temple in Deerfield, IL. One of the founders of the Society for Humanistic Judaism, he serves on the editorial board and is a regular contributor to the journal Humanistic Judaism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LTHCjRHv1aYC&dq=Jews+Without+Judaism:+Conversations+With+an+Unconventional+Rabbi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baker's Dozen: 13 Short Fantasy Novels","description":"Tells the stories of a vampire, buried treasure, Zulu magic, a war between clans, a terrible curse, an alternate world, a quest for knowledge, and a brave knight","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2vSAAAACAAJ&dq=Baker%27s+Dozen:+13+Short+Fantasy+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Green Bay Tree","description":"The book deals with the adventures and misadventures of two daughters of a Midwestern steel baron.

Greenwood's shimmering, haunting novel that explores the nature of memory, aging, feminism, lust, and most importantly, love in a tumultuous era. In this deeply tender novel, acclaimed novelist T. Greenwood moves deftly between the past and present to create a poignant and wonderfully moving story of friendship, the resonance of memories, and the love that keeps us afloat. In 1960, Billie Valentine is a young housewife living in a sleepy Massachusetts suburb, treading water in a dull marriage and caring for two adopted daughters. Summers spent with the girls at their lakeside camp in Vermont are her one escape--from her husband's demands, from days consumed by household drudgery, and from the nagging suspicion that life was supposed to hold something different. Then a new family moves in across the street. Ted and Eva Wilson have three children and a fourth on the way, and their arrival reignites long-buried feelings in Billie. The relationship that deepens between the two women offers a solace Billie has never known, until their secret is revealed and both families are wrenched apart in the tragic aftermath. Fifty years later, Ted and Eva's son, Johnny, contacts an elderly but still spry Billie, entreating her to return east to meet with him. Once there, Billie finally learns the surprising truth about what was lost, and what still remains, of those joyful, momentous summers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ykBLEAAAQBAJ&dq=Bodies+of+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Land That Could Be: Environmentalism and Democracy in the Twenty-First Century (Urban and Industrial Environments)","description":"Environmentalist and lawyer William Shutkin describes a new kind of environmental and social activism spreading across the nation, one that joins the pursuit of environmental quality with that of civic health and sustainable local economies. In this book, environmentalist and lawyer William Shutkin describes a new kind of environmental and social activism spreading across the nation, one that joins the pursuit of environmental quality with that of civic health and sustainable local economies. In the face of challenges posed by often corrosive market forces and widespread social disaffection, this civic environmentalism is creating nothing less than a new public discourse and dynamic social vision grounded in environmental action. Shutkin points the way to vibrant, sustainable communities through four inspiring examples of civic environmentalism in action: the redevelopment of contaminated urban land for agriculture in inner-city Boston, mass-transit-based development and waterfront restoration in Oakland, protection of open space and conservation-based development in rural Colorado, and smart-growth and sustainability strategies in suburban New Jersey. The book's underlying message is that the nation's environmental health is a critical factor in its success as a vital democracy. Social health, democratic community, and environmentalism, Shutkin shows, are one. From the author's preface :\\"This book asserts that environmentalism is as much about protecting ordinary places as it is about preserving wilderness areas; as much about promoting civic engagement as it is about pursuing environmental litigation; and as much about implementing sound economic development strategies as it is about negotiating global climate change treaties. Ultimately, I believe, environmentalism is nothing less than about our conception of ourselves as a social and political community--what the bald eagle, our national symbol, really means.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=goJxngEACAAJ&dq=The+Land+That+Could+Be:+Environmentalism+and+Democracy+in+the+Twenty-First+Century+(Urban+and+Industrial+Environments)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oedipus the king","description":"Each volume in a collection of affordable, readable editions of some of the world's greatest works of literature features a chronology of the author's life and career, a concise introduction containing valuable background information, a timeline of significant events, an outline of key plot points and themes, detailed explanatory notes, critical analyses, discussion questions, and a list of recommended books and films.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jn1bNT1eRbMC&dq=Oedipus+the+king&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buccaneers","description":"Set in the 1870s, the same period as Wharton's The Age of Innocence, The Buccaneers is about five wealthy American girls denied entry into New York Society because their parents' money is too new.

The transfer function of a linear time invariant system is a function of the complex vari able s or z and it is analytic in a large part of the complex plane. Many important prop erties of the system for which it is a transfer function are related to its analytic prop erties. On the other hand, engineers often encounter small and large matrices which describe (linear) maps between physically important quantities. In both cases similar mathematical and computational problems occur: operators, be they transfer functions or matrices, have to be simplified, approximated, decomposed and realized. Each field has developed theory and techniques to solve the main common problems encountered. Yet, there is a large, mysterious gap between complex function theory and numerical linear algebra. For example, complex function theory has solved the problem to find analytic functions of minimal complexity and minimal supremum norm that approxi e. g. , as optimal mate given values at strategic points in the complex plane. They serve approximants for a desired behavior of a system to be designed. No similar approxi mation theory for matrices existed until recently, except for the case where the matrix is (very) close to singular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ymbmBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Integrating college study skills: Reasoning in reading, listening, and writing","description":"This successful text shows students how to use study strategies by integrating their reading, writing, and listening skills.

At the city's premier nightspot, the Cocoanut Grove, the largest nightclub fire in U.S. history took the lives of 492 people--nearly one of every two people on the premises. A flash of fire that started in an imitation palm tree rolled through the overcrowded club with breathtaking speed and in a mere eight minutes anyone left in the club was dead or doomed. The Grove was a classic firetrap, the product of greed and indifference on the part of the owners and the politicians who had knowingly allowed such conditions to exist. Against the backdrop of Boston politics, cronyism, and corruption, author John C. Esposito re-creates the drama of the fire and explores the public outcry that followed. In retelling the horrific events of one of America's most cataclysmic tragedies, Esposito has fashioned both an incomparably gripping narrative and a vibrant portrait of the era. But it is the intense, detailed narrative of the fire--harrowing yet compulsively readable--and the trials that followed that will stay with the reader well after they finish this remarkable book. \\"[Esposito] reminds us that the cautionary tale of the Cocoanut Grove is still relevant today.\\" (New York Law Journal)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=irOgswEACAAJ&dq=Fire+in+the+Grove:+The+Cocoanut+Grove+Tragedy+and+Its+Aftermath&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Heart 2 Heart Diary Birthday & Address Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sweet Science","description":"A.J.

Not Paul Williams. America cannot afford to ignore his terrifying contentions. Williams reminds us that we have not seen the last - or even the worst - of Osama bin Laden and his hydra-headed network of terror organizations. - Neil J. Kressel, Ph.D., author of Mass Hate: The Global Rise of Genocide and TerrorIt's important to know your enemy. And Paul Williams in this book sheds light on the evil intentions of Osama bin Laden like few others do. - Brian Kilmeade, cohost of Fox & FriendsFormer consultant for the FBI on organized crime and international terrorism and a seasoned investigative reporter, Paul Williams reveals the potential for nuclear terrorism on U.S. soil in this shocking expos . Based on the findings of U.S., Israeli, Pakistani, and U.K. intelligence, Williams describes how the theft of tactical nuclear weapons from Russian arsenals have in all likelihood made their way to al-Qaeda cells throughout the United States in preparation for the next terrorist attack.Williams presents evidence showing that, in the chaos following the demise of the Soviet Union, the Chechen mafia got their hands on portable Russian nuclear weapons. Between 1996 and 2001, they negotiated the sale of twenty nuclear suitcase bombs to representatives of Osama bin Laden. According to Williams, reliable sources indicate that these bombs may already be in the possession of al-Qaeda cells in New York, Washington, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas, Houston, and Los Angeles. In addition, bin Laden has recruited former Soviet scientists and technicians to maintain these weapons and recharge their nuclear cores so that they may be deployed immediately on his command. In 2001, he issued a statement boasting of a Hiroshima against America.Also included in the book are bin Laden's Letter to America and his Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places, as well as the World Islamic Statement declaring Jihad against Jews and Crusaders. These crucial documents highlight the rationale behind and the depth of bin Laden's hatred for the United States. Moreover, Williams documents that Osama has the international network of embedded terrorists to carry out his threats.Although the media have reported on some of these threatening developments and government insiders have acknowledged the threat of nuclear attack, no one until now has put all the pieces together in a coherent, no-nonsense way. Williams makes a persuasive case that Bin Laden and his deputies have the motive and the means and are waiting for the right opportunity to launch an apocalyptic attack against the Great Satan of America.Paul Williams, Ph.D. (Clarks Green, PA), is a journalist and author of The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia among other books. Formerly, he served as a consultant for the FBI, editor and publisher of the Metro, and an adjunct professor of Humanities at the University of Scranton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XyrakL10zlYC&dq=Osama%27s+Revenge:+THE+NEXT+9/11+:+What+the+Media+and+the+Government+Haven%27t+Told+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The effect of a rating change on commercial paper outstandings (Finance and economics discussion series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins (The Library of American Choreographers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Golden Age Flash Archives, Vol. 2 (DC Archive Editions)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Warner Bros.

Elijah's mantle was not the colorfully embroidered garments of the wealthy, much less the elegant robe of royalty, nor even the typical garment of the average man; neither was Elijah's mantle the soft clothing of false prophets, those reeds forever shaking in the capricious winds of popular doctrine. No, Elijah's mantle was the rough and rare garment of the Divinely-called prophet. Let the true sons of Elijah take heart with Elisha, for God has sovereignly chosen to leave the mantle of Elijah upon the earth, even upon the shoulders of men with like passions as Elijah, men of frailties and fear, failures and foibles, but also men of power through the amplitude of Elijah's mantle. If we would rightly claim the mantle of Elijah, we must wear it as he wore it, our ministries attesting to the same Divine power that the mantle invested upon Elijah our forerunner. So let us ask ourselves: If Elijah's mantle signifies his singular, unique, and divine authority as a God-called preacher, what is the fabric of such a mantle and of such a preacher, and, most importantly, has the mantle of Elijah fallen upon us, and are its threads woven into our ministries? If we would bear Elijah's name and wear Elijah's mantle, we must serve Elijah's God; like the rugged prophet, we must be \\"very jealous for Jehovah, the God of Israel\\"; otherwise, no matter how we may array ourselves, we cannot claim Elijah's mantle if we do not proclaim this one truth, the very essence of Elijah's name and the very fabric of his mantle-Jehovah is God. Let us not claim Elijah's mantle if we deny Elijah's God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Iy3DywEACAAJ&dq=The+Mantle+of+Elijah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beating the King's Indian and Benoni: Shock Your Opponents with the Four Pawns Attack!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eccentric preachers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AwsDAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature, man, and woman (A Mentor book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iokJzQEACAAJ&dq=Nature,+man,+and+woman+(A+Mentor+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The gospel of Buddha;: Compiled from ancient records, (Open Court Paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IFShzQEACAAJ&dq=The+gospel+of+Buddha%3B:+Compiled+from+ancient+records,+(Open+Court+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Effort: A True Story","description":"\\"One woman's courageous search for her missing husband, a true story\\"--Jacket subtitle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-1lnQgAACAAJ&dq=Every+Effort:+A+True+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Russian Theology: Bukharve, Soloviev, Bulgakov: Orthodox Theology in New Key","description":"Get the hands-on experience you need to program for the iPhone and iPod Touch.

There were painfully few safety nets in our society for young, orphaned females, Jenny married not a man of choice but for desperate need. When the alcoholic husband died in the bootleg war, leaving her with an infant son she was drawn into a private war- one of survival in a hostile world. Her son grown to manhood entered that world too. If there was one thing that both sought out of life, it was true love. Circumstances drew mother and son close together. The neighborhood would frown if they had openly showed their affection for each other. Long before Tom Brokaw, A.J. Ciulla knew that his generation was the greatest in the history of our republic. The three decades that encompass the duration of Dark Passions are those that molded the character of the nation. The book is by no means meant to glorify the past.

F. Strawson s influential  Freedom and Resentment  P. F. Strawson was one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century, and his 1962 paper  Freedom and Resentment  is one of the most influential in modern moral philosophy, prompting responses across multiple disciplines, from psychology to sociology. In Freedom, Resentment, and the Metaphysics of Morals, Pamela Hieronymi closely reexamines Strawson s paper and concludes that his argument has been underestimated and misunderstood. Line by line, Hieronymi carefully untangles the complex strands of Strawson s ideas. After elucidating his conception of moral responsibility and his division between  reactive  and  objective  responses to the actions and attitudes of others, Hieronymi turns to his central argument. Strawson argues that, because determinism is an entirely general thesis, true of everyone at all times, its truth does not undermine moral responsibility. Hieronymi finds the two common interpretations of this argument,  the simple Humean interpretation  and  the broadly Wittgensteinian interpretation,  both deficient. Drawing on Strawson s wider work in logic, philosophy of language, and metaphysics, Hieronymi concludes that his argument rests on an implicit, and previously overlooked, metaphysics of morals, one grounded in Strawson s  social naturalism.  In the final chapter, she defends this naturalistic picture against objections. Rigorous, concise, and insightful, Freedom, Resentment, and the Metaphysics of Morals sheds new light on Strawson s thinking and has profound implications for future work on free will, moral responsibility, and metaethics. The book also features the complete text of Strawson s  Freedom and Resentment.

The wives and consorts of these powerful men have generally been viewed as decorative attendants, while common women were presumed to have had no power or consequence. Reassessing the conventional definition of power that has shaped such portrayals, Women and Power in the Middle Ages reveals the varied manifestations of female power in the medieval household and community--from the cultural power wielded by the wives of Venetian patriarchs to the economic power of English peasant women and the religious power of female saints. Among the specific topics addresses are Griselda's manipulation of silence as power in Chaucer's \\"The Clerk's Tale\\"; the extensive networks of influence devised by Lady Honor Lisle; and the role of medieval women book owners as arbiters of lay piety and ambassadors of culture. In every case, the essays seek to transcend simple polarities of public and private, male and female, in order to provide a more realistic analysis of the workings of power in feudal society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A_J3qDFLwqgC&dq=Women+and+Power+in+the+Middle+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Shot in the Cathedral","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Witch And Wizard Training Guide","description":"For anyone who has ever wanted to cast a spell or make a magic potion, this guide can show them how.

Is aging inevitable? Will advances in medical knowledge allow us to extend the human lifespan beyond its present limits? Because growing old has long been the one irreducible reality of human existence, these intriguing questions arise more often in the context of science fiction than science fact. But recent discoveries in the fields of cell biology and molecular genetics are seriously challenging the assumption that human lifespans are beyond our control.; With such discoveries in mind, noted cell biologist William R. Clark clearly and skillfully describes how senescence begins at the level of individual cells and how cellular replication may be bound up with aging of the entire organism. He explores the evolutionary origin and function of aging, the cellular connections between aging and cancer, the parallels between cellular senescence and Alzheimer's disease, and the insights gained through studying human genetic disorders-such as; Werner's syndrome-that mimic the symptoms of aging. Clark also explains how reduction in caloric intake may actually help increase lifespan, and how the destructive effects of oxidative elements in the body may be limited by the consumption of antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables. In a final; chapter, Clark considers the social and economic aspects of living longer, the implications of gene therapy on senescence, and what we might learn about aging from experiments in cloning.; This is a highly readable, provocative account of some of the most far-reaching and controversial questions we are likely to ask in the next century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JImoswEACAAJ&dq=A+Means+to+an+End:+The+Biological+Basis+of+Aging+and+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Profession of Violence","description":"The classic, bestselling account of the infamous Kray twins, now a major film, LEGEND, starring Tom Hardy.

But sixty-six years later, he learns by chance that the cause was a gunshot wound. Investigating the circumstances, he soon finds himself peeling away the layers of a suppressed nightmare chapter of American history: the unspeakable brutality of the \\"Osage Reign of Terror.\\" He learns that Sybil was the victim not of random violence but of a systematic killing spree in the 1920s, carried out by white residents of Oklahoma against the oil-rich Osage Nation. White men descended upon the reservation, courting, marrying and murdering Osage women to gain control over their money. McAuliffe is forced to suspect that his own grandfather engineered Sybil's murder. The book uncovers the full extent of the crimes committed against the Osages: how white lawyers appointed by Congress to protect the Osages systematically swindled the tribe; how a ring of prominent and envious whites poisoned or shot possibly hundreds of Osages to seize their oil wealth and then papered over the Reign of Terror with doctored death certificates; and how solving the mystery of his grandmother's death led McAuliffe to confront the mysteries of his own life. Part murder mystery, part family memoir, part spiritual journey, The Deaths of Sybil Bolton reintroduces us to a people whose story has been literally torn from the volumes of our nation's history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V43RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Food Service Professional Guide to Bar & Beverage Operation: Ensuring Success & Maximum Profit (The Food Service Professional Guide to, 11) (The Food Service Professionals Guide To)","description":"This series of fifteen books - The Food Service Professional Guide TO Series from the editors of the Food Service Professional magazine are the best and most comprehensive books for serious food service operators available today.

Besides the economic wreckage left in the wake of their high-flying dreams there is also a good deal of psychological turmoil. Psychologists Mel Krantzler and his wife Pat, both counselors who have helped hundreds of managers and CEOs of high-tech companies cope with dreams turned to nightmares, expose the shadowy side of Silicon Valley in this revealing book about the personal costs of success. In addition to being a psychologist, Dr. Krantzler is also a trained economist. His economic expertise, combined with his psychology practice, enables him to uniquely illuminate Silicon Valley's culture from both perspectives. This is the first book to explode the romanticized myth of Silicon Valley, which is still so prevalent in advertising and the media.What you never hear about this Mecca of high-tech culture is that it has one of the highest divorce rates in the world, more children who are psychologically disturbed than in less-affluent areas, almost no affordable decent housing even for those earning $50,000 a year, and widespread alcohol and drug use. What the Krantzlers make clear is that aside from the simple geographical designation, Silicon Valley is the name for a psychological obsession found any place where people believe that instant fame and fortune can be gained through silicon chips and Web sites. This dream nourishes itself on an illusion of power and instant gratification. And like heroin and cocaine, it is highly addictive, promising total happiness, but often ending in disarray and despair.Based on interviews with many Silicon Valley executives who have decided to change their lives to achieve true well-being for themselves and their families, this book concludes with a formula for real success - a well-rounded, balanced, and fully human life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QD1yhXIjeWsC&dq=Down+and+Out+in+Silicon+Valley:+The+High+Cost+of+the+High+Tech+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greta Garbo, A Life Apart","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gardner's Art Through the Ages, Volume I, Chapters 1-18 (with ArtStudy Student CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","description":"Author and award-winning scholar-professor Fred Kleiner continues to set the standard for art history textbooks, combining impeccable and authoritative scholarship with an engaging approach that discusses the most significant artworks and monuments in their full historical and cultural contexts.

The book attempts to blend mathematical theory with nontrivial applications from varipus disciplines. It does not contain lengthy proofs of mathemati~al theorems as this would be inappropriate for its intended audience. Nevertheless, in each case we motivated these theorems and their practical use through examples and in some cases an \\"intuitive proof\\" is included. In view of this approach the book could be used also by aspiring mathematicians who wish to obtain an overview of the more advanced aspects of differential equations and an insight into some of its applications. We have included a wide range of topics in order to afford the instructor the flexibility in designing such a course according to the needs of the students.

But as Louise grows up to indulge in amazing food and travels to Italy herself, she arrives at a fuller and more compassionate picture of her own roots. And, in the process, she reveals that our image of the bounteous Italian American kitchen may exist in part to mask a sometimes painful history.

Topics covered include flight dynamics, equations of motion, and lateral and longitudinal aerodynamic derivatives. Basic lateral and longitudinal motions are also considered. A non-dimensional system of notation is used, and problems are included at the end of chapters. This book is comprised of 13 chapters and begins with an introduction to aircraft static stability and maneuverability, with emphasis on the theoretical basis of flight dynamics and the technical terms used. The physical background for the estimation of aerodynamic derivatives is discussed. Subsequent chapters focus on the longitudinal and lateral motion of aircraft, including the effect of automatic control; modern developments such as the effects of aeroelasticity, dynamic coupling, and high incidence; and aircraft response to gusts.

After sketching the main features of each medieval age, he deals in greater detail with the Papacy, the relations between Rome and her rival Constantinople, the bishops and archbishops, and the various religious orders, providing in all a superb history of the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FIJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Western+Society+and+the+Church+in+the+Middle+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lo-Tech Navigator","description":"The Lo-Tech Navigator explains the principles lie behind traditional navigation instruments and explores unusual and long forgotten navigation techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3R0tbLkRmMkC&dq=Lo-Tech+Navigator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Wide Margin Bible-KJV","description":"76 Bible helps Outlines Archaeological supplement 9 1/4 X 11 7/8 % Font size: 9","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G7xQAAAACAAJ&dq=Thompson+Chain+Reference+Wide+Margin+Bible-KJV&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Circumference of the Knowable World: Travel Stories (Uqp Paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Survival and Beyond : An Anthology of Stories By Victims of Crime and a Victims' Resource Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Men Beyond the Law (Camden)","description":"The entire field of film historians awaits the AFI volumes with eagerness.--Eileen Bowser, Museum of Modern Art Film Department Comments on previous volumes: The source of last resort for finding socially valuable . . . films that received such scant attention that they seem 'lost' until discovered in the AFI Catalog.--Thomas Cripps Endlessly absorbing as an excursion into cultural history and national memory.--Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e024jm9X7gQC&dq=Men+Beyond+the+Law+(Camden)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slaviane v drevnosti (Russian Edition)","description":"This companion comprises 28 essays by international scholars offering an analytical overview of the development of Russian history from the earliest Slavs through to the present day.

Beneath their surfaces, it seemed to him, waited alien and mysterious worlds. With library books as his guide, he applied himself to the task of learning to fish. His progress was slow, and for years he caught nothing. But then a series of teachers presented themselves, including an inspirational young intelligence officer, from whom he learnt stealth, deception, and the art of the dry fly. So began an enlightening but often dark-shadowed journey of discovery. It would lead to bright streams and wild country, but would end with his mentor's capture, torture, and execution by the IRA. Blood Knots is about angling, about great fish caught and lost, but it is also about friendship, honor, and coming of age. As an adult Jennings has sought out lost and secretive waterways, probing waters \\"as deep as England\\" at dead of night in search of giant pike. The quest, as always, is for more than the living quarry. For only by searching far beneath the surface, Jennings suggests in this most moving and thought-provoking of memoirs, can you connect with your own deep history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jxyzBwAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+Knot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Princess Smartypants","description":"Forced by her parents into looking for a husband, Princess Smartypants sets impossible tasks for her suitors to prove their worthiness, but when Prince Swashbuckle succeeds at every task, the Princess turns him into a frog with her kiss.

All major myths, legends and fables are here, including gods and goddesses, heroes and villains, dangerous women, legendary creatures and monsters.

The 172 illustrations give visual immediacy to the words, by showing how ancient artists perceived their gods and heroes. The impact of myths on ancient art is also explored, as is and their influence in the postclassical arts, emphasising the ongoing inspiration afforded by the ancient myths.

The episodes are balanced by her day-to-day life for the next two years with her brother, Anthony, as they approach and tackle domestic and international realities. With dry humor and a conservative outlook, these two strongly patriotic siblings create havoc in Marine Park, where they live. Each chapter (story) takes the reader briefly through the history of the episodes location and time period. At the end, they uncover and disrupt a terrorist plot. These two kids do not give a rats tail about any political correctness when it comes to protecting their own country and way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=amj6PQAACAAJ&dq=Marine+Park+Patriots:+Two+Years+in+the+Lives+of+Anthony+and+DeAnna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam Explained","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Art of the Bookplate","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cuaderno del Duero (Los libros de la candamia) (Spanish Edition)","description":"In Isis Pelagia, Laurent Bricault offers a new interpretation of many of the various sources on Isis as a goddess of the seas in the Graeco-Roman world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHu9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Cuaderno+del+Duero+(Los+libros+de+la+candamia)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rise Of Brandenburg Prussia To 1786","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beginner's Book for Older Pupils (The Oxford Piano Course for Class and Individual Instruction)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hxZfPgAACAAJ&dq=Beginner%27s+Book+for+Older+Pupils+(The+Oxford+Piano+Course+for+Class+and+Individual+Instruction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Political repression in modern America from 1870 to the present","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Female Sexual Abuse of Children","description":"This courageous and powerful book is a first step in addressing the secrecy, distress, anger, and fear surrounding female sexual abuse of children. Refuting the rationales for our lack of attention to the problem and contradicting some commonly held beliefs about sexual abuse, it combines accounts from survivors with input from professionals working with both survivors and abusers. Part I presents contributions from professionals who discuss aspects of female sexual abuse ranging from impact and treatment issues for victims of childhood sexual abuse by female perpetrators to the paradox of women who sexually abuse children. The second part is devoted to survivors--it presents stories from both men and women, then provides self-help guidelines for both. The book concludes with a valuable section on resources which includes a review of the existing literature on female child molestation as well as a listing of pertinent books and help organizations. FEMALE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN also addresses the controversial issue of current statistics that show that female sexual abuse is very rare and the question of whether it is being underreported due to fear from survivors that they will not be believed or supported. Regardless of the true magnitude of this problem, secrecy or denial about any aspect of child abuse must be avoided. Whatever future studies may show about this problem, it will not diminish this book's importance in taking the step of exploring this issue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zrhafV2NTU4C&dq=Female+Sexual+Abuse+of+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STEPPING OUT OF THE BUBBLE: Reflections on the Pilgrimage of Counseling Therapy","description":"This is a story of risk and courage taken by those who seek to better their lives.

Some observers suggest that we in fact face two crises: the crisis of scarce resources and the crisis of inadequate language in the discourse of ethics for framing a response. Laurie Zoloth offers a bold claim: to renew our chances of achieving social justice, she argues, we must turn to the Jewish tradition. That tradition envisions an ethics of conversational encounter that is deeply social and profoundly public, as well as offering resources for recovering a language of community that addresses the issues raised by the health care allocation debate. Constructing her argument around a careful analysis of selected classic and postmodern Jewish texts and a thoughtful examination of the Oregon health care reform plan, Zoloth encourages a radical rethinking of what has become familiar ground in debates on social justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OpsjDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"With the 364th infantry in America, France, and Belgium,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mini Butterflies Tattoos (Dover Tattoos)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Commercial Culture: The Media System and the Public Interest","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heros Don't Run","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Developing Self-Advocacy,Second Edition: A practical guide and workbook for preparing the high school learning disabled student for post-secondary success","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Emptiness Dancing: Selected Dharma Talks of Adyashanti","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Heart Soars (Children's Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Game Plan","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anthropological Reflections on Missiological Issues","description":"These reflections by a leading evangelical anthropologist reveal how insights from anthropology can help missionaries communicate biblical content without syncretism.

Grit Laskin is the first and only musical instrument maker to receive Canada's prestigious Saidye Bronfman Award for Excellence.

Its most prominent voice, astronomer Dr. Hugh Ross, has convinced many that here is a biblically sound way to accommodate the facts of science. With brilliant clarity, Jonathan Sarfati, author of the best-selling Refuting Evolution (1 and 2) has produced a comprehensive and ringing refutation of the position of 'progressive creationist' Hugh Ross, whose views are causing massive confusion about science and the Bible. This promises to be the most powerful biblical and scientific defense of a straightforward view of Genesis creation ever written. Ross is a skillful presenter of scientific evidences for the veracity of the Bible, yet he advocates the nontraditional views of progressive creationism, which claims such things as: Death, bloodshed, and disease existed before Adam and Eve. Noah's flood was only a local event. Man-like creatures existed before Adam and Eve, but had no spirit, and thus had no salvation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e14MAAAACAAJ&dq=Refuting+Compromise:+A+Biblical+and+Scientific+Refutation+of+%22Progressive+Creationism%22+(Billions+of+Years)+As+Popularized+by+Astronomer+Hugh+Ross&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success God's Way","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Calendar of the gods in China","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Electrical safety : safety and health for electrical trades : student manual (SuDoc HE 20.7108:EL 2/3)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VC6nXZhF92UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Time for Pilots","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7aoEAAAACAAJ&dq=No+Time+for+Pilots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wool-Gathering or How I Ended Analysis","description":"Wool-Gathering or How I Ended Analysis is a personal and humorous account of the last month of personal psychoanalysis, principally Lacanian in orientation, taking place in a frenetic and strikebound Paris.

A frightening delinquent before being sent away, his return sends Parkland residents into a religiously infused tailspin, which only increases when Stew Pot announces that he experienced a religious awakening in prison. Most neighbors are skeptical of this claim, with one notable exception: Mrs. Motley, a widowed retiree and the Reeves's next-door neighbor who loans Stew Pot a Bible, which is seen by Stew Pot and many in the community as a friendly gesture. With uncompromising fervor (and with a new pit bull named John the Baptist), Stew Pot appoints himself the moral judge of Parkland. He discovers that a woman on his block is a lesbian and outs her to the neighborhood, the first battle in an escalating war of wills with immediate neighbors: after a mild threat from the block club president, Stew Pot reveals a secret that leaves the president's marriage in ruin; after catching a woman from across the street snooping around his backyard, Stew Pot commits an act of intimidation that leads directly to her death. Stew Pot's prison mentor, an African American albino named Brother Crown, is released from prison not long after and moves in with Stew Pot and his mom. His plan is to go on a revival tour, with Stew Pot as his assistant. One night, as Stew Pot, Mrs. Reeves, and Brother Crown are witnessing around the neighborhood, a teenager from the block attempts to burn down the Reeves home. He botches the job and instead sets fire to Mrs. Motley's house. She is just barely rescued, but her house is a total loss and she moves in with a nearby family. Neighbors are sure Stew Pot is behind the fire. The retaliations against Stew Pot continue, sending him over an emotional ledge as his life spirals out of control with grave consequences. Through the unforgettable characters of Stew Pot and Mrs. Motley, the novel provides a reflection on God, the living and the dead, and the possibilities of finding love without reservation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pt_JAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The combination of stellar influences","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fathers Footsteps","description":"\\"In His Father's Footsteps is an unforgettable new novel from Danielle Steel, whose countless #1 New York Times bestsellers have made her one of America's favorite storytellers\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7eWDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fathers+Footsteps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret of Getting Straight A's: Learn More In Less Time With Little Effort","description":"This fool-proof system offers easy step-by-step guidelines for turning average students into above average performers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1htYPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+of+Getting+Straight+A%27s:+Learn+More+In+Less+Time+With+Little+Effort&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Awakening And Selected Short Fiction","description":"WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED IN 1899, THE AWAKENING WAS GREETED WITH CRIES OF OUTRAGE.

His portraits of his friends--Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Christopher Isherwood--render a romantic world of literary genius. Spender uses a poet's language to create an honest and tender exploration of amity and the many possibilities of love.

What happened to the body of Jesus? Are the writers of the Gospels reliable witnesses? The author selects some of the most prominent lawyers of modern times to sift through the evidence on the most influential figure of history. He describes the lawyers' professional backgrounds, outlines their contributions to this 2000-year-old debate and reinforces their conclusions by some careful research of his own. A compelling case is made for the familiar claim of the Apostles' Creed: 'On the third day he rose again.' While Ross Clifford believes that 'the evidence would convince a court of law, ' he argues that we can't leave the matter there. The phenomenon of the resurrection strikes at the very heart of who we are and how we view human existence. Inevitably, we find ourselves asking: What does it mean if Jesus did rise from the dead? How does it affect my understanding of life and death? Where does this understanding take me? This book is a modern classic with chapters on the writings of distinguished jurists such as Simon Greenleaf, Lord Hailsham, Norman Anderson, and John Warwick Montgomery. A significant book which every lawyer should read . . .(David Kilgour, MP and Deputy Speaker, Canadian House of Commons).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ho3psgEACAAJ&dq=Leading+Lawyer%27s+Case+for+the+Resurrection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By Recommendation Only","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ?

Infused with an operatic sense of theater and drama, his paintings conjure scenes from the cultures, history, and religions of the American West and Mexico diffused, as Pletka writes,  through the lens of personal experiences, dreams, research, and ancestral memory.  In Paul Pletka: Imagined Wests, the first book on this major American artist in over thirty years, readers will encounter the full range of Pletka s oeuvre through more than eighty color reproductions of his best-known and most influential works. Images of warriors and shamans are paired with depictions of George Armstrong Custer, Christian saints, and the lost gods of North and South America, their forms rendered in a distinctive style that mixes classical drawing and expressionist distortion with elements of surrealism and European symbolism. An artist statement and notes on selected paintings provide rare insight into Pletka s creative process, and an introductory essay by art historian Amy Scott discusses how Pletka s studies of indigenous cultures of the American West and Mexico, as well as art historical and critical influences, have informed his work. Complex, mysterious, and mesmerizing, Pletka s paintings are designed to make it almost impossible to look away. In their boldly conceived subject matter, vivid color, and ethnographic detail, these works and their creator are true originals in the rich artistic landscape of the American West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sSs0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Pletka&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maker of Universes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYNDPgAACAAJ&dq=Maker+of+Universes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Heart 2 Heart Diary: Indigo Puppy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Memory at These Speeds: New and Selected Poems","description":"A new & selected collection providing a comprehensive overview of an inventve, daring, and insightful lyric poet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0A1bAAAAMAAJ&dq=Memory+at+These+Speeds:+New+and+Selected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captain Blood: His Odyssey","description":"Young Irish physician Peter Blood is exiled as a slave to Barbados.

This illness, officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is potentially fatal and highly contagious, and has spread quickly to many parts of the world in a matter of a few weeks. Aided by globalisation and the ease of air travel today, the disease has now been reported in many countries, such as China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, the US and some parts of Europe, with a large number of infections and a significant number of deaths. In this book, the global SARS outbreak is traced and described, with a focus on the regions where the most infections have been identified. An overview of the whole saga is presented: how the disease spreads; how governments react; how societies and people cope and how health experts work fervently to identify the virus and search for a cure. In addition, the book contains guidelines on what a person or organisation can do to reduce the risk of contracting the deadly illness. It includes precautionary measures disseminated by various health authorities and preventive herbal concoctions recommended by Chinese physicians, presented in an easy-to-read manner.

On the Earth s moon, genetically engineered Lunarians carrying the DNA of Dagney Beynac a descendant of the legendary Anton Guthrie, founder of the powerful and visionary Fireball Enterprises struggle to preserve their lives, their freedom, and their satellite s resources in the face of threats posed by encroaching humans and controlling machines.

Shiatsu is the Japanese art of healing using hand pressure, which is based on the ancient Oriental medicine theory of ki, or the body's natural energy flow. Ryokyu Endo is an internationally known master of Shiatsu, and has been dubbed \\"miracle hands\\" for his healing abilities. He trained in traditional Oriental medical techniques, and went on to practice what he called \\"Tao Shiatsu,\\" a technique based on Taoist principles, which he has taught at workshops and lectures in various countries, and which he explained in Tao Shiatsu: Life Medicine for the 21st Century (Japan Publications, 1995). He has since made several startling discoveries that have led him to adapt his original technique. Shiatsu is based on the theory that there are certain points on the body that can be used for healing, called tsubo. Conventionally tsubo are in fixed positions, Endo now believes that they are constantly moving according to changes in a person's ki. He now believes that conventional shiatsu builds up resistance to treatment in the body. In The New Shiatsu Method, Endo explains the principles of ki, tsubo and meridians-the lines along which ki energy flows-providing ki meditation and breathing techniques, and explaining how to develop ki power. He also demonstrates how to visualize meridians and locate tsubo, and provides a detailed, clearly illustrated, step-by-step guide to his treatment techniques that can be practiced by the individual on him/herself or on a partner in order to heal a specific ailment or generally promote a sense of wellbeing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LbXzwAEACAAJ&dq=The+New+Shiatsu+Method:+Helping+the+Body+to+Heal+Itself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collected Poetry of Dorothy Parker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YijfsgEACAAJ&dq=The+Collected+Poetry+of+Dorothy+Parker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women in Purple: Rulers of Medieval Byzantium","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ezra Pound's Cantos: A Casebook (Casebooks in Criticism)","description":"This casebook provides a selection of key criticism, including an article newly translated into English, on the Cantos of Ezra Pound. The introduction positions the poem within Pound's corpus, contextualizes the contributions included and outlines their arguments, and concludes with suggestions for how the student may best approach this troubled and fascinating artifact. The selected articles maintain a high level of immediate contact with the Cantos, with the intention of preparing students for reading individual cantos on their own. Contributors discuss the nature of many of the successive major blocks of work, allowing the Pound newcomer to experience the poem as an irregular progression, varying greatly in its qualities. The first selection discusses \\"Canto I\\"; subsequent selections discuss, successively, major elements from \\"Canto II\\", the Draft of XXX, the China Cantos, the Pisan Cantos, and Drafts and Fragments. As a whole, the collection elucidates the personal and historical shifts that profoundly impacted Pound and consequentially produced the changing fusions of technique and matter in the Cantos. It also shows some of the huge variation in critics conceptions of the poem, or poetry itself, and of what it meant to be a poet and citizen of the West during the half-century in which the Cantos were written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LBrUTJBxXSoC&dq=Ezra+Pound%27s+Cantos:+A+Casebook+(Casebooks+in+Criticism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREAT ILLUSTRATED CLASSICS TREASURE ISLAND","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Complete Cake Decorating: Techniques, Basic Recipes and Beautiful Cake Projects for All Occasions","description":"Includes step-by-step photographic instructions for over forty cakes projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kP4EAAAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Cake+Decorating:+Techniques,+Basic+Recipes+and+Beautiful+Cake+Projects+for+All+Occasions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Calhoun","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Professional SCWCD Certification","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics, and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World","description":"This is a vital book for those who care about the environment, society and deploying new technology to check the destructive power of humankind.- Allan Thornton, President, Environmental Investigation Agency, Washington, DC., and recipient of the Albert Schweitzer MedalThis book will shake conventional environmental wisdom to its roots. ... A landmark work that should be read by environmentalists and businesspersons alike.- Patrick Moore, cofounder, Greenpeace; president, GreenspiritIn Our Molecular Future [Mulhall] neatly outlines why our increasing ability to manipulate single atoms and molecules is a concern, and lays out the opportunities and threats this technology presents. And it''s surprisingly readable, unlike most of the nanobabble in the science journals. In the end, as Mulhall admits, he poses more questions than he answers. But that''s a good place to start.-New ScientistI just finished reading Douglas Mulhall''s outstanding new book Our Molecular Future . . . and I highly recommend it. Put this one at the top of your list! . . . In an easy to read format, with very few forays into geek-speak, Mulhall presents his well considered and thoroughly researched theories. Overall, an excellent overview for those who wish to understand how disruptive and enabling technologies may save us from ourselves and from mother nature. And along the way you will learn a lot about how nanoscale technologies may enhance our lives, provide abundance for all, and greatly raise the standard of living for everyone. . . . Rating: five stars out of five.- Rocky Rawstern, Nanotech NowWhat Alvin Toffler''s Future Shock was to the 20th century, Our Molecular Future will be to the 21st century.'What will happen to our jobs, health care, and investments when the molecular revolution hits?How might artificial intelligence transform our lives?How can molecular technologies help us cope with climate changes, earthquakes, and other extreme natural threats?Our Molecular Future explores some intriguing possibilities that answer these questions and many others. Douglas Mulhall describes the exponential changes that are about to be wrought by the nanotechnology and robotic revolutions, which promise to reduce the scale of computing to the nanometer a billionth of a meter while increasing computing power to almost unimaginable levels.The resulting convergence of genetics, robotics, and artificial intelligence may give us hitherto undreamed-of capacities to transform our environment and ourselves. In the not-so-distant future, our world may include machines that scour our arteries to prevent heart disease, cars and clothes that change color at our whim, exotic products built in our own desktop factories, and enhancements to our personal financial security despite greatly accelerated obsolescence.But while technology is making these fantastic leaps, we may also encounter surprises that throw us into disarray: climate changes, earthquakes, or even a seemingly improbable asteroid collision. These extremes are not the nightmare scenarios of sensationalists, Mulhall stresses, nor are many of them human induced. Instead, they may be part of nature''s cycle recurring more often than we''ve thought possible.The good news is that this convergence of catastrophe and technological transformation may work to our advantage. If we''re smart, according to Mulhall, we can use molecular machines to protect ourselves from nature''s worst extremes, and harness their potential benefits to usher in an economic renaissance.This visionary link between future technology and past disasters is a valuable guide for every one of us who wants to be prepared for the twenty-first century.Further Praise for OUR MOLECULAR FUTURE:A provocative and profoundly convincing message from the future.- Graham Hancock, archaeological journalist and author of Fingerprints of the GodsIn a breezy, journalistic style, Our Molecular Future takes us on a tour through some of the issues that will preoccupy ma","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=us-CaDgNkRIC&dq=Our+Molecular+Future:+How+Nanotechnology,+Robotics,+Genetics,+and+Artificial+Intelligence+Will+Transform+Our+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come to the Light: An Invitation to Baptism and Confirmation","description":"Christians must pass through essential passages in their progressive understanding of the divine and this text meditates on the meaning of the elements that make up baptism and confirmation: water, fire and oil.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XfkAIOPdUT8C&dq=Come+to+the+Light:+An+Invitation+to+Baptism+and+Confirmation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call to commitment;: The story of the Church of the Saviour, Washington, D.C","description":"How unconventional methods can make Christianity a living reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9BIdAAAAMAAJ&dq=Call+to+commitment%3B:+The+story+of+the+Church+of+the+Saviour,+Washington,+D.C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Athletic Development of the Dressage Horse: Manege Patterns (Howell Reference Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Constitutional law, principles and policy: Cases and materials (Contemporary legal education series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Neither Waif Nor Stray: The Search for a Stolen Identity","description":"The author's father, Frederick George Snow (1909-1994), became a ward of the Church of England Society for Providing Homes for Waifs and Strays when he was four years old in 1913.

When speech-language pathologist Christina Hunger first came home with her puppy, Stella, it didn t take long for her to start drawing connections between her job and her new pet. During the day, she worked with toddlers with significant delays in language development and used Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices to help them communicate. At night, she wondered: If dogs can understand words we say to them, shouldn t they be able to say words to us? Can dogs use AAC to communicate with humans? Christina decided to put her theory to the test with Stella and started using a paw-sized button programmed with her voice to say the word  outside  when clicked, whenever she took Stella out of the house. A few years later, Stella now has a bank of more than thirty word buttons, and uses them daily either individually or together to create near-complete sentences. How Stella Learned to Talk is part memoir and part how-to guide. It chronicles the journey Christina and Stella have taken together, from the day they met, to the day Stella  spoke  her first word, and the other breakthroughs they ve had since. It also reveals the techniques Christina used to teach Stella, broken down into simple stages and actionable steps any dog owner can use to start communicating with their pets. Filled with conversations that Stella and Christina have had, as well as the attention to developmental detail that only a speech-language pathologist could know, How Stella Learned to Talk will be the indispensable dog book for the new decade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lsf_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"45 RPM: The History, Heroes, and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Price: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Do You Really Need Eyeglasses? -","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best of Outdoor Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Water Excercises: Workouts With the Aqua Noodle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Indian Crafts and Lore","description":"Discusses Indian life and customs, and provides instructions for doing dances and making war bonnets, headdresses, and other articles of Indian costume and adornment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nd4_swEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Indian+Crafts+and+Lore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truman Capote","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Alair Gomes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BnJUtAEACAAJ&dq=Alair+Gomes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The colossus of Maroussi,","description":"Millers great book about Greece's people and their past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=krSDPue9K3QC&dq=The+colossus+of+Maroussi,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shattered Lives: Portraits from America's Drug War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Healing the Feminine Betrayal of the Feminine","description":"Ginger and Atreyu were no strangers to pain and disappointment.

In the past five years, John Freeman, previously editor of Granta, has launched a celebrated international literary magazine, Freeman's, and compiled two acclaimed anthologies that deal with income inequality as it is experienced. In the course of this work, one major theme came up repeatedly: Climate change is making already dire inequalities much worse, devastating further the already devastated. But the problems of climate change are not restricted to those from the less developed world. Galvanized by his conversations with writers and activists around the world, Freeman engaged with some of today's most eloquent storytellers, many of whom hail from the places under the most acute stress--from the capital of Burundi to Bangkok, Thailand. The response has been extraordinary. Margaret Atwood conjures with a dys?topian future in a remarkable poem. Lauren Groff whisks us to Florida; Edwidge Danticat to Haiti; Tahmima Anam to Bangladesh; Yasmine El Rashidi to Egypt, while Eka Kurniawan brings us to Indonesia, Chinelo Okparanta to Nigeria, and Anuradha Roy to the Himalayas in the wake of floods, dam building, and drought. This is a literary all-points bulletin of fiction, essays, poems, and reportage about the most important crisis of our times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_eXvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Two+Planets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shepherd's Notes: Ephesians","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Derek Rosenfeld's Travel Companion, Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Camping Arizona","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The American seasons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yrFAswEACAAJ&dq=The+American+seasons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mi mundo (My World) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Your world.

A woman for whom commitment and causes are equally important as her next starring role, Sarandon has been passionately promoting political and social change from the start of her illustrious career. This first biography of Susan Sarandon highlights the real person behind the screen image, exploring her idealism, values, and combative spirit in the service of higher goals, while also celebrating her stunning film career.Renowned celebrity biographer Marc Shapiro traces Sarandonfs life from her strict Catholic upbringing in suburbia and her early days of protest in high school for civil rights and against the Viet Nam War to her more recent involvement with women and childrenfs rights in Nicaragua, the AIDS quilt project, ACT UP, the disruption of an Academy Awards ceremony to protest the internment of Haitians with HIV, and many other ongoing projects. Shapiro also discusses her first career successes through high-profile roles in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Pretty Baby, Atlantic City, and Thelma and Louise, as well as her openly unconventional relationships with directors Louis Malle and Franco Amuri, and actor Tim Robbins.So motivated is Sarandon by her convictions that she often chooses roles to reflect larger issues. She agreed to play in the film Dry White Season to draw attention to the evils of apartheid, and her opposition to the death penalty resulted in her Academy Award-winning performance in Dead Men Walking. Over the years she has paid a price for her activist positions, and supposedly she has accumulated a sizable FBI file. Nonetheless, she has proved time and again that she is always ready to speak out and act up whenever she believes it will do some good.No ordinary biography, Susan Sarandon is a captivating page-turner about a sexy, alluring, and passionately committed actress who has broken every conventional rule.Marc Shapiro (Pasadena, CA), the New York Times best-selling author of J. K.

This has been made possible by two main factors: America's huge economy, which has made the U.S. the largest single commercial market and the biggest investor in Latin America, and America's military prowess, which has been convincingly demonstrated in victories in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) and the Spanish-American War (1898). This volume concentrates on the history of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the nations of Latin America from the creation of the independent United States in the late eighteenth century up to the present. This is accomplished through a chronology, an introduction, a bibliography, appendixes, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on the countries involved, significant events, major crises, important figures, controversial issues, and doctrines and policies that have evolved. For scholars, historians, and students interested in the diplomacy of these two regions, the Historical Dictionary of United States-Latin American Relations is an essential reference.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPu12Sb62BEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Bee in His Bonnet","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7agNAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Still - William.

Choices in Healing offers valuable information and guidance for the whole life cycle of cancer from the initial shock of diagnosis to decisions about choosing a physician and conventional therapies, selecting complementary therapies, coping with treatment, and the art of living fully with the possibility of recurrence. There are detailed explanations and evaluations of a wide range of complementary therapy programs, including spiritual and psychological approaches, nutritional therapies, physical therapies, pharmacological therapies, and traditional medicines from around the world. There are sections on prayer and other forms of spiritual healing; psychotherapy, support groups, visual imagery and hypnosis; massage, therapeutic touch, yoga, and Qi Gong; macrobiotic diet and other cancer diets; acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicines; and numerous other unconventional therapies used by American cancer patients. With an unusual combination of compassion and objectivity, Michael Lerner describes his conclusions following more than a decade of study of unconventional cancer treatments in North America, Europe, India, and Japan.

For over a decade she has worked in the maternity ward of a hospital outside Paris. Called in by hospital staff when a baby or its parents are suffering, Szejer uses the psychoanalytic techniques of careful listening and talking to reach failure-to-thrive and other suffering newborns and reverse their conditions. Talking to Babies is the story of her important work. Having psychologists or psychiatrists available to new mothers on maternity wards is not unusual. But having a psychoanalyst available who also talks to newborns is completely revolutionary. Szejer has pioneered her unique approach to treating struggling infants through years of study and apprenticeship. And in Talking to Babies she describes in thoughtful and convincing detail the theory of her practice and how her interventions work, illustrating with the moving stories of the numerous infants she has helped. In the very first days of a baby's life, the newborn, still struggling between birth and its entry into our world, already needs words. By \\"needing words,\\" Szejer means that infants need to be talked to about the specific situations into which they are born. They need to hear about their mothers, fathers, siblings, and caretakers, but they also need to hear about problematic aspects of their histories, such as the death of a twin sibling or the death of a baby before them. These words must be spoken to the baby in the presence of his or her mother and father if at all possible. Such speech helps everyone-newborn and parents-to find their places in the altered world created by the birth. When such words are not present, physical symptoms and illness may emerge. Talking to Babies is the first book to show how the \\"talking cure\\" can help infants and their parents. Post-partum depression in mothers, failure-to-thrive in babies-these problems might be approached quite differently if maternity wards incorporated some of Szejer's practices. High-tech interventions are all too common in American maternity wards; Talking to Babies offers a more humane route for restoring health. Preface: \\"Sometimes, as I am leaving the hospital late at night, I stop to look in on a patient who has recently given birth. And often, as I open the door, I catch a special moment: the new mother leaning over the crib, or more often face to face with the newborn on her lap, looking intently at him and murmuring motherly words . . . In a maternity ward, however, everything is not always so rosy. Birth is sometimes accompanied by suffering, a suffering too rarely perceived in our Western societies . . . When I met Myriam Szejer, an unknown field opened to me: the reality of the newborn's preverbal behavior. Szejer dares psychoanalyze newborns, dares talk to them, dares intervene before the symptom has taken root, particularly in dangerous situations . . . Her approach ought to become known to all who make perinatal medicine their career. Her approach is innovative. What woman has not been shaken to her very being by becoming a mother; what man has not trembled at becoming a father? Babies feel that profound apprehensiveness. They need to be listened to, which is a form of respect.\\" --from the Preface by Ren  Frydman, M.D.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3vdB6PDhz34C&dq=Talking+to+Babies:+Psychoanalysis+on+a+Maternity+Ward&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dutch with Book(s)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reasonable Sufficiency","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Turkish History","description":"The twenty two essays collected in Turkish Language, Literature and History offer insights into Turkish culture in the widest sense.

She stares; she has violent crushes on people; and, perhaps most unsettling of all, she cannot stop telling the truth. After a traumatic experience during her teenage years, the thirty-two-year-old now craves love and companionship, but her relentless honesty makes her painfully vulnerable to those around her: Frances, her wealthy aunt and begrudging guardian; Birdy Dusser, who befriends her and then cruelly rejects her; and Colin Mackey, the seductive man who preys on her desires. Confused and bitter, distrusting even those with her best interests at heart, Martha is slowly propelled into a desperate attempt to gain control over her own life.

Between watches he kept a record of life on board, the good times and the bad, true tales of heroism, fear and all too often death. This was the war at sea as it really was. The three books were sensationally published even while the war raged about him, and make a fascinating prelude to the post-war The Cruel Sea.

A New York Times Notable Book The last time Gawain Harper saw Cumberland, Mississippi, he was heading off to fight for the newly formed Confederate States of America driven not by the cause that motivated so many others, but by love. The father of his beloved, Morgan Rhea, refused to allow her to be courted by a man who would not take up arms to defend the South. So Gawain joined the Mississippi Infantry and now, three nightmarish years later, he is coming home. But postwar Cumberland is not the place Gawain so fondly remembered. An occupying force of Union soldiers keeps uneasy watch over the townspeople, including an erstwhile slave hunter and an albino gravedigger known as Old Hundred-and-Eleven.

It begins with an investigation into the paradox of how the poet most known for his hatred of generalization and prudence could make such frequent use of proverbs, which as -the wisdom of many-, are historically closely tied to careful generalization. Arranged in two sections, the book first sets Blake's radically new visionary proverbs into a brief literary history (examining proverbs in the Bible, Bunyan, Swedenborg, and Milton). It concludes with a detailed study of the function of the proverbs in Blake's prophetic works. A central aspect of this function is ultimately shown to be the Godlike creation of Blake's Bible of Hell, a Bible which turns out to be chiefly comprised of his systematically rewritten versions of the biblical Wisdom books.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QfodAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Wisdom+of+Many,+The+Vision+of+One+(American+University+Studies+Series+IV,+English+Language+and+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vogue Knitting on the Go: Scarves Two","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chloe & Maude","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Democracy's Moment : Reforming the American Political System for the 21st Century (People, Passions, and Power)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"XXX","description":"In 1772 in Uppsala the Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele discovered the element Oxygen. Two hundred and one years later, in 1973, the International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue (ISOTT) was founded. Since then there has been an annual ISOTT meeting. After 24 years of international ISOTT meetings it was decided, at the 2005 summit in Bary, Italy, that the 2007 meeting was to be held in Uppsala, Sweden. Thus, after the Louisville meeting we, in the Uppsala group, withdrew to the Edgewater Resort at Taylorsville Lake outside Louisville and prepared the Uppsala ISOTT meeting by tasting Kentucky Bourbons, smoking cigars while bathing in a jacuzzi in the hot dark Kentucky night full of fire flies and a sky full of stars. The ISOTT program should include different aspects of oxygen - however, it is accepted that each meeting has its own local  touch . We decided to focus the Uppsala ISOTT meeting on the theme of \\"Imaging and measuring oxygen changes\\". With this in mind we invited scientists within and outside the ISOTT society. We then also received lots of good abstracts from ISOTT members that were included in the program. Lars-Olof Sundel?f introduction speech  AIR AND FIRE  concerned how oxygen was discovered in Uppsala in 1772 by Karl Wilhelm Scheele. After the introduction speech a get together event took place in the magnificent and spacious foyer of Uppsala University main building.

Filled with historical and biblical accounts of speaking in tongues, this is also the deeply personal and moving story of how you, too, can walk in the power of the Spirit day by day.

Dai Qing, an investigative journalist and author with a wide audience in China and abroad, compiled this book of essays and field reports assessing the impact of the Three Gorges megadam now under construction at Sandouping in China's Hubei province at great risk to her own freedom. This book is an effort to prevent history from repeating itself ten-fold (a reference to the great floods in 1975 during which over 60 dams collapsed and at least 100,000 people lost their lives) if the 39 billion cubic metres of water in the Three Gorges reservoir ever escapes by natural or man-made catastrophes. These comprehensive essays reveal the deep rooted problems presented by the Three Gorges project that the government is attempting to disguise or suppress. The main concerns are population resettlement and human rights, the irreversible environmental and economic impact, the loss of cultural antiquities and historical sites, military considerations, and hidden dam disasters from the past. Opponents of the dam are attempting to kill the project or at least reduce the size of the megadam now planned to be the biggest, most expensive and, incidentally, the most hazardous of all hydro-electric projects on this planet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eH6TDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Omni Magazine November 1980","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bewildered for Three Days: As to Why Daniel Boone Never Wore His Coonskin Cap","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ABC's with Ace and Christi","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-6tCHQAACAAJ&dq=ABC%27s+with+Ace+and+Christi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heirs of general practice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crucified in the Media: Finding the Real Jesus Amidst Today's Headlines","description":"Presents an evangelical perspective on the media's varied depictions of Jesus--correcting misinformation, examining the debates, and defending the historic Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w2HSJbe_Wf4C&dq=Crucified+in+the+Media:+Finding+the+Real+Jesus+Amidst+Today%27s+Headlines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archaeology of Ritual and Magic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Red Camp","description":"From barrios and labor camps spring life and inspiration. The Red Camp weaves a deeply humane and moving tapestry of coming of age and of the mundane and ugly transformed into the beauty of feminine self-discovery. Amid the poverty, exploitation and discrimination, families set down roots, send children to school and raise them to become better ?Americans,? all in the hopes of providing a better life. Evoking a location at the margins of both established society and our imagination, the Red Camp?once a labor camp, then a shanty town for migrant workers, and finally a barrio?is to Latino immigrants and laborers what New York tenements were to earlier generations. Debra Diaz has poetically recreated for us the life of one family struggling under the red roof of its shanty. The women of the Cruz family spin mesmerizing tales of hope, life, and inspiration. They describe the exquisite tension of male-female relationships, the sweet discovery of love, the high expectations and bitter disillusionment that husbands, wives, parents and children bear for each other, and the difficulties of life among a group of people caught between two cultures. In this richly textured and enchanting narrative, the voices of the Cruz family join in chorus to remember their trials and triumphs in the Red Camp. Hear the passionate music of an anniversary waltz, the haunting tale of a lost soul who murders her children and the call to a better life which in the end may not be as good as the family life shared in the Red Camp.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l-1ezz1CMlAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep Play","description":"Provides an incisive exploration of the concept of \\"deep play\\"--a psychological state of mind in which we fully engage our faculties--discussing the activities that draw us into this state, the qualities that distinguish deep-play activities, and the ways in which the state can be achieved.

S. L. Jarvis offers an innovative appraisal of the various postmodern and poststructural theories sweeping the discipline of international relations. Citing the work of Richard Ashley, Jarvis explores the lineage of postmodern theory, its importation into international relations, and its transformation from critical epistemology to subversive and deconstructive political program. Inspired by a deep-seated concern that theory in international relations is becoming increasingly abstract and unrelated to the subject matter scholars strive to understand, Jarvis argues that much postmodern and poststructuraltheory has impoverished our theoretical understanding of global political relations, embroilling us in incommensurate discourses and research agendas driven by identity politics. By developing a series of critical typologies to assess postmodern and poststructural theories, Jarvis mount a ringing defense of the discipline's exisiting research methods and epistemologies, and he suggests that more harm than good has come of the epistemological subversion occasioned by the Third Debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIxNEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Manager's Guide to Strategy","description":"Translated into 16 languages!

The drama focused on the desperate efforts of the Metropolitan Police to catch and convict a serial killer targeting women in a series of particularly gruesome attacks, while Tennison battles male colleagues who resent her taking charge of the case. Over seven series, Prime Suspect went on to tackle issues such as racism, homophobia and child abuse, establishing La Plante as a leading TV dramatist; winning multiple industry accolades for its stars and production team (including a clutch of BAFTAs and EMMYs) and gaining distribution all over the world. Deborah Jermyn's study examines exactly what made Prime Suspect so distinctive and controversial and the role it played in transforming the TV crime drama. Jermyn places the series in the context of earlier TV crime series, particularly those such as Juliet Bravo, The Gentle Touch and Cagney& Lacey that featured female detectives, and traces its influence on those such as Silent Witness and CSI that came after. Jermyn also relates the institutionalised sexism and misogyny that Tennison confronts to real-life discrimination and prejudice in British policing and its attitudes to women, whether as investigators or victims, in cases such as that of Assistant Chief Constable Alison Halford and the distinction made between prostitutes and the 'innocent' victims of the Yorkshire Ripper. Through a close analysis of key scenes, Jermyn highlights the formal and aesthetic innovations of Prime Suspect, in its attention to the detail of forensic work; its unflinching portrayal of the bodies of murder victims and its cinematic shooting style. Recognising Prime Suspect as one of the most striking, acclaimed and influential texts in British television history, Jermyn acknowledges the key roles played by the original screenwriter La Plante and by Helen Mirren as Jane Tennison.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=px9dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fallen Spaceman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heavenly way: The Union of Tao and Universe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"CLASS DISMISSED","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Help!: The Quick Guide to First Aid for Your Cat","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Long Good Night: My Father's Journey into Alzheimer's","description":"As more and more people are discovering, Alzheimer's disease is the worst kind of thief. Over time, it robs those who suffer from it of the treasure of their memories and the sharpness of their minds. In The Long Good Night Daphne Simpkins chronicles the slow, sometimes heartbreaking decline of her father from the disease, but also contradicts the prevailing opinion that caregivers can experience only suffering and chaos during this difficult season. As Simpkins writes about what she calls her father's disappearing act, she illuminates the tremendous toll that this disease takes. Alzheimer's doesn't happen to one person, she explains. It claims the community of people who love the person with the disease. The care is constant, the demands profound. But her book is far more than a recounting of the long journey into the deep night of the disease. It is a loving memoir of a good father and a good man. It is a powerful portrait of a close family whose bonds are strained but ultimately strengthened by the challenge of caring for him. And, perhaps most surprisingly, it is a remarkably uplifting account of that experience. and humor. The humor arises naturally, almost miraculously, out of the stories Simpkins tells, a series of vignettes about her family's daily life. Alzheimer's is admittedly a dark subject, but Simpkins brings as much natural light and levity to it as circumstances allow. The Long Good Night is a memoir about love rather than an elegy about a disease, Simpkins says. It will give caregivers cause for honest hope, and its many other readers a wonderfully nuanced story of love and laughter amid the ruins of illness -- a story that both illuminates the tragedy of Alzheimer's and powerfully transcends it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BQCBzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Long+Good+Night:+My+Father%27s+Journey+into+Alzheimer%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way: A Discovery of the Grail of Immortality Welsh Witchcraft and the Old Religion","description":"RHUDDLWM GAWR is the leading authority on the Welsh Traditions of the Ancient Mysteries; including Paganism, Witchcraft and Druidism.

Both through proponents such as Karl Marx and detractors such as S?ren Kierkegaard, the impact of his ideas and reaction to them continue to be felt to this day. Unfortunately, reading Hegel is a notoriously difficult task and there is a good deal of debate about how to interpret his words. In fact, his contemporary, Arthur Schopenhauer, criticized Hegel's writing as the most ponderous and general mystification that has ever existed. There is thus a need for a clear presentation of his major philosophical contributions to help students and other interested persons in approaching the work of this important thinker.Philosopher Michael Allen Fox admirably fills this need in The Accessible Hegel. He begins by examining Hegel's thought as the culmination of classical German philosophy's idealistic trend toward explaining the universe in its entirety. Unlike Kant, who believed that human reason was limited, Hegel argued that reason has the capacity to unravel the mysteries of existence. Throughout history reason has progressed, said Hegel, like an expanding circle grasping more and more of reality.Fox discusses at length the chief component of Hegel's systematic philosophy -- the concept of the dialectic. According to Hegel, in a world of becoming and persistent change, reason progresses through conflict and the resolutions that arise from the dialectic of opposing elements. The tumultuous clash of opposites leads to ever new advances in human knowledge and culture.Fox also considers many of Hegel's other ideas: his difficult notion of the Absolute, the final stage of history in which reason attains perfect mastery of the world and thought realizes its full potential; his dynamic conception of truth as evolving toward total comprehensiveness; the master-slave pattern of human relationships; the social structure of the self; the varied political interpretations and adaptations of Hegel's philosophy on both the Left and the Right; and many other aspects of Hegel's complex system.For both beginners and those already familiar with Hegel's work, this excellent overview of one of philosophy's great geniuses offers many clarifications and insights.Michael Allen Fox is professor emeritus of philosophy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and adjunct professor of humanities at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. He is the author of The Accessible Hegel, Deep Vegetarianism, and several other titles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qloQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Accessible+Hegel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Pendleton's The Executioner: Sea of Terror","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Apache 2 in 24 Hours","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"This star shall abide","description":"When he rebels against the tyranny of the ruling Scholars, Noren, a village boy, is labeled a heretic and sent to them for punishment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tyNbLxXEU1kC&dq=This+star+shall+abide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"France (Insight Guide France)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Last Two Bachelors: Falling for Him/Ending in Marriage (Midnight Sons Series 5-6)","description":"A guide to series fiction lists popular series, identifies novels by character, and offers guidance on the order in which to read unnumbered series.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tBUlCAwAtNwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Poems of Su Tung-P'o","description":"Gathers poems about travel, nature, daily life, friendship, and exile by the eleventh-century Chinese poet, who wrote under the name Su Tung-p'o.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvgQAAAAYAAJ&dq=Selected+Poems+of+Su+Tung-P%27o&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Narnia Full-Color Oversize Gift Edition Box Set: The Magician's Nephew; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Studies in the Bible and Science","description":"Evidence of an apparent conflict between religion and science is everywhere: Time Magazine features a debate between a nationally known atheist author and an imminent Christian scientist, a newspaper article condemns those who advocate intelligent design, legislatures fight over what can and cannot be taught in public schools, courts intervene in cases that involve issues of faith and science, three of ten candidates in a presidential debate say they do not believe in evolution while the other seven say they do. The controversy affects national and local policy, influences education, and, some argue, could degrade our way of life if scientific advancement or religious belief and practice are stifled. The conflict is being waged on two levels. The public level is a continuing war among relatively few activists. We see warring books and articles, contentious town meetings, lawsuits, legislative efforts, private schools, and other efforts by each side to win and make sure the other loses.The other level of the debate, like the submerged portion of an iceberg, is larger, more insidious, and ultimately more hurtful to society. This conflict is within the hearts and minds of a vast number of people who sense an  either/or  conflict between the religion they believe and the science they see, hear, and experience. This conflict has no clear battle lines and no obvious winner or loser, but a high mortality rate that includes all those people, particularly young people, who simply opt out. Some check out of religion and become  de-facto agnostics  who claim a faith when the chips are down, but don't practice it or get anything from it. Others check out of science and reason. They allow their faith and their views about the Bible to kill their intellectual curiosity, and they look scientific truth in the face but refuse to see it. For the most part, this conflict boils down to different beliefs among people of faith about scripture, evolution, and the  isms  that each has spawned. Most interpret the Bible and understand science in ways that make finding an intellectually satisfying resolution to the presumed conflict frustrating and even scary. Any attempt to reconcile the two requires learning new words that initially sound like so much gobbledygook, reading an array of books and articles that usually present only one side of a multi-faceted issue and tend to obfuscate rather than enlighten, and making judgments without all the facts. The purpose of Reconciling the Bible and Science: A Primer on the Two Books of God is to take the fog out of the controversy by telling in simple language the story of the  Book of Scripture  and the  Book of Nature.  The work is aimed primarily at Christians and seekers who don't need proof of God but do seek a better understanding of the relationship between their faith and science. It will be helpful to those who are having difficulty reconciling their faith with what they learn about science, those whose faith prevents them from fully exploring science with an open mind, those who oppose the teaching of evolution because they feel it is a threat to faith, or others who just don't know where to turn. Reconciling the Bible and Science is based on a college level course that Lynn Mitchell has taught for many years in colleges, churches, and on television. It explains that faith in God and a belief in the Bible do not preclude acceptance of science, and that the two can in fact co-exist perhaps even complement one another. It does not try to convince readers of the validity of evolution or of a particular approach to religious practice, but maintains that we all should be free to make our own judgments about faith in God without being constrained by anything science can discover, and about science unfettered by presumed constraints of the Bible.

According to Buddhist texts, the entire universe, including the individual, is made up of different phenomena, which Buddhism classifies into different categories: what we conventionally call a  person  can be understood in terms of five aggregates, the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity, since beings are nothing but an amalgam of ever-changing phenomena. Although the aggregates are only a  convenient fiction,  the Buddha nevertheless made frequent use of the aggregate scheme when asked to explain the elements at work in the individual. In this study Mathieu Boisvert presents a detailed analysis of the five aggregates (pa?cakkhandh ) and establishes how the Theravda tradition views their interaction. He clarifies the fundamentals of Buddhist psychology by providing a rigorous examination of the nature and interrelation of each of the aggregates and by establishing, for the first time, how the function of each of these aggregates chains beings to the cycle of birth, death and rebirth   the theory of dependent origination (paticcasamupp da). Boisvert contends that without a thorough understanding of the five aggregates, we cannot grasp the liberation process at work within the individual, who is, after all, simply an amalgam of the five aggregates. The Five Aggregates represents an important and original contribution to Buddhist studies and will be of great interest to all scholars and students of Buddhism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jl49DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experimental Methods: A Primer for Economists","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Russian convoys (A Ballantine War Book)","description":"Written by experts for use by nonexperts, this monumental work probes Germany's \\"Genius for War\\" and the unmistakable pattern of tactical and operational innovation and excellence evident throughout the nation's military history. ?

It preoccupied Wagner for much of his adult life and revolutionized the nature of opera, the orchestra, the demands on singers and on the audience itself. The four operas-The Rhinegold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried and Twilight of the Gods - are complete worlds, conjuring up extraordinary mythological landscapes through sound as much as staging. Wagner wrote the entire libretto before embarking on the music. Discarding the grand choruses and bravura duets central to most operas, he used the largest musical forces in the context often of only a handful of singers on stage. The words were essential: he was telling a story and making an argument in a way that required absolute attention to what was said. The libretto for The Ring lies at the heart of nineteenth century culture. It is in itself a work of power and grandeur and it had an incalculable effect on European and specifically German culture. John Deathridge's superb new translation, with notes and a fascinating introduction, is essential for anyone who wishes to get to grips with one of the great musical experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=joE5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now Choose Life: Theology and Ethics in Deuteronomy (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Strong and true (The Character Reading Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yv-rmwEACAAJ&dq=Strong+and+true+(The+Character+Reading+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: Shadow Of The Bat #86","description":"\\"Originally published in single magazine form as BATMAN: SHADOW OF THE BAT 1-12.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G9WxjgEACAAJ&dq=Batman:+Shadow+Of+The+Bat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You're On!: Seven Plays in English and Spanish (Spanish and English Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ultimate Visual Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ask Not: The Inauguration of John F.

The Second Letter to the Corinthians is an implicit yet undeniable plea that Paul addresses to the Christians of Corinth and is impressive above all for its exposition of the apostle's identity. In this letter Paul more than once fiercely counters the attacks of his opponents. He extensively describes both the quality and circumstances of his apostolic existence: the sufferings he endures, the opposition he encounters, and his continual care for the Churches. Second Corinthians is, therefore, highly significant theologically as well as autobiographically. Not an easy letter to follow, the emotional language used in 2 Corinthians, the question of the integrity of 2 Corinthians as a letter, and inadequate information about the concrete situation at Corinth and the identity of Paul's opponents make following the flow of Paul's argument difficult at times. Yet 2 Corinthians is an especially important document because of Paul's ongoing reflection on his ministry. It is both profound in its content and style for its original audience as well as for today's readers. Chapters are *Corinth and Paul's Visits, - *Paul's Corinthian Correspondence, - *Christianity in Corinth, - *The Events Between 1 and 2 Corinthians, - *Paul's Opponents, - *One Integral Letter? - *A Structured Survey of the Letter, - *The Theological Significance of the Letter. -","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJcjakrEHMwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawks in the hand;: Adventures in photography and falconry,","description":"The behavior, habitat and reproductive habits of the duck hawk, the bald eagle and the great horned owl.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OSA6AAAAMAAJ&dq=Hawks+in+the+hand%3B:+Adventures+in+photography+and+falconry,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Altman Code: A Covert-One Novel","description":"When a photographer is murdered while recording cargo being secretly loaded in Shanghai, Covert-One director Fred Klein is brought in to find the cargo ship, which is rumored to be carrying thousands of pounds of chemical weapons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JnswdZitDz0C&dq=Robert+Ludlum%27s+The+Altman+Code:+A+Covert-One+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen Elizabeth II: A Celebration of Her Majesty's Fifty-Year Reign","description":"For more than fifty years, Queen Elizabeth has tirelessly greeted the Canadian public and welcomed the floral bouquets, mementos, and tributes that have been presented to her.

The main house where she and her husband live was built directly on a path which the elephants have used for hundreds of years to get to the water. The elephants want their walk back! She learns another disturbing fact. Her new husband, played by Peter Finch, is completely dominated by the memory of his late father, who built the house and the tea plantation. Everything must be done because that is the way his father did it. Soon, a love triangle develops when her husband's overseer, played by Dana Andrews, makes a play for her. At first Taylor resists, but not very hard. She soon asks him to take her to Paris. They try to escape from the plantation, but are stopped because the plantation has been placed under quarantine. A cholera epidemic has broken out on the plantation. Nobody is allowed to leave, for fear of spreading the disease. One by one, her husband's faithful servants start dying. Others escape over the wall or through the jungle. Soon, almost no one is left on the plantation except for Taylor, the husband, the overseer and the late father's faithful servant, Appuhamy (which means \\"cooking man\\" in Sri Lankan). By this time, there is an affair going on between the overseer and Taylor. The husband knows about it. \\"The quarantine is almost over. Then, you both can leave,\\" he wryly remarks. The elephants see their chance. Because of the cholera epidemic, all the servants and plantation workers who used to defend the house from the elephants are now gone. The elephants are wild with thrust because of a drought. Over a hundred elephants attack the house, knock down the walls, start a fire and bulldoze the house, all this with Elizabeth Taylor inside.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZ_drQEACAAJ&dq=Elephant+walk,+a+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No-Limit Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PPK4AAAACAAJ&dq=No-Limit+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lawyerland: What Lawyers Talk About When They Talk About Law","description":"In Lawyerland, Lawrence Joseph brings an unerring ear for dialogue, a cunning artistry, and a prosecutor's radar for loaded testimony to a series of rangy, irreverent conversations with downtown lawyers, making his book a uniquely fresh and insightful accomplishment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t-sVva890KQC&dq=Lawyerland:+What+Lawyers+Talk+About+When+They+Talk+About+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foreign Affair.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Applied Mathematics","description":"This is the most authoritative and accessible single-volume reference book on applied mathematics.

With new reflections on the future of Judaism and Israel, Ellis underscores the enduring problem of justice. The use of liberation theology to make connections between the Holocaust and contemporary communities from the Third World reminds both Jews and oppressed Christians that they share a common ground in the experiences of abandonment, suffering, and death. The connections also reveal that Jews and Christians share a common cause in the battle against idolatry -- represented now by obsessions for personal affluence, national security, and ethnic survival. According to Ellis, Jews and Christians must never allow the reality of anti-Semitism to become an excuse to evade solidarity with the oppressed peoples -- be they African, Asian, Latin American or, especially Palestinian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QwYFUqZNcdcC&dq=Toward+a+Jewish+Theology+of+Liberation:+The+Challenge+of+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I, Sherlock Holmes: Memoirs of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, OM, late consulting private detective-in-ordinary to their majesties Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and King George V","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A history of comparative anatomy,: From Aristotle to the eighteenth century,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B-BFAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+history+of+comparative+anatomy,:+From+Aristotle+to+the+eighteenth+century,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leave No Child Behind: Preparing Today's Youth for Tomorrow's World","description":"The founder of the School Development Program at the Yale Child Study Center argues for a change of focus in educational reform programs away from an emphasis on test scores to an approach stressing community involvement, emotional growth, social skills,e","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hb2VAQAACAAJ&dq=Leave+No+Child+Behind:+Preparing+Today%27s+Youth+for+Tomorrow%27s+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Polygamist","description":"\\"The Polygamist weaves a tale of four women whose lives become intertwine when they all fall for wealthy banking magnate Jonasi.

Born and raised in a small Oregon town, all-American girl Rebecca Bender was a varsity athlete and honor roll student with a promising future. Then a predator pretending to be her boyfriend lured her into a web of lies that sent her down a path she never imagined possible. For nearly six years, Rebecca was sold across the underground world of sex trafficking in Las Vegas. She was branded, beaten, told when to sleep and what to wear, and traded between traffickers. Forced into a dark sisterhood, Rebecca formed bonds with her trafficker and three other women, creating a false sense of family. During that time, God began revealing himself to her. And in the midst of her exploitation, she found the hope she needed to survive. After a federal raid, Rebecca escaped. Her life was forever changed as she felt the embrace of her heavenly Father guiding her to healing and wholeness. Rebecca soon began to use her own experiences to change the lives of others as she went back into the darkest places she had known--assisting FBI, VICE, and law enforcement across the country in some of their most difficult cases. Through Rebecca's incredible story of redemption, we remember that our past does not have to determine our destiny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=41ieDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Is Boasting: Early Jewish Soteriology and Paul's Response in Romans 1-5","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When the Gangs Came to London","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JZUIAQAAIAAJ&dq=When+the+Gangs+Came+to+London&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Way There, a Wonder Tale for Boys and Girls, Both Little and \\"Grown Tall","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

David Wenham has written convincingly against this view, and in this new book he introduces readers to the \\"true\\" Paul. Rooted in a thorough knowledge of the New Testament, this book fulfills two important purposes. First, it provides a superb introduction to Paul himself. Wenham describes Paul's early life, shows the importance of his conversion, and follows him on his missionary journeys. Second, the book explores Paul's relation to Jesus. Writing in dialogue with those who wish to distance Paul from Jesus, Wenham shows just how important the ministry and teaching of Jesus were to Paul's own thought and evangelism. What emerges from a study of Paul's epistles is a man who drew extensively on the traditions of Jesus and faithfully worked to spread his message to the rest of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWAKtZd-cCMC&dq=Paul+and+Jesus:+The+True+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Reliability (ASA-SIAM Series on Statistics and Applied Probability)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Creative Interiors: A Complete Practical Course in Interior Design","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Danish Made Nice & Easy (Languages Made Nice & Easy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QJOP5tVzjOMC&dq=Danish+Made+Nice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sunday Vigil Followed by the Rangueil Mass","description":"Chanting the psalms, or psalmody, is an ancient practice of vital importance in the Christian spiritual tradition. Today many think of it as a discipline that belongs only in monasteries but psalmody is a spiritual treasure that is available to anyone who prays. You don t need to be musical or a monk to do it, and it can be enjoyed in church liturgical worship, in groups, or even individually as part of a personal rule of prayer. Cynthia Bourgeault brings the practice into the twenty-first century, providing a history of Christian psalmody as well as an appreciation of its place in contemplative practice today. And she teaches you how to do it as you chant along with her on the accompanying CD in which she demonstrates the basic techniques and easy melodies that anyone can learn.  Even if you can t read music,  Cynthia says,  or if somewhere along the way you ve absorbed the message that your voice is no good or you can t sing on pitch, I ll still hope to show you that chanting the psalms is accessible to nearly everyone.

It ultimately brought about the end of the Norman dynasty and the birth of the mighty Plantagenet kings. When Henry I died having lost his only legitimate son in a shipwreck, he had caused all of his barons to swear to recognize his daughter Matilda, widow of the Holy Roman Emperor, as his heir and remarried her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. When she was slow to move to England on her father's death, Henry's favourite nephew Stephen of Blois rushed to have himself crowned, much as Henry himself had done on the death of his brother William Rufus. Supported by his brother Henry, Bishop of Winchester, Stephen made a promising start, but Matilda would not give up her birthright and tried to hold the English barons to their oaths. The result was more than a decade of civil war that saw England split apart. Empress Matilda is often remembered as aloof and high-handed, Stephen as ineffective and indecisive. By following both sides of the dispute and seeking to understand their actions and motivations, Matthew Lewis aims to reach a more rounded understanding of this crucial period of English history and asks to what extent there really was anarchy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xZbqxgEACAAJ&dq=The+anarchy+of+Stephen+and+Matilda&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going barefoot","description":"Americans are chronic shoe-wearers. We buy shoes for infants who can t yet walk. We wear shoes almost constantly, certainly in public spaces, and often within the comfortable walls of our own homes. If we d like, we can purchase shoes for just about any occasion or purpose imaginable, in a vast array of styles, colors, materials, and prices. Well, of course. We need shoes. We need them for warmth and for protection. We wear shoes to be fashionable and because it s expected. It s just what we do. And what s wrong with that? The Barefoot Book explores this question and provides a surprising answer. What s wrong is that chronic shoe wearing is negatively affecting our health and especially the health of our feet. Most of us have experienced pain and blisters caused by wearing an ill-fitting shoe. In some cases, it s only a matter of minutes before we realize the damage our shoes are causing to our feet. The long-term consequences of chronic shoe wearing are more difficult to connect but are abundant nonetheless. According to author L. Daniel Howell, the warm, moist environment of a shoe-clad foot makes a perfect condition for fungus and bacteria to grow. Poorly fitting shoes cause or exacerbate a host of foot issues from hammer-toes, bunions, and ingrown toenails to fallen arches and Hallux valgus. And high heeled shoes are the worst culprits of all with chronic use damaging the knees, spine, and posture. In fact, continuous wearing of shoes  any shoes  is a problem. Howell explains how shoes redistribute weight, alter joints, weaken foot muscles, decrease foot flexibility, and eliminate sensory feedback from the sole and shock absorption of the arch. This leaves feet weak, fragile, and even more dependent on shoes. Although shoes are meant to protect our feet, they can sometimes cause more problems than they prevent. This is especially true for women, who tend to wear the most unnatural types of shoes, such as high heels. In fact, high heels are likely to blame for the fact that women outnumber men in rates of foot problems by four to one. If shoes are causing such problems, the solution is obvious: take them off. (Or at least, take them off more often.) Ease out of shoes while sitting at the desk at work. Take the dog on a barefoot walk. Declare the house a barefoot-only zone. Spend an entire weekend without shoes. If we dare, commit to a fully barefoot lifestyle. Simply let our feet breathe. A startling idea at first glance, the barefoot lifestyle is one that increasingly makes sense in the context of foot health and culture. Americans might love their shoes, but the citizens of many other countries successfully and comfortably go barefoot. In fact, significant differences arise between the typical American foot, which is constantly shod, and that of the typical barefooter. Hint: barefooters are the ones reaping the benefits. In The Barefoot Book, Howell describes the best and healthiest kinds of shoes to wear for the times we must wear shoes. For the rest of the time, he suggests we go barefoot, and gives tips for getting started on a more barefoot lifestyle. He suggests ways to ease into going barefoot more often, defines the best conditions and situations for going barefoot, identifies the risks, and provides ways to explain to people why you re going barefoot  particularly if you venture into public areas where shoes are expected. To help readers on the journey to a more barefoot lifestyle, Howell dispels some of the myths about going barefoot. Thus, readers can rest assured that the health department does not require shoes in public places, it s not illegal to drive barefoot, and in most circumstances, going barefoot is not dangerous. Howell admits it isn t practical for all of us to embrace a barefoot lifestyle all of the time; that isn t the goal of The Barefoot Book. What he would like to see is more people going barefoot in more places, more often. He d like us to experience healthier feet and fewer trips to the podiatrist s office, to develop feet that are strong, flexible, and comfortable. After learning about the dangers of chronic shoe wearing and the health benefits of going barefoot (or after a long day in uncomfortable shoes), readers will likely agree.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6RCmH7e_BgC&dq=Going+barefoot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Kyoto: The Updated Guide to Traditional Shops, Restaurants, and Inns","description":"Down the cobbled paths and behind the tranquil noren curtains of Kyoto, the old way of life goes on, nurtured in the restrained furnishings of the traditional inns and in the old shops where fine handmade items still add a touch of quality to life.

Bill Gates, GatesNotes After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset those who believe that abilities are fixed are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations.

This commentary argues that Paul's doctrine of justification by faith is essentially social in nature and has important ecumenical implications for the Church today. In its original setting, Galatians established a foundation for the unity of Jewish and Gentile Christians: all are justified by the faith of Jesus Christ. In addition to illuminating the historical situation that led Paul to write his Letter to the Galatians, this commentary pays careful attention to the rhetorical structure of this letter and its theological message. The author provides a fresh translation of Galatians, critical notes on each verse of the text, and a careful commentary of the letter in light of Paul's theology. Theories abound on the question of Galatians, why it was written, what it says, and what the implications of that message are. Yet few scholars have devoted themselves at length to this letter. What sets this work apart is the extent and detail of its scholarship. Includes an updated bibliography as an appendix.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r3W7DwAAQBAJ&dq=Galatians+(Sacra+Pagina+Series)volume+9&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Busman's Honeymoon","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No Night Without Stars","description":"In a world nearly destroyed by a cataclysmic natural disaster, a young metalsmith leaves his own people to seek out some of the ancient skills and knowledge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6VTWAAAAMAAJ&dq=No+Night+Without+Stars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dove Legend","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Way of Salvation","description":"Psalm 119:105 (p. 1-16) ; Psalm 43:3, Psalm 36:9 (p. 17-32) ; 1 Peter 3:15 (p. 33-44) ; John 6:68 (p. 45-57) ; Psalm 8:3, 4 (p. 58-71) ; Acts 17:26, 27 (p. 72-84) ; Galatians 6:7,8 (p. 85-95) ; Matthew 25:26, 27 (p. 96-107) ; Matthew 18:11 (p. 108-121) ; Acts 16:30 (p. 122-134) ; Psalm 51:4 (p. 135-148) ; Mark 10:22, 23, Matthew 8:21, 22, Luke 9:61, 62 (p. 149-162) ; Proverbs 18:14 (p. 163-176) ; Jeremiah 6:14, Luke 7:48-50 (p. 177-190) ; Psalm 103:8 (p. 191-205) ; 1 John 1:7 (p. 206-218) ; Colossians 1:20 (p. 219-232) ; John 3:3 (p. 233-245) ; 2 Corinthans 5:17 (p. 246-258) ; Titus 3:5 (p. 259-272) ; Acts 20:21 (p. 273-285) ; Acts 3:19 (p. 286-297) ; 2 Corinthians 7:9-11 (p. 323-336) ; Mark 16:16 (p. 337-348) -- Hebrews 11:6 (p. 349-361) ; 2 Corinthians 5:7 (p. 362-373) ; Job 25:4 (p. 374-385) ; Romans 3:20 (p. 386-396, 397-408) ; Job 35:5-8 (p. 409-421) ; John 1:16 (p. 422-433) ; Romans 3:24 (p. 434-446) ; Romans 1:16, 17 (p. 447-460) ; Romans 1:17 (p. 461-474).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bdcTAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commodore (Highbridge Distribution)","description":"Timeless wisdom on controlling anger in personal life and politics from the Roman Stoic philosopher and statesman Seneca In his essay  On Anger  (De Ira), the Roman Stoic thinker Seneca (c. 4 BC65 AD) argues that anger is the most destructive passion:  No plague has cost the human race more dear.  This was proved by his own life, which he barely preserved under one wrathful emperor, Caligula, and lost under a second, Nero. This splendid new translation of essential selections from  On Anger,  presented with an enlightening introduction and the original Latin on facing pages, offers readers a timeless guide to avoiding and managing anger. It vividly illustrates why the emotion is so dangerous and why controlling it would bring vast benefits to individuals and society. Drawing on his great arsenal of rhetoric, including historical examples (especially from Caligula s horrific reign), anecdotes, quips, and soaring flights of eloquence, Seneca builds his case against anger with mounting intensity. Like a fire-and-brimstone preacher, he paints a grim picture of the moral perils to which anger exposes us, tracing nearly all the world s evils to this one toxic source. But he then uplifts us with a beatific vision of the alternate path, a path of forgiveness and compassion that resonates with Christian and Buddhist ethics. Seneca s thoughts on anger have never been more relevant than today, when uncivil discourse has increasingly infected public debate. Whether seeking personal growth or political renewal, readers will find, in Seneca s wisdom, a valuable antidote to the ills of an angry age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XJ5-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Commodore+(Highbridge+Distribution)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bear Memories: The Chicago-Green Bay Rivalry (IL) (Images of Sports)","description":"\\"Halas would provide food according to how we had fared against the Packers.

From the Latin words venio, meaning \\"come,\\" and ad, meaning \\"to,\\" Advent means \\"coming to.\\" The curious energy of Advent is the waiting for something that has already happened, the looking for something that is already here. It is both right now and not yet. Christians sing \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel,\\" yet Emmanuel means \\"God is with us.\\" Author Pat Livingston believes the best preparation for this celebration of the coming of our Lord at Christmas is to deepen awareness of God's presence every day, to pause in the \\"right now\\" so we can see evidence of what is already here and what is yet to come. The passages found in \\"Daybreaks\\" act as doorways to the Emmanuel reality and help readers notice doors opening of their own. Everyday occurrences are transformed into moments of prayer and meditation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nJjMQgAACAAJ&dq=Let+in+the+Light:+Facing+the+Hard+Stuff+with+Hope&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feud at Single Shot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FJt3mgEACAAJ&dq=The+Feud+at+Single+Shot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sing Me Home","description":"","infoLink":""}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],E={key:0},I={key:1};function H(s,i,t,u,r,n){const p=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",P,[(e(!0),o(m,null,y(n.visibleBooks,(l,g)=>(e(),b(p,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,M)):c("",!0)])}const q=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-dbd3f274"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/60.md","filePath":"glossary/60.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/60.md"},D=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(q)]))}});export{x as __pageData,D as default};
