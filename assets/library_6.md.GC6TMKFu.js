Jamal, a pre-tween asks his grandmother if she has ever been a child. She tells him that indeed, she was a child once and, at one time was even a baby on the way!Curious, Jamal asks her to tell more. His grandmother describes her own mother's pregnancy and her place in the family. His grandmother is the youngest of 10 children and she describes the joyous fanfare in preparation of her birth. Beautiful pictures illustrate the story; the characters' faces are delightfully expressive. Jamal's grandmother describes events from her early girlhood and tells Jamal that one day, he may have a child or grandchild who will ask him if he was ever the baby on the way.A loving story about the connection of family and traditions that will find a permanent place in the hearts of readers."},{"Title":"The Baby on the Way","review":"Good picture books featuring African-American characters (particularly contemporary ones) are few and far between. They appear in spurts and splutters in the marketplace and unless they garner a prestigious award of some sort they sink back down into obscurity despite their own brilliance. When I consider the sheer swath of mediocre picture books featuring white children that take attention away from the really wonderful picture books featuring black children... it's enough to make a children's librarian physically ill. Now I'm a big Karen English fan. I consider her book, \\"Speak To Me (And I Will Listen Between the Lines)\\" to be perhaps the best little-read children's picture book available on the market today. My admiration was due in part to her own brilliant writing, and in part the illustrations of the accomplished Amy Bates. Now English has written another moving title that jumps with aplomb between the past and the present. She has also, however, been paired with illustrator Sean Qualls and the result is less brilliant than it might have been. A great book that fills a definite need, I regret that I can't recommend it as heartily as \\"Speak to Me\\" due to my own personal problems with its accompanying pictures.While gardening on their apartment building's rooftop garden, a question occurs to Jamal that had never quite come to him before. Was his grandmother ever a little girl? Ever a baby? To his evident surprise his grandma says that she was most definitely a baby once. Heck, she was once the baby on the way. With that Jamal begins to hear the story of how his grandmother was born. She was the tenth child her mother birthed and was born on a large family farm. A midwife had to be sent for and her father even left his plowing in the field to attend to the birth. When at last she was born, Jamal's grandma was the baby of the family. \\"You know, my feet hardly touched the ground my whole first two years. I was carried everywhere. Just passed around from person to person\\". And when Jamal has heard the story and the only sound left is the wail of a siren somewhere, he wonders if someone will ever ask HIM if he was once the baby on the way. Grandma says she hopes someone will and then proceeds to tell him the story of his own birth as well.In many ways, \\"The Baby On the Way\\" reminded me of another rural African-American midwifery title, \\"Missy Violet and Me\\" by Barbara Hathaway. Obviously \\"Missy Violet\\" is a book intended for older children, but the two work together especially well. In her New York Times Review, Jenny Allen noted that perhaps when Jamal's grandma says, \\"should you live so long\\" when he asks if anyone will ever wonder if he was a baby, she may be referring to \\"the violence that snatches the lives of so many African-American men\\". Whether or not this was English's intent, it does add a kind of poignancy to the story that it might not have had otherwise. Such multiple interpretations attest to English's superb writing in this matter.Now I know that as a reviewer of children's books I have a certain responsibility not to elevate my own preferred illustration style for children and condemn those pictures that don't strictly correlate to that art. That said, I had a great deal of difficulty enjoying Sean Qualls' illustrations. Having taken a glance at his other illustrated book for children, \\"Powerful Words\\" by Wade Hudson, it's obvious that the style he chose for \\"Baby On the Way\\" was a personal choice. Flat and utilizing a kind of makeshift messiness, it conveys the scenes well but is so doggone simplistic that much of the emotional impact of English's words is lost in the viewing. Now this isn't to say that Qualls doesn't do some mighty interesting things with the pictures. I was particularly taken with his tendency to mirror the events Grandma relates on the right with images of contemporary urban life on the left. No matter what exciting events occur on the right page, there's always Jamal or Grandma on the left either listening or telling the tale. In this way we get a nice distinction between today's city life and the rural sharecropping farms of sixty-some years ago. If it weren't for the fact that the illustrations also flatten and somewhat depress the story, I'd consider Qualls a competent illustrator of this book. The New York Times Book Review article on this title accused Qualls' illustrations of a feeling of melancholy suffusing certain pictures. Actually, I didn't feel much of this. I just thought that a different artist could have brought so much more to the tale. Qualls has his own strengths. They just weren't apparent in this book.Just the same, \\"The Baby On the Way\\" is a strong title and one that deserves a look. Due to Qualls illustrations I was initially going to give this book a mediocre three stars. I've amended that to four but with the strict understanding that I think a different artist would have done better by this book. It's a great read and will probably strike many as perfect. It just didn't win me personally over 100 percent."},{"Title":"The Mental Keys to Improve Your Golf","review":".This will be the BEST [price] you will spend on your Golf game.I forget how I met Michael Anthony but I will not forget how his book changed my golf game.

I have every golf book I ever bought, except for this one. The author uses psychological premises that could be accurate, but VERY rarely applies them to golf. He states that these premises have been backed up by \\"leaders\\" in the field, but it seems more like he offered them a sound bite that they agreed with, then made it sound like they agreed with the whole book (common spinning). I guess that's why nobody really published this book...it's like a photo copied, spiral bound home creation. When the author's common psychological premises are applied to golf, the word \\"sales\\" is used at the same time. It's like he threw the words golf & sales in there only gratuitously to make this book seem like it relates to them (to hook guys like me). I felt cheated by this. The Amazon reviews were why I bought it, and I'm very surprised now that they are all so positive. As an alternative, I found the book \\"Eye on the Ball, Mind on the Game\\" very helpful for my mental game (it may be out of print, as I do not see it on the Amazon sight). I'm sure there are others too, that actually give mental golf analysis that applies directly to golf. By the way, I've improved my game by 15 strokes (so far) this year...at least 10 due to improved mental keys that had nothing at all to do with this book."},{"Title":"Your Pregnancy Month by Month 5e","review":"The book was boring, slow, and full of a alot of WRONG info.- The section on episiotomys is not factual. I have the updated version of this book, so there is no reason for it to have such old information. It has been proven that episiotomys are needed in only extreme cases when a baby needs to get out right away. This section in this boosk makes them out to be the norm, and says very little about the importance of natural tears.Not only does it heal better, faster and more natrually, but your body knows how much to tear in order to get the baby out. Often times a doctor will cut you too much..meaning you have more to heal, or they don't cut long enough..and then you end up tearing ontop of the cut.-Dr. Gillespie is not very accepting of homebirth's, and he fails to mention that the the 20% of normal pregnancis that have 'births gone bad' are caused by hospital interventions. He also seems to think that the reason home births are popular in other countries is because women can't afford to go to a hospital. Nice try doc. Could it be that other countires are just smarter? Yep!He also forgets to mention that the home birth popular countries have a much higher 'live brth' rate compared to the united States.I am not against hospitla births. I have had one myself..as well as a homebirth. It seems to me though that the doc is only putting his personal opinion rather than fact and helpful info.He only mentions midwives in passing which is very unfair to women who will read only this pregnancy book. He does very little to empower women and makes pregnancy into a big medical mishap, that only doctors can be a part of.He does not get into delivery except to talk a lot of nonsence. FOr instance. His only mentino of position during delivery is a short blurb about where squatting, and hands and knees adapted from.Not a book for a smart women who actually wants to learn factual information and how to have a wonderful pregnancy and birth. My fear is that some young girl will pic up this book, believe what it says and then make all the wrong choices (although the author believes any and all choices during pregnancy and birth are the dr.'s and not the mothers).

I don't really have issues with Dr. C telling readers about every slight problem that could happen, nor with the layout or anything else- but the patronising manner in which he speaks to women who are pregnant.The book only addresses issues which Dr. C deems &quot;proper,&quot; and at the same time alienates women who may not have [male or existant] partners, financial security, or anything else people assume you're meant to have when you fall pregnant. He ignores issues which many women may want information about- such as homebirth and alternatives to pain relief, and advocates the &quot;don't ask any questions, just obey doctor&quot; line of dealing with patients which I've become all too used to.On a lighter side, the pictures are interesting and detailed, however they may send you into freak-out land if your ultrasound doesn't look like the ones in the book.If you don't mind doctors assuming you're stupid, or you are, this is all you'll need to read- how to ignore what your body may be telling you, how to give up your autonomy, and place your life, your baby's and your dignity right into the hands of a doctor.Do yourself a favour- get Sheila Kitzinger, the &quot;What to Expect...&quot; series, or Ariel Gore's &quot;HipMama: A survival guide.&quot;"},{"Title":"Your Pregnancy Month by Month 5e","review":"This book, while &quot;thorough&quot; is so fear inducing that any pregnant woman with a low-risk pregnancy shoud steer clear at all costs.

He does not inform her that the likelihood of having one of these problems is very rare. I would have rather have seen a listing somewhere else in the book of such possibilities and the symptoms to watch for. Rather than have this book at all, I recommend Gentle Birth Choices, Birthing From Within or anything by Sheila Kitzinger.

This book is extremely thorough and useful for anyone who wants real medical facts and straight talk. I have read a number of fact-based books about pregnancy and found this to be a good no-nonsense guide including some information which can't be found in any of the other common resources.When a woman embarks upon a pregnancy, it's important to know all of the facts rather than cling to a sugar-coated view of how an &quot;ideal&quot; pregnancy should shape up. Armed with information, a rational, informed woman can intelligently manage her pregnancy and know how to recognize true problems if they arise. If you are such a woman, this book is for you.

There is no hidden agenda."},{"Title":"The Colonial Experience 1607-1774 [Basic History of the United States Volume 1]","review":"Reading this book carefully, it's obvious that the author is writing from a conservative Christian viewpoint. That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but this book claims to be a mainstream text. Caveat Emptor!The book presents the Biblical account of Jesus' life as historical fact. This is the only part in the first several chapters where it goes into any detail. It contends that the separation of church and state is contrary to Christianity. It explains its use of the term 'humanism' by differentiating it from secular humanism, which is equates with athiesm. Of all the material available from the early church, the author chooses a quote from Bernard on the joys of the Rapture. There's nothing from Auqustine or Francis of Assisi.I was curious and looked up the publisher. Here's an excerpt from the publisher's website:\\"The main purpose of the American Textbook Committee has been to provide textbooks faithful to the American tradition, constitutional government, free enterprise, and to Judeo-Christian morality for the general reader, schools, home-schoolers, introductory courses in college and the like.\\"To give you an idea of where Mr. Carson is coming from, here's an excerpt from the introduction of another of his books:\\"It would be a considerable fraud to do a book on American government which talked as if the Constitution were still being substantially observed, that pretended that when Presidents took the oath of office they intended to observe the bounds set by Constitution, that Congressmen recited their pledges with the same intent, and that federal judges were still construing the Constitution as it was written. In sum, any book on American government ought to make clear how remote from the Constitution the government has become.\\"'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Mirrorwork: 50 Years of Indian Writing 1947-1997","review":"This book, edited by Salman Rushdie and Elizabeth West, was published in 1997 and contained 32 writers and as many works, created in the 50 years after India's independence. There were 14 extracts from novels, 12 short stories, 4 excerpts from memoirs, 1 excerpt from a nonfiction novel, and 1 speech.As far as could be determined, more than two-thirds of the pieces came from the 1980s and 90s, and a fifth from the 1940s and 50s. There seemed to be very little from the 1960s and 70s.Though this was an anthology of Indian writing, also included were works by two authors from Pakistan -- Bapsi Sidhwa (1938-) and Sara Suleri (1953-) -- together with another who left India for Pakistan, Saadat Hasan Manto (1912-55). And Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (1927-), a woman of Jewish heritage who was born in Germany and married to an Indian. V. S. Naipaul, according to Rushdie's introduction, declined inclusion in the collection.Nearly all the writers selected had spent some years living in the West or currently live there. The few exceptions, as far as could be judged, were Narayan, Manto, Ray, Chatterjee and Roy.In his introduction, Rushdie generated some controversy by stating that in the course of compilation he'd found Indian prose in English during the period was proving to be stronger and more important than writing in the vernacular languages, and that the writing in English was perhaps India's most valuable contribution to the world of books. As a result, all but one of the selections made for the anthology were written originally in that language. Of works in the many vernacular languages, only Manto's piece from the 1950s, translated from Urdu, was judged worthy of inclusion.On the other hand, the editor of a more recent anthology of Indian prose, Amit Chaudhuri, has argued that Indian writing is much too diverse to be represented only by authors who write in English, many of whom live in the West. And that the most profound impact of Western culture on India, and Indians' complex response to it, can be discovered in the vernacular languages. It was worthwhile to keep the opposed viewpoints in mind while reading.In Rushdie's anthology, roughly four generations of writers were included. The oldest were those born in the late 19th century or very early 20th (Nehru, Nirad Chaudhuri, Anand, Narayan, Desani, Manto). Following were those born in the 1920s through early 40s (Ray, Markandaya, Jhabvala, Anita Desai, Gita Mehta), the late 1940s through mid-60s (Rushdie, Sealy, Mistry, Seth, Ghosh, Tharoor, Kesavan, Chandra, Roy, Amit Chaudhuri), and the early 1970s (Kiran Desai).Though many of the authors in this collection live abroad, all the works of fiction except for Desani's were set entirely in India or Pakistan. For the nonfiction, an excerpt from a work by Ghosh began with the narrator's attending a wedding somewhere in the Egyptian countryside, but his memories carried him back to a time of unrest in East Pakistan during the 1960s.Some of the works of fiction in this anthology took place in the countryside, in nameless villages, or on a train. But many were set in cities: Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, a city in Kerala, a town in Indian Punjab, and Lahore. A number concerned characters from the middle classes, and Chandra's was set among the well to do. This differed from the selections of a collection like Best Loved Indian Stories from Penguin Books India, which contained many earlier stories that were often set in the countryside or in nameless towns, among farmers and villagers. In Rushdie's collection, there wasn't a bullock cart in sight.In terms of style, for me the main distinction in Rushdie's anthology was between the realists and what could be called the magic realists. The realists in their variety were concerned mainly with social observation and social types, the relations between people or psychological introspection, in lighter or darker shades (Markandaya, Jhabvala, Anita Desai, Gita Mehta, Mistry, Seth, Appachana, Hariharan, Chandra, Vakil).The magic realist writers, on the other hand, leaned much more toward flamboyant wordplay, exaggeration or improbable situations, minute description of action, sights or smells, or some combination thereof, with relatively low degrees of coherence and readability (Desani, Sealy, Rushdie). The work by Desani showed the other two's debt to him in terms of style.Other writers might be described as falling somewhere between realism and magic realism (Ray, Tharoor, Kesavan, Roy, Kiran Desai). Ray's short story was meticulously realist, except for the fabulist event at its center: a skeptic discovered a birdlike predator from the prehistoric age. Kesavan's followed an introspective older man walking around Delhi and contrasting the sights and smells with his memories of the U.S., before switching abruptly to different characters and an improbable situation. Roy's, an excerpt from The God of Small Things, was interesting for its minute, intense descriptions of actions, sense impressions and psychological states. The excerpt from Desai's novel described a childbirth amid a raging storm and flooding rivers, as an airplane flew overhead dropping care packages.The extract from Tharoor's satirical novel was a sweeping view of events from Indian history in the 1920s as described clearly by a narrator, but taking historical figures like the Gandhis and Nehru and recasting them as characters from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. His work may be in a category of its own.Various other categories in the anthology were memoirs dealing with moments in India's history, the seasons in a village at the turn of the century, a boy's life at a school for the blind, or a woman's memories of family, food and her native land (Sahgal, Nirad Chaudhuri, Ved Mehta, Suleri). Other prose works touched on independence or Indira Gandhi's assassination (Nehru, Chatterjee), while some stories dealt with partition, either with black humor (Manto) or a grim recording of the violence (Sidhwa). Some tales were mainly concerned with light humor (Anand, Narayan). There was also a piece by the writer Firdaus Kanga on a gay, disabled narrator's attraction to his male friend, interesting more for its subject than its style.For me, the more memorable works were Nirad Chaudhuri's slow-paced but atmospheric description of the seasons in a village life around the river. The excerpt from Markandaya's 1950s novel Nectar in a Sieve that described memorably the desperation of a farming couple without money or crops. The work by Hariharan in which an old, devout Hindu woman began violating proscriptions against food, drink and behavior as she approached death. And the excerpt from Roy's novel.Among the other Indians writing in English who weren't selected for this anthology: Raja Rao (1908-2006), K. A. Abbas (1914-87), Khushwant Singh (1915-), Ruskin Bond (1934-), Manoj Das (1934-), Bharati Mukherjee (1940-), Manjula Padmanabhan (1953-) and Sunetra Gupta (1965-).Among those in other languages who weren't included for the time period: in Bengali, Manik Bandyopadhyay (1908-56), Buddhadev Bose (1908-74), Mahashweta Devi (1926-) and Sunil Gangopadhyay (1934-). In Hindi, Krishna Sobti (1925-) and Nirmal Verma (1929-2005). In Kannada, M. V. Iyengar (1891-1986) and U. R. Anantha Murthy (1932-). In Malayam, O. V. Vijayan (1930-2005). In Marathi, Gangadhar Gadgil (1923-). In Punjabi, Amrita Pritam (1919-2005). In Tamil, Ambai (1945-). And in Urdu, K. A. Abbas again, plus Ismat Chughtai, (1915-92), Qurratulain Hyder (1927-2007), Surendra Prakash (1930-), and the Pakistani writer Enver Sajjad (1935-).One way to determine the relative truth of the claims made by Rushdie and Chaudhuri would be to read the latter's collection, The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature (2001), published in 2004 in the U.S. under the Vintage title. It's somewhat more balanced, with half of the selections in English and half translated from some of the vernacular languages -- mainly Bengali, but also Hindi, Urdu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Oriya. And it offers a bit more background commentary on the writers and their concerns.Like Rushdie, Chaudhuri hasn't escaped criticism, in the latter's case for the generous space given to translations from Bengali -- the language of his own region -- compared to other vernacular languages. For a more balanced selection of regional writing, there are Our Favourite Indian Stories (2001) and The Penguin Book of Modern Indian Short Stories (1989, revised 2001), as well as anthologies of short fiction translated from the vernacular languages that've been published every one or two years since 1990 by Katha Books of New Delhi.Anyway, accepting Chaudhuri's argument about the lesser importance of the English writers didn't mean for me that the stories in Rushdie's collection were uninteresting. A certain amount of the dislike recorded by other readers for this anthology seemed grounded in scorn for Rushdie's assertions. But why blame the stories and authors for the claims he made for them."},{"Title":"Mirrorwork: 50 Years of Indian Writing 1947-1997","review":"It would be really unfair to say the book has not been a representative collection of Indian writing in English. It is, though a few glaring points puts it at a disadvantage to become a volume to be cherished. The editors' seems to have allowed their backgrounds and biases to rule which determined their choice to large extent. This could have been avoided had the editors gave a harder look on the literary environment in India which is rapidly changing for the better. Much of the excellent work produced in vernacular languages is conveniently forgotten ascribing lack of good translation - a reason which simply does not hold water. And, if the all time favourite 'Tryst with Destiny'is included, no harm would have come if one of much sought after editorials by VN Narayanan or a science fiction was included. A translated piece of Hindi heartland politics mirrored by say, Rahi Masoom Raza could fill the gap. The absence of the enigmatic Khushwant Singh disturbs. The collection gives a fair space to new writers of the subcontinent, even if they are now based outside India. However, it remains skewed towards the age old mysticism and bullock carts in an age where these are pushed to the background by the fast enveloping modernity and automation. it is forgotten that we have a thriving middle class and a large educated elite which is crying to be heard and represented in our stories. For a book claiming to represent 50 years of writing, it is a bit focussed narrowly. The collection, though remains a must read. I read it over a long stretch of time, finishing many other volumes inthe the meantime, and would recommend the same way."},{"Title":"Mirrorwork: 50 Years of Indian Writing 1947-1997","review":"I bought my copy inspite of reading severeal reviews criticizing Mr. Rushdie's choice of literature to represent Indian writing.

I also recommend his book on Network Economics for all undergraduate and graduate students in Industrial Economics.

The selection for each day is taken from a harmony of the Gospels (and the entire harmony list is given for reference in the back of the book), so as the year progresses, you move quite thoroughly through the life and ministry of Jesus. Daily readings are accompanied by an explanatory text and an inspirational text. Just a few minutes reading each day gets through it, so it's not really much of a time investment. The translation is easy to read, but corresponds very well to more traditional translations. The print is a decent size (I read mine in a rather dimly-lit church) and the binding is holding the pages in. A word to Catholics considering this book: this book is published by Tyndale, a Protestant publisher, but I haven't found anything in the commentaries that is either anti-Catholic or significantly against Church doctrine.

Cocoon has attracted widespread attention because it solves a substantial problem for Web developers. Yet Cocoon's reliance on a wide array of open source technologies and standards makes it very complex. And, unlike some other open source technologies, Cocoon's online documentation is sparse and inadequate. Lajos Moczar's Cocoon Developer's Handbook is a practical, detailed guide for intermediate to advanced level developers who need to learn how to implement the Cocoon framework in a Web XML publishing system. Cocoon Developer's Handbook is not a theoretical work about XSL, XSP, and XSLT standards, but rather a hands-on explanation of these technologies within the Cocoon framework, with examples and solutions to get developers up and running with Cocoon."},{"Title":"Cocoon Developer's Handbook","review":"Sorry guys I know I should have wrote this one sooner. I went to a local bookstore here in Taipei and I bumped into someone who was buying this book. If only I could speak mandarin I would have told him that this book is simply OUTDATED because Cocoon has always been changing. It has never been, and may take a long time for it to be a full blown butterfly :)The book is great. It taught me a lot of stuff. Let us just say buying this book is like buying a book with a title \\"Mastering Windows 95 in one month\\".I am not going to preach on staying away as far as you can with Cocoon, not the book, even if it almost cost us our project but take a good, very good, look at the Table of Contents and see if the stuffs there are still supported by Cocoon. Or go to Cocoon website and decide on which stuff you would like to use (god bless you) and check if they are in this book.If I am to rate this book regardless of whether or not its updated, I will give it 5 star or even 6.

The descriptions of degradation experienced by those who fought in the trenches and their ability to create a sub-culture of derring-do is powerful in its modesty.Sassoon's mounting frustration is skilfully portrayed, especially in his allusion to details about provision for and management of warfare. His ennui is almost palpable on those train journies across France.The first volume (Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man) is possibly of more interest to those of us born and raised in the parish where Sasson himself lived. I enjoyed playing 'spot-the-location', but must declare that I am in possession of a comprehensive list, produced by Brenchley History Society,of pseudonyms/real names.The writing in this volume has some of the lyrical quality of his autobiography (The Old Century and Seven More Years - out of print)on which it is based. Rather than a treaties on Hunting, I consider this to be a gentle study of the awakening of Sassoon's poetic sensibilities; the Hunt and the relationships he formed with particular characters was, for him, an early catharsis. They also augur the events and characters in the following volume.The final volume (Sherston's Progress)is probably most poignant if one is aware that this is, indeed, a thinly veiled autobiography. Sassoon's heroism is, for me, as great beyond the era of World War I as it is within it. This volume should certainly be read within the context of the previous two, but stands alone as a testament to the debt future generations owe to the perseverance of men such as Sassoon."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"I had heard of this book many years before I was tempted to read it, and now I truly regret my lack of interest in Sassoon up to this point. He is a great poet, but as a memoirist he absolutely sparkles. Robert Graves' book, &quot;Goodbye to all that&quot;, often described as a classic, is a mere string of unrelated anecdotes compared with Sassoon's modest, humorous, poignant account of his own youth, which takes us from his childhood in Kent to the end of his military career after the First World War. Don't hesitate to read this book, especially if you enjoy seeing the English language used at its very best."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"World War I had a far greater impact on Britain than the US for the obvious reasons that they were in the war for over four years and suffered horrific casualties. The literature produced by that war made a sharp break from what came before, which reflected the feeling in the country that the war had irrevocably changed life in Britain. This is well illustrated in Siegfreid Sassoon's &quot;The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston,&quot; a fictional version of his own experiences. The first part covers Sherston's pre-war life, with his obsession with fox-hunting. This is so well written that you will enjoy it even if you don't have the least interest in the subject.The next section, &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot; covers his experiences in World War I, during he is highly decorated. The horrors of the war, which many of Sassoon's class thought would be a great adventure, are accurately portrayed. Eventually he becomes disillusioned with the war, and writes a letter denouncing it that could have led to his court-martial. A close friend (Robert Graves in real life) gets him classified as having a mental disorder and he is sent off to a hospital to recuperate.This book is deeply moving and is one of a handful of books that changed the way that the English-speaking world views war. Sassoon's writing style is plain on the surface, but its plainness makes the emotional impact all the greater."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"Sassoon's three volumes wrapped up into one take the reader into another world. First volume describes life in the English country, where a young George Sherston becomes completely immersed in fox hunting. To say he becomes consumed by this is an understatement. Sassoon's intimate depictions of the countryside, to include the life of a country gentleman are so detailed you can clearly &quot;see&quot; and feel how young George felt.Volume 2, Memoirs of an infantry officer take George into the trenches of France, where again with graphic details, the horror and calamity of the fighting in WWI are brought to our attention. Of note is the latter part of the volume where Sherston's morals are challenged, and how he deals with this mental dilemma.Volume 3 takes Sherston from the trenches of France, to a stint in Ireland and Palestine, but ultimately back to France where the novel is brilliantly wrapped up.Sassoon's experiences in the war have given us perhaps one of the greatest novels from the era. The writing is absolutely outstanding and will give you pause to put the book down."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"This book-- it is actually a chronological series of three novels, though it is packaged here as one book-- starts slowly by current standards. In fact, the only reason anyone would want to read the first novel &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man&quot;, is as necessary preparation for the next two. It is as boring as the prewar life of George Sherston, the novel's main character. By the second book &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot;, things begin to speed up. Sherston's character grows under the pressures of command; the lazy country gentleman finds himself capable of courage, creativity, and moral outrage. By the third novel, &quot;Sherston's Progress&quot;; Sherston has become a decorated hero, a poet, and an antiwar protester.These novels, by the British poet Siegfreid Sassoon, are a fictionalization of his wartime experiences and friendship with the writer Robert Graves. The same events are covered from a different perspective in Graves own wartime memoir, &quot;Farewell to All That&quot;. As powerful in its own way as Remarque's &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;; this is a book worth searching out and reading-- even with the slow first section."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"Sassoon's thinly-veiled autobiography is one of the finest accounts of a soldier's life during World War One that I've come across, and, indeed, is one of my favorite autobiographies.And, in addition to his life-during-wartime memoir (\\"Memories of an Infantry Officer\\"), the descriptions of Sassoon's life in England both before and after the \\"war to end all wars\\" are also finely detailed, giving each of these memoirs a life and vividness seldom found in similar books.All in all, these memoirs are profound, moving, and well worth reading!(I'd also recommend picking up Robert Graves \\"Goodbye to All That\\" for a look at the same period (and often the same characters!) through different eyes.)"},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"A rhetorical question. I've looked for these memoirs off and on in used book shops for years, chiefly because I remembered the first, foxhunting volume so fondly. I don't agree at all with the other reviewers that this section of the &quot;memoirs&quot; is dull. If you like animals or learning about lost sports and conventions--alpine climbing when it was a club activity, say, or round-the-world sailing--you'll enjoy Sassoon's description of hunts and hunters, especially those of the equine sort."},{"Title":"The complete memoirs of George Sherston,","review":"I've not much to add to the previous excellent review except to mention a few things that struck me:- The fox-hunting, golfing and cricketing stuff really is immensely tedious unless you happen to like that sort of thing. Just when you think there's no chance of it recurring, there's another dose of it in the third part, &quot;Sherston's Progress&quot;.- Sherston/Sassoon's narrative is overly self-conscious. He doesn't need to explain the way he was thinking so much as it's already perfectly clear from the events he describes. It's particularly irritating that he spends so much time excusing his Declaration against the War.- The gay sub-text is well concealed.- Sassoon uses the real names of people who were dead when he wrote the novels and pseudonyms for those who weren't (&quot;Cromlech&quot; for &quot;Graves&quot;, for instance.) At our distance in time from the Great War this is either an amusing guessing game or an irritation, depending upon your p! oint of view. Perhaps some enterprising person could produce an annotated edition.- Pat Barker's &quot;Regeneration&quot; is magnificently complementary to these novels."},{"Title":"The Survival of the Adversary Culture","review":"This major contribution to the understanding of American society during the past quarter century illuminates developments and trends which the Reagan years have obscured. Beliefs, values, and movements associated with the 1960's, argues the author, have had far greater influence than is generally realized. Above all, the volume seeks to explain why American society has gathered so much hostility at home and abroad over the last quarter century. Why have critiques of American isnstitutions and policies proven so durable?Hollander show that contrary to much popular and journalistic opinion, the rejection of American society conceived during the 1960s have been absorbed into the mainstream of American life, making it more dificult to distinguish between the dominant and \\"counterculture.\\" Gradually and almost imperceptibly, the entire political spectrum has shifted to the left and meanings of \\"radical,\\" \\"liberal,\\" \\"conservative,\\" and \\"moderate\\" have been redefined. Much social critism - examined in detail in these pages - has become highly standardized and is now embraced by important social institutions such as colleges and universities, churches and foundations, and much of the media. Special attention is paid to groups engaged in the articulation and circulation of such critiques: intellectuals, church leaders, journalists, academics, and some politicians. While emphasizing continuities, Hollander also traces differences between the social critism of the sixties, the seventies, and the eighties.--- from book's dustjacket"},{"Title":"Complicating Categories: Gender, Class, Race and Ethnicity (International Review of Social History Supplements)","review":"This book was assigned in a class, and was one that I wish we had not read.

The first book was Bedding His Virgin Mistress - about one of the friends. This book is Julia's story. She works for her friend Lucy & is being pursued by Lucy's creepy husband who she went out with before he ever met Lucy (they never slept together). She agrees to pretend to go out with billionaire businessman Silas to throw this guy off her scent, so he'll leave her alone and stop making things awkward for her at work and with her friend. She doesn't know that Silas has planned to marry her since she was 18 years old (8 years ago) because he decided she would be a suitable bride for him because she understands his responsibilities (they are distantly related - they share a greatgrandfather and he will inherit the estate she grew up on). You will love Julia - she is a thoroughly modern girl who loves sex and the city & is obsessed with shoes! She's not a timid, virginal type, and she's not afraid to be bold in bed - her fun & passionate personality quickly win Silas over and make this a love match after all. This book also covers an important worry for all women - date rape drugs. I guarantee you'll enjoy this fun & romantic read! The last book will be about Lucy and how she gets rid of her creepy husband and finds true love (looks like it will be with one of the trustees in charge of her trust fund) - I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Expecting The Playboy's Heir (Harlequin Presents)","review":"This book represents exactly how this line of series romances has been gutted by staggeringly dumb oversight.Penny Jordan used to have a distinctive voice. She used to write about characters. She used to tell a story. Shoot, they even used to have titles. You never thought you were reading \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" but you at least felt that had spent some time with characters an author had gone to some trouble to think about, and had some small emotional investment in. Jordan in particular had a familiarity and fondness for English country life that was a very engaging and integral part of her stories.Well, that's gone. It's been replaced with schlock, tackiness, and not-very-well-done soft-core porn (all readily available from a wide variety of other sources). There are no characters, just blank-faced figures wearing placards to identify them (\\"really rich sexy guy\\" and \\"spunky heroine\\"), going through 180 pages of product-placements and gymnastics, until the formula decrees that they be in love forever and it's over.I guess they're trying to update the line and woo a different audience, but I don't think they'll accomplish that by making it into something so utterly, trashily soul-less."},{"Title":"Expecting The Playboy's Heir (Harlequin Presents)","review":"A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!"},{"Title":"Expecting The Playboy's Heir (Harlequin Presents)","review":"I found the story very silly.First: Its not romantic.Second:The heroine is very vain.Three: The language doesn't look like Penny Jordan, it sounded cheap especially when the heroine says baby grub and talkes about her vibrator Roger.These books are supposed to be silly likable love stories, then of talking about about vibrators etc."},{"Title":"Expecting The Playboy's Heir (Harlequin Presents)","review":"I like Penny Jordan, and I usually like all her books. But Suzy has put me off this one by telling me the heroine is some vacuous airhead who likes Sex and the City and shoes, and who is 'bold in bed' (a real turn on - not.) So, guess I'll wait for the next one in this trilogy. Maybe the heroine in that one will be a litte more appealing.

But this book is basically a rehash of things that have been said or written elsewhere.

Sorry, but don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Imus: America's Cowboy","review":"In this comprehensive biography of radio host Don Imus, Tracy (Home Brewed: The Drew Carey Biography; Seinfeld: The Entire Domain) patches together the reminiscences of friends and enemies into a rollicking narrative of the sleazy but successful career of the &quot;I-Man.&quot; Tracy posits that Imus, who grew up on an Arizona ranch, brought a cowboy ethos with him to Manhattan. By her lights, Imus is &quot;a rugged individualist living by his own code&quot; with a &quot;from-the-hip style.&quot; Despite much-publicized alcohol and drug problems, and incidents like his 1969 firing for repeatedly making comments about &quot;spooks,&quot; after having held a mean-spirited &quot;Eldridge Cleaver look-alike contest,&quot; Imus has always bounced back. His incendiary--and oft-protested--rhetoric and his jousting with public figures who criticize him have garnered the talk-radio pioneer an audience of 15 million who listen to him on WFAN in New York, or in syndication on almost 100 stations. Whereas Jim Reed''s recent biography, Everything Imus, is based almost exclusively on second-hand stories, Tracy has conducted extensive interviews, producing hilarious reflections and a balanced account. Leonard Shapiro of the Washington Post asks, following a presidential appearance on Imus in the Morning, &quot;Why would somebody like Bill Clinton, a decent human being, go on a show where there are constant references to genitals and Jews and derogatory comments about blacks?&quot; Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes takes up the defense, calling Imus rival Howard Stern &quot;a vulgar, vulgar man,&quot; and finding Imus &quot;infinitely more intelligent [and] infinitely more sensitive.&quot; The shock jock who calls himself &quot;Howard Stern with a vocabulary&quot; will find little here to raise his famous ire.

For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true."},{"Title":"Life of Cervantes","review":"I HAVE BEEN A CERVANTES SCHOLAR FOR THE BETTER PART OF 30 YEARS AND HAVE READ AND STUDIED MANY OF HIS BIOGRAPHIES.THIS PARTICULAR BIOGRAPHY PRESENTS THE DETAILS OF THE LIFE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST AUTHOR.LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ARE BROUGHT TO LIFE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT BIOGRAPHY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MY BEING A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO BELIEVES THAT READING IS AN END UNTO ITSELF!"},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Second Book","review":"Fans of the new Ang Lee film, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; will welcome this swashbuckling adventure story of 17th century Manchu-dominated China. THE DEER AND THE CAULDRON (aka &quot;Royal Tramp&quot;) is by repute the very best of the thirteen &quot;wu xia&quot; (or &quot;martial chivalry&quot;) novels written by Louis Cha, &quot;the Alexandre Dumas of Asia.&quot; Published originally as a newspaper serial in Hong Kong, under the Chinese pseudonym Jin Yong, this beautifully constructed novel may be a better book than any by Dumas, who certainly never created a central character as seductively self-absorbed as Cha's Wei Xiaobao - who becomes &quot;Trinket&quot; in translator John Minford's version. Trinket is an incorrigible teenage rogue from the &quot;pleasure quarter&quot; of Yangzhou who by guile and good fortune becomes simultaneously a confidant of the boy emperor Kang Xi and a leader of the loyalist martial arts outlaws of the Heaven and Earth Society. John Minford's graceful translation gives the most popular Chinese novelist on earth a shot at a legion of new fans. (An earlier Louis Cha novel, &quot;Book and Sword: Gratitude and Revenge,&quot; is available for download in its entirety, in English, from &quot;http://idt.net/~earnshaw.&quot;)"},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Second Book","review":"Yes! This is pretty much the same review as the one for the first book, but it's not a book series. So there!This is the last of Cha's masterful storytelling efforts and it is by far his most original. The siver-tongued and foulmouthed anti-hero (Trinket Wei) will definitely fill your hours with amazement, laughter, gasps of &quot;WHAT!&quot; and &quot;HOW'D HE DO THAT!?!&quot;. For me these comments and expressions were spoken out loud (and very loud somthings), which is something I almost never do. The other characters in this book are very loveable, mostly heroic, and uncommonly very vulnerable. At first glance, the men and women of River and Lake seem to exude the aura of stereotypical &quot;heroes&quot; (and villains) that as children listening to storytellers we have come to believe to have lived in that era. But their personalities and character faults envelope them with a third dimensional layer that definitely makes them leap of the page. Only the first two (of three) books are currently available and you'll definitely want to pickup the second before finishing the first. I think I read about 600 pages the first night.So... Tired of the &quot;poo&quot; that's been floating around in you're Fantasy or Adventure sections of the bookstore? This is one of the books that you'll want to snatch up! Now! Currently, I'm pulling my fingernails out with my teeth waiting for Oxford to put out the THIRD part of this book. I'm also anxiously awaiting Cha's &quot;The Book and The Sword&quot; which was translated by Graham Ernshaw (GREAT translation BTW). This one is mentioned in the intro of TD&amp;TC, so I'm hoping that it comes out soon!"},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Second Book","review":"In this Second Book of *The Deer and the Cauldron*, Trinket the teenage trickster gets to travel a lot more than in the First Book, which was mostly set in the Forbidden City. Still searching for the eight copies of the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, about which much more is now revealed, he visits the northern Wutai Mountains, where evil Tibetan lamas try to kidnap the lost father of the young Manchu Emperor; confronts the perils of Snake Island, where he is initiated into the Sect of the Mystic Dragon; stays at the Shaolin Monastery, from whose assortment of rather ridiculous monks he does not seek to learn much kung fu; and is finally sent to the south-western Yunnan province, where a conspiracy is afoot to overthrow the Qing dynasty.The first one hundred pages of this Second Book are perhaps the most addictive of the two volumes and the action remains fast-paced throughout. However, Trinket's assumption of more and more false identities and his rapid promotion in the various milieux he infiltrates tend to become a little formulaic. The general tone is one of derision, and the only truly noble figure in the whole series is the White Nun, who might have been interpreted, in another era, by a Xu Feng or a Cheng Pei Pei. As for Trinket's increasingly sophisticated Machiavellianism, it is often disturbing, as he murders enemy after enemy in the most dastardly ways (usually by poison or back stabs), disposing of the bodies with his &quot;decomposing powder&quot;. Even his sex life, and particularly his sado-masochistic relationship with the berserk Princess Ning, is repulsive. I am not talking of light B&amp;D, which I would have rather enjoyed (especially with the woman on top), but of the heavier stuff of which the following might give you an idea: &quot;Dear Laurie [Trinket's false identity as an Imperial Eunuch], Prince Laurie, you can go on beating me if you like, but please first put my joints back!&quot;. And I am not mentioning in what horribly mutilated condition Trinket finds one of his friends at the end of the novel. Had the tone been a little less over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek, such scenes would have sickened me.Nevertheless, *The Deer and the Cauldron* remains an extremely enjoyable read, and I hope Oxford University Press will not fail to publish the Third Book. I aspire some day to find more uplifting, mystical and literary martial arts novels, in the vein of the King Hu movies I worship, but in the meantime, Louis Cha (a.k.a. Jin Yong) is the closest literary equivalent I have found to a really good kung fu film."},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Second Book","review":"Louis Cha is perhaps the paramount Chinese adventure novelist of the modern age and with Deer & the Cauldron, his last epic, he introduces one of his most indelible characters--Trinket Wei.Trinket is the son of a Yangzhou prostitute who goes through a series of adventures so unbelievable, from becoming a 'eunuch' in the Forbidden City and friend of the emperor, to a Shaolin, a Lama, a Heaven & Earth rebellion leader, and a disciple of Snake Island--all woven into the mystery of the sutra and dragon-lines, and the fate of the Qing (Manchu) Empire--yet so utterly entertaining, as to both honor and revolutionize the genre.The only drawback is that the translation maintains the more Chinese style of heavy narrative exposition--they 'tell' almost as much as 'show' which is very much different to the post-TV/Cinema Western style of immediate scene. If the sheer lunatic excitement of the story wasn't so engrossing, it would probably lose some readers along the way.Hopefully more Wuxia will make the transition into English!"},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Second Book","review":"The novel's most glaring weakness is that too many girls pop in and out of Trinket's life at his convenience. There is no compelling romantic relationship in the book and I found their characterization one dimensional and utterly predictable. The book shows its heritage as a serialized newspaper novel. Nevertheless, Trinket is witty, resourceful, and delightful.This book is so different from his other novels that many consider the Deer and the Cauldron his ultimate accomplishment. I beg to differ. The first 2/3 of the Book and the Sword was more coherent and entertaining. The Smiling Proud Wanderer has a much more profound love story between Linghu Chong (played by Jet Li in Swordsman II) and two lead female characters (doesn't include Brigitte Lin in II) with an interesting tragic twist at the end.However, I am eagerly awaiting for the release of the final volume."},{"Title":"Mary's Treasure Box","review":"This is a wonderful story of Jesus that can be read to children.

Not only did he self-publish it-at the height of his fame no less-but he refused to copyright it, hoping to pass through the complete media blacklist a book like this faced. It went on to sell more than 150,000 copies its first year. Take that, Cory Doctorow! Though the book has been almost entirely forgotten by history, it's not only fascinating but a timeless perspective. Sinclair deeply understood the economic incentives of early 20th century journalism and thus could predict and analyze the manipulative effect it had on The Truth. Today, those incentives and pressures are different but they warp our information in a similar way. In almost every substantial charge he leveled against the yellow press, you could, today, sub in blogs and the cable news cycle and be even more correct. In fact, the reason that most newspapers could escape this criticism is that over the last 50 years they have instituted many of the important changes he asked for."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"A Language Older Than Words impresses by its sheer honesty. Derrick Jensen is the rarest of men: He's a man willing to present and find the truth at any cost. His meditations on various subjects, including his own abuse at the hands of his father, the killing of salmon, the rampant mistreatment of women, elucidate our culture's severe sickness. Our culture is a culture of violence and denial. By relentlessly exposing the truth, Jensen brings us one step closer to confronting and fixing our ills. His work is a reality check, and his pursuit of truth is courageous."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"There is no disagreement that Derrick is excellent with tossing variables into the air and single-handedly drawing them into himself for a larger inspection of his readers. The stark honesty is bold and refreshing for one can see a catharsis for the writer we all get to experience. The tone is anger and the theme is personal revenge against the world, when actually it is against his father, still he triumphs by constantly telling himself he will not be conquered by a hateful world of violence and greed. Derrick is an excellent researcher and due to his gift of working the abstract and variables---he finds from his own PC---he engages the reader to think far outside the box. Unfortunately, one must agree with him or he tailspins into a rather bratty viewpoint. His work can be dictatorial, with no compassion whatsoever, and he offers no solutions that well balanced people can embrace. What is surprising is the fact his main solution is to blow up dams, but he does not even do this himself. For a person to blow up dams would destroy more life than he can possibly imagine and most of that life will be innocent. Still, he advocates such nonsense. What is most shocking---to me----is his systematic slaughter of the innocent life around him. Throughout the entire book---although poignantly this is a man at war with himself not civilization---Derrick slaughters helpless birds including chickens and ducks. He has a special ax and a special bloody stump for this. The illusionary \\"connection\\" he has with the duck he murders is the most memorable episode---for me---in the book. For Derrick to have such a following of anarchists and nihilists and bitter angry people is one thing, but for readers to accept the senseless slaughter based solely upon the premise that he will not eat \\"factory-farm\\" chickens, but is more of a survivalist swiftly acting as judge and executioner is beyond my understanding. What impacted me the most in the book was his systematic slaughter of the fowl around his house and how he was obsessed with this slaughter all-the-while justifying it to himself and to his readers. I suggest not falling into this childish manipulation. Consequently, the tone of honesty therefore is swiftly replaced with a need to annihilate his past. The ducks and chickens consistently symbolize the slaughter of his childhood rape and the slaughter of his father. I want to thank him for doing the incredible amount of research he does daily on the Internet, for I would never sit in front of the PC for those many hours. And thank him too for his books. But as he attacks cars, technology and deforestation he contributes to this just as much, and even more, as most of the people he wants to annihilate. In conclusion we have an angry man with a genius for juggling variable and abstract thinking, but a man who is convincing insecure Western fans to do his dirty work for him. I don't see any difference between Derrick Jensen and the \\"European white civilization\\" he so hates with a vehemence. His viewpoints are interesting, but lack philosophical insight, for one can see they are a direct result of the snippets he finds on the Internet. But, putting philosophy aside, he is most fascinating to read due to his relentless investigations to highlight the destruction the Western Civilization has caused. However, to want to \\"bring down\\" the society would hurt millions of innocent living creatures including women, children, animals,mammals, oceans, plants and tress and more of his ducks!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I'd been reading some articles lately by Derrick Jensen, and always, I found them stunningly ... courageous ... because he constantly insisted on challenging us to consider, when-oh-when?, will we take the actions necessary to confront and at least 'try' to 'stop' the destruction of our planet. He's been blunt about his estimation of our chances, at this late date.This book seemed like a good place to start reading Jensen in earnest, but I'll have to let you know down the line whether it was. I can say this: I now feel a strong need to read of him more -- not to mention some of the books that were important to his thinking. Actually, I've already started: Jack D. Forbes; Hannah Arendt ...To unpack the parallel relationship Jensen sees between violent, domineering family violence and environmental-plus-genocidal depredation, Jensen tells the powerful stories from harrowing childhood experience, juxtaposed with 'thick descriptions' (Geertz)of personal interactions with animals, trees, stars and dreams, that demonstrate how seriously we need to take the sentience of the beings that surround us, in this 'more-than-human world' (Abram). All this in a clear, unvarnished, authentic voice -- just a lyrical voice. His honesty and willingness to take a stand repeatedly took my breath away. Now, given what we're up against, how can I do more????"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Derrick Jensen's book, A Language Older Than Words, is a landmark in environmental writing. A standard formula for eco-books is to describe the evolution of a problem, provide charts, tables, and illustrations to document the extent of the problem, and then present \\"solutions.\\" Typically these are theoretical, politically impossible, pie-in-the-sky solutions based on the premise that humankind is fundamentally rational and reasonable -- solutions that require minimal adjustments to the machinery of consumer society, will not significantly interfere with perpetual economic growth, and will let us keep our cell phones, lights, and cars.Happily, Jensen is not stuck in these ruts. Obviously, reason is not the guiding force in the journey of humankind. Obviously, if a workable and intelligent win-win solution to the Earth Crisis existed, we would have already found it and implemented it. Jung had a name for episodes of mass insanity, like Nazi Germany, or consumer society: psychic epidemics. Psychic epidemics are far more devastating than natural catastrophes (earthquakes, hurricanes), and reason is powerless to resolve them, because reason does not communicate with the unconscious.The \\"language older than words\\" refers the voice of the living planet -- the wind, the burbling brook, the ravens, the howling wolves, the rattling leaves. Everything is communicating, sharing, cooperating. Unfortunately, civilized humans have isolated themselves from the rest of the family of life. We no longer listen to the ancient language, which is always talking to us. We have become space aliens in our own home. Not coincidentally, we are racing toward catastrophe.Most eco-writers do not reveal a spiritual connection to life on Earth. Jensen clearly does, and this adds much power to his work. He is not a professional scholar who is systematically analyzing a sub-optimal process, he's a man who radiates love for the wild natural world, and deeply cares about it. This passion is a treasure, and it is slipping through our fingers as each generation lives in greater isolation from the sacred natural world.Jensen's father was a fundamentalist Christian and a wealthy businessman. He was abused as a child, and he grew up to be a violent, controlling tyrant. He physically and sexually abused his wife, sons, and daughters, including Derrick. The family lived in fear of his rage, and all of them suffered permanent emotional damage. Many years later, his father still refuses to acknowledge his violent past, and Derrick still has trouble sleeping. Jensen says that if he had to do his childhood over again, he would kill his father. He believes that it's essentially impossible to rehabilitate an habitual abuser.During the years of violent rage, the family members lived in a world of make believe, blocking out the fear and suffering. In order to survive the terror, they had to shut down emotionally. This family was not an unusual freak. Physical, emotional, and sexual abuse are commonplace in our society.In many ways, on a larger scale, our global civilization resembles Jensen's family. It's beating and raping our planet. Similarly, we feel powerless to stop the senseless savagery. We shut down emotionally. We pretend that everything is OK. We ignore vast amounts of information, and what we can't ignore, we forget or dismiss. Living behind a wall of fear, we become isolated from life, from our bodies, from our spirits. Isolation is poisonous.Humans are not essentially bad, but we have had the misfortune of being born into a culture that is speeding down the path of self-destruction. Jensen says: \\"Within any culture that destroys the salmon, that commits genocide, that demands wage slavery, most of the individuals -- myself included -- are probably to a greater or lesser degree insane.\\" The central question of our time is this: \\"What are the sane and appropriate responses to insanely destructive behavior? In many ways, it is the only question of our time.\\"One gift of Jensen's traumatic childhood was that it knocked off his cultural blinders. His father was a respected member of the community -- and he was also an abusive monster. Jensen came to the terrifying realization that our celebrated modern culture was as crazy and brutal as his dad. The first step on the path to healing is to acknowledge the existence of problems, to recognize the truth. Then, the process of awakening involves a series of deaths and rebirths, as useless things are tossed overboard, and replaced with healthier ones. It's about growth, and it's not quick or easy.This book is a dizzying non-linear tilt-a-whirl ride that zooms round and round in the insanity of our culture. It's a slideshow of stories, describing various outbreaks of the disease that's destroying the world -- the Sand Creek massacre, Peruvian dictatorships, the sadism of animal testing, devastating clear cuts, the destruction of the salmon, and on and on and on. He also includes stories about indigenous people who are eager to promote healing. He tirelessly explores many paths in search of coherence and understanding. It's a messy business. The results are not neat, clean, or consistent. Jensen explodes with pain, love, intelligence, and a burning hunger for a brighter tomorrow. He is a man you will never forget.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"A Language Older Than Words, Derrick Jensen Memoir/Philosophy of NatureAn archangel wake up call.....a message for everyone on our planet to hear.

While Jensen's prose style is immensely readable, the substance of Language Older Than Words is challenging stuff! It becomes necessary for the reader to abandon judgement and trust in Jensen's sincerity if she hopes to wrap her mind around what are oftentimes strange concepts and horrifying experiences. I found it impossible to read this work without stopping every other page to evaluate the world and my own life and compare that experience with the world Jensen describes. What I found is that Jensen, when he is not wandering away in emotional diatribe, is dead-on."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I read in an earlier review someone thought jensen thought his abuse was unique. I would disagree venomously, Jensen uses his abuse as the basis for his critique of a culture that does this all the time. If Jensen had thought he was unique his points would be somewhat irrelevant, Jensen constantly in all his work states facts on the prevailance of violence in civilization, and many times uses stats on child and women abuse and rape. His crtique is well thought out and thurough. It seems to me that this book is mostly a collection of beautiful thoughts that concur with memories. I hope that this book gets fully understood, Jensen is not your run of the mill environmentalist, he is much more, he understand that there is a root to this oppression, civilization."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like A Language Older Than Words. The concept of interspecies communication and the need for humanity to be more in touch with the surrounding ecosystem rather than taking it for granted rings very true with me. In this rambling book, Jensen does a good job at presenting the point he promises to address in his title.Unfortunately, I found the book to be highly irritating, much like a Michael Moore movie. Everything seemed to be black and white, either good or bad. Those who agree with Jensen are great. Those who do not are terrible. Native cultures are wonderful, even when they are abusive. Western culture and western religion are terrible and are dragging us to a point of annihilation.To my way of thinking, this is just too pat and easy. For all of Jensen's bad mouthing of corporate America, he does his work on a computer, sells books that are printed on paper, drives a car to go dumpster diving, uses power generated by evil dams, and so on. His choice of proof texts are difficult to substantiate, to the point where, at one point, he says that he skips some sentences in a quote because they would disprove the point he is trying to make. When he pulls from the biblical tradition, he chooses texts that are damning, yet misses ones that are very crucial to the Christian environmental movement. Proof texting is a dangerous business.So, if you are interested in this book, read it with caution and try to read behind the words. There is great stuff here, it is just requires dumpster diving to get to it."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"A Language Older Than Words was by far the most difficult book I have ever read. Derrick Jensen cracked open his heart and shared his innermost secrets. All the honesty regarding his feelings and some of the inexplicable horrors he endured during his childhood, left me so uncomfortable that many times I had to put the book down and leave it on the coffee table for days at a time. But Jensen's writing is so terrific that I repeatedly came back to it and resumed reading. Thankfully I read every word and when someone asks for a book recommendation this is the book that first pops into my mind. Most books give me pleasure while I am reading them, but this one is one I will never forget."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This book is an eye opener and backs up many thoughts you may have had about our culture and its disillusions via, history, personal experience, and statistics.

It must have taken a lot of courage for Derrick Jensen to write this book. Not only is Derrick exploring the cause of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse that he and his family suffered at the hands and genitals of his father. He is also exploring how are cultures relationship with humans and non-humans is similar to the relationship he and his family had with his father.

The book will leave you in awe and give you a different perspective on this culture of mass destruction.Keep writing Derrick!!!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite books for its raw and uncensored examination of the world's problems. It is a great source for recognizing our collective problems. I just could not put this book down! This book deserves 4 to 5 stars based on problem recognition. It would be in our best interest to acknowledge these realities, instead of simply \\"silencing\\" them. Otherwise, everything wonderful that we've worked so hard for will just all go down the drain. Guaranteed, the world will go on, perhaps with another ice age. As for humans, we may or we may not. As evolution has demonstrated time and time again, life will survive. The question is, will many of us survive through it.What this book does not offer are solutions. Maybe that wasn't Jensen's purpose for this book. He basically says that there are no solutions and that we're all[in trouble]. It's possible that he was simply using a \\"double bind\\" or \\"reverse psychology\\" approach to get readers to take action. In looking at the big picture of getting things done, this book gets 2 stars and it is up to us to fulfill the other 3 stars. Earning 5 stars is a combined effort between Jensen and ourselves.It would be impossible for a single author to offer a manual for action in solving the problems we recognize. There are so many disciplines to cover. What is needed is a combined effort from all sectors of civilization. I do believe that it can be done. In fact, it's currently taking place, even though it is difficult to tell because we do not see any drastic results in our everyday lives. Only time will tell. The important thing is that we get as many people to join in the effort as we can. It would be impossible to get everybody to do it, which is fine. The crucial part is getting THE RIGHT PEOPLE to join the effort in sustaining everything we've worked for.I highly recommend this book. It does what it's suppose to do. I have faith that you will create possible solutions based on your own expertise and experiences."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"My all time fav book!I have read it at least 3 times and will constantly refer back to different sections."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This is my favorite book by my favorite author.

This book will help demonstrate the \\"why\\" and the \\"how\\". Sure it is a bit of a harrowing read but it is no less harrowing than the carnage on your evening news."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Mr Jensen repeatedly focuses us on the violence and coercion of the society as he sees it. He asks : should we kill our senators (\\"who are tools of genocide, ecocide, and atrocities\\")? No, but only because it wouldn't do any good. He advocates blowing up dams, and states that he has not done it himself YET because he is \\"too small\\".He says that SILENCE is the root of all our problems - silence allows the holocaust, child abuse, deforestation, wife beating, lack of love, etc. Without Silence, abuse and violence and coercion would not exist. And his solution to the problem: There is no solution. A double bind can only be elimated by obliterating the structure that gave rise to it.When I looked in the back of the book for references to his quotations, I found that many were not footnoted and it was not possible to find the actual source or author.In regards to his own abuse, I began to wonder about his view of it. He never says what actually happens, and mentions that his sisters have a different view of it. His other family members don't seem to have any responsibility in the matter. Like everything else in the book, he talks a lot but doesn't say anything with substance: I was always left with more questions, and wondered about his slant on the matter, and all the details that were conveniently left outCommunications with animals: he says the stars talk to him, but never what is being said. There are very few instances where he gives concrete examples of this \\"communication\\" with animals, and these can be dismissed by prior vocalizations and training. We are encouraged to listen to messages from animals, but not how to do this.He calls the person who is building a home next to his house \\"a killer\\" (presumably because they are destroying habitat), but does not believe that he and his home destroyed the same. Over and over again, he accuses everybody else of genicide and ecocide for doing exactly the same things he is doing (heating with wood, living in a wood house, killing chickens, ducks, bees; advocating violence, being a capitolist and gasoline burner, carting his bees every day with a truck and pallet lifter, teaching, eating non local food,using electricity,earning a wage,living in this culture and therefore supporting it, etc).He advocates the very violence and coercion that he says are characteristic of our culture, and that he believes gives rise to genicide and ecocide. He contradicts himself at every turn, and sees everybody as either a victim (himself), or a perpertrator (almost everybody else). I could not believe his dishonesty, and lack of character or responsibility. He blames everybody but himself. He fails to listen to his body, to himself, to family and friends, to others, to animals, to the earth. What does he really believe in? There is nothing in the book that indicates to me that he is either connected to the earth or animals,, despite the hype."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen has a slew of problems and decides that the entire world works the way his childhood did. As an abused child who doesn't actually become a sentient person until his later 20's, he explains his view on Western Civilization where everyone is abused or an abuser, and one's membership to either group vascillates. He also seems to put forth the notion that Western Civilization sprung up as an entity not influenced by history or affected by human nature. He quotes many different sources without providing citation or credit for most, and I have discovered that it is usually quoted out of context. As is becoming increasingly avant garde these days among the environmentalists searching for peer approval through platitudes, he ends the book with the statement that there are no solutions after quipping midway about all the trees the publication of this book has destroyed. While I would be equally as suspect of a book that wrapped up the problem in one tidy little solution, the notion that there are none is absolutely ridiculous and demeans everyone who has fought and suffered thus far. I found his arguments and support for them to be lacking and horribly suppressive to any contradictory evidence. He seems to start off in the right place with many different ideas, including the argument that all of nature communicates, but then contorts them with his notion that everything is black and white. It is unfortunate that he hopelessly anthropomorphises everything in nature in order to justify why it should continue to exist. It solidifies the idea that its importance is only that which we place on it. I have met Jensen in person, asked him about several problems I had with the book, and remain unimpressed."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I started reading this book believing it to be a memoir about growing up with a brutal, violent father. The author does mention that time very briefly, but it makes up about 5% of the book. The rest of the book is divided into 2 basic themes: 1) Oh my God all the animals are dying and we're polluting the earth and everything is dark and horrible and there's no hope for mankind, blah blah blah; and 2) *I* the author am so much more highly evolved, sensitive and caring that everyone should be trying to emulate ME and then we'd all be fine. He goes on about how he raises his own chickens instead of buying a bucket of drumsticks at the grocery store. Well, sir, I live in an urban area and don't have the space, time, or patience to deal with fowl or livestock of any kind. He paints a ludicrously bleak picture of mankind's future and basically comes across as hysterical and WAY too self-righteous. Also, every paragraph has something in quotation marks, yet he rarely provides a reference (although I admit it MAY be at the end, I'm not quite there yet). One positive about the book: he can really write very, very well, which is why I'm giving this diatribe two stars. But the man needs Prozac stat!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen seems like a good man. Sexually abused as a child, he has dedicated his life to saving the environment, for the sake of the salmon, bears, trees, and us. This is noble. However, his logic at times takes giant leaps, or his facts are distorted.I am a man that wants everything to be proven to me. (Interestingly enough, because of this, I'm Catholic and not an atheist.) However, Jensen does not prove to me that interspecies communication is as real as he thinks it is. He cites a study saying most people believe in it. Out of curiosity, I did a small scale survey of friends and coworkers. I only found one who thinks interspecies communication is natural. They are stated something like, \\"Yes, I believe in interspecies communication. That's how we train dogs. BUT it only works with domesticated animals.\\" Could this fact have been overlooked by Jensen?Jensen then uses the story of his dog his chicken. His dog would frequently put the chicken in his mouth as a toy. Jensen claims that his dog understood that he was to no longer do this to the chicken because Jensen said so. Yet, Jensen admits it took many weeks of yelling at the dog to stop. Isn't it possible the dog was TRAINED and didn't understand the first time?His other errors deal with what has happened when the culture of Europe met people of other races. He specifically attacks Christians for being \\"bad\\" to the natives. I would most certainly agree the Europeans were \\"bad\\" to the natives, but I surely would not say they all were or that this is Christinaity's fault (something he seems to understand little about. Jesus was not the first environmentalist.) Names like Blessed Juniperro Serra comes to mind, who taught irrigation to groups of Native Americans in the west. Or Damien Vesteur, who worked amongst the sick of Hawaii. His attack on Christianity is unfounded.Although the book does raise good points (that we are in serious trouble), his solutions are lacking, and so are his attacks on what the real problem is. Therefore, I cannot recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This is a cool book. I really liked the Dad! What a live wire.

He brings into focus how corrupt this world really is and encourages you to do something about it although is very far gone.If you want to lead an ignorant life, then don't read this, it's not for the faint at heart.

Derrick Jensen is without a doubt my favorite author of all time, and I highly recommend all of his books._A Language Older Than Words_ is written in a unique style which blends Derrick Jensen's personal experiences, conversations with other authors and activists, critical cultural analysis, as well as historical and contemporary events and facts to back up his analysis.If you are concerned with domestic violence, ecological destruction, how civilization is responsible for both, and where we should look for answers, then this is a book for you.No other author has contributed more to the way I view the natural world, civilization, and this culture in particular than Derrick Jensen. I recommend all his books, but I think _A Language Older Than Words_ is probably the best of his books to start with._A Language Older Than Words_ is written in a very non-linear conversational style. What at first appears like unrelated tangents are masterfully woven into a complex vision of how the silencing of the natural world is related to the silencing of the oppressed and abused. Intertwined with those concepts are gut wrenching first hand accounts of both, as well as other attrocities in the culture at large. But while there is much that is dark, the book on a whole shows a hopeful path to reconnection with ourselves and the natural world.I first read _A Language Older Than Words_ a few years ago, and I have continually lent my copy to friends, and recommended it to everyone I know. If there is any hope for humanity, and any hope that the natural world won't be completely decimated, I think some of the wisdom in this book will help guide the way.The reason that I love this book the most is because it is intensely personal in the way that it is written, in the subjects that are discussed, and what the author reveals about himself. Derrick Jensen's cultural criticism and analysis is not some abstract intellectualized theory, but rather put together and put forth in a very down to earth and easy to grasp way. He pulls no punches, and is willing to go against cultural convention when necessary to speak what the pepetrators of abuse (domestic, ecological, economic, social, and political) would have us all remain silent about."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend b/c he said it changed his outlook on life. After reading it I have a lot of feelings about it. Overall i think the book is a must read for any open minded person. Derrick Jensen touches on so many truths w/i both the lives and minds of most, if not all, americans. I felt Jensen's saddness on almost every page, but the great part is that it wasn't a pittying sadness, it was an honest sadness. Anyone who is truelly honest with themselves will get a lot out of this book. However, for the skeptic and the 'intelligent' person, Jensen will seem crazy, and many times, he goes out of the way to paint a picture as if he is crazy.Many times, through frustration and anger, Jensen will attempt to describe what he is feeling. Sometimes it comes out clear, sometimes its on the tip of his tongue. Half the time i knew exactly what he wanted to say, but i felt that he wasn't quite ready to share this information with us. He wasn't far enough along his journey and hasn't quite figured out his feelings on certain matters. Personally, i didn't care. I enjoyed watching him spirtualy grow on paper, it reminds us of our humanity.If you were a layman psychologist, or ignorant, you could blame every crazy idea that Jenson has that isn't agreeable with you, on his abusive history or his 'abnormal' passions. Jenson lets his feelings get ahead of him in a few instances and lists religion as a whole as one of the evil's of society, when clearly it is mans use of religion that is the evil. However, i can't really fault the man for not being 100% well thought out. No one is, and he obviously is speaking through many emotions, one of them being anger.People looking for a perfect book that has no flaws best wait another millenia for one to show up, but for right now, this book is a delectable supplement."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This book is bound to challenge some of your deepest assumptions in life. Derrick's ultimate advice -- &quot;Listen. If you listen carefully enough you will in time know exactly what to do&quot;.Highly recommended reading (with an open mind)."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen's book is both terrifying (NASA is apparently using plutonium to power its rockets, in spite of the risk of an accident on earth) and haunting (the image of a child trying to be invisible in order to avoid a beating.) It breaks your heart. It challenges you. This modern-day Thoreau bares his soul in an attempt to get us to open our eyes, our ears, and our hearts. I hope we have the courage to listen to him."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"You've heard it before: he's the same as the old boss. \\"A Language Older Than Words\\" and \\"The Culture of Make-Believe\\" are two thorough immersions in Derrick Jensen's thought. I was impressed with his depth of research and with the passion of his analysis of our culture, which I believe covers much we have long, to our detriment, denied.After reading some less finished pieces of his on an email discussion list devoted to his work, I found myself less impressed with his writing ability. It appeared the quality and the ability to communicate passion found in his writing may have largely been the contributions of his editor.Subscribing to the email list for a short time, I found Jensen to be at the center of a minor-league cult, complete with sycophants and enforcers. He appeared to be supportive of its growth around him. Soon after I subscribed, a member politely and conversationally asked about some nihilistic notion was summarily barred by the list's moderator (not by Jensen himself, although the moderator clearly deferred to and took cues from him.)I protested. (What I said was \\"Gee, that's not very polite.\\") I soon found myself barred, too. A similar series of events happened to at least two other correspondents of whom I'm aware. I would be surprised if there weren't many others.Jensen appears to be faring poorly in the battle fought by any idealist who becomes accepted--that is, the battle between his true beliefs and his true-believers. He seemed to enjoy being at the center of a company of worshipful fanatics. This is not a position occupied by people whose ideas I find largely acceptable.Those who base themselves in opposition tend to become that which they oppose. Derrick Jensen is a perceptive and creative thinker who has been crippled by his anger and despair. His work is made ineffectual and wasted by its own conclusions: a puerile, unworkable anarchism which, while appealing to the bitter and naive, occupies territory inadequately near to much of what we call the \\"real\\" world. Or worlds.My email list story, of course, may be seen as putting me in the role of \\"disgruntled reader.\\" As you will. In my opinion, Derrick Jensen is the kind of revolutionary who would, the day after his revolution, order most of his followers executed on grounds of insufficient zeal."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This work reads like a transcript of a conversation with a stoned guy sitting on the couch who's worried about the environment. I wanted to like this; I thought Jensen was supposed to be a dangerous, radical thinker who strikes at the bedrock of civilization. The book might as well have been two sentences: \\"We're destroying the planet because we can't recognize it as a living thing that communicates with us and of which we are a part. Let me tell you about this really cool thing that happened with me and some animals one day.\\" Jensen's critique might posture as radical, but his largely humorless tone never rises above mild concern and his language is lackluster. I suspect that might be the point: the book's mediocrity is intentional, seeking the lowest common denominator."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Derrick Jensen's latest, A LANGUAGE OLDER THAN WORDS, is one of the most uncomfortable books I've ever read. As such, I suspect it was also highly uncomfortable for him to write. Its poetic use of words and skilled syntax only serve to emphasize, not obscure, the brutal honesty that he puts forth here.The thesis is a simple one: We are killing the world. It's Jensen's rugged, insightful, and raw analysis of how and why we're doing it that makes me shudder when I read it. Having studied many of these themes before (well-written in books like Daniel Quinn's ISHMAEL), I've not encountered this subject in a way that touches the nerves that Jensen has managed to tap into. Killing the world, after all, is a horrifying thing, and Jensen exposes the horror by shining a bright light on it and analyzing where it comes from.It's a brave book and a bold statement. And one that will be hated by many, particularly those who have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are. The bottom line is this: if you read this book and find yourself affected by it, there's a chance for all of us. If you read this book and wonder what all the hoo-hah is about, you're too far gone and wrapped up in our cultural ways and vision to ever find your way out. If you read this book and find it threatening to your way of life, then you're the enemy, and you need to reconsider which side of the line you stand on.I can't think of a higher compliment to give a book than to wish that I'd had it within me to write it myself. I wish I had this kind of insight and courage, and I'm grateful that Jensen does."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen opens with a series of body blows: \\"Do we think about nuclear devastation, or the wisdom of producing tons of plutonium, which is lethal even in microscopic does well over 250,000 years?\\" Unlikely. \\"Does global warming invade our dreams?\\" Do wet plutonium dreams count? \\"In our most serious moments do we consider that industrial civilization has initiated the greatest mass extinction in the history of the planet?\\" I'm still considering whether to do my kitchen floors in linoleum or hardwood. \\"How often do we consider that our culture commits genocide against every indigenous culture it encounters?\\" That's the way the Darwinism cookie crumbles, right? \\"As one consumes the products manufactured by our culture, is s/he concerned about the atrocities that make them possible?\\" Not if one wants to look cool.Do we ever stop to think about how messed up the world is? The answer, of course, is an overwhelming no. And if we do, it's not for very long. We don't think about these problems, we don't talk about them, and more importantly we don't try and stop them. In Jensen words, \\"We don't think about them, because they are too horrific to comprehend.\\" They are too foreboding and ominous to stomach. They are, in effect, unspeakable.After taking an honest look at the evolution of Western Civilization, Jensen draws the only logical conclusion that can be found: Our culture is insane. We are off our collective rocker. Reason, science, technological advancement and the work-a-day world have only driven us deeper into the carnival of horror and madness. Things are not getting better. They are getting worse with each passing day. Oops, I went and said it.But you still believe in progress. Casually examine the context of your own life. In the last fifty years, \\"sane\\" men have killed 100,000,000 of their \\"sane\\" fellows (perhaps now a few women have gotten in on the action too). Maybe you knew some of them. Perhaps they were family members. Or perhaps it was you that dropped bombs, laid land mines, pulled the fatal trigger. Or perhaps, like me, your father went off to war and came back crazy. War... an aspect of our culture that is now more familiar and ordinary than ever before. (Need I even mention what \\"Dubya\\" is planning right now?)Yet we are all live in work in this web of destruction together. Perhaps your paycheck comes with each fresh clear-cut, or perhaps you simply buy those clear-cut trees in the form of a new house, deck, or furniture. Perhaps you draw energy from a dammed river, helping kill off the last of the salmon. Or perhaps you are more intimately linked to the web of murder, genocide, mass rape, abuse, wage slavery, systemic impoverishment and ecocide that characterize life in the twentieth, and now twenty-first, centuries. Perhaps you are a victim. Perhaps you are an abuser. More than likely, you dabble in both.That said, wherever you fall within the totem of abuse, don't ever admit there is a problem. Don't say with me, \\"My name is j.w.k., and I live and take part in a system that is utterly abusive, coercive and wrong.\\" Rather, keep telling yourself that everything is fine. That is all right. Yes, we'll pull through. Humans are too bright to destroy themselves and the planet.But that is exactly what we are doing... A fourth of all animals slated for extinction - 1000 times the natural rate of extinction. (\\"The government will do something. Anyway, extinction is part of life.\\") A quarter of all American women are raped, and another 19 percent are sexually abused. (\\"They should take self-defense courses and stop wearing such sluttish clothes.\\") Skin, prostate, colon and breast cancers are on the rise from industrial pollution, UV radiation exposure, and poor food quality. (\\"Our scientists will fix it. They'll invent something new and make it all better.\\") 150,000,000 children are enslaved, carrying bricks, chained to looms, or otherwise filling the Wal-Mart's of the Western world. (\\"Work builds character.\\") 32,000 people die of hunger everyday, in a world where one billion are too busy stuffing their faces with steak and marshmallows to care. (\\"I can hardly pay my own bills.\\")Rationalizations... Sometimes witty, sometimes humorous, but always easy, efficient and painless ways to avoid the facing cognitive dissonance. They are the bedrock of our philosophy in a world awash with deprivation, hunger, war, famine, abuse, and ignorance amid waste, plenty and absurdity. Nazi Germany was good at rationalizing, too. Smoke billows up from Auschwitz: \\"It sure is a cloudy, Heinrich, isn't it?\\"\\"When we do allow self-evident truths to percolate past our defenses and into our consciousness, they are treated like so many hand grenades rolling across the dance floor of an improbably macabre party.\\"Today we all live under concentration camp conditions, without even realizing. We also live in a world of hopeless and impending death. The only difference is, we can watch TV and pretend \`it's all good.' As Kunster says in Home From Nowhere, \\"We demand fantasy in order to distract ourselves from the reality of life's tragic nature, and since reality tends to be insistent, we must keep the TVs turned on at all waking hours and at very high volume.\\" Bring on the CNN. Hail Friends, Survivor, and the Comedy Channel.Comedy amid horrors - next to oil it's our best selling commodity. After waking up to apocalypse every morning, one gets used to it. It becomes completely natural. Yet in our more lucid moments, should reality suddenly appear the phantasmagoria of pain, suffering, and hell it truly is, we can deny everything. We can take mental holidays or look the other way; but one thing is becoming increasing clear: We cannot play the denial game much longer. Something will give. If we do not awake from this nightmare of plutonium, rape, genocide and ecocide, we will most certainly perish along with the rest of the species we have consigned to eternal oblivion. Even our scientists now say so - when they can be heard over 500 billion screaming TVs.Don't believe it, though. Don't believe any of it. It's a bunch of lies. Propaganda. Reactionary hype. Jensen is clearly out of his mind. Perhaps he's a communist. Don't listen to him, don't listen to me, nor to anyone else who blackens your rainbows or eclipses your sunshine. Don't buy this book. It might affect you. Go to the mall, plop down in front of the TV, or hit the disco and dance away the thought of this pessimistic review - but do keep an eye out for those grenades.Essential reading.j.w.k."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Oh how I wish I could get every member of Congress, say, or every schoolboard member across the country to read this profound book. Imagine such &quot;leaders&quot; having the sensitivity, insight and values that Derrick Jensen displays in this book! Our world would not be the same. The book has a lot of sadness to it - and why not, since the subject - the pain and destruction being inflicted upon our dear old mother earth and all her children - is a sad one indeed. There's a lot of honesty here, and a willingness to go places the less-courageous would never go. A sad, moving and powerful tale this is, but not a depressing one, for it goes deep into what ails us and our planet home, and that kind of depth is ultimately exhilerating and encouraging. A truly remarkable book - please buy it! In fact, buy as many as you can and give copies to friends and foes alike!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Derrick Jensen has written this book from his own, and the world's, soul. What starts as a &quot;feel-good&quot; book on interspecies communication becomes a searing examination of his own silencing as a child (his father viciously abused him, his mother, and his siblings), and his perspective widens to encompass the silencing of all life on earth through the murderous practices of industrial, religious, military, and political institutions through history. Jensen indisputably links individual suffering and violence with that of other life forms -- and of the Earth that we continue to ravage in our denial of pain. This book is a masterpiece; it is agonizing to read -- yet hopeful...though in a most cautious manner. To anyone daring to awaken to the signs in and around us, time is running out for us humans to change our suicidal and ecocidal behaviour. Jensen dares us to face our pain and transform it into loving action on behalf of Life. I consider him a prophet. He spares us nothing in his passion for healing. We must pass through raging agony in order to wake up and shake ourselves free of our denial and inertia -- but the pain we (and everything else that lives) will feel if we don't change our ways will be indescribably worse.I also recommend Joanna Macy and Molly Young Brown's book, &quot;Coming Back to Life,&quot; which gives us specific practices that individuals, groups, and communities can do to take loving action. WE CAN DO THIS -- and we need to do it together.Please -- read this book and act with it!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This is one of the most profoundly moving books I've ever read. I absolutely encourage everyone to buy it and read it, over and over. Never before have I read words that so courageously challenge our assumptions about the way we live while simultaneously awakening a profoundly intimate connection with our souls. Jensen weaves a story of abuse, love, and impassioned relationship with family, friends, nature, culture, and self. The son of a wealthy attorney in western Montana, Derrick Jensen reveals heart-wrenching details of his own childhood, and uses these experiences as a springboard to talk about the culture at large. In a provocative weaving of his own experience, critical research, and folk stories, Jensen makes clear the relationship between the intimate atrocities of domestic violence and the larger atrocities of ecological destruction. Yet, he promises that when we begin to change our way of living, on both personal and cultural levels, we will find a whole world of connection waiting for us. It is a world of joy and pain and love and sorrow, but most deeply of all, connection. With masterful skill, awareness, and insight, Jensen's hard-hitting yet poetic writing style forces readers into an acute awareness-and deep experience--of the connected relationships between our personal lives and the world. This book is a guide for living and should be read by anyone interested in being alive."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"If I could afford it, I would GIVE copies of this book away. I believe it is that important. If polls are to be believed, the majority of Americans say they are concerned about the environment, but few of us manage to live up to our convictions. Jensen's book is so compelling that has the power to push readers from complacency to activism in a quiet, but forceful manner.What is truly unique about this book is the manner in which Jensen discusses his own journey to personal activism. He spent years numbing himself to the sexual abuse inflicted upon him by father. He sees the same processes at work in our destructive relationship to the environment. Learning to treat each othe with greater respect and learning to appreciate the natural living environment, he argues, are irrevocably linked."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"...you're prepared to confront your deepest self along with the earth, politics, religion, science, and to risk changing your inner and outer self at last and for good, then don't read this book. Jensen spares no one and nothing in his blistering attack on our blind-deaf-dumb-unfeeling selves and culture. If on the other hand, you'd like to find the wonder of yourself and the earth and your fellow creatures (human and non-), then this is the book for you. I promise you, nobody comes out of this book the same. It's a painful, wondrous, moving experience. It confirms your worst fears but at the same time leaves you understanding you are not alone in your feelings about our destructive culture. Knowing that in itself makes the read worthwhile. Thank you, Derrick Jensen."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Did the stars speak to you, or the trees? I grew up by a lake, and at night in the summertime I slept under the stars. The bullfrog songs lulled me to sleep. Connection to the natural and spiritual world, and to my sibling, kept me alive through difficulty. Derrick Jensen calls this book &quot;a prayer of thanksgiving.&quot; He's walking the ground that Richard Rhodes walked in _A Hole in the Heart of the World_, seeking meaning and purpose beyond the violence and pain of his childhood. This book had a profound effect on me, not unlike Viktor Frankl's _Man's Search for Meaning_. Derrick Jensen seeks to stop genocide and ecocide, and perceives family violence as a microcosm of the larger violence. Something meaningful exists in the pages of this book, a truth beyond words. If you read intuitively, you will find it for yourself, within yourself, and you will begin to think of what you can do to bring some part of misery to an end. Not everyone wants to protect a tree for two years like Julia Butterfly Hill, or spend a lifetime advocating with the energy of Audre Lorde -- but we can begin by erasing amnesia and intentional ignorance. (Just read what he says about schooling, pages 103, 104!) I believe that if the earth is going to survive, more of us will need to become aware of the interconnectedness here. As Meir Berliner said, &quot;When the oppressor gives me two choices, I always take the third.&quot; This book will open thoughts to those third choices."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This book is categorized as a memoir and a philosophy of nature, but it is much more like a hike in the Rockies. There are places in the book of great, sweeping beauty, and places of clear-cut frustration. There are places where you want to cry out as if to warn unseen bears that you are near and you don't want them to threaten you. There are places where you must slow down, or stop for a rest and get some water. At the end, there is a deep satisfaction of having spent the energy to take such a hike.Descartes said, &quot;I think, therefore I am,&quot; and our author found this quote absurd and elitist. If Jensen could be quoted to say, &quot;I think, therefore I write,&quot; those who have read this book would agree. The source of such deep thinking is deep feeling and deep pain, however this writer balances these feelings with humor and hope. This book will ask questions of you in both subtle and obvious ways. The questions are difficult, but you need to hear them. Answering them will be like a steep hike up a forested mountainside. Will you see the forest through the trees?Was I made aware of this book by listening for &quot;a language older than words?&quot; I think so. To potential readers, listen to your heart. It will tell you to not only read but to think along with this book."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This book is an incredible brave affirmation to all of us living its fury, pain, passion and love. Here is a voice that brings together so many aspects of our lives...the ones we are usually told to see a psychiatrist about! e.g.'getting outraged,speaking out,( you are so full of anger, don't you think...?), being embraced by trees, feeling the mussels die after half a minute in the pot. Personally it confirms for me that these as well as my almost daily tirades against blatant insanity, are core to my being able to be here at all.What I especially like about this book is that I sense that Dereck knew that the writing of it is its own solution, the brave stark acknowledgement that 'this is how it is for (hopefully) so many of us.... you are not alone out there.Can I dare hope that its writing signals that the number of humans passionately seaching for ways to create an unfettered way of life out of the current destruction and insanity is growing? that some kind of critical mass may just arrive in time to change 'globalisation' into something creative and life affirming?...the fact that Dereck has found a ready audience. It has also above all convinced me that the outraged, angry, sensitive, clear-headed brazen child that I live with inside myself, has been, and will remain a saving Grace.This is a profound extraordinary tour de force all the more because it so naturally spoke to all the most important parts of me that it does not feel separate. Because of its depth and power, it is a true celebration."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Excellent book.

However, I fault Jensen on the following areas:- Jensen makes incessant references to 'our culture' (which, according to him extends five millennia back to Gilgamesh in ancient Mesopotamia!) and expects the reader to know what he is referring to, as if it can be known a priori what our culture means. Our culture consists, in my opinion, of many cultures, countercultures, and subcultures and to dismiss everything that has happened in Western (and even non-western) societies as happening in one culture is just plain ignorant.- Jensen relentlessly attacks the scientific method but ends up being a 'scientist of convenience' by talking about climate change, deforestation, species loss, etc. all of which only make sense in terms of science and statistics. For all that he can worship personal experience and the anecdotal, all of the issues he is decrying about 'our culture' presuppose that the scientific evidence that backs them up is in fact sound.- Jensen is extremely self-righteous and two-dimensional. Apparently, we readers are such ignorant sots that he feels the need to pepper his first chapter with such precautions as \\"it's probably better if you don't read my book...none of it is true.\\" What does Jensen think? That his writing is so profound, moving and inspirational that we can't handle what he has to say? This profoundly irksome, self-righteous style is neither compelling nor engaging. It's as if you're either with him and the do-gooders (indigenous people, women, children, the Earth) or you are with his father and the bad guys (Weyerhauser, Richard Dawkins, Descartes, Bacon, et al.).- Jensen distorts and (probably intentionally) misinterprets Descartes and many other philosophers, saying \\"it would be easy for me to hate Descartes, Bacon, et al. but they had an entire culture to support them.\\" The absurdity of hating people who've been dead for 350 + years, and of judging 17th century thinkers by 20th century values cannot be over-exaggerated."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"A friend of mine once created a kind of collage that said, &quot;As I am transformed, the world is tranformed.&quot; I admire the ideal expressed in my friend's collage, but I have always believed that while it is important to transform ourselves, the problems in the world and with our species require far deeper resolutions than individual work, such as meditating, projecting love, peace, etc.Thus I do agree in spirit with a lot of what Mr. Jensen says in his 370+page book. I think that the problems in the world can only worsen if things go on as they are, but that is just my opinion. On the other hand, so far the world has gone on, despite one prediction after another, ad infinitum, by ecologically-minded people, religious extremists, etc. Thus I can only conclude that the earth and humanity are far more resilient than the predictors of doom are willing to admit.Mr Jensen is not just an environmental extremist, he takes extreme positions on just about every facet of what he discusses. In fact the word extreme is really tame for many of the stands taken in this book. The correct term is more like in-your-face, and that might be a tame word also.The author does have a very good handle on the causes of many of the problems in the world and with the human species. To name but a few of his points, he cites the lack of love, fear, coercion, oppression/torture of women, minorities, native peoples world-wide, and animals, and the overvaluing of money along with the obsession/overemphasis of producing (unnecessary) material goods. He discusses these points insightfully and thoroughly, and he very deftly analyses the deleterious effects of Newtonian-Cartesian reductionism on the social sciences. Also, people do live in denial about what is going on. Few question much of anything. &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; is very relevant to our times.Yet to me the book fails badly. On the one hand, on p. 142 Jensen correctly states that &quot;life is untidy&quot; and talks about embracing life's contradictions. But his real agenda is to trash everyone and everything that doesn't agree with his worse-than-extreme positions, so later (p. 198) we get a simplistic quote from Victor Frankl that either we are decent or indecent people. I will give one of countless examples I could of Mr. Jensen's extremisms based on this black or white illogic. To the author, if you are a decent, hardworking &quot;wage slave,&quot; trying to raise a family, you support capitalism, you are trashing the planet and oppressing the have-nots, and thus you are &quot;bad.&quot; His extremism reaches absurd heights, such that on p. 371, as he is wrapping up the book, we read, &quot;We are, of course, already dead. There is no hope.&quot; This is nonsense.I do not have enough space to discuss Mr. Jensen's personal pain. It is tragic, there is no doubt about that. Yet Mr. Jensen seems to feel that his pain is not only unique (it isn't), but also gives him the right not only to judge humanity as a failure, and furthermore to paint himself as some sort of Messiah carrying that burden. It doesn't work. And while I do not totally buy into the New Age dictum that we always create our own reality, in Mr. Jensen's case I have no doubt that it applies far more than he would believe.I also do not want to discuss the title of the book, because to me it is maybe a tertiary theme to what the book really delves into. I will say that I do not doubt at all that interspecies communication exists, &quot;without words,&quot; and that sensitive people can pick up things from the earth and non-humans.One question that is asked repeatedly I do want to answer. On p. 237 we read, &quot;Where do we look for ultimate responsibility...?&quot; I recommend the book, &quot;And The Truth Shall Set You Free,&quot; by David Icke. You will get answers, though they may not be *the* answers.&quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; comes highly recommended by the author of &quot;Diet For A Small Planet&quot; and other respected authors of alternative books. Personally I would recommend this often overstated diatribe only to deeply wounded souls looking for large-scale scapegoats. As for caring and aware people who are trying to live decent lives, please consider my review and the other reviews and decide for yourselves."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I want to thank Derrick for writing this inspiring book. I give him a lot of credit for his honesty; for the ideas contained inside are connected with so many aspects of his life, what is going on in America and on Planet Earth. He brings attention to practices and thought patterns that many people have chosen to ignore.After reading this, I began to practice listening to the language of Nature even more, and all of the things that she is communicating to me.This is an excellent read!!!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Derrick Jensen is a master storyteller who skillfully weaves his own heartbreaking and heart-mending experiences together with a courageous and careful analysis of modern civilization and it's many causes and casualties. Jensen explores some of humankind's deepest and most personal questions and leads each of us to find our own answers by empowering and challenging us to simply turn to the natural world and ask. If you can put this book down, you will pick it up again (and again and again). You will be changed."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"If you can't handle the truth, then don't bother. If you demand excellence and honesty from your literature, then don't hestitate to read this. For those of us who know in our hearts that there is something dreadfully wrong with 'the way it is' in our human world, this book is crucial to developing the understanding that we, like the Lorax, must &quot;speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues!&quot; To speak for the other species we must first listen and before we can listen we must accept that such a thing is possible. This book goes a long way in breaking the pattern of denial which has kept our hearts and minds frozen in a hideous world where the only thing we seem to attribute sentience and importance to is other humans, and what these other humans keep saying over and over are outright lies about who we are and what we are doing. Please read this book and know that beyond all these lies and the destruction they try to hide there is another world with another language where the few remaining indigenous tribes and all the other species we haven't destroyed yet are still willing to welcome us back and forgive us for taking so long to admit when we're wrong."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"My mother, a librarian, brought this book to my attention. She always fought my tendencies toward anti-establishment ideals. However, she always presented me with antiestablishment writings. Go figure. I have to agree with the first critique of this writing. It is a disturbing writing that culminates in a positive way. This is important: IT IS A DISTURBING WRITING; this writing is not for the faint of heart. I believe that humans seek that with which they can agree, and you can agree with this stuff, or be damned. Interesting writing."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Read this book! It has tons of information, many that we would wish we had never known. But the truth is there, and no matter how silent we are about it, it won't change the facts. Rape is out there, child abuse is out there, the destruction of our planet is out there - we must aknowledge what is happening to our culture and fight for changes.This book will serve as guide for understanding who we are, where we are going, and our place in the world. I wish that everyone would read this book, its impossible to be and act in the same way after reading it. Do yourself a favor and buy this book! And lets not sit and wait for changes, lets fight for them. If we listen to ourselves we'll know that changes in our culture are not only necessary, but imperative. Let's begin it NOW!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"There were times when reading &quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; when I wanted to shout passages from Derrick Jensen's book as loudly as I could. Surely everyone needs to hear this message: we are destroying the planet. We must stop. But beyond this &quot;message&quot; also lies another revelation, one that has changed my life forever: all living things have something to say, we just don't do a very good job of listening. Everyone knows that talking to plants helps them to grow, right? Well, then it should be no great leap of understanding to realize that plants can help us grow, too, and not just by producing oxygen... I recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to increase their awareness about the world in which we inhabit, but to which we pay too little attention."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I found this book through Daniel Quinn's book list, and I didn't waste much time in reading it.Although maybe more radical than Quinn and less science based than Richard Dawkins, the emotional cry of this book cannot be denied. Sheer rage, love and honesty that scream out of these pages is so overwhelming you'll have to be hard pressed to put the book down, or like my mother, to read it at all.I was pretty sensitive as a child and I had to make &quot;walls&quot; and &quot;barriers&quot; in my mind to avoid being physically overrun by our culture. So my idol became (except my mom and dad) the coolest and coldest character ever - Mr. Spock. Logic with no feelings. To the max. In doing so, I became the prime mental example of our culture, yelling &quot;I want more and I want it now&quot; although not really believing it.This book is for everyone who suspects there is something more than industrial consumerism that eats away our very planet.I don't agree with all opinions in this book (especially about Richard Dawkins' work), but I began to have converstions with animals and plants. Insane? Maybe, but they said the same for those who said the Earth wasn't flat...This is no easy read! But it is, after all, a very rewarding one."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Awesome, brave, chilling, provocative, challenging...Mr. Jensen has significantly changed the way I look at our world, my community, my direct and indirect interaction with all life. This should be read by everyone interested in saving our planet -it rings with common sense and in a unique and personal voice challenges each and every one of us to stop and listen...and demands of each and every one of us to ACT before it is too late. I will be sharing this book with as many people as I can; I will tell people about this book; I hope every library in North America stocks this book. Profound...cannot wait to read more of Mr. Jensen's thoughts. Buy it, then buy a second copy to lend."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen reflects about our culture. As he notes, silencing and violence are common behaviors that provide the powerful their power and the victims their invisibility. Jensen presents a view of our society that is sometimes difficult to accept, but that can't be ignored. When we silence nature, ourselves or someone else, it is often done violently. What do we lose in that silence in terms of our understanding of the world or each other? I found this book moving and enlightening. I have a better understanding of the beauty that we have lost by silencing the world and the ugliness that we have gained through our violent encounters with the world and one another."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"One doesn't have to always agree with Jensen's arguments to get a lot out his book. Indeed, his calls for dismantling civilization may provoke dismay and be misconstrued by some. Even so, this is an extremely well-written book, and endlessly thought-provoking. It's free-flowing style and rather loose organization actually make it easier, rather than more difficult, to read. Jensen's use of deeply personal and often tragic experiences to illustrate some of his points and/or back is arguments, far from being pathetic, gives this book far more weight than it would otherwise have. In light of recent events, there is one disarmingly simple statement he makes - and a point that essentially underlies the entire text - which I simultaneously find particularly troubling, meaningful and significant: \\"Things don't have to be the way they are.\\""},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Personally, the books I enjoy the most force me to question my belief system and perception of how the world operates. This book does just that, and rather elegantly. If a friend recommended this book and attempted to explain the main premise I would have laughed in their face...an environmental activist that lives on a farm and has conversations with animals. But this book affirms my notion that you can't constantly put people in a box. The author learns many lessons and you get to share his most intiment thoughts along his journey. Before I attempt to review the book or deconstruct a few issues I had with the book, let me first explain how I came across \\"A Language Older Than Words\\".Because it came up in a discussion with a peer and out of morbid curiosity, I recently read Ted Kaczynski's manifesto. His call for a \\"revolution\\" against the current system, a.k.a modern industrialization is the general theme shared by Derrick Jensen. And this book helps lay out a solid case against mankind. As taboo as the subject is in most circles, it is something that most people can agree upon; We are simply headed in the wrong direction as a culture. We collectively chose to ignore events in the past and rationalize the reasons we destroy our planet and oppress \\"weaker\\" cultures. We value production over life.When I normally hear about the horrible acts committed everyday in this world I stop and think the world can often be a cold place. This book is Derrick Jensen's case that it doesn't have to be.This book actually frustrated me because it may be the first book in which I cannot articulate the author's main viewpoint to friends and co-workers nearly as passionately as the author. However, I enjoy reading it and discovering and re-discovering. One moment he is writing about horrible incidents he experienced as a child and the next moment he is discussing how Nazi's rationalized the acts they committed against the Jews. You would be safe to assume that the author makes wild claims in an attempt to connect the two incidents, and how they both (in their own way) contribute to the downfall of societies. However, he creates a pretty solid case for the slow destruction of mankind and recognizes the vulnerability in his writing.Instead of ending with healthy solutions mankind can take to preserve the environment and change the system he recommends just sitting back and watching society crumble."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Words cannot do this book justice, but let me say that &quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read, and by &quot;best&quot; I mean: its message is important; it is memorable; it is sincere/authentic; and the prose is excellent (Jensen's story/message is conveyed artistically). This book should be required reading for human beings. National Book Award, Pulitzer, you name it: there is no award this book does not deserve. In fact, there is no award worthy of this book."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"A Language Older Than Words was a life-altering experience for me. I have been, like others, deeply concerned for the world since I can remember. And I knew that I felt an incredibly deep sadness, an intense loss, creeping towards despair...but I did not know how to articulate why. This book articulates why. This book illuminates in precise and heart-rending prose the inextricable connections between cycles of abuse on personal and global scales. Often incredibly painful to read, this book tops my list of books the entire privileged world should be exposed to. Jensen's talent for weaving the horrors of the world together into a plain-as-day picture of the destruction humanity has wrought, and continues to wreak, on the natural world and each other, is unparalleled in my opinion. And his bravery in his frank retelling of the abuse he suffered as a child is staggering. I so often run out of words trying to say why I think this book, and indeed the rest of Jensen's work, is so important. Read it for yourself and find out. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I have always felt a spiritual connection to the earth, and this book puts reason to it - in a logical, coherent way. I was so glad to read insightful, intelligent writing from someone who is not blinded by industry, advertising, money, STUFF... etc. The premises are easy to understand, and backed up with referenced facts. Ironically, I let a liberal ex-boyfriend borrow this book, and he called it BS.. funny because we never connected anyway. Then I talked with someone else about it and was so glad to hear he understood the book and the fact that only since civilization has come around, people have been disconnected from that which keeps them alive - the living, breathing earth. This book is about the relationships between people and their landbases, and the language of this most important balance."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I can't go on enough about this book. It should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government, Wall Street and industry CEOs.The writing is excellent. Many of its passages read like prayers. I can't think of topics and subjects more important than those Jensen writes about -- our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth.Jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas, BUT instead of ruining it, I think the non-linear trajectory of his book actually enhances his message.The first half of the book where he discusses problems can be hard-hitting and difficult to get through certain parts of it, BUT please hold fast through the end. It is worth it.Jensen's eloquence and wisdom are best when he is also discussing answers, or possibilities, as it were.www.corimorenberg.com"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"And if you're not on my list, be well advised that this may be the most important book you will ever read."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"By exploring his traumatic experience of childhood sexual abuse as a metaphor for the damage being inflicted on the planet, Jensen interweaves ecofeminist theory with eco-anarchism, a fusion of Susan Griffin, Chellis Glendinning and Starhawk with a heavy dose of John Zerzan. Though the subject matter of the book is grim (global warming, deforestation, femicide, ecocide, rape), it is ultimately a book about restoration, the restoration that comes from struggle, commitment and love. Reading this book will make you cry, will make you angry, will make you act. It will remind you that for every bird that disappears, a part of our humanity also disappears. To heal ourselves, we must heal the earth."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Through my lifetime up until my senior year of high school, I knew something was wrong with the actions that were taking place around me. I couldn't pin point it though, because of the way I was raised to reason situations. A teacher of mine recommended this book to me and I havent been the same since. This is the BEST introduction to the ideas of (in my opinion) the greatest and most important writers of our time. I have read all of Derrick Jensen's work and this one helped me come to terms with the importance of communication with the natural world. I would recommend this bood to everybody."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Derrick Jensen has put his finger on the elusive ability to pinpoint on many different levels exactly what is wrong with our culture.

It openly addresses current problems in society without any rose coloring."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I purchased this book expecting something entirely different- I thought I would be reading about the toils and troubles we've inflicted on mother earth and how we can change.

Good book!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Wow, what a book. Jansen takes what he has learned as an abused child and draws some extremely valuable lessons about our culture and society. This book has changed my life. I'd recommend it for everyone on the planet."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Rarely has a single book changed my life. Mr. Jensen's life story and perspective have changed mine. Particularly insightful is his analysis of our western culture as based in a \\"culture of death\\". Our quote civilization unquote seems hell bent on destroying the very planet on which we are intimately connected and dependent. Jensen has convinced me that everything about the way we live is geared toward destroying the very home in which we live. What is different about his analysis compared to others stating similar concerns is that he encourages his readers to change their lives first and not give up hope in the face of the depressing facts of our own stupidity and ignorance of who we are. We can realize our intimate connection with the earth and all that is in it if we just stop and listen."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Jensen fearlessly tackles the ubiquity of violence within our culture, correctly concluding that without the destructive forces of silence and apathy, the pervasiveness of violence could not exist. He doesn't pretend to offer solutions which is something I respect. All too often with this subject matter, we are given \\"options\\" that are really just band-aids. They refuse to address the roots of the failures that result when a culture holds nothing sacred.This is a brave book. Jensen holds nothing back. I imagine him returning to the darkest spaces of his life, pulling that ugliness from the trenches and pushing it forth to create one of the most lucid accounts of our culture. I was often reminded of Hannah Arendt's \\"...Banality of Evil\\" (which he references) and the necessity of coming to terms with the destructive forces within ourselves before we can even begin to battle the larger forces that are intent on destroying Mama Earth and any chances of a life of decency.The creative process is often referred to as giving birth and Jensen definitely gives birth in \\"A Language Older than Words\\". This book resonated with me in ways I cannot express but it has made its way to the all-time favorites list. As a voracious reader, with thousands of books under my belt, that's one helluva compliment."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"i needed this book for a class that i was enrolled in at a community college. i found the book hard to get into. to me it wasn't interesting. order shipped fine. good condition."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"I'll try to make this short. This is a wonderful book, but it's not perfect. It comes from the long tradition of idealism born in the American West which includes such figures as Josiah Royce, Ezra Pound and John Steinbeck (though its subect matter is like none of those writers'). It is indiscretely confessional in its personal tone. It is violently radical in its political tone. And it is unapologectically idealistic. Jensen doesn't so much offer any practical solution to the problems he describes as he proposes theoretical responses. It makes the book an interesting philosophical statement rather than a manual for action. Stoics and realists will truly hate it, if they get past the Preface. That reminds me: The first chapter, called \\"Silencing\\" is the best in the book and will (or should) knock the breathe out of you. Generally, the writing is lyrical and has the ability to make you swoon. Jensen's creation is so original in that it combines lyricism with propaganda. Most of the world's great revolutionaries were far too scientific to pull off a style even remotely close to this. Read it, but keep your head about you."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Denial is such a tricky thing to talk about. It is designed to protect us from truths we absolutely see exist but find too frightening or upsetting to our world view, our sense of safety and stability, to acknowledge.We know they are there.We look away, and only talk with others who wont mention anything that makes us feel or think about the horror, the pain and the fear we live with daily in our insane, abusive culture of destruction and denial. And anyone who talks about the truth, who causes us to see, must be silenced.Derrick Jensen will not be silenced.A Language Older Than Words is an intelligent and unrelenting exploration of the patterns of abuse and denial in our culture that extend into every aspect of our lives, our relationships with each other, with women, children, and the natural world. Jensen shouts where others fear to whisper, and validates our natural knowledge that we are an inseparable part of the living world, and our culture of denial is silencing and killing everything.This courageous, from the gut, truth telling rips down those layers of denial revealing how we have been taught to fool ourselves and how much of the experience of being human we have lost. Because in order to ignore the suffering (our own and that of most of the other creatures on the planet) we must also shut ourselves off from our own experience and the wonder, joy, complexities, and ecstasy of living in relationship with others and the natural world. Jensen's inspiring writing offers a way back to fully exploring and experiencing our own lives.A Language Older Than Words is a passionate and poetic catalyst that will blast open your perceptions and give you courage to face your denial and abandon your fears. It is a gift of welcoming us back to what it truly means to be human, to be alive, to have relationship with all living things. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a springboard to so much further understanding, experience, and discovery. Jensen is truly one of the most important philosophers writing today.Don't wait another day to read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"\\"Every morning I wake up and ask myself whether I should write a book or blow up a dam,\\" writes Jensen in his opening pages. \\"Every day I tell myself I should continue to write. Yet I'm not always convinced I'm making the right decision.\\" This is the agony of an environmentalist and a pacifist who has come to realize that he's been throwing snowballs at army tanks. While he debates and negotiates with the polluters, the developers and the industrialists, they continue their destructive activities virtually unimpeded. How long, wonders Jensen, can we afford to go on being pacifists?\\"Scientists study, politicians and businesspeople lie and delay, activists write letters and press releases, I write books and articles, and still the salmon die. It's a cozy relationship for all of us except the salmon.\\"Jensen, whether he realizes it or not, is the philosopher-king of the deep ecology movement. In this provocative and insightful book, he shows us that deep ecology is truly deep, not the shallow feel-good wishful thinking of the New Agers who too often represent the movement. Drawing on personal experience, anecdotal evidence, historical examples, and philosophical thought from the early sophists to Descartes, Jensen helps his readers peer over the tops of our cultural eyeglasses. He invites us to gaze at the world unfiltered by our shared myths and illusions about human progress. The earth is dying. We are the cause. We can stop it, but first we will have to begin talking about some subjects we've all agreed never to talk about.One of Jensen's most effective tools is the use of his personal experience as an abused child as both a metaphor and an object lesson on the process we all go through in order to distance ourselves from the pain we endure and the damage we do simply by living in a \\"civilized\\" industrial society. Yet Jensen manages to open our eyes without using a pry bar. With self-deprecating humor, he chats with us in the amiable tones of an old friend sharing a beer on the back porch. This is powerful stuff delivered in an affable package. Highly recommended reading. So dangerous it could change your life-and maybe even your behavior."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"It's not often that I can say that a book has truly changed my life. Perhaps twice before. One was the first book I ever read which taught me that the Airplane was in the blue sky followed by a kind of realization that I was in fact, reading. One was a book I read when I was twelve which made me realize that a sixteen year old boy in New York City escaping from a Boarding School might think and feel the same way I did. And the one that I just got through reading. A Language Older than Words has changed my perception of my perceptions. It has made me realize that I can hear Spiders, Birds, Trees and I am now working on Lettuce! That the world around me is constanly communicating to me in ways that I had not allowed myself to understand before.

This is one of the bravest books I've ever read, and as a writer myself I commend the courage it took to write it. Never have I been more moved, more affirmed in my feelings, more outraged (positively) and more -- full.This is what we need to know, what the world must comprehend. It is the most truthful, the clearest mirror ever held up to our culture and it is long overdue. We must look. We must see. Mr. Jensen demands this of us without apology, without sugar, but with the necessary brutal honesty.I don't know how you did it, Mr. Jensen, but somehow, even without offering a definitive answer, you managed to leave me inspired. I closed the book and cried for a long while. Out of sadness, fear, and oddly enough, out of a deep and meaningful hopefuleness. I've told everyone I know this book must be read, felt and passed on.I cannot commend you enough, cannot thank you enough, and could not respect you more for your willingness to go through the journey of writing this book so that we might read it and remember our lives.Would that I could shout it from the rooftops!Do not miss this -- it's a rollercoaster ride, and I did, indeed, go through every emotion conceivable while reading it. And I would not trade the experience for anything in the world.Godspeed!"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"As I travel my own path in my life I find myself asking many of the same questions that Derrick asks himself and society in this book. My own frustrations found voice and there was a great sense of relief that perhaps a change in our culture may yet be on the way before we destroy all the things truly sacred in our lives. If only we could see that which is sacred apart from that which is in front of us. Highest recommendations if you are looking for the interrelationships of life. Deeply philisophical and bound to create more questions than answers. Yet without asking the right questions the answers are irrelavent. With warning as this book may change your soul, it did mine - and though the path is somewhat frightening - at the same time many burdens have been lifted from my spirit.Some of my favorite passages:&quot;I know that beneath the fear and hatred, beneath the urge to control and destroy, far beneath the scarred shells that protect and define us, people are good. Deep down our needs are simple: apart from food, shelter, and clothing ther are the needs to love and be loved, for community, to be open to the world at large and for it to be open to us, to affect and be affected, to understand and be understood, to hear and be ehard, to accept and be accepted. it is only when we fear that these needs won't be met that we grasp at them, and in the grasping lose and chance of satisfying them. Love controlled is not love; just as sex demandes is rape and acceptance expected is subservience. Bu if we fear, that demand we must, for to fear these needs will not be met is to fear for our lives as surely as if our lack of love and acceptance were instead the absence of food and water. With these deep needs unsatisfied we waste away, shrivel and dies as from hunger or thirst. We die, but we go on surviving. the search for that which should have been there all along continues, but we can no longer recieve it, nor even recognize it.&quot; - P 98&quot;For nearly as long as I can remember, I've had the habit of asking people if they like their jobs. Over the yearst, about 90 percent - with the exception of my bosses at the NOAA - have said no. As I sat bored those days at my computer, I began to wonder what that percentage means, both socially and personally. I wondered what it does to each of use to spend the majority of our waking hours doing things we'd rather not do, wishing we wher outside or simply elsewhere, wishing we were reading, thinking, making love, fishing, sleeping, or simply having time to figure out who the hell we are and what the hell we're doing. We never have enough time to catch up - I never knew what that mean, but it always felt as though I were running downhill, my body falling faster than my legs could carry me - enough time to try to understand what we want to do with the so very few hours each of us are given.&quot; - PP 108-109&quot;We are the relationships we share, we are that process of relating, we are, whether we like it or not, permeable - physically, emotionally, spiritually, experientially - to our surroundings&quot;...&quot;I am only so beautiful as the character of my relationships, only so rich as I enrich those around me, only so alive as I enliven those I greet.&quot; - PP 126-127"},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"Jensen has been awe-fully, inspiringly awake, and he modestly submits his report on reality. And believe me, once you read this book you will decide you have not been awake at all; you have been in a trance, or sleep-walking. We are not fully aware of the world around us. For he reminds us that we communicate with animals in a special language. It is an unsettling truth, and you know it to be so. We have been ignoring animals, and certainly have never thought to reach out to them. We feel some stirring in their presence, but we are not quite sure what it means. Jensen explains exactly what it means. But then he expands his notion. We haven't even been attuned to other people, or the Earth. He graphically explains how our destructiveness silences our communication. We have to suppress a child so that we can molest him. We have to trivialize a culture so that we can bomb it. We have to ignore the Earth so we can despoil it. A moving thesis and an absorbing read. In the process, Jensen describes in detail the experience of being sexually attacked by his father. Probably the best book I have read in two years; on a par with The Goddess and the Alphabet by Schlain, although a completely different kind of book. He makes stunning points because they flow naturally out of his personal experience of reality. Schlain makes almost the same argument, but by arraying a lot of information drawn from five thousand years of written culture. Make this the next book you buy.

As we witness the world being murdered before our eyes, we urgently need to learn to listen, before it's too late.In all of Derrick Jensen's work, he offers brilliant insights about why civilization is killing the planet and what we can and must do about it. Many people have described this book as \\"heartbreaking,\\" and that's true -- it breaks through the surface of hearts hardened by denial, confronts us with despair, then leads us carefully to the other side of that despair into healing and the possibility of conscious action. It combines investigation and well-reasoned political analysis with an engaging personal style and rare honesty that together offer the reader both intellectual understanding, and just as importantly, a deep emotional comprehension.After reading this book I immediately bought three copies to give to relatives, in the hope that they would be strengthened by it as I have been, to break the silence, join the world, and stop the horrors."},{"Title":"Language Older Than Words","review":"W.S.

As is the case with most great lines, my memory absorbed them: I would one day understand. Slowly, as a result of more paradigm shifts in my thinking than I care to count, that day has come. At the heart of A Language Older Than Words lies a philosophical treatise: if we as a species desire to survive, we must liberate ourselves from the constraints of rational thought. Such a notion will startle the covenanted rational man, cause him to seize up, to tighten his grip upon his notion of reality--&quot;I think therefore, I am;&quot; &quot;Not trees but sense-contents of trees.&quot; He must find the closest possible means by which to descredit the source of the words that have disturbed him. He will say, drawing on rhetoric of Psych 101--&quot;The author is acting out.&quot;--or Logic 208--&quot;This book contains a contradiction, therefore it is not real book.&quot; He does so in order to protect that which he holds true. He puts the book down and selects another which will congratulate him for being who he is, what he is a part of.This book does not congratulate anyone. In its Brechtian diatribes on the post-treaty Gulf War devastation, the multinational melange present on any and all plates at supper time, the genocide of native populations committed by colonists (corporate and otherwise), and the eradication of countless species populations, as well as the author's own experiences with violence (at others' hands as well as his own), A Language Older Than Words documents the crimes of rational man, of Western Culture, of America.In Jensen's writing, the personal is political. His logic is associative, rather than rational. In these ways, the book itself practices the very lessons it conveys. If humans will survive on this planet, they must alter their concept of logic. There can be no more hiding behind judgement of others (&quot;The author's acting out...&quot;) in order to facilitate the very mechanism of silencing that Jensen challenges on every single page. There can be no more isolating of one's personal experience from the sea of all human events. No tidepool will go unrecalled.What is writ large in world events is writ small in all our lives. Jensen invites anyone who has chosen to believe they are happy and whole to reconsider if they disagree. He asks us to question why we consume so much and love so little, why we destroy so much and devalue creation? Once the reader considers these questions, they will feel that everything they &quot;know&quot; and &quot;hold true&quot; quakes in the presence of the answers. The shifts in thinking this book can lead to are frightening. But Jensen holds us to him. In the epilogue he draws us near--the reader feels they are being blessed with strength, confidence, and deep human love. &quot;Godspeed,&quot; he whispers. And the reader wants to weep. We realize that, as the poet asks God to do in John Donne's Holy Sonnet 14, Jensen has &quot;battered [our] heart&quot; in order to let us subvert reason and believe once again with our entire being something we feel shyly to be true.I am reminded most strongly of Sojourner Truth's &quot;Speak truth to power with love.&quot; In Jensen's &quot;Language&quot; and words, the reader experiences the execution of Truth's charge. From a lesser writer, the ideas conveyed might read like hate mail to corporations, patriots, and true believers of any kind--and those who have yet to explore the questions Jensen asks will dismiss it as such and go on with their lives--but in Jensen's hands--just like the bird's egg in the nest on the cover--the ideas are delivered as more of a love letter addressed to anyone who feels their life does not belong to them, and begins every morning with a soft wish that it did.If everyone were to read and consider deeply this book, W.S. Merwin's words may never have to come true. In the meantime, however, reading &quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; prepares us should we soon indeed have to speak &quot;a forgotten language.&quot; Jensen is speaking it already."},{"Title":"Families of ancient New Haven","review":"This book contains family lineages to hundreds of Connecticut families!

Whether or not that is a good thing may be a matter of debate. Some subjects are worth discussing at length, because trawling for deeper meanings or drawing out the nuances of the matter yield more insight and expand our understanding with each new layer of data-whether by contrasting it against the hard edge of another discipline or by the overlay of the veneer of a new metaphor. But some subjects, once having been examined, leave one with the impression that \\"everything that needs to be said has been said.\\"Robert Banks and Bernice M. Ledbetter think that the subject of leadership is one of those topics worth revisiting, and they do so in their book, Reviewing Leadership, much to our benefit. In this short book, Banks and Ledbetter do two things. First, they briefly introduce the reader to \\"everything that needs to be said that has been said\\" about leadership by providing a brief overview of how leadership has been treated and understood in what they categorize as biblical, historical, and contemporary perspectives (chapter two). Second, in the chapters following, they attempt to bring an ethical lens to the subject of leadership through a Christian perspective, beginning with \\"spiritual and religious dimensions\\" (chapter three) to a more overt Christian understanding of the leadership function in the final chapter through the use of \\"exemplary case studies\\" of Christian leadership in action (refreshingly, and tellingly, none of the persons featured in the case studies would likely be the first, or second, guess of most contemporary leaders or informed laity as to \\"models of leadership.\\").According to the writers, the book is \\"a summary of academic approaches and concrete experiences. It is a fruit of biblical investigation and reflection on our own experiences. It is an exercise in cultural analysis and theological exploration. It is derived from current writings on leadership and personal observations of exemplary role models. It has its basis in common sense and familiar proverbs and our exposure to film and poetry\\" (p. 11). And it is this confessed subjectivity that yields some of the (few) least helpful portions and conclusion in the book. The critical reader, however, will be able to overcome those sections and focus on some of the more substantive and insightful contributions the authors make in this study.The first two chapters provide a background to the study on leadership that the authors develop. The first chapter provides definitions and discussions on the nature of leadership and stakes a claim as to the importance of its study. In the second chapter the authors offer a brief historical interpretive overview of leadership, limiting the scope to a biblical context and to the last century. The brevity of the coverage leaves curious gaps in the scope of leadership studies, as well as an absence of mention of some arguably influential leadership theories and schools.Chapters three and four provide the unique contribution that the book makes to the subject at hand. In these chapters the authors attempt to highlight overt spiritual, theological, and religious dimensions of leadership. The treatment culminates in their attempt to frame, and critique, distinctly \\"Christian\\" approaches to leadership. The fifth chapter discusses how to translate theories of leadership into practice through the advocacy of three ethical (Christian) dimensions: faithfulness, integrity, and a servant-like attitude. Following the chapter on case studies of model leaders (Franck Buchman, Soren Kierkegaard, Janet Hagberg, and Gordon Cosby), the book concludes with a a very brief chapter reflecting on how to nurture the kind of Christian leadership the authors advocate.While not containing everything that needs to be said on the subject of leadership, this book is a good companion addition to other solid, more thorough, books on leadership that may be on the readers' bookshelf."},{"Title":"Reviewing Leadership: A Christian Evaluation of Current Approaches (Engaging Culture)","review":"Reviewing Leadership: A Christian Evaluation of Current ApproachesBanks, Robert and Bernice M. LedbetterBaker Academic, 2004171 pages.Reviewing Leadership sets out to review, analyze, and process the paradigms of secular and religious leadership from the Christian worldview. The authors accomplish this mission through the development of six chapters, each building up the previous. The construct of the book is--Ch. 1 The Growing Interest in Leadership Today: Definitions, Causes, and IssuesCh. 2 Biblical, Historical, and Contemporary Perspectives on LeadershipCh. 3 The Emerging Spiritual and Religious Dimensions of LeadershipCh. 4 Popular and More Substantial Faith-based Approaches to LeadershipCh. 5 Practicing Leadership through Integrity, Faithfulness, and ServiceCh. 6 Christian Leadership in Action: Some Exemplary Case Studies.Banks and Ledbetter attack this reviewing, analyzing, and processing through six tiers--theological exploration, current writings, personal experiences, cultural analysis, and personal observations of exemplary role models-- that consistently stack upon a common foundation: \\"truth comes from God in a variety of ways and that all truth is God's truth\\" (p. 11).The authors from the onset of the book suggest that leadership and the leader are based both upon objective and abstract values. It is futile to establish any sense of a system of leadership as one-and-only-one and any limited catch-all attributes of the leader; but, the authors, as well, make it clear that there is a base philosophical system and a base of attributes that should be core to \\"influencing and empowering...people to bring about change\\" (p. 17).What the authors uniquely provide in Reviewing Leadership is unparalleled in all \\"influencing literature\\" familiar to the reviewer. Banks and Ledbetter extract the core of every leadership book presented in their book, giving an objective-as- possible- purview to the reader. The authors do not merely attack-and-extract, but carefully weigh the pros and cons of each unique paradigm. As well, the authors complete each section with an exemplary model of the paradigms and implications for application (whether the authors agree to the model or not).As great as the first four chapters book are, the reviewer believes that the remaining two chapters would even be as valuable if standing alone. The authors complete their reviewing, analyzing, and processing by giving heed to their personal flavor of leadership as focused through the core attributes of Integrity, Faithfulness, and Service. Banks and Ledbetter finalize these cores attributes by describing several near impeccable examples of \\"Christian Leadership in Action.\\"The reviewer holds little in negative assessment to the book as a whole. The book was informative through its historical description of leadership and provides an intense survey of modern leadership, leaders, and culturally relevant literature. As much the book was informative, it was far greater spiritually inspiring and provided the reviewer with a rekindled and new-founded motivation and desire to move to a greater personal and communal hope. Though small in size, the material begins to uncompress as soon as the reader opens the preface and continues to expand even upon completion of the final chapter.The reviewer was affected not merely on the concept of external leadership but received a harsh slap to the ego. The result is a deep tattooing of the core questions addressed by Max De Pree--What do I believe? What is my purpose in life? To what am I, as a leader, devoted? Who do I intend to be? What is the source of our humanity? What will I die for? If anyone is unable to at least ask the tough questions, one may be doomed to a reciprocal selfish and superficial existence.Reviewing Leadership's affect transverses the cognitive, affective, and spiritual synapses--what one hopes will be for the reviewer's remaining temporal existence. This learned objective and affect of leadership is not for the \\"I\\", but for the \\"we.\\""},{"Title":"Reviewing Leadership: A Christian Evaluation of Current Approaches (Engaging Culture)","review":"Another book with which I was very pleased with its condition.

It's the first grief book I've read that made perfect sense to me from the moment I began reading it and believe me I've read or skimmed through many grief books since my family began dying around me in 1991. I was raised to be aware that I would be faced with the death of people I cared about during the course of my life and I've believed coping with death or loss was just as natural as rejoicing for a marriage or the birth of a baby, but until I read this book I didn't feel my beliefs were really validated. I also learned early in life that humor is 'a friend' and allowing it to help us cope with life's tragedies is a positive thing. Richard Obershaw presents the process of grieving as a natural life event and acknowledges that we grieve for many things in our life--not only the death of a person! These are valuable life lessons and I'll be forever grateful that I found this particular book when I did. He also takes a little more light-hearted approach than some authors which was very refreshing for me and made me feel better about embracing my own humor as I worked through my grief. For me, the MOST important point he makes is that each of us has the power to move forward &quot;through&quot; our pain as long as we face it head on, and &quot;Do The Necessary Work&quot; -- and he makes it clear that it IS work!! I've recommended his book highly to several others who are coping with a death, or any other kind of loss or change in their lives. As a matter of fact, I will be giving it as a gift this Christmas (2000) to a friend whose Mother died recently. I do think it's a must read for anyone who has accepted the reality of loss or change in their lives, and wants to find a way to work &quot;through&quot; their pain to get to the other side where they can reinvent themselves to start a different life. Maybe I should offer one word of caution and suggest that if a person is not 'truly' ready to accept the death (or loss) in their life, then this book may not be as helpful to them at that point. But who knows, it might just help give them a different outlook."},{"Title":"Cry Until You Laugh: Comforting Guide to Coping With Grief","review":"My father died suddenly last October and I purchased this book to help me understand the grieving process.

There are no set 'stages' to the process, Obershaw advises: only 'rocks, boulders' and obstacles which can affect the end results of grieving.

The image of the headless horseman pursuing his prey through woodland at night is not one you can forget in a hurry and I was intrigued to see where it all started and how many heads would roll.There's no doubt Burton's adaptation of this classic story changed many elements. In Irving's story the main character of Ichabod Crane is a local schoolmaster, rather than a police constable, who has eyes on the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus Van Tassel. However, Ichabod has a rival for her affections in the form of Abraham Van Brunt, also known as Brom Bones. Amidst this love triangle emerges the legend of the Headless Horseman, who is said to be a Hessian warrior who appears in search of his head which was taken off in the American Revolutionary War. I'm glad I'm not the only man who's useless at finding things when I've lost them!This isn't a long read, in fact you'll easily clear it in a day, if not in one sitting but what's there is worth your time and effort. Ichabod is an amusing but hapless protagonist, unwilling to give up on Katrina even when Brom trashes his school. Katrina seems divided between the two men who are very different characters. Brom's fists do the talking while Ichabod may be weak but he is intelligent, though somewhat clueless with women. Ichabod's pursuit of Katrina leads him to a party at the Van Tassel residence, but will he get the woman he wants or will Brom beat him to Katrina's hand in marriage?We have to wait until the second half of the story before Ichabod's encounter with the Headless Horseman and Irving manages to convey the eeriness of the meeting well. Ichabod is wandering alone at night, the tensioning building with every paragraph, as unknown sounds fill the air before the Horseman appears. Ichabod is still a long way from home when the Headless Horseman bears down on him so what will become of poor Ichabod?The story ends with a bit of ambiguity and the mystery of Sleepy Hollow remains intact beyond those final pages which seems apt for a story like this. There is a resolution to the love triangle though. What happens to Ichabod when he meets the Headless Horseman? Does he survive and win Katrina's love? Is he cut down in the woods leaving Brom unchallenged in his pursuit of Katrina? That I can't say. You'll have to read this yourself.Burton's adaptation remains a good one for me but don't be content with just having seen the film. Do pick up Irving's story and read it for yourself as it is different. Written nearly two centuries ago this is still a chilling read in places."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"When I was a kid I had the record and read along book for Sleepy Hollow and the headless horseman.

Well, this is one of those cases of wrongfully watching the movie before reading the book. They were so utterly and completely different.In all honesty, I didn't really like the book. It's really short and there was really no mention of the horseman until about twenty -seven pages in (36 pgs total). It just wasn't for me.I'll stick to Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, thanks."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Another one of those great stories that you can get on the kindle for free!I picked this book to get me into the Halloween spirit this fall. Having only heard this story told in the cartoon versions of television I was quite surprised by how much I did'nt know about this classic tale.A few minor formatting issues that don't really get in the way at all.In short, a fun little read!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"My book arrived hot off the press!(literally) Printed the same week I ordered it!The binding is sturdy, yet beautiful!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I was so happy to find this. Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a classic and also a favorite of mine. I remember as a kid sharing the story with my mom and have wanted my own copy for years.

Anyone who's a fan of folklore or just good storytelling should pick it up."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"This is one of those stories that needs to be savored.

But I go back to it every now and then just to experience the beauty of the language."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I knew how this book turned out before I even started it. But the author writes so wonderfully I felt like I was just learning the story as I went along. I sat up, wide-eyed, as I read the chase scene, afraid of the ghost as though it were in my room. Amazing author no wonder this is a classic."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The majority of this short story is spent on developing the characters, some of which are not pertinent to the story. Once you get through the characters introduction, the story happens quickly and leaves the reader questioning what really happened and a desire for more.If you're looking for a ghost story, this isn't the book for you. But if you're looking for a thrilling, quick read, definitely pick up this classic."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is set in the early 1800s in the Dutch farming community of Tarry Town. Ichabod Crane is the local school teacher and a scarecrow of a man. The first two thirds of the story establish a love triangle between Crane, a beautiful young heiress, and a young man named Abraham Van Brunt. The remainder of the story deals with events involving Ichabod and a certain horseman.Those reading this book in search of a horror novel will be sorely disappointed. Much of the writing dwells on the atmosphere and charm of the setting, the nature of life in a small community, and other non-suspenseful items. There is a chase that certainly adds tension toward the end, but it is fairly brief. This is not to say that Sleepy Hollow is not worth reading. It's obviously a classic and is a pleasant read. But it's much more of a wry commentary on life in a farming community than it is a tension packed thriller. I would recommend it to any reader willing to accept it for what it is."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washington Irving is a master storyteller who can conjure images with his skillful use of adjectives to describe everyday scenes. This story is not very long, so most should be able to read it in one or two sittings. Yet it has a simplistic charm to it that captivates the imagination.Ichabod Crane is really neither hero nor anti-hero. He is rather self-indulgent but otherwise not unlike many of us today. He is looking for love and looking for gratification. Aren't we all? He encounters rivals in his pursuit of love, one who apparently (it is never proven) who uses a local legend and the appropriate setting to scare old Ichabod into either death or flight (again, we are not quite sure).The story is really nothing more than a campfire ghost story set in post-Revolutionary War New York. It has a believable plot as far as ghost story premises go, and then builds the legend into the main story line. All in all it is a fun story to read."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is an intriguing tale that is much more profound than it seems.The overly superstitious townspeople, including Ichabod Crane, are fascinated with scary, ghost stories that permeate the town as the dreamy Dutch community is a perfect setting where people are absorbed in myths and superstitions. With its ambiguous ending, this story leaves the reader questioning what is true and what is merely fantasy. This is interesting as it allows the reader to believe what they want. I determined that the appearance of the Headless Horseman was a hoax by Brom Bones, but disliked that there was no definite answer to the mystery of the Headless Horseman.Irving's fluid style is amazing as he aptly creates the settings, especially dreamy environment of the town. His exceptional descriptions are, at times, witty, and at others, suspenseful, demonstrating his ability to conjure up a wide range of moods.As Ichabod Crane's downfall is caused by his strong belief in superstitions, Irving warns of the dangers of believing in superstition too fervently.This classic tale is one that readers of all ages will enjoy for its riveting storyline, unique characters, and delightful style."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"This book was a creative and vibrant retelling of Washington Irving's tale \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" Illustrator Jeff Zornow applies his dynamic and often creepy imagery to a classic for children. Zornow captures the autumn landscape of upstate New York that inspired Irving long ago beautifully is this book so that the imagery alone tells the tale. The reader follows charismatic Ichabod Crane through his time at the village of Sleepy Hollow. Ethereal specters, jealous townsmen, the fair maiden, the rest is history all captured in a short story. Who can ask for more? Perfect for ghost story lovers and Zornow junkies."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I make no bones about it. I am an Legend of Sleepy Hollow fanatic. I have loved the story ever since growing up in that wonderful region along the Tappan Zee. Every Autumn, I look forward to reliving what WAshington Irving so lovingly captured. This production is simply a wonder to behold. It captures the flavor and feel of what Mr. Irving with our doubt meant to present. I was stunned to discover (to their credit) that this production remained very faithful to the book (something rarely done in this Hip Hop age). This is a great CD and I hope everyone gets a chance to enjoy the acting and very powerful music score. Get a copy, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"After listening to a friend's copy of Colonial Radio Theatre's \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" I decided to purchase some for myself and to give as gifts for next Halloween. Of all the audio or movie productions I know of, this is by far the only one most like Washington Irving's book.What fascinates me is that Irving's sumptuous and colorful writing style has been lovingly captured by the actors. Even his wonderfully descriptive--not to mention extensive--narration is performed with ease, gently drawing the listener into the spirit-filled world of Sleepy Hollow.I applaud the producers who, employing excellent production values, have chosen to maintain the integrity of the original book."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I remember reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow as a child, as it was one of the classic tales that frankly frightened me a lot, but it was always an enjoyable read. Now, having to read the story academically, I have found that Washington Irving subtly covers many themes throughout his story that I would have never realized if I had not been digging for them- revealing the brilliance of Irving's writing. To be able to integrate such classic humor with insights into human nature is an amazing feat, and Irving does so seamlessly.Written years after the Revolutionary War, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow contains an underlying message about how America needs to act in order to succeed as an established society. It was not until I had read many literary criticisms on the story that I could find this theme apparent throughout the story. Irving brilliantly juxtaposes the practical Brom Van Brunt to the overly imaginative protagonist, Ichabod Crane. The two characters compete to win Katrina Van Tassle's affections. Throughout the story, Ichabod surrounds himself in tales of ethereal creatures, and these tales greatly influence Ichabod's state of mind. After hearing about the infamous Headless Horseman, Ichabod takes an unsettling trek home through nature and is frightened by every little noise, believing each shadow to be a mark of the horseman, revealing his active imagination. In the end, it is his imagination that ultimately brings Ichabod to his downfall and the brawny Brom to his success, as he is the one who successfully woos Katrina. Ichabod represents the idealistic and superstitious mindset that America as a society should not adapt to; rather, America should be more practical and realistic, like Brom.Irving's writing is humorous and bright and the novel truly deserves its place in classic American literature, as it spawned the dawn of comedic writing in America. From an academic standpoint, however, I cannot say that I would encourage readers to pursue this story for any moralistic lesson in particular. The historical context in which Irving wrote the story creates a bit of barrier to relate the novel to today's society. Despite all of that, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is definitely an enjoyable read that one could indulge in for leisure."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I really like how Washington Irving describes the places where his stories take place, and Sleepy Hollow is not the exception. Although sometimes is a hard read, the story is wonderful, I enjoyed it a lot, and free Kindle edition, you have to get it."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"this book seemed like it went on forever. i love the movie, this was nothing like it...it did not get to the actual story that we all have heard till the last 2 pages. it was okay. a quick read."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I bought copies of this book for my students.

If so, I would never have bought it. The book was a pain in the butt to read. First, it was written entirely in the passive voice (\\"The stories told by Brom Bones sank deep into the mind of Ichabod\\"). And second, there wasn't one word of dialogue in it. I am aware that the story is at least a hundred years old, but that doesn't stop me from feeling disappointed in this purchase."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Yes, I love Ichabod Crane. He is cute and quirky and Washington Irving does an efficient job in garnering sympathy for the plot's protagonist. And I hoped for his best as he tried desperately to escape the woes of the Headless Hessian and win the heart of Katrina. But that's the only positive I saw in this short story.The whole plot never went beyond lethargic and boring. And this wasn't because of the time period as this time period inspired future horror writer Edgar Allen Poe. The town's name is a good representation of what goes on in this town. And the grand jerk of the story, Brom Bones, wasn't depicted as the truly evil and seductive man out to ruin everyone and benefit only himself. He wasn't the fun guy everyone loves to hate. In fact, if I were him, I would have at least been feeling the same feelings he was. The writing style wasn't impressive and I really wasn't at the edge of my seat. I honestly wanted effective suspense with short syntax and frigtening diction, as Poe and Hawthorne do so effectively in their works. I haven't seen the movie yet, but it must be an improvement since it has Johnny Depp and special effects to replace the lacking substance within the plot."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"First and foremost, as a child, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, as portrayed by Walt Disney movies, was a rather light and goofy film, having humorous moments even reaching to the end when Ichabod is running away from the headless horseman, he can be seen running with the horse on his back! Oh and just as a general forewarning, the original story is entirely unlike that of the movie, as it plays on the readers' terror which can be attributed to Washington Irving's use of Gothic elements.Anyways, the original was not that lighthearted nor that funny. Rather it focuses on a love triangle between Ichabod Crane, Brom Bones, and the wealthy Katrina Von Tassel. Set in the dreamy town of sleepy hollow, where imaginations do come to life, this setting makes for the perfect environment to tell their stories and foreshadow the ending. Where Brom Bones, after a series of failed attempts to discourage Ichabod to marry Katrina, he implants the story of the legendary Hessian knight. Bones relies on Ichabod's sensitivity to the paranormal to make him imagine the Horseman. Unlike the Disney movie, who portrays Ichabod as the protagonist and Brom Bones as the antagonist and a jerk, the original one is vice versa, telling a classic tale of city man versus a country man for a hand in marriage. It stays consistent with this theme, as it seems the country man would come out on top in the end.However, besides that, though the story implies that Brom Bones was the headless knight, the rest is left up to the readers to determine the true whereabouts of Ichabod. This open-ended story may also be Irving's way to in essence \\"save the city man\\" from the country. Although it is implied that he dies, if a reader speculates more optimistically, he simply could have just left the town, which was unfit for him right from the beginning.Overall, I found this book to be rather listless with minimal plot development. All Irving throughout the entire book is set up for the ending, making Ichabod seem like an outcast and extremely in tune with nature, having the town be in a dream-like state, and Ichabod's purely greedy motives. They all serve to build up to the finale. However, Irving drags on much too long with his abundance of imagery; the ending was nothing spectacular."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I liked the story a lot, the description of the characters of crane, katrina and others was excellent. But I did not find the story that scary..b/c there was only one encounter with that horseless horseman. Also I did not like the way the story ended. I would have liked it more if Ichabod was not such a coward..:) Thats irvings style i guess."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"A long time ago I fell in love with Tim Burton's dramatized version. This is nowhere CLOSE to being as good. The descriptive passages(about 90% of the story or so it feels like)become tedious and you tend to forget what's going on while you wait for the author to finnish describing a rock in the road or some such thing. Also very dissapointed that Ichabod and Katrina's relationship did not go as it did in the film and that it's unclear what Ichabod's fate really was by the end. I realize that it's the original and probably should be revered on some level but it was so dull and I can't bring myself to feel anything special for it. Glad it was free!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Truly an American classic, Washington Irving writes \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" for easy reading and entertainment. The misadventure of Ichabod is intentionally set for ambiguity and different interpretations to appeal to audiences, limited to neither space nor time.Unlike the popular form of ghost story written in gothic and darkly morbid fashion, Irving's ends his ghost story of the headless Hessian without a definite identity, creating interest from the debates of his true identity. In the above passage is one of the biggest plot points in the short story; it implies a connection between Brom and the disappearance of Ichabod. Irving does not try to exploit the plot twist with elongated descriptions and unnecessarily overt insinuations of Brom's involvement. He goes over it relatively quickly and lightly. He does not aim to register shock values with his words, terrifying and horrifying the reader. In no way does he put to ink repetitive suggestion of Broms Bones being the Headless Hessian, but instead allows the reader to mentally repeat the sentence and his implication in their minds. By allowing the reader's imagination to work for itself, the imagination quietly disturbs the reader with his own thoughts though seeded by Irving are developed by the reader himself.Irving employs ambiguity not only in the ending of his short story but litters ambiguity throughout his work to increase the potential range for his audience and readers. From the young to the old, readers of \\"The Legend of the Sleepy Hollow\\" are able to enjoy it for entertainment. However more seasoned readers may be able to see Irving's purpose in writing his short ghost story greater than that of entertainment. Subtlety, so not to distract from the development of the plot and its scare value, Irving creates an onion-layered story with different interpretations at every level. His writing alludes to a greater meaning, but it cannot be verified concretely in his work. Some think the legend is strictly for entertainment, some interpret it as a criticism of the published American writings during his time and others see it as a warning to Americans to not become like England. The uncertainty surrounding \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" becomes a major factor of its continuing success in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"This wonderful story finally gets the illustrations it deserves with Gary Kelley's elegant paintings.

Spooky, and full of great descriptions and as much a part of the American experience as Apple Pie, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is a true American classic that should be required reading in early highschool. A must read for Halloween time or if you ever plan a trip to upstate New York! So if you ever walk the backroads at night and you hear something unknown approaching, just take a guess as to what it is. It might just be the Headless Horseman!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I had not read anything by Washington Irving so now that I have my Kindle I decided to give it a go. To my surprise I found the story charming and the writing excellent.

The descriptive writing is just excellent and sure to hound you well after you have finished the book."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"What The Legend of Sleepy Hollow lacks in substance it makes up for in quality. Washington Irving writes a short piece crammed with elements of sophisticated literature, Dark Romanticism, and meaningful themes. This short story is a literary masterpiece that is directed to a wide range of readers.Short and easy to read, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow provides a delightful storyline that fascinates even the youngest audiences. Irving's diction is somewhat elevated, but not so much that it is confusing or difficult. The words would provide an excellent transition for novices that wish to improve on their vocabulary. The style is intriguing and never fails to entertain readers. Children can get an early exposure to writing from another era and gain an early respect for Dark Romantic literature. Most laudable is Washington Irving's extremely vivid imagery. His depiction of the rural town of Sleepy Hollow is unmatched, with each image providing a burst of emotion. The writing is straightforward and will not confuse or perplex readers. The supernatural aspects of the story make this far from bland, exciting children and adults alike. There is a considerable amount of mystery, suspense, and action, each adding to the joy in reading the piece.The story itself may seem simple, but The Legend of Sleepy Hollow can entertain many intellectuals with its themes and dark Romantic aspects. There are many elements that are sophisticated enough to be dissected, scrutinized and, analyzed. Although the plot is straightforward, themes are hidden and can be vague. The story ends on a note in which nothing is absolute, leaving it to readers to come up with their own theories. Complex themes from Dark Romanticism are rampant and can reveal complex revelations about human nature.The story is short, but complex in its themes and literary aspects, making the novel a delightful piece to read and analyze."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"In the movie, Crane ends up with Katrina.

I really enjoyed this story although at times, I gave my dictionary a good workout. There were certain descriptions in this book that I liked so much that I would read them over and over again not even realizing I was doing it. I think this is because they so vividly reminded me of certain childhood memories. I liked one so much that I added it to \\"My Clippings\\" so I can return to it again and again. Since I didn't really know anything about this story previously, when I was very near the end, I kept wondering how in the world it was going to tidy up for the ending.

The plot was a little boring and it took me a little while to get into the book."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I began reading this book with high hopes. I expected it to be a great book filled with great suspense sequences and rousing dialogue.Way wrong.It's just about how the main character, Ichabod Crane, became a teacher and his affairs with Lady Van Trussel and his fued with Brom Bones. You learn that Ichabod is interested in the dark arts and stuff like that. It gets pretty repetitive after a while.The book isn't divided into chapters or sections. Barely even paragrahps. There isn't much dialogue and half the book is just a bunch of words that shouldn't even be in there. Irving probably ran out of ideas and he didn't want to end the book after ten pages, so he just put in a bunch of characters and crap that aren't relative to the plot of the book.They spend so much time using non-useful words that after a while, you begin to forget what the book is about.When they finally mention the Headless Horseman halfway through, it's very unsatisfying. And in the final encounter between Crane and the Horseman, it's another thing you could care less about.The book has too many dissapointments to keep people interested and really isn't too suspenseful. It isn't even that scary. I'm not to sure I want to see the movie now, but anything even relating to the Headless Horseman has to be better than this.Happy reading. At least try to."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"If I had to make one worthwhile advice in my life, it would be to not read this story. The boring storyline simply fails to capture any interest, despite the character's unique names.Washington Irving's overhyped tale not only did not fulfill my expectations after hearing such praise about it and seeing the Disney animated film on it, but also wasted thirty minutes of my life.The simple and ineffective plot drones on and on when you just want it to end. Following the actions of Ichabod Crane, a fellow schoolmaster, in the lazy town of Sleepy Hollow, the story does not capture the desired love triangle among Crane, Katrina Von Tassel, and Brom Bones, the local ruffian. Instead the relation pans out one-sided, leaving a big gaping question, what was the point of that?The characters all prove to be quite uninteresting. Every character never fully develops, thus statically remains boring throughout the tale. From Ichabod, to Katrina, to Brom Bones, to the headless Horseman, none of the aforementioned ever spark a moment in the book worth recalling.What really brings the story down is the olden nineteenth century style. Nothing is ever enticing and makes me want to read more, rather, every word I struggle on to read, just adds to my frustration and willingness to simply give up on the story.In the end, if you have some time to spare, do not read this book, rather go buy an ice cream and chill; it will make your day much better. The only lasting impression you will have is how horribly you wasted your time."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"One of the most basic storylines I have ever encountered, Sleepy Hollow is not a book to read. Washington Irving does not do the book any justice as the story drags on without any eventful actions to get readers excited or intrigued. Reading the book is merely a waste of time.Irving starts the book of well with beautiful imagery and descriptions of the setting. The place is fully described and the mood and atmosphere is already in place, yet Irving continues to drag on with his meaningless descriptions that do not help add to the plot in anyway. Irving continues to do that for basically half the book before adding a couple of events to speed things along. Unfortunately for me, I was already burned out reading the useless extraneous descriptions.The plot is based on a love triangle, yet the love triangle is so overused, that if nothing special is added to help make the story interesting, the story remains an unoriginal, ineffective storyline set to bore readers to sleep. The characters seem too extreme to ever be real. The whole story seems too fake to ever capture anyone's interest.And what is up with the ending? Brom Bones gets the girl and Ichabod becomes successful. To me the ending is ridiculous because it makes no sense.Do not waste your time trying to plow through this boring story."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"As one of Kindle's free selections, if you're a fan of classic horror literature, you need this on your device.

It is short enough to finish in a few days with a busy schedule (like mine!), yet detailed enough to make it substantive, and satisfying for someone who rarely reads fiction (save for literary classics, when there is time), and is usually disappointed by it. I will be buying my daughter a Kindle for her 23rd birthday next month, and will be including this short story with it. I know she will love it, as she is already familiar with and a fan of the story from Hollywood versions."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"As a kid I used to watch the Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon and the headless horseman scared the living daylights out of me. When I got a little bit older, as a budding horror fan - I was psyched to find out that The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was actually a respected contemporary piece. In other words: I could easily get away with reading a scary book for a class book report. Nice!Re-reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow today, it holds up very well. The first thing to note is that it's really not a full novel - it's a novella or even short story. It took me around half of an hour to read it from cover to cover. Washington Irving's prose is simple and easy to follow, and even beautiful at times. The only problem with reading it nowadays is that there are a number of archaic terms that you'll want to look up - but thankfully you can do that instantly and painlessly with your Kindle.Since this book is FREE on the Kindle and is such a small time investment - you really do owe it to yourself to experience this classic of American literature. What are you waiting for? Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I grabbed this for the Kindle since it was free, and like the previous reviewer, I only had a vague idea of the story from various cartoon versions.I was very pleasantly surprised. I've not read anything else by Washington Irving. The story is simple; the prose is easy to read but in spots is downright beautiful. Some of the scenic descriptions border on poetry. Irving writes with a dry sense of humor; and he has faith in the reader's ability to connect the dots, so he doesn't spell everything out.It's a short read - in print I guess it would be 30 to 40 pages. One GREAT thing about reading it on Kindle is having the dictionary function, as there were a number of archaic terms with which I was not familiar.I give it 5 stars for the combination of price and quality of writing. If you'd like some good writing, a peek into America (upstate New York) at the end of the 18th century, and a little wit, go ahead and grab it - especially if it's free!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"How would you feel if every time you walked outside in the dark, you felt a chill? What if you lived in a town that everyone said was haunted? How would you like it if you were running for your life from a headless horseman? Well that's what the schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane does in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving.To begin with this book will keep you on the edge better than any other book. When Ichabod is alone in the woods at night and starts hearing noises you have no idea what's going to happen to him. From experience my heart was pumping faster than it ever had before while I was reading a book.Another good reason to read this book is it will hook you in from the very beginning. It was so good that I was anxious to turn the next page and see what was going to happen. I liked the book so much that I finished the it the same day I started it!The next reason is it can be scary. When Ichobod is in panic as he rides his horse down the road because he is being chased by the headless horseman you don't know if Ichabod will live or die. Even though it may not be that scary in the beginning it gets a lot scarier later on. Besides the book being scary it is also a love story. Ichabod is deeply in love with the beautiful Miss Katrina Van Tassle but unfortunately so is Brom Bones. He is a rough, bold, and strong man that would do anything to get what he wants. In the book he trashes Ichabod's schoolhouse because he caught him talking to Katrina. That still doesn't stop Ichabod from trying to get the one he believes is his one true love.Out of all the books that I have ever read The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has hooked me in faster than any other. If you like scary/mystery books this would be the book for you. Although it is a cool book I recommend it to kids 8 years of age and older because of the scary and suspenseful moments the book has in it. So next time you are at the library and want a good book, get The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Then you can get chills in the dark, too!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washington Irving had a way with words that none could compare with. His simple and not very scarry at all tale of one of the most famous \\"ghosts\\" in history is both delightful in it's humor and wit and charming in it's character description. If you are looking for something to send shivers up your spine and make you quake in fear, you have looked to the wrong story master. Irving was a story teller of everyday people in everyday situations. The comical and the endearing. He made his observations on life and living it and left the afterlife to speculation. That is why \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is a true literary classic!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Have you ever heard of the Headless Horseman? Have you ever heard the stories about him and how he attacks people in the woods? Have you ever wondered whether or not the story is real?Find out for yourself by reading Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. I enjoyed reading this book and i think anyone who has a liking for mysterious legends and superstitions should read this book beacause of the interesting legend the town believes in. There are few characters to keep track of and the story is not hard to follow. The book is long but the reading goes quickly.The story is set in the late 18th century in a town in New York called Sleepy Hollow. The town believes in a legend of a headless horseman who rides through the woods at night anf attacks people. The main character is a man named Ichabod Crane who is a schoolteacher from Connecticut. He moves to Sleepy Hollow in search of work and ends up going from home to home working as a tutor. One of his students is 18 year old Katrina Van Tassel who comes from a wealthy family. Ichabod gets the idea that he will try to marry Katrina in order to obtain the family's wealth. However, Katrina's boyrfriend Abraham &quot;Brom Bones&quot; Brut has other plans for Ichabod. As the tension rises, Ichabod continues trying to win Katrina until a breathtaking surprise appearance by the town's legend creates as mysterious an ending as they come.The book has many strengths and few weaknesses. The author manages to create a mood in the book that keeps you always on th edge of your seat waiting for the legend of the Headless Horseman to come into play. The story is simple and easy to follow but is still very interesting. The characters are developed well and have personalities that you can understand and relate to. One such character is Brom Bones who is easily seen as an arrogant egotist. The only weakness of the book was one based on my personal opinion. The end of the story leaves too much to be concluded for my liking.All in all, this book was a great story. The author wrote the characters in such a way that you had definite feelings towards each one of them. Also, the story line was definitely not without surprise. But if you want to discover what surprises I am talking about then I suggest you read The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Like Rip Van Winkle, this tale is set in Dutch New York State in a real place called Tarry Town. The colonists farm and gossip, play tricks, have ambitions and court young ladies--in an area steeped in macabre superstition. Ichabod crane, a lanky and susceptible schoolmaster from Connecticut, vies with local hothead, Brom Bones, for the affection (and lush estates) of desirable Katrina Van Tassel.But the sleepy region's ghostly lore and grisly legends are used for more than mere fireside entertainment. Will we ever know the truth of the shattered pumpkin by the bridge? Each one must fill in the fate of the ambitious pedagogue as seems best, for Washington Irving leaves it to the reader to decide.Once the US ambassador to Spain, Irving traveled widely and collected the folklore of the countries he visited nearly 150 years ago. &quot;Yet his characters are as fresh and vital today as when they first appeared in print.&quot; One edition of his stories includes: Rip Van Wwinkle, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, plus two lesser-known works: The Spectre Bridegroom (set in Germany) and The Moor's Legacy (set in Spain's Alhambra). Few authors can match his rich vocabulary and detailed narrative. Our American literary and folkloric heritage are indebted to Irving's style and imagination. What were Halloween without the Headless Horseman hounding poor Ichabod Crane through the spooky woods?"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I read \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" to test out my new Kindle. It is extremely short and has a plot that has been adapted so many times that I really wasn't expecting what I got out of the real thing. Irving's writing was witty and beautifully descriptive. Its vocabulary was also often surprisingly advanced for such a short book. However, if a person goes into this book looking for a spooky tale of terror, this is not the place to look. Most of the actual book is build-up and description. Rather than being the scary story that people come to expect due to the many film adaptations, it seems to be more of an example showing how people can get carried away with superstitions as well as what deeds people can perform when consumed by jealousy. Irving's hints that Brom's jealousy prompted him to perform the elaborate hoax in which Ichabod's fears of The Headless Horseman are realized seemed pretty obvious to me."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The original 1928 Arthur Rackham edition of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' (first published in 1819) was one of the most beautifully illustrated versions of the tale ever produced. This Books Of Wonder facsimile of that edition is certainly the finest available today, though folk artist Will Moses' bright retelling runs a close second. Rackham's watercolors for this American classic are very much in keeping with his earlier work, which had established him as the greatest British illustrator of his era.Where much of Irving's tale is painted in the warm autumn hues, Rackham choose to portray Sleep Hollow as not only a place of overwhelming haunts and visions, but as a region existing in a state of permanent, moody twilight. His Sleep Hollow seems perpetually in crepuscular shadow: the last pure rays of the sun have just vanished from the earth, and darkness, though it has not fallen yet, is falling quickly. In the artist's eye, Irving's fireside tale appears to take place not in glorious mid-October, but in storm-swept late November. The illustrator's anthropomorphic and archetypal Sleepy Hollow also magnifies elements of Irving's romantic landscape over and above the necessities of the text.While witches, ghosts, and visions are discussed in the story, Rackham depicts the trees, houses, and countryside of the region as teeming with every kind of fairy, goblin, dryad, and witch, as if calmly revealing to the eyes of man the always coexistent if invisible supernatural life of the Hudson River Valley. His painting of Major Andre's Tree, for example, depicts a traditional European fairytale witch and her black cat familiar walking along the road beneath Andre's tree as if they had every right to be there. It is mankind that is the anxious, insecure, and mortally temporary interloper into this vaster mystical world. Rackham's trees are trees but also fairies, his fairies are fairies but also witches, his witches are human in form but also trees, and the birds resting in the trees, while birds, are sometimes partially fairies. All of these creatures confidently, humorously, and mischievously observe mankind, which, when not perpetually scurrying home to safety, gathers together in nervous groups to share tidings, portents, and spook tales.Irving's remarkably poetic and nuanced prose is in every way worthy of the man who bears the honor of being America's first great writer. Interestingly, the tale is partially a study in contrasts: schoolteacher Ichabod Crane and his rival, the rabble-rousing Brom Bones, though obvious opposites, each also contain elements of the other. Ichabod, though he lives largely in his thoughts and dreams, has a very definite physical side: he plays boisterously outdoors with the town children, and, at the fatal party at the story's end, commands the dance floor in a way that delights and astonishes the other guests.And Brom, who is a great horseman and a fearless fighter, is also known throughout the region for his cleverness in shrewdly achieving his own ends. Ichabod is an ugly, eccentric \\"scarecrow\\" of a man, while Brom is \\"broad-shouldered and double-jointed,\\" with a \\"Herculean frame and great powers of limb.\\" Brom, unlike the ultimately solitary Ichabod, is a well - established alpha male with \\"three or four boon companions who regard him as their model,\\" and who comprise his \\"gang.\\" On the other hand, Ichabod, when not surrounded by his boy students, spends his time gossiping and sharing ghost stories around midnight fires with elderly Dutch women. Ichabod and Brom both court the lovely Katrina Van Tassel in their own fashion, not only because she is a model of feminine beauty and charm, but because each covets her family's wealth and bountiful farmland.It's no accident that the \\"dominant\\" specter of Sleepy Hollow, who is \\"commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air,\\" is a headless horseman, while Ichabod is a respected teacher and storyteller, a \\"man of letters\\" and a \\"pedagogue.\\" The fearsome, massively-built Headless Horseman, who may or may not be Brom in disguise, is all torso and limbs, while Ichabod is one of the few, if not the only, inhabitant of the hollow who earns his living by his intellect--by his head. Thus they make symbolically perfect, if unequal, opponents.With his real or illusory ties to the supernatural, the headless horseman, who is believed to ride the wind and to appear and disappear in bursts of fire, is a malevolent force of nature. If of supernatural origin, then he does indeed command \\"the nightmare, with her whole ninefold,\\" and all the other spirits of the air; but if merely human, then he still commands Brom's raw, \\"Herculean\\" power, and is physically far more than a match for Ichabod. Clearly, Irving was making a statement of sorts. Brom's earthy cleverness and steely masculinity triumph in the end, while Ichabod's misapplied intelligence, more often than not, leads him towards, and not away from, superstition, anxiety, and hysteria-ridden imagining. Brom's quiet confidence in his prowess is genuine, but the talkative Ichabod's confidence is only a smug self - deception out of which his boastfulness and foolish behavior are born.This edition is a happy marriage of two masters of their form, and contains the unabridged text. Travelers may be particularly interested in the Rackham watercolor captioned \\"Reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones,\\" which portrays Ichabod and three Dutch maidens standing in the Old Dutch Churchyard on an overcast afternoon. The illustration is remarkable, because, 75 years after it was completed, those visiting the churchyard today, which is now a national landmark, can stand in exactly the same spot and see how incredibly accurate the artist's representation of the burial ground was, and how little the beautiful site has changed, in mood and detail, over the years. As Irving wrote, \\"Time, which changes all things, is slow in its operations on a Dutchman's dwelling.\\" And thereabouts."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Will Moses' illustrated retelling of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow rivals Arthur Rackham's near century-old version as the best edition of the book ever published. The Rackham version, with its moody, archetypal illustrations, has the slight edge, as it contains Irving's full original text in addition to Rackham's spectacular artwork.However, Moses's simplification of the narrative is masterfully executed, and the colorful, playful, and numerous paintings which adorn the book have a warm period charm of genuine Americana. Moses portrays the Hudson River Valley as a lush expansive valley not unlike the Garden of Eden on the first day of creation. Happy farmers, their wives and children, cows, geese, ducks and pigs frolic together amid fields of wheat and corn; galleons approach dramatically from the river; and the Catskill Mountains, sun, and sky suggested an infinite panorama and endless horizon full of promise.The story tells us that the Dutch colonists were a superstitious lot, and that the Sleepy Hollow region itself was or seemed to be under a spell of some kind. The farmers and their wives suspected witchcraft; strange music was heard in the air; visions were seen; and the inhabitants themselves lived their lives in a kind of continuous dreamy revery. These tales and superstitions give rise to the legend of the headless horseman, said to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head to a canon ball in the war, and now nightly prowling the region in search of it. Moses' nocturnal landscapes of the swamps, hills and the Old Dutch Cemetery under a bright harvest moon are particularly effective. Significantly, these stark, haunted landscapes do not violate the spirit of the book, but enrich its sense of wonder.Moses' Ichabod is a cheerful but somewhat hapless fellow, confident and foolish in equal parts. His Katrina is a strong but innocent blond beauty, and a friend to children. Brom Bones is an appropriately square-shouldered, square-jawed hooligan, rowdy and full of mischief, if not absolute spite.Anyone familiar with the tale knows that it is not a horror story but a folktale, a fireside spook story, and a \`legend' as Irving, writing here as Diedrich Knickerbocker, himself called it. This edition of the book is appropriate for children but is equally suitable for adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"These books are all ABRIDGED although it doesn't disclose that anywhere that's prominent. Don't accidentally buy any of this series thinking these are the UNabridged classics. What a rip-off. Amazon should really post the \\"adapted by\\" author!!!!!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"You ever get that feeling where a book comes out and your immediate reaction is, \\"WELL, IT'S ABOUT BLOODY TIME!\\"? I tend to get this feeling only about books that it never would have occurred to me to hope for. A kid-friendly version of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"? It seems self-evident when you say it like that, but I don't prowl the stacks of my library looking for classics to freshen up. I leave that sort of thing to the professionals. Professionals going by pseudonyms like, \\"Gris Grimly\\" and the like. What we have here in our possession is a tidy little item with a certain panache and flair. Faithful to the original text (albeit with judicious cutting and abridgement here and there) Grimly brings Irving's story to macabre life right before our eyes. Any book that has the wherewithal to introduce a classic tale to kids in a manner that they will not only understand but also seek out voluntarily should be considered in full. In Mr. Grimly we've real kid-sensibilities alongside some good old-fashioned storytelling horrors. Mr. Irving would be so pleased.At the risk of sounding trite, you all know the story of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" do you not? No, not the Tim Burton movie, sillies. This is the tale of the schoolteacher Ichabod Crane who, in spite of his innate goofiness and gall, was apparently the most desirable schoolteacher this side of the Mississippi. Sure, he looked like a \\"scarecrow eloped from a cornfield,\\" but in a town as small as Sleepy Hollow, any fellow with even a scant bit of intellectualism about him is worth checking out. But Ichabod doesn't set his sights on just anyone. Oh no. He's impressed with only the richest girl in the county, Katrina Van Tassel. Unfortunately for him, she is currently being wooed by the local county swain Brom Van Brunt a.k.a. Brom Bones. Ichabod is keen for the challenge however, and after being invited to a dance at the Van Tassel manor it looks as if all his hopes and dreams might come true. After a possible rejection, however, the naturally superstitious teacher finds himself going home, alone, from the party. It is then that he runs across the notorious supernatural figure that all the county discusses: The Headless Horseman. Whether the horseman truly does spirit away the teacher or whether Ichabod merely flees Sleepy Hollow for good is not known. What people do know, though, is that all that remains is his hat and a shattered pumpkin along the side of a brook.As a kid, I was always mildly baffled that Ichabod was not supposed to be the hero of his own story. If you've watched the Disney version of the tale (and I'll get to that later) then Brom Bones comes off as a bit of a jerk. This feeling isn't alleviated any by Grimly's adaptation, but it makes for an interesting change of pace from those other tales of rivals in love. In terms of the story itself, there is much here that a kid will incline towards. It's rare to find a title for kids where the protagonist is A) human and B) and adult. Nigh unto impossible, almost. Still, Ichabod with all his flaws and greed is a quintessentially American figure. I'm a little shocked no one's ever updated him into a contemporary book or movie. Talk about ripe pickings.Some will write off the book as just another graphic novel, which is not entirely unwarranted, but also not entirely fair. I mean, what is it about this book that strikes you as comic booky? There aren't any word balloons or snatches of dialogue. There are panels, however, and often they will display action sequences in a linear fashion. Just the same, I think that it's safe to say that this book falls squarely into the category of \\"indefinable entity\\". It's maybe best described merely as an \\"illustrated novel\\", and nothing more.But really, the art is what makes it more than just a visual adaptation. On examining this book closer I found that often the lines on a character's mouth would often extend far beyond the limits of their own face. If Ichabod smiles, for example, them the line of his smile carries on long after the flesh has ceased. At first I mistook this for some kind of moustache or facial hair, but then I found that everyone (except possibly Katrina) suffers the same technique. It's interesting to consider. Does it indicate an extreme emotion or does it merely give one character or another a bit of visual pizzazz? Gris Grimly isn't known for his sexy females (though Bella of the book \\"Boris and Bellacomes close) so it's interesting to see him work his magic on the character of Katrina. She's all delicately lowered eyelids and curves. Grimly's style in this book is restrained, it seems, and it plumbs the inner recesses of the \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" tale for all the humor it's worth. It's not a bad idea, really. When Ichabod cuts a rug you've never seen a more ridiculous sight. For finding the funny in both the implied and the obvious, Grimly pairs nicely with Irving's fabulous text.Let's admit something together right now. A certain strain of American has probably seen the Disney version of theLegend of Sleepy Hollowat least once in their lives. As such, certain images and phrases from this book have a hard time separating themselves from that oddly faithful (just our luck) adaptation of the tale. Certain sentences in this book float through our mental ears to the sonorous tones of Bing Crosby. For the most part, Grimly does what he can to separate himself from Disney's version, and as far as I can tell he only comes close to a direct reference once. That would be the moment where, in the midst of trying to escape the headless horseman, Ichabod briefly finds himself doing the running with his horse sitting on his back. Classic slapstick stuff, sure. Maybe too classicFlaw: I read a few pages of this book then proceeded to stare at the cover intently for a good fifteen to thirty seconds sans blinking. I did this because I was convinced that the word \\"Abridged\\" was lurking somewhere in plain sight and I was just too thick to see it. Bemused by my inability to find it, I flipped to the title page. Nothing. The back bookflap? Nada. The front bookflap. Nothing a thi . . . . wait! Wait wait, I spoke too soon! What's that teensy tiny itty bitty l'il nuthin' of a sentence down there? That little snippet lurking beneath the description of the story? (removes magnifying glass from purse and peers closely) Ah. I see now. It says, \\"Be forewarned: The text has been slightly condensed for maximum fright.\\" Knowing, as we do, the frequency with which such bookflaps get lost, perhaps the book beneath the jacket says the same thing. Yeah, no such luck. So basically, you're going to get a lot of confused parents who don't know their Washington Irving very well and will be more than happy to think that this is the complete story. Or, more likely, you'll end up with a lot of fast-moving teenagers who have been told to read the tale for their autumnal English class and can't see why this book isn't the original story since even the publication page is absent of any warnings or notations. BAD, Atheneum, BAD! You did a killer job on the bookjacket (I'm loving the faux binding peering out along the spine and the buckled \\"leather\\") but when your author abridges something you need to let us know with big flashy lights. Seriously, now.I anticipate so many kids falling under the thrall of this book that their parents seek out Irving's original tale just to slake their headless horseman thirst for more. And anything that gets the kiddies reading real honest-to-goodness Washington Irving will have to be seen, even by the most jaded critics, as a good thing. Putting aside the question of whether or not the book should have been more forthcoming in the whole \\"is it abridged?\\" area of affairs, this is a great title and one that deserves a place in every library far and wide.

But don't let this faade fool you! Author Washington Irving himself has stated that \\"I have often hid my moral from sight, and disguised it as much as possible by sweets and spices, so that while the simple reader is listening with open mouth to a ghost or a love story, he may have a bolus of sound morality popped down his throat, and be never the wiser for the fraud...\\" \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is no exception.What seems to be a classical myth meant solely to entertain, defies convention with a subtle criticism of tradition and superstition. The reason for this criticism can be found in Irving's life story. The birth of Irving, April 3, 1783, incidentally coincided with the birth of a new nation - the United States of America. He was born five short days before the formal proclamation ending the American Revolution, declaring America a free nation. In fact, Washington Irving was named by his mother after the hero of the new nation, George Washington, whose biography (Life of George Washington) he would ultimately come to write. He was literally a contemporary of the country, and essentially invented American literature. Irving avoided purely patriotic writing, choosing instead to assert patriotic messages in a characteristically circuitous manner. \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" reflects a critique of Britain's snobbish pride regarding its tradition as opposed to the young America's lack thereof, something Irving dismisses in his story as foolish.\\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is a short story following the local schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane, in his quest to win the hand of the widely courted local beauty (and local heiress), Katrina Van Tassel, and his eventual downfall. Irving writes the tale from a 3rd person limited point of view, like an observer watching the story unfold, with a few insertions of first person commentary in between. This style not only reflects the entertainment qualities of \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" but also allows the reader to follow along with Ichabod's actions in an unbiased observation of his character and emotions. This story is based predominantly on myth and legend, so Irving's style of writing in a detached observational manner heightens the mystery in the story. The outcome of Ichabod's encounter with the Headless Hessian remains unbeknownst to the reader, allowing the readers to attempt to uncover the truth for themselves, and enhancing the ambiguity of Ichabod's fate, as well as the mystery of Sleepy Hollow.This short story is an amazing aesthetic experience as well. Irving provides a satirically humorous depiction of two contrasting characters, Ichabod Crane, and his rival Brom Bones, whose rivalry over Katrina provide for several memorable encounters. In addition, in accordance with the Romantic Irving is, he artfully uses nature to subtly reveal the character's innermost emotions. Rather than directly stating that Ichabod is depressed, Irving instead describes \\"the night [growing] darker and darker,\\" and \\"the stars [seeming] to sink deeper in the sky.\\"The atmosphere of revolution that Irving grew up in influenced his ambition towards creating a cultural independence from Great Britain as well. In a time of lackluster development in the arts in the new nation, Washington Irving was a pioneer in creating a new genre of American literature. His most famous works are quite literally a piece of history, and such short stories as \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and - of course - \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" are certainly worth reading, time and time again."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"All these years I was brought up thinking that this novel was something special, even epic.

I guess my expectations was of a massive novel, instead I get a short story that has less words in it than some cell phone owners manuals."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"While The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a timeless tale that has endured the ages and countless retellings from Disney to Tim Burton, the original work contains a rather large error in tone - a blatant one. The story is told in third person as though it's a journal - the sketch book of Diedrich Knickerbocker, in fact. This is fine, except for the climax scene in which Ichabod journeys home through the hollow from Van Tassel's house, and is confronted by the Headless Horseman. This scene is written with all the detailed minutia that characterizes Irving's style, but the obvious problem is that, of course, nobody was there to witness what happened to Ichabod Crane while he was alone in the wilderness, so therefore it could not possibly be communicated by means of somebody's journal - this person would never have known what actually happened in the Hollow since nobody was there to witness it, and apparently Ichabod never survived or stuck around to tell anyone. Irving never deals with this obvious problem in the text (a simple \\"This is what we think happened...\\" would've sufficed). The story probably would've worked much better with a traditional \\"God-perspective\\" narrator rather than a fictional character's journal. It is nonetheless, a classic work of American literature and should be read by everyone.This is a fine edition and also includes Rip Van Winkle, another story of paranormal experience and also of the Knickerbocker sketch book. It's a similar tone to Sleepy Hollow, but the characters aren't as memorable."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I remember this story from when I was a kid, the animated version on tv particularly.

I'd recommend this book."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"ISBN 0824985745 - Printed and bound in Mexico (boo hiss to Ideal Publishing in Nashville, Tennessee, for that decision - the US can print and bind, too!). Amazon says this book is for ages 4 to 8. I'll disagree, in a small way. This book is for your child when you think your child is old enough for it - and that will be so individual that suggested ages are irrelevant. If I had to choose an appropriate age group, myself, I'd think 8 to 12.Before I get to my review, I'd like to ask Amazon review readers to notice the line above each review, where it says \\"This review is from:\\". Click the book title next to a few different ones and you'll see that they lead back to different editions. Amazon has this somewhat annoying habit of lumping reviews together when they're not really for the same book at all. In kids' books, especially, this matters, since illustrations are a huge portion of the package and the quality can vary so much. Remember to keep that in mind! On with the review.Ichabod Crane, a schoolmaster, came to teach in Tarry Town, a place that happened to have a local legend about a headless horseman who haunted the nearby woods. Ichabod, moving from one family's home to another on a weekly basis, passed through those woods frequently, spooking himself with memories of the tales. Tired of his slightly vagabond-like life, Crane decides to win the hand of a local young lady, putting himself in place to inherit her family land and a stable home of his own, finally. With his heart set on Katrina, he is challenged at every turn by the very strong Brom Bones, and on the night when Ichabod finally speaks up about his feelings, only to have his hopes dashed, a scary and suspicious appearance of The Headless Horseman occurs - and Crane disappears forever!The text is framed by the outline of spooky, leafless trees in colors that match the color of the illustration on the facing page. Those images are large, bold and match the mood of the text superbly. For the classic American folk tale by Washington Irving, alone, I'd give it five stars, but when you add in the absolutely wonderful illustrations by Russ Flint, this is one edition of this book that is staying on my keeper shelf for good. The adaptation is good, not flawless, and the person who did the adaptation isn't named anywhere on the book that I could see.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I highly recommend this book as a visual aid which relates to the current generation of readers.

None of them is as good as this book/cassette set, with the combination of Glen Close's narrative talents in relating the story and being able to read along in the wonderfully illustrated book graced with period \\"artwork.\\" The mystery and atmosphere of this story is perfectly captured; the story is expertly edited and narrated. Close is a storytelling genius and is completely and effectively able to switch personae and voices as she re-tells this classic story. I have listened to it with my children during long drives in the car at night, and I have listened to it on bright autumn afternoons by myself. I have carted it around and I have lent it to many people, with the result that I no longer have my copy! Autumn and Halloween were not the same last year without it.

The only thing I have to complain about is that this is NOT an &quot;Unabridged&quot; reading of the Washington Irving story as advertised on the cassette case; this adaptation has been severely abridged, losing some of the more important elements of the story (such as Ichabod's life as schoolteacher, Brom Bones' history and rivalry with Ichabod, and the events after the night of Ichabod's terror-filled ride).

With rich and romantic language, a story of love, mystery, wonder is painted in the mind of the reader. The story is unpredictable and imaginative with a pleasant plot and a shocking ending. Irving adds many historical references to his legend which creates a heightened interest for the reader. Ichabod Crane is a creatively crafted main character. He is the one character that is made very familiar throughout the story. If the story has a flaw, it is the lack of dialouge amongst the characters(most likely because it is told as a legend by a narrator) that prevents the reader from feeling as though he is a part of the story's happenings and rather that he is looking upon them from above."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"\\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow\\" by Washington Irving is my all-time favorite story! Set in upstate New York in the late 1700's, schoolmaster Ichabod Crane arrives in the quiet village of Sleepy Hollow to teach the area's children, but is soon enthralled by the many local haunts, sightings and superstitions...and by Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the richest farmer in the land and romantic interest of local rival Brom Bones. After attending an autumn celebration at the Van Tassel's luxurious mansion, Ichabod Crane rides home through the gloom of night and encounters the most famous ghost in the area...the Headless Horseman...and is never seen or heard from again.\\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow\\" has enchanted readers for nearly two centuries, and will no doubt continue to provide great reading for centuries to come.

The plot in this short story is rather predictable and because of the many reproductions of Sleepy Hollow as movies or other types of books, the reader generally has an idea about the outcome of the story. However, the beauty of this story is not the plot but instead its style and unique presentation. It is told to the reader as if by a storyteller, and confirms this with a postscript after the conclusion of the actual story. This method of writing creates a more cozy feeling throughout the book, without compromising the dark romantic aspects of Irving's writing. Right off the bat Irving's extensive imagery jumps off the page. Many of the descriptions are full, imaginative, and paint a picture in the reader's mind.The writing itself was excellent, but there were a few things that were at once confusing within the plot. Expecting the general plot I had seen and read before the actual authentic story, I was shocked at Ichabod's portrayal as a schoolteacher with ulterior intentions in pursuit of the Katrina, a main character in the story. He did not seem innocent, chaste, and pure as I had imagined and believed his character would be. Similarly, when I had finished reading the story, it left me wondering what was the author purpose, or point of the story. Even with much consideration, it seemed a mystery and I could not come up with a point to the story, and that is the basic problem that I have with the book. All the characters show no hint of compassion, and all seem to have obvious dark sides to them, characterized by jealousy or coquettish behavior. There is no main protagonist for the reader to root for, because all characters are horribly flawed. In addition, some versions of the book include a postscript which explains and addresses the very problems I have with the author purpose, but because it seems random and some books do not have it, I was not sure of its importance. Overall, I would recommend this short story to everyone because it was enjoyable to read, through a stylistic standpoint. Even with its minor flaws regarding the moral of the story and the character development, the book is still very well written."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"the legend of sleepy hollow is a mystery story it made me feel exited.thisis a summery about it.just a ordanary man in a little town named ichabod crane. and he fell in love one day same as another named brom they both had a crush on the same girl named katriena . she danced with ihabod every night . then they got marryed. brom got enveous then he left ichabod out cold with his horse .

Washington bridged the gap from the Puritan era to today. By descriptive scenes and common characters Washington lulls you into the story. The Legend of Sleepy Hallow was unlike the full-length feature film \\"Sleep Hallow\\". Though the two have the same characters the plots differ. The book has Ichabod Crane (the protagonist character) as a dumpy school teacher who is content to teach school, give singing lessons, and read books on bewitching tales, where as the movie has Ichabod Crane as a pharisaic pathologist. I liked how the book was unlike the movie; I didn't know what was going to happen next. Also the book is relatively short, making it easy to breeze through the book in no time. If you need to read a novel from an American writer then this would be the book for you."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is a classic haunting story has been redone in picturebook format to appeal to a younger audience here.

Glenn Close gives a stellar performance with incredible (almost impossible) voice characterizations of the different players in the story. The background music is perfect. The illustrations are both colorful and authentic. Neither my husband nor I are &quot;spring chickens&quot; any longer-I am 39 and he is 54. But both of us completely enjoy this production, and it is great for our four young children, as well. It is well-edited to leave out the extraneous information (although Irving's tale is well-written in the first place, some of it would not translate to a story-telling mode), and the length of 22 minutes is perfect. I only wish the book were a little larger and hardbound (as some nursery rhyme books are) so that the beautiful pictures would be more visible to a larger group of people viewing them (plus a hardback book would be sturdier-the edges wouldn't fray as easily in eager little hands.) Overall, though, I have no complaints. I lost the tape and am ordering it here again, because it is a classic no family should be without."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Most of us know the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - likely through Disney's well-crafted and true to the original adaptation of this Washington Irving classic, but it is worth the effort to explore the original.

The book is a quick read, with vibrant descriptions of colonial life in upstate New York.I recommend reading in the early fall, with a good scotch and a roaring fire."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Although most readers have already read this fine book as youngsters, probably properly prompted by teachers who wanted to introduce their charges to good literature, it is worth-while rereading it as adults not only because the Amazon version is free and their teachers were right that it is good literature, but also because it is fun. Washington Irving (1783-1859) was known for his humor while he was alive, and his reputation has lived after him. He claims that the book was found among the papers of Diedrich (read, died rich) Knickerbocker. It occured near a town called Tarry Town because husbands lingered there on market days (doing what?).The place was called Sleepy Hollow because of how the area affected its inhabitants. They seemed to loose their minds and go off in an almost sleepy fashion, accepting all kinds of foolish superstitions. The principle superstition was about a headless man who galloped around on horseback. Legend has it that this is a Hessian whose head was struck off by a cannon ball during the Revolutionary War. Even people from out of town or out of State who come to the area soon breath in this legendary air and believe it.One day, a man from out of State, Ichabod Crane comes to town to teach children. The rest of the story is literary history, and Irving tells it very well."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Many have seen some tv or movie variation of this story and are familiar with the storyline. I had read it in school and even watched the movie Legend of Sleepy Hollow that came out. I liked the movie, but there is always something about a good story that always beats out the movie especially when it comes to a mystery or scary story.The story is set in 1790 in a place called Tarry Town that is in a glen called Sleepy Hollow. We meet Ichabod Crane who is a schoolmaster and who wants to marry an 18 yr old wealthy farmers daughter, Katrina Van Tassel. However, he has some competition with Abraham Van Brunt who also wants her hand. One night there is a party where all are in attendence. When Ichabod leaves he finds he is pursued by the Headless Horseman. He is the ghost of a Hessian trooper who had his head shot off by a stray cannonball during a \\"nameless battle\\" during the American Revolutionary War. Ichabod mysteriously disappears from town after that fateful night which leaves Katrina to marry Brom Bones. The story leaves in mystery saying only that Brom would look \\"exceedingly knowing when the story of Ichabod was related\\".This is a fun story that is wrapped in love, mystery, and legend.

It captures the flavor and feel of what Mr. Irving with our doubt meant to present.

Now, the language deals with another time in our early country, but its not that difficult for a modern day boy to understand."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washing Irving uses flowery prose to establish the setting of a sleepy little backwater town, kind of hard to imagine considering the story is set in New York, somewhere along the Hudson, which is incredibly populated these days. I consider myself to have a decent vocabulary but there were many words that I needed to look up while reading this, one of many things I love about my Kindle. It is so easy to look up word definitions while reading.Many people are familiar with the legend of the headless horseman, and I was quite surprised by how involved the story was in detailing the every day life of Ichabod Crane, and very little of the story actually involves the horseman. While this book is very short in reality, it is chock full of suspense and general spookiness. Well worth the half hour it took to read. I can see this being a favorite story to read around Halloween."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washington Irving certainly had a firm grasp on language, and he flaunts it here. Still, the flowery description and excruciating attention given to the scenery, vegetation, the food on tables, etc. gets old fast. This is already a short book as it is and said flowery descriptions make up the majority of its length; not much actually happens in terms of story. In fact, the entire plot (which is almost nonexistent) could probably be told in 5 or so pages if we didn't stop to smell the roses so often, and at such great length. I'm all for digression in a book as long as it's interesting (as in philosophical ramblings on the human condition or some such); but I can only stare at a rock or a bale of hay for so long before I'm ready to move on.Not really a book that I'd recommend, but if you're curious about it then by all means, check it out. It's really not horrible, the writing is quite good, it's just far too tedious for my liking. In all honesty, this is one of those rare instances in which I hold the modern movie adaptation in much higher esteem than the original writing. Sure, the Tim Burton film took great liberties with it and added much that wasn't originally there, but if they hadn't then there simply wouldn't have been enough material for a feature film."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"This book was very good.

The text is from 1820 and with that the writing style and vocabulary is different than that of today and takes some getting used to. However, if anyone remembers the 1949 Disney adaptation of this story, the film is very true to the book. In the Kindle version, a quote at the beginning of the book was indecipherable as well as some proper nouns around 70%-80% of the way through the book.

I actually got this book confused with Rip Van Winkle and kept waiting for Ichabod Crane to fall asleep for hundreds of years. So it wasn't quite what I was expecting but it was still enjoyable.It can definitely put you in the mood for Halloween because the writing is great and all the descriptions of the woods and Sleepy Hollow, not to mention the Headless Horseman, were very vivid. Plus, if you're not familiar with all the details of the original story, you can discover them for yourself.I did find the writing to be a little overly descriptive at times and focused on details which I didn't think were that important. But this book is so short and such a quick read that, if you don't like a portion, just keep reading and in a minute you'll be on to something better.So I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I finally got to read it and find out more about the story.

The archaic language was difficult to follow in places, and there wasn't much actual story. Irving very much liked to go off on tangents, describing things in detail when it wasn't needed (not to say the descriptions were poorly done, simply that they shouldn't have been there). To put the actual story on paper, it would probably fill half a page.That being said, it's nice to sometimes read older works- it's a way to 'cleanse the palette', as it were.As for the actual Kindle edition- there were a number of glitches in the type (letters replaced by random symbols). Perhaps someone should take another look at editing this."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Up to this point I had only seen the Disney cartoon the Legend of Sleepy Hallow which I loved as a kid. The story was very well written and I got caught up in the words and transported to Sleepy Hallow."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"A thrilling and compelling read, \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", captures the reader with its intriguing supernatural elements and unique atmosphere. At first read, the short story is entertaining by the masterful way Irving paints his novel. But on a second thought, the story is a prime example of subtleties, its theme and message hidden from most readers.The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a short story set in the early 19th century in the mystical town of Sleepy Hollow. The story's protagonist, Ichabod Crane, is a poor school teacher who is a lonely fellow, without friends or family. From his first appearance, Irving has portrayed Crane as an outsider to the town's way of life. His actions rival that of the gentry but earn him little respect from the town as a whole. The story centers on Crane and his attempts to wed the daughter of a local wealthy farmer, Katrina Van Tassel. His plans are soon dwarfed when he learns that the local hero, Brom Bones, is also in a quest to win the hand of the lovely maiden. But the battle over Katrina's hand is only half of what the story has to offer.The story is more than a ghost tale of superstition and the unknown but the story itself is as mysterious as its atmosphere. The power of the story comes from its abrupt end and disappearance of Crane and the secretive identity of the Headless Horseman. Irving does such a fine job that he forces the reader to question the true identity of the Hessian. The story does imply a connection between Bones and the disappearance of Crane but nothing is solidified and the end of the story. The readers are left to question and debate among themselves.The subtle connection and tense relationship Crane shares with Bones reveals the changing ideals of that time. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was published in a new era of American history. The early 1800s was a time of quick change for America and Irving sought to portray the tension between the new ideas and old traditions of his time. In a sense, the disappearance of Crane can be seen as the refusal of the new changing times by the community of Sleepy Hollow.Either reading this short story as a quick entertaining read for a rainy day or fully dissecting the tale for its full brilliance, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow will not disappoint. With a unique atmosphere and unsolved conclusion that leaves readers wanting more, Irving has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", is known for its poetic, flowing style. Yet, the rest -plot, theme, characters, and setting -limit the short story's zest, turning reader after reader away with its repetitive dullness.I have to admit, however, that Irving's style is fantastic in this story -the lengthy drawn-out sentences and chains of details matching its mood and atmosphere perfectly. Each description creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind, excluding no details and offering every type of poetic rhetorical device. Alliteration, similes, metaphors, personification -Irving does it all. Yet, eventually the writing also becomes tedious. Readers skip over chunks of sentences, scanning for the next major plot. He hopes for another spark of interest, a reason to continue the story. Unfortunately, the reader ends up disappointed, for the plot is annoyingly short: Ichabod Crane, the main character, is the town's schoolteacher. In love with the beautiful Katrina's wealth, Crane competes with Brom Bones, who also desires Katrina's hand in marriage. However, one night Crane finds himself pursued by the Headless Horseman. Terrified as his worst nightmare comes to life, Crane loses his reason, a subject of his active imagination. And the next day, he's gone.Since Irving spends much of the story introducing each character and setting precisely, by the time the reader gets to the actual story, it is about over. Having finally understanding each character, the reader might expect a reward for sticking through the details -perhaps a juicy plot to accompany the characters. Yet, after detailing every characteristic to its absolute end, the story ends. Readers are given no chance to care about the characters, and the story loses its appeal and memory in the reader's minds.With its themes well-hidden behind its style, The Legend of the Sleepy Hollow is neither a fun nor an easy read. Close diligent speculators will approach the story as a puzzle, an enigma to be eagerly solved. Yet, casual readers of the short story will gain nothing, perhaps muttering some praise for its style before quickly finding something more interesting. Learning nothing about how the story can relate to us, readers finish the story confused about its purpose and message. Because of this, the author fails to communicate with the reader, seeming to only strive to entertain the reader.Although the setting also matches the style and overall atmosphere of the story, it is unrealistic. A town of dreaminess, where everyone is void of reason and rationality, and only fascinated with superstition and the imagination. Visions and hallucinations are prevalent in this town, and time slows down to a dreamy tempo. As much as the town of Sleepy Hollow seems different and perhaps even interesting, it is impractical. Thus, readers are again unable to connect to the story, distanced away from the book.While its graceful lyrical style can render it stylistically a good read, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow contains barely any plot and discernible themes. It really is all style and no substance."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Not much to say about \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" or Irving that hasn't already been said, but it gave me a real thrill to read this oldest of American fiction on the newest reading device -- the Kindle!

Colonial Radio hit the ball out of the park when they recorded this gem. The acting is FANTASTIC! They all captured the essence of these wonderfully absurd characters...I loved Icabod, as I loved Brom Bones. The narration too was a joy to behold (as he let Washington's prose speak for itself, though it was certainly performed with flair and pinache, just as one would perform a one man show...no dull audio book drone here). The Musical score was inspired (Three cheers for Mr. Gage), and the surprise musical number was a joy.

I have the movie version by Tim Burton but had never read the original tale by Washington Irving so I thought it would be fun to see how close to the original it was.

The book leaves more for the imagination and allows you to make up your mind whether there was something supernatural at work."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Ugly. That's one word that describes Sleepy Hallow. Set in a unbelievably fake place of Tarry Town (sounds a lot like Toon Town), Irving parallels the events in Sleepy Hollow with those after the American Revolution.Expressing his views of knowledge in a world of open frontier, Irving repeatedly allows Brom Bones' to get the best of Icabod Crane. Bones' a burly and muscular man often wins the heart of Katrina, a woman who Crane, a scrawny intellect, is in love with. More than often, Crane is ridiculed while Bones' is idolized. Ivring strongly comments on the unimportance of intelligence in a world that is in its early stages of evolving from nature.The plot is basic and the characters are static. Little change is found within the characters, and the plot is more than predictable. So save yourself some time, and get some sleep instead of reading Sleepy Hallow."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Whoever gives Irving's \\"The Legend of the Sleepy Hollow\\" more than one star is just strange. I have not read a more boring or a more pointless story in my life. With themes that require the reader to do tedious research and style that just bores the reader out, I do not advise anyone to read such a horrible story--unless your public library is out of books.With elongated descriptions and a motionless plot, this short story that would take half an hour to read can take you four hours to comprehend, and when you do finish it (that's if you don't fall asleep in your chair), you will wish time machines existed! Talking about two men's attempts to win over the coquette Katrina Von Tassel, this book attempts to entice the reader but immediately fails to do so when the style kicks in. The page-long references to the lazy town, as well as the redundant descriptions of the characters just discourage the reader from finishing. Set in the sleepy town of, well, Sleepy Hollow, one already asks, why not already choose a happier place for such a romantic story to take place?The storyline is also a bit disappointing considering all the hail and praise I have heard about this \\"classic.\\" Ichabod is a schoolteacher who tries to court Katrina but is faced with another suitor--the strong and muscular Brom Bones. To be fair, the most exciting part of the short story is when the legendary Headless Horseman, who many believe might be Brom, chases Ichabod after a Dutch party where the guests engaged in lengthy story telling. To our disappointment, both characters disappear and never return.The ending is ambiguous as the reader is left to wonder, did the Headless Horseman kill Ichabod? What is the point of having such a character as the Headless Horseman or Ichabod if they will both disappear? If you feel like answering any of these questions, feel free to use your researching skills.On the positive note, many elements of Dark Romanticism found throughout the plot attempt to entice the reader's morbid curiosity. We see the supernatural Headless Horseman who wanders in graveyards; we see the morbid ending of two major characters; and we see the desolate and isolate setting of the town.Overall, this book is not that enticing at all. The themes are very subtle and require either close attention or quite a bit of research, both requiring you to waste some precious time that you might, well, enjoy going to the movies with some friends."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"While reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving, I was reminded of another gothic novel known as To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow takes place centuries ago where a schoolmaster named Ichabod who lives in the town of Sleepy Hollow becomes associated with the myth of the Headless horseman. When Ichabod is at a town meeting, an unexpected visit from the headless horseman becomes appalling and frightens everyone in town; this is where the mystery begins to unravel. The book it is difficult to understand and is challenged by vocabulary. I myself did not like the book because I did not understand it, until I watched the movie and became more involved. I would say however, that this novel may not be exciting nor interesting for everyone; mainly people who like mysterious and suspense themes will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"My first experiences with this Halloween story were on old Halloween records my parents had and of watching the old Disney video in elementary school for Halloween. I realized though that I had never actually read the story itself. So I downloaded the free version on my Kindle.Everyone should know this story, or at least have heard of it. It's about Ichabod Crane, the schoolmaster of Sleepy Hollow, and his run-in with the evil Headless Horseman.This story is very well-written and enjoyable even after such a long time. I was surprised to find that theThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow (Disney Mini Classics) [VHS] was extremely accurate; so if you watch that short movie you will get a very good representation of the story.Most of the story is spent setting things up and some of the descriptions can get a bit drawn-out and boring. At the same time some of the descriptions are also rather amusing and humorous.All in all an excellent story that made for an interesting read. Might get a bit boring at parts for kids, but I was impressed at how funny some parts of it were too. If you get a chance to watch the Disney movie Sleepy Hollow, it is a great movie and really stays true to this story.This free Kindle version had some slight formatting problems in a couple places, nothing too horrible but I did notice them."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Of course the story is a great one, but the illustrations in this book are just beautiful. Very well done and my granddaughters love looking through it."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"There is more to this classic American tale than just an annual Halloween story! Washington Irving has an insightful writing style which puts humanity on display. His characters are realistically flawed with quirks and mischief. While the ghostly tale occurs in a time gone by, the personality traits of his characters live on. Perhaps you will recognize them in the people you know, or maybe even in yourself.The residents of Sleepy Hollow are people who have sought a safe retreat from the trials of life, but even there, they are haunted by a headless horseman! (Or is it their own imaginations and superstitions that haunt them?) There are so many different angles from which you could interpret this geniusly contrived story and that compelling quality contributes to its enduring status as an American classic. From a neurological standpoint the headless horseman could represent any fear that haunts an individual or community of people that drives them to withdraw or hide from its presence. In this case, it's no coincidence that the headless rider seeks a head to conquer as this is his throne of power. Then again, maybe Irving is writing commentary on the clash of cultures between the country and the city. It's interesting that he chooses the image of a headless horseman. On the one hand, it makes a great spooky story. At second glance, if a person was overtaken by one of the four horseman of the apocalypse it would be understandable, but to be defeated by a horseman with no head would be an inglorious thing! (she named the boy Ichabod, saying...the glory has departed) This book is fun, suspenseful, and exposes real human behavior, thoughts, and attitudes."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. It is a quick read and different from the movie. I would recommend this, you can say you have read the actual story."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Well, I certainly won't give anything away, but the movie with Johnny Depp certainly doesn't do it justice. This is certainly a keeper.The only irk I have is at the beginning there is a small sentence or two which was found with the papers for Sleepy Hollow, however, the conversion of this is not very good at all, and one ends up with a bunch of symbols and whatnot that don't mean anything.The book itself is very short, I would say only about 100 pages in real life if you were to buy it in print, but it is well worth the read. The Kindle made it a lot easier to read as well, with the built-in dictionary I was able to look up words I didn't understand with ease."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Gorgeously illustrated, this is the entire version of Sleepy Hollow, made much more entertaining. It makes a great gift."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The story is an adaptation of the original, more or less a hybrid of the old Disney cartoon and the Sleepy Hollow movie starring Johnny Depp, but Gris Grimly's art brings this tale to life. The format borders on graphic novel and the hardcover edition is absolutely beautiful. This book is perfect for Halloween, rearing Gothic children or unusual fairy tale collectors like myself."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I havent read this book since I was a kid and it is as classic as ever."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow strays significantly from many of the retellings of the classic story. I had always expected it to be an innocent and bland work of fiction, but upon reading the story and analyzing it for detail, I was surprised at the darker elements that the cartoon and movie versions of the story failed to yield. It was extremely hard to discern any type of theme or motif from the retellings, but reading the book and taking in all of its rhetorical style, I was able to recognize some definite patterns and messages it hid. The book emphasizes the harmful nature of obsessive beliefs, like the belief of the existence of the Headless Horseman, with which Ichabod Crane is indoctrinated. Irving apparently wants to point out the fact that such preoccupation with legends and superstitions often end in tragedy and the demise of the protagonist; Irving creates a character that is the example of false indoctrination, and concludes the book by bringing the tragic disappearance of Ichabod, which points at the idea that Irving is against the faith Ichabod puts into a myth.Throughout the book, Irving gives obvious examples of some of the dark elements present in the story. In the exposition of the story, Irving warns readers that they are about to enter a sleepy land that is open to many supernatural happenings. The mythical events that happen in the land correspond to ideas of dark romanticism that incorporated nature and fantastical occurrences. However, not the entire book is plagued with dark and serious elements. For example, the character of Ichabod Crane is intended to be a comic figure, because Irving assigns odd characteristics to him, such as an abnormal nose and gangly frame. Through such depictions, Irving creates a Yankee type of character that introduces humor into the otherwise gloomy mood of the story.I would recommend this book because it is an easy read, despite the fact that some vocabulary words are quite uncommon. There are hidden aspects of the book that will be sure to please the reader upon discovering them. Finally, this book is a classic and an overall interesting and unique tale that satisfy the reader."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow written by Washington Irving is a great story to read and tell. Irving's precise descriptions of the setting and the characters paint pictures in your mind. It is very easy to see what is happening. The story is about a schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane, who has a run-in with the towns talked about gohst, the Headless Horseman. This book is funny and would be great to tell to kids around a campfire in the middle of the woods."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Before you know it, this book is over. I found it consisted of two main themes - eating and witchcraft. Sleepy Hollow is a cursed place, where nothing substantial seems to take place except spiritual visions and things of that sort. In addition to the tale of the famous Headless Horseman, there are numerous tales of other local spirits nobody outside of Sleepy Hollow seems to remember.There's one other \\"supposed\\" spirit of Sleepy Hollow that one would be hard-pressed to forget and that's the protagonist of this story. Perhaps no other character in literature is described as well as Ichabod Crane. We're able to know everything about him simply from a few printed words. He's an interesting mixture of ambition and meekness, unlike his counterpart in the Disney adaptation that is only meekness. I can see why Disney left out the ambition of the Ichabod Crane character though, because it's limited to nothing more than endless hearty meals. The man loves to eat more than anybody I've ever seen, and is willing to go against the toughest brute in Tarry Town to fulfill this uncommonly strong desire. But you know, why not? Most grown men desire gold, women, or religous fulfillment; Ichabod wants food. Is it really all that ridiculous of an ambition? I may find it somewhat childish, like the chocolate bit in the Willy Wonka story, but perhaps it shouldn't be. Food is good. Witchcraft is scary. Both are interesting to Ichabod. He's an educated man allowing his life to be guided by these simple ideals, and a part of me is tempted to follow in his footsteps."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"This ghost story is wonderfully told and I highly recommend it to readers of all ages. It is a particularly good read during Halloween. The fact that it is told in third person contributes to its overall good qualitity because I felt as though I was an outside observer watching the characters progress.I enjoyed the plot of this story, for it is a sweet love story in which two men fight to court the beautiful Katrina. Along the way, the town is haunted by the headless horseman, who will defeat anyone who crosses his path. I developed sympathy for Ichabod Crane as he watched the love of his life with the fierce Brom Bones. Described as a social outcast, Ichabod is a lonely person with an overactive imagination. I admire him for his intelligence and determination and I believe that many teens can relate to him today. We have all felt the feeling of rejection, or as though we didn't belong. Even though the situation is not in Ichabod's favor, he perseveres and tries to regain the affections of Katrina. On the other hand, I learned to dislike Brom Bones because he reminded me of a typical bully. With his tough exterior, Brom Bones intimidates many people in the town.The plot is very simple, yet Irving uses an abundance of words to describe his characters. The descriptions of Ichabod, Katrina, and Brom Bones are very specific, allowing readers to appreciate them more and imagine them as real human beings. Irving's language is poetic and he uses imagery continuously. The descriptions are so vivid, that they seem almost dreamlike.The end of the story is magnificent and it startled me because I did not see it coming. Even though the circumstances were not to my favor, I found the ending to be very clever and suspenseful. Personally, I enjoy both love stories and horror films, so this short story met my expectations. It is special because people can relate to it even hundreds of years later. The simple plot mixed with a sophisticated word choice make this story one to be read for generations."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I remember reading this story as a child, how it was frightening and suspenseful at times, but always entertaining and an enjoyable read. Re-reading this classic American story for academic purposes, to my surprise I found that the same feeling still persisted through the years, only this time with a deeper understanding of the rhetorics and it's witty brilliance. Irving's exceptional and unique way of combining suspense and humor makes this story a must read for everyone.The sheer length of the story already got me excited. It's short and a fast-read, but not compromising for its quality. The story primarily deals with a man named Ichabod Crane, a teacher immediately following the American Revolution. Ichabod surrounds himself with beliefs of mystical creatures and legends, such as that of the Headless Horseman. His superstitions are what ultimately brings Ichabod to his downfall. Not only Ichabod, but the entire town is certain that such a creature exists, although no one has uncovered evidence, and as a result myths fly around and everyone is on their toes about the whole issue. This goes to show Irving's primary argument and purpose in this story: that false supersitious beliefs will ultimately lead to ones downfall, as is the case for Ichabod.The overall tone of this story is light and lyrical, with a dash of wit and humor thrown in to add spice. Irving's eloquent and flowy writing makes this story enjoyable just from the sound of the language, and has an unusual combination of freight and suspense with light-hearted humor. Throughout the book, Irving also gives examples of some of the dark elements present in the story. For example, Irving warns readers that they are about to enter a sleepy land that is open to supernatural happenings. The mythical events that happen in the land correspond to ideas of dark romanticism that incorporated fantastical occurrences. However, not the entire book is plagued with dark and serious elements. For example, the character of Ichabod Crane is intended to be comical, because Irving assigns odd characteristics to him, such as an abnormal nose and gangly frame. Through such traits, Irving adds humor that is shown through the character of Ichabod from the otherwise dark and gloomy storyline.All in all, this story is simply a must read for any lover of American literature."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"I bought this CD last Halloween, and I just ordered one as a gift.

Great job Colonial, this truly is as good as it gets!"},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a short and entertaining book which takes the reader on a journey, following the schoolteacher Ichabod Crane and his wild fantasies. The beautiful yet dark setting of Sleepy Hollow creates a curious atmosphere, blending Ichabod's chase after Katrina with his own attempted escape from the headless horseman. The perspective of the story, told through the point of view of a storyteller, gives an interesting view, leaving out parts that the reader must fill in on his or her own. As the reader completes the story, he or she is left with a great mystery which surrounds the ending of the novel, concerning whether the headless horseman was just a hoax created by Brom Bones to scare off Ichabod Crane, or the Galloping Hessian really does haunt the town of Sleepy Hollow. Each reader is allowed to discover his or her own perspective of the story's ending.Although only a short tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow goes beyond the simple bedtime story. The chimerical nature of Ichabod Crane and his hodgepodge of superstitions ultimately lead to his downfall, a detail not easily uncovered with a quick read-through. Irving's criticism of dwelling too long on dreams and fantasies is exposed through the schoolteacher's flaws and supposed death. Even if the reader does not immediately pick up these points, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is still a delightful tale to indulge in.What makes The Legend of Sleepy Hollow such a great book is the author's writing style, which appeals to readers of all ages. Irving creates contrasting moods, setting scenes of joy and gaiety next to gloomy nightmares. He places the lovely home of the Van Tassels in the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow. These contrasts create a beautiful and intricately designed setting for the legend of the headless horseman. Scholarly readers can analyze the effects of the shifts in tone and atmosphere, while younger readers can indulge in Irving's vivid descriptions, picturing themselves feasting with the Van Tassels or riding with Ichabod on his flight from the Galloping Hessian."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Like the meanings and themes hidden within the story, the aesthetic qualities of Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow at first seem beautiful, almost shallow, as Irving conveys his message with misleading nonchalance and dreaminess. The darkly fascinating tale does, in fact, hold several layers of subtle literature, and with each discovery of a new layer comes a completely new understanding of the story, which is, amazingly, comedy, warning, legend, and poetry all masterfully blended into a short piece of writing.Context is extremely important in this story. Some useful background information includes the time period during which this was written: at this time, America was becoming a new country, progressing quickly and shedding its few old traditions for a new, fast-paced lifestyle. Uncomfortable with the quick development of the country, Irving chose to highlight tensions between old beliefs and new ones. The tension is highly palpable in the story, and its main theme addresses this issue, following the path of one main character.Though featuring a relatively simple plot, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow draws its sophistication and merit from Irving's amazing style. A short synopsis: the tale tells of a quirky schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane, who is viewed by most citizens in Sleepy Hollow as an intruder. Most of the time acting gracious and serene, Ichabod, a lover of and believer in supernatural fantasies, becomes a victim of his own overreaching imagination, which induces frequent lapses in understanding and evaluating reality. This thus leads Ichabod to failure in his one aspiration in the tale: to win the hand in marriage of coquette Katrina Tassel, the daughter of a prosperous farmer. His quest, even in its early stages, is not without obstacles, however; local prankster and town hero Brom Bones is equally eager to capture Katrina's affections, and easily exposes Ichabod's tragic flaws and uses them against the teacher. Surprisingly, several characters in this short story are comic figures; Ichabod, for instance, has wildly exaggerated physical features that alleviate the seriousness and depression that comes from many scenes. Because of amusing character descriptions, the story blends perfectly, including both light, carefree moments and dark, satisfying scenes. Successful in creating engaging and unique characters, and a refreshing, though straightforward plot, Irving establishes a solid foundation, on which he adds additional layers of nuance and artistry, for his story.Most thrilling in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is Irving's writing style, which never ceases to delight, amaze, or amuse. The atmosphere constantly changes throughout the story, but Irving always describes it so well that is remains substantial and very real. Dreamy reveries almost overcome the reader when Irving recalls Sleepy Hollow, where he can \\"steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life.\\" It's very easy to float through the story on Irving's lyrical descriptions, which are very flexible in adapting to the necessary mood. Irving's mastery of language is such that every choice of syntax or diction seems to match perfectly the current situation. The literary merit of this work is sensational, with each scene bringing forth a specific emotion when appropriate, and engaging the reader in a riveting collection of exquisite depictions.The few flaws in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow are entirely avoidable, though they require the reader to make an important decision. A casual reader will not notice or miss the hidden themes in the story, but a curious, avid one probably will. Buried under several layers of plot, description, and commentary, the themes are extremely subtle, and almost undetectable sometimes. The story is, definitely, cryptic, and can be unclear, especially because so much of it seems like description, which is seemingly unrelated to the main purpose of the tale. On closer inspection, however, so many themes are interconnected with very minute details that are easily missed. Written in an archaic, sometimes convoluted prose, the story can become obscure. A reader may also find the story to be dragging because of the notion that descriptions of unimportant, and not everything seems to be made clear by the end. This problem relates to characters as well; because a reader doesn't immediately understand what Irving wishes to convey, characters become mysterious; whether Ichabod is a successful hero or a greedy intruder is one ambiguous question for a confused reader. Hints in the language are present, but easily missed. Two solutions exist to this problem. A reader can choose to glaze over the themes in the story, and simply read for the pleasure of absorbing Irving's excellent writing. Just paying no mind to deep interpretations is the first choice. Someone who wants to delve deeper can read the story more closely, and perhaps find literary criticism for further study and clarification. Because of the story's stylistic qualities, both choices are effective ways to enjoy the story.The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is, in general, easy to read, easy to absorb, and extremely entertaining. It blends dark, romantic elements with fun, carefree ones, resulting in an extraordinarily well-written story that feels like a classic legend itself."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"At first glance, Sleepy Hollow may seem like a simple child's fairy tale, but it actually gives us a warning of the future. Superstition controls Ichabod Crane's life and his fears of the headless horseman are ultimately what cause his downfall in the end.Throughout the story, no one is ever quite sure of the headless horseman's existence. Us, being rid of the long ago beliefs of witches and ghosts, find it hard to accept the fact that a ghost without a head riding around on a horse actually exists. We are not afraid of this fantasy because we see it for what it is.In the story's setting, the characters are all believers of the unnatural and unexplainable. They fear the headless horseman even though they have no proof that he actually exists. It is hard for them to think like we do because Ichabod's eloquent descriptions of the superstition in Sleepy Hollow greatly contrast that of reality. With the scientific phenomena being jokingly discussed, superstition is made to seem the fact and science the belief.This story does show the bad sides of being dependent on superstition when Ichabod's fear of the headless horseman leads to his disappearance. This shows us that we need to be careful of what we so readily believe because it can end up hurting us in the end.Even if you do not see these connections when you are reading, the book is still enjoyable. I did though that this book was going to be mainly about the headless horseman attacking the inhabitants of sleepy hollow and was disappointed when i discovered i was wrong. I did come to appreciate the lengthy descriptions of Ichabod, Bones and Sleepy Hollow in the end, though, because it helped me to understand the importance of Ichabod's disappearance."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Although laden with underlying messages about social behavior, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is nevertheless little more than a tale. How Irving elaborately narrates it with a flowing syntax and beautiful imagery only adds to its allure; this tale is among one of the longest-standing classics of children's stories. I would not recommend this story to those seeking novels with deep, thought-provoking philosophies, as this is not one of them. It is, however, very entertaining and easy to read, and the historical backgrounds of Sleepy Hollow adds to the mystery of the story. Only after exploring Ichabod's psyche could one begin to ponder whether the Headless Horseman was, in fact, real, or simply a figment of Crane's wild imagination. Set in a time when witchcraft and superstition ran wild, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow offers a perspective on the dangers of believing the supernatural tales that the townsfolk of Tarry Town so like to share. This is a book to be read for brief enjoyment, but will most likely not have a lasting impression on the life of its reader."},{"Title":"The legend of Sleepy Hollow,","review":"Hearing about the tale for so long from others, I was finally thrilled to get an opportunity to read Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.In this piece, Irving beautifully encompasses the development of the rivalry between the protagonist, Ichabod Crane, and the antagonist, Brom Bones through his descriptive images. He gives the readers each of the characters' motives and aspirations in life which makes it easier to relate to both Ichabod and Bones. The aspect of the tale that amazed me the most is Irving's utilization of semi-colons to depict his characters. Although it may be grammatically incorrect, with more than six semi-colons in one sentence, everything seems to flow together nonetheless. Every detail of the characters is included, allowing the readers to develop their own opinions about their liking of the characters physically and mentally. Because the reader knows so much about the characters, Irving's humor is heightened by his overexaggeration of the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the characters. By predominately focusing on the characters and their behaviors, Irving entwines many of his themes subtly, amplifying the effect of the themes when the reader finally realizes his intention in writing The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Finishing the story in less than an hour or two, I was stumped when I got to the last page. The whole meaning of the story flew right past my head and I did not understand the story's meaning whatsoever, frustrated that I could not understand the point of the story. Because of Irving's clever approach, it seemed as though it was merely a superficial story-tale; but in reality, there were many themes ranging from the detrimental effects of denial to jealousy present only when the reader delves deeper into the text. Once the reader begins to comprehend The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, there is no turning back; everything falls into place and they are definitely going to be awed by how well it is written.Even though at times I was irritated that his antiquated writing made the plot even more difficult to read, I recommend this story to anyone that is willing to take the extra effort to fully comprehend the entire piece. It is futile to read it superficially because they will not gain anything from the story; but it will be worthwhile in the very end if they do take the extra time to do so, personally guaranteeing that they will be amazed at Irving's cleverness and skills."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"There is something both mundane and exciting about this book. I read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story and the author has put so much research into it. A must-read for all women interested in prehistoric culture and even men who don't mind books with a good believeable heroine.I first started this book when I was 17 but couldn't get into it at first because of the apparent mundanity of the story. But I discovered later that the beauty is in the details with this book. The characters and the author's descriptions of the landscape and culture of the people are just wonderful.I highly recommend this as an addition to a fantasy collection."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'd love to carry all the series on my Kindle! Please do it as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A good story, told very well. There are hints of some of the problems that show up in the later books (repetition, soap opera, dry explanation of the flora/fauna/history, unnecessary heroics on the part of Ayla), but they are just hints. The story here in the first episode is very tight. Surprisingly, Auel is willing (and able) to be a bit depressing in the last 30% and still pull off a powerful and satisfying ending. For once in the series, things do seem real and believable."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wholeheartedly recommend this series of books. They are so different from the other novels out there. Aside from the interesting (although sometimes very lengthy) descriptions of the prehistoric landscape, the storyline is compelling. I could not put these books down!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I ordered all the 5 books that have been published so far in this series. The author writes very well and has done her homework on this era of history. Great love story also."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My mom had a copy of this book when I was younger and this series were some of the first adult books I ever read. I wasn't sure if I would still enjoy the story now but I couldn't put it down!A young girl, Ayla (one of the Others) is found alone and wounded by a medicine woman of the Clan, Iza. She is taken in by the Clan and raised as one of them. As a result of being different she makes many dangerous mistakes and behavioural errors but also finds friendship among the Clan. Ayla's struggles to fit in lead others to question the accepted ways and what \\"normal\\" is.I found the characters easy to relate to despite the novel being set in prehistoric times. The story revolves around fitting in and how much a person can change who they are, or if they should. I will be reading the rest of the series again, and the fifth one for the first time!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Hands down, Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the best books I've ever read, and it changed the way I write and think about the world. Jean M. Auel's research into her subject is amazing, she actually describes ancient technology with such accuracy and detail that you could repeat the experiments yourself. Nothing is cheesed up or flowery, you feel like you could be looking through a hole in the fence that lets you peek into Ayla's world. Some may argue that long descriptions of making medicine, cooking or other aspects of daily life are boring, but it added to the realism for me.Characters such as Creb, Ayla and Isa may have simple names, but they are in no way simple. Each is multi-layered and interesting, and it's impossible for me to pick a favorite to read about. Even Broud, the main antagonist, has his likeable moments, and he's one character that's easy to love to hate.Auel manages to pull off a strong heroine without falling into the same trap so many other authors do in making their women Mary-Sues. Auel is realistic about Ayla's hardships and shortcomings, like the fact that, compared to the Clan, she is an incredibly slow learner, very ugly and taller than most men.The world in which Ayla lives is so well fleshed out that it feels tangible. The rituals, the manner of choosing totems and the living arrangements of the Clan are interesting to read in of themselves, but the detail in which they are described paints a clear picture. Auel even describes the louse treatment the clan uses, and the ritual for marriage and mating.In all, I'd recommend that everyone should read this book at least once in their lives. (That is, once you are old enough to get past the very blunt and graphic details that Auel portrays.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book and the entire series. It gives an educated glimpse into history. I am not a scientist and cannot verify any of the things written to be true; but anyone who has even a slight interest in prehistory ,or just a good story, should look at these books. I have always been a fan of series books and these have a good continuity and satisfying endings. There is a great deal of mysticism running throughout and should be taken \\"as is\\", that is, conjecture on the part of the author. The sex scenes can be embarrassing but the story supports the attitudes of the people as just another natural human condition."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Cave of the Clan Bear is well written. It moves quickly. The descriptions of the venue are detailed enough to draw the reader into the scene and the little girl's trials are believable."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book back in the 1990s and was hooked on the series. Love the ancient period it covers and especially that the main character is a woman. Jean Auel characters are believable and interesting. Great series. The only thing I don't like in the books, is the over description on some things, which, in my opinion, can go over the top. I decided not to read the latest book, after reading the reviews which are pretty poor, as I didn't want to spoil the experience. I am now re-reading the first three books in Kindle."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book starts a bit slow but then really grabs your attention. The first in a series of \\"Earth's Children\\" by Jean M. Auel, it tells the story of a girl in caveman days who loses her family and her clan and finds another clan who looks at her as an outsider, but accepts her because the the strengths of the medicine woman and shaman."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Loved this book from the very beginning; just reading about Ayla and her struggles and victories. She overcomes so much having to prove herself. Ayla is one of the only heroine's I truly admire. She is humble and modest and proves herself not by bragging but through her actions and accomplishments."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was gift for a friend who loves the writings of Jean Auel. My friend had trouble putting the book down and now wants to own the series. Everything the seller listed was factual and the book was very quickly shipped."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I first read this book back in the 80s, I was in heaven. It was one of a handful of books that I truly loved. Then the sequals sprang and I was thouroughly disappointed. This is a truly great novel, but the other books are not near as good and infact, some are just wretched. I recommend this book and no others. The author never did know what to do with the series. She just repeats things that already happened and the other books barely have plots. However, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"the earth children series was a wonderful read,I din'nt want to put it down and I did'nt want it to end.very entertaining.and their is a book 6."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is about very early humans (before homo sapiens) and their way of living & governing themselves. I don't know how much of it is true, but it is very engrossing."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book a few years back but couldn't resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account.Jean Auel is one of my favorite authors. I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I actually bought this book to replace the original that my mother gave away years ago.Clan of the Cave Bear and it's characters have stayed with me since I first read it in 1980 while I was at school. Jean's descriptive passages really took me to the cave. I felt as if I knew the characters - some I loved and some I hated with passion. Ayla really got under my skin. I re-read it before I read \\"Valley of the Horses\\" to get back into the 'mood'. I have to admit, I re-read each book (all the previous books) before I read the next one. I have been in love with this series and these characters since the first day I started reading this series.I was privileged to meet Jean when her \\"Land of the Painted Caves\\" came out a couple of years ago. She felt like a kindred spirit to me. I am so glad that she was able to finish the series.Please, if you enjoy history (at least one version of it) and really get into characters, read this book and then read the series. This series is my secret guilty pleasure and one I have gone back to time and again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend suggested this book as something that I would like. I have to admit that I did not like any of her previous choices for me, but this book was excellent. I read it in two days and could not put it down. It was described in such beautiful detail that at times I felt as if I was right there with the characters having the experiences with them. I would tell anyone that may be interested in a period of history seldom ever discussed that this is your kind of read. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first book I have read in many years. I can't put it down and it's super good. I purchased all 4 and I cant wait to read them all."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had heard about this book several times before I read it, by people telling me I would like this because of my tastes, I enjoy historical fiction.This book did NOT disappoint! Jean M. Auel's prose is rich and descriptive (perhaps a bit too descriptive for some, but it suited me just fine!) so that it was very, very, very easy for me to imagine the settings, from the hunting grounds to the cave, to the setting of the Gathering of the Clans, and so on and so forth. Not only that, but smaller details also bring this setting to life - the plants that Iza and Creb use in their medicine/magic, the creation of hunting implements or clothing, Clan traditions and ceremonies, and what have you.Life is not easy for Ayla since she is an Other, a Cro-Magnon and the only one in a Clan of Neanderthals. She is adopted by Iza who treats her as her own child, even after she has a daughter of her own, Uba. Ayla is raised to be a medicine woman, and while she lacks the Clan memories, Iza notes that she is quicker to learn, so what she lacks for in inherited memory, she makes up for in the ability to acquire new things. This is noted more than once and not just by Iza, since the wise Mog-ur himself understands that it is this ability to learn that will ensure the survival of Ayla and her species and unless the Clan gain/foster at least some of this ability, they will become extinct even with their inherited memories.Ayla for the most part manages to fit in with the Clan. Her medicinal abilities become respected, and she learns to live with/deal with the intense patriarchal society of the Clan. Most of the men respect her, but every story needs an antagonist, and we get one hell of an antagonist here - Broud, the son of the Clan chief. He is an overall stinker, but he takes most of it out on Ayla because he feels threatened by her despite the fact that Ayla does not try to purposely antagonize him. He does pretty terrible things to her, but Ayla prevails and gains more respect after a particular ordeal.With the richness of setting, characters, and story, this is a book that you simply can not go wrong with. There are five more books in this series, but this one remains the best of them all."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am in love with this book and the other books in this series. Some people say I'm too young to read this book, but i think even young people will enjoy this book. Ayla is my idol!She is so brave and smart. After reading this book I now want to become a writer and a arcaeologist!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Some one had to twist my arm to make me start to read it but when I started I was hooked. I was fascinated by the story, the characters and all the fantastic research that gave a feel of authenticity to the context.Just don't get started with it if you don't have time to read within the following weeks since you won't be able to stop and hop on to the next book. You can skip the last one which does not add anything to story and instead take a plane / train to France to visit the painted caves.Enjoy !"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love the start of a life journey of these characters! They're like old friends to me. I can always count on this book series to be interesting, educational, and to hold my attention without being dramatic or unrealistic- not that there aren't dramatic parts, because their are- but the drama in this series is based on an entire life unfolding rather than a short time span like most books are. The characters are ones I have fallen in love with. This book is how it all started- and the characters are present, if only in memory, for the rest of Ayla's life in the entire series. The stories here are what shape an incredible character. LOVE."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am re-reading this book. First read it more than 25 years ago. Fascinating as are the rest of Jean Auel's series. Very well researched and interesting"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am currently still reading this book. I'm having a great time reading it and I love how every scene is so perfectly described and full of details.It's one of those books that you have to stop reading now and then, so that you can let your imagination fly and Imagine how would you survive in such conditions and time period.Simply fantastic."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Now I'm that kind of a person who usually goes against the stream and rates a 5-star rated book with 1 star. But despite this fact, I'm rating this book 4 stars, which happens very rarely (unless you're talking about Tolkien, of course).The book has some small problems. Auel does burden the reader with lots and lots of unuseful (for me, at least) information. Sometimes, her narrative stops and gives way to a 4 page lecture on different plants and stuff. Sometimes Auel gets too carried away and her plot gets a little strange. So in order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to know how to skim through books. When you see a plant lecture coming, just skip it and go on. If you take these lectures out, you will get a very gripping book.I must admit that the author had the needed effect on me. When I'm supposed to be nervous, I was nervous, and when something interesting and important was going on, I just couldn't tear myself off the book.Most of these low-star ratings are from people who can't skim through boring material. Believe me, I couldn't do it before, and that's why I hate so many books which don't deserve it. Try reading it at least, if you get through the first 100 pages and you still don't like, then don't try going further - it won't help."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book when I was around eleven years old, couldn't put it down, and within four months I had read all four of them (Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage). All four books are beautifully written and they create a very believeable ice age world. Don't be put off by the number of pages, all of those pages are needed and none of them are dull.While it's true that it's quite fanciful to think that one woman would have been the first person to do all the things that Ayla does (if you read the books, you will know what I mean), the series is, after all, a work of fiction. I think it's that fancifullness (is that a word?) that makes Ayla's story so enjoyable.Clan of the Cave Bear, by itself, is a good book, but I find the next books more interesting. If you read part of Cave Bear, and think at all that you'd like to skip to the next book, don't. I wouldn't advise trying to read any of the other books without having read the previous ones. There is so much information and... feeling, that would be lost if you didn't read the whole series, in order.So, if you're looking for a book that can take you away to life as it was thousands and thousands of years ago with main characters you can cheer for (and a bad guy that you'd like to see thrown off a cliff), you will probably like this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is part of a very moving series about what ancient history could have been like for the cro-mags as they moved in on the neanderthals (cavemen). This book is very touching and is filled with descriptions that show evidence of her extensive research about what prehistoric Europe might have been like. It's also a good escapist story for bored people or college students like me to read in our spare time. Actually I'd recommend this to anybody whos willing to take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I saw the movie and was not interested in reading the book. My sister gave it to me and promised it was a good book and that I would love it. She understated! I couldn't put it down. I immediately purchased the rest of the series. I read the entire series over the summer of 2000 and am going to read it again this year. I yearn for the fifth book, but I understand the author is very ill and I wish her well.Besides being an absorbing adventure, this story is painstakingly researched. Ms. Auel's knowledge of healing herbs and plants is impressive. It was also interesting to learn how primitive people probably foraged for food and what kinds of things they may have eaten (water lily tubers, for example) I was thoroughly entertained and got an education at the same time. My favorite kind of read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm sure everyone already knows the plot, so I'll skip that. this thoroughly - researched, impossible - to - resist book is my favorite book ever - and, since I read over half an hour every day, that definitely is saying a lot. One of those books that, very so often, you feel the urge to read it over and over again until you're sick of it (at least for now!) I love and admire the characters, especially (of course) Ayla. The rest of the series goes just the tiniest bit downhill, but they are still some of the best books ever. Other great authors, if you have some time on your hands, are Linda Schuler,Lynn McKee, Kage Baker, Marrion Bradley, Michael Crichton, Tamora pierce...ah, forget it. there are too many to list."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 20 years. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Yes, this book, as with its 3 sequels, has depictions of sex and emotions that hard-core scientific types may find unfitting in a description of prehistoric man. But Auel brings a human light to a people who for most of us, are nothing more than bones scientists dig up. I really think that this book is a must read. I read it first as a teenager when it first came out and 9 years later, I am waiting for the fifth (and final?) installment in the series, and this book is a captivating must-read. Even now after having read it half a dozen times, it has an almost mystical quality to it, and it will transport the reader to a different world."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What can I say ! When my boyfriend recommended this series to me (he's read it twice), I was indifferent. I'd seen the film years before &amp; it was o.k, but the book really was something else ! I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it &amp; then I'd run straight out to buy the next one. The characters &amp; descriptions are so real you feel like you're reading a history book written by someone who was there. Ayla the main character is what most women would like to be, intelligent,gutsy,&amp; completely captivating ! Throughout the book you can't wait for her to grow up because you know she is going to be a woman like no other on earth. This book is: informative, romantic, angering, gut-wrenching, &amp; will leave you wanting more ,more, more ! And guys, this isn't just a book for the girls, I've seen far more men reading this than anyone. Believe me, I've had people run up to me in cafes, on the beach, on buses, everywhere, &amp; all over the world to tell me that they also have read the book &amp; how brilliant it is. This book gives you an insight into how the world really was &amp; how life could have developed into what we are today. Please read this book or you'll regret it when everyone else has !"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (\\"the clan\\") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really enjoyed the Clan of the Cave Bear because it was descriptive and interesting. The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This has definitely become a cult classic. I really liked the book the first time around, and it is a compelling story, but it definitely has some flaws. One of the biggest is Auel's writing. Her story ideas are good, but the execution is not great. Oh, let's face it, she writes like a tenth grader. An imaginative tenth grader, to be sure, but a tenth grader just the same. With that in mind, the best audience for this book is the high school crowd. Ayla has that whole teen rebellion thing going. As I've gotten older, she keeps getting less sympathetic. Seriously, it almost seems like she goes out of her way to get into trouble, and that whole &quot;she was different, she couldn't help it&quot; line just sounds like an excuse for her lack of self-control. Just because one has the ability to break every rule of their society, doesn't mean one should, but she's smart,blonde and pretty, so we'll build a series around her.&lt;sigh&gt;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"WARNING! If you start on this book you'll probably be just as captivated as I was and move on to the others. BIG MISTAKE! Once you've read the 2nd book you'll be hooked.....& then comes the trouble.First let me say that I'm a sucker for all types of adventure stories and that the adventures contained in the \\"Earth's Children\\" books (4 of which I've read) are fun and hard to resist; that's why they've been so popular.The problem is the writing. Jean Auel is a terrible, I repeat TERRIBLE writer who came up with a good, fun idea. Some Amazon reviewers criticize her work because her main characters are \\"Stone-Age Super Heroes\\". I say: \\"so what, that's one thing that makes them fun & exciting\\". Who cares that her 2 protagonists invented just about everything useful to help push man (and woman) through the Stone Age? Who cares that they have a natural compassion, sense of equality and pacifist philosophy that can only be matched by Jimmy Carter? Who cares that their personal hygiene is up to 20th century standards even though they lived 25,000 yrs. ago? These books are historical, FICTIONAL adventure stories.However the \\"historical\\" part is where Jean Auel gets into so much trouble.Auel tries to overcome her poor writing ability by making two additional HUGE errors. The first is by repeating and rehashing in every book, circumstances, events, information and experiences (not to mention sex scenes) to a degree that is so beyond exasperating it absolutely ventures well into nauseating.Her second monumental blunder is caused by her extensive research in the Botanical, Anthropological and Archeological fields. For some reason beyond my limited comprehension, Jean Auel must think that the more banal historical minutiae she includes in her fictional \\"super-hero\\" adventure stories, the more credibility she gains as an author. She could not be more wrong. I can only describe my frustration in reading the 4th book with the analogy of what they say about men who drive fancy, expensive cars...... they're trying to make up for a \\"short\\"-coming they know they have.In each book these two problems get worse and worse. By the end of the 4th book you'll be tearing your hair out.....I promise! Again, not because the story itself isn't enjoyable but because the repetition and plant and landscape information & descriptions are so tedious and cumbersome that they take most of the pleasure out of plot. After reading reviews of the 5th book, my impression is that it's just as bad as the 4th.Jean Auel doesn't realize that MOST of her readers ARE NOT going to start with the 3rd, 4th or 5th books. Most people like to start at the beginning. She also has NO concept that those same readers are there for the plot and characters, not for the research. But if we can learn a little about the evolution of the earth, it's human, animal and plant life development and value along the way....GREAT!In comparison, when we pick up a Harry Potter book, we acquire some knowledge on magic, folklore, myths and legends. But that information is not what captivates us. It's the excitement of the characters, their interaction and the plot. If we wanted text book information, we wouldn't be reaching for a fiction novel, would we? You and I know this, luckily for her, J.K. Rowling knows this but unfortunately Ms. Auel doesn't. Because of this, the \\"Earth Children\\" popularity will not stand the test of time.I guess my biggest question is \\"Where are the editors?\\" Does Auel put up the money to publish these monstrosities? The \\"The Plains of Passage\\" is 760 pages; it should and could have been cut by 250 pages.If you want some truly GREAT adventure stories or series' reach for The Leather Stocking Tales, The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Sackett Stories, The Wrinkle in Time Quartet, Harry Potter, The Adventures of Alan Quartermain or The Martian Tales, Discworld, Horatio Hornblower or The Master and Commander Series anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexander Dumas or Jules Vern. My list is almost endless.I'll grant you that anything written in the 18th or 19th centuries are more difficult to read but they are SO much more rewarding. However, there's still plenty of truly great adventure writing for you to enjoy from the 20th century.In short the \\"Earth Children\\" Series just doesn't measure up. As much as I love Ayla and Jondalar, I don't think I'm going to read the 5th or upcoming 6th books. If I do, not only will I mostly just be skimming the pages without quotation marks but the books themselves will be read between classics, dramas and adventures written by authors who have an understanding of not just what their readers want but rather what their genre requires."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"...you're really missing out!First off, let me announce to those who are not aware that BOOK FIVE IS COMING OUT IN MAY 2002!... The entire series is excellent, but you MUST 'begin at the beginning' with COTCB. Jean Auel's carefully detailed prehistoric world - how they hunted, worshipped, cooked, and lived - is endlessly facinating to me. The characters really come to life and this - the first book in the series - sets the tone for the next three books.I almost envy those of you who have not yet read them - you're in for a special treat!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Never I have read a book which brought out such strong feelings of emotion. A tale of humanity, love, hatred, jealously and conflict. Whilst reading this book I lived and breathed the lives of the earth's children. I smiled when Ayla became accepted by the Clan, laughed at the thought of the children tugging at Brun's beard, felt awe and love for Creb's wisdom and compassion and cried at Iza's last words of love to Ayla. Words fail to describe a book which I'm sure will be remembered as a classic of our time. Better than any history lesson could ever hope to achieve this tale of humanity brought our heritage to life. Please MS Auel put your readers at rest and bring on the fifth book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of Ayla and her adoption by a tribe of proto-humans is a compelling one. One wonders, while reading this book, if events such as this might have happened once long ago, and bones found of a young boy by archaeologists which were half human and half Neanderthal seem to suggest it did happen. And in this tale, too, one can see the possibilities of how the other proto-human species might have been different from homo-sapiens, and this is a good look at how a culture might have developed that would make it difficult for such a species to survive the coming cataclysms of earth. While Ayla is an exaggerated figure, more of an archetype of what the newer human race represented against the older Neanderthal, I did find her likeable.However, while I did find the story itself compelling, at many times the writing got in the way. This book would have been well served by a copy-editor who could have clarified sentences and cleaned up grammar and punctuation. The constant activity of my \`mental editor' as I read through sentences and mentally re-phrased them, or placed correct punctuation where it should have been, or took it from where it obscured the words made it difficult to really get into the book. I think this story would have seemed so much better if it hadn't been for the cumbersome nature of running into so many errors through the text.Perhaps in later editions this has been corrected; the copy I read was an older one.The ending left me a bit cold. While I was satisfied at some developments, it didn't seem like a true ending. Yes, I understand that this is a trilogy, but this book doesn't stand alone, and without the book following it, I'm left with a sense of incompletion. I kept expecting/hoping that perhaps \`The Others' which are mentioned throughout the book might show up at some point, that she might see one of her own kind...but no, I suppose that's for the next book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This novel was gripping. What can I say... I couldn't put it down. And that is probably why I am sitting here at 12:30 at night wishing that I had the sequel. It has an unbelievable cast of characters; Ayla, the orphaned Homo sapien child with spirit, pride, and the unique ability to shed tears and laugh, Iza, the Neanderthal medicine woman who begged for the clan leader to take her in, Creb, the crippled old holy magician that agreed to provide for them both, Broud the heir, a neanderthal male chauvinistic pig who is driven slightly insane (at least that is my perception) by everything that Ayla does and represents, along with a host of other, equaly intriguing memorable characters too numerous to meantion.In the society these people live in Men are entirely dominent. In an almost animalistic structure, the lowliest male is socially higher then the highest female. This might infuriate a great deal of the women who read this book, except for the fact that Auel as author manages for the deeper meaning to come across. She shows that the Neanderthals are a dying race, so set in their ways, so psychologically unable to change that the dominence is no longer a Slight. It is the Way Things Are. But Ayla, as a child of the newer species, is not totally able to come to terms with this. No matter how obedient she is, there is something about her, her pride and confidence, that shows through. And this angers our antagonist Broud to no end. Because he knows, deep down, that she is more than he is.CLAN is full of struggle and strife and all that good stuff. Will the strange child be allowed to stay? Will Broud break her spirit? What will happen when Iza has her child? Will she have to leave the hearth of Creb? And if that happens who will take Ayla?This novel spans more than a decade and I as the reader felt that it did every moment justice. If it were a meal I would be content right now. But man, I have to get my hands on the next one. This one ended with such a cliff hanger! -Eli@"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is undeniably an enjoyable read, but it has its share of flaws: the plot, for one thing. Perhaps inventive in 1980, it now seems familiar. The problems Ayla runs into and their solutions are predictable. Nothing shocking ever seems to happen.However, the setting is an innovation. Anyone interested in prehistoric life will delight in the richly detailed, painstakingly researched descriptions of Neanderthal life. It is these accounts that separate CLAN from other stories of survival and belonging and constitue much of its appeal. However, details of prehistoric life cannot engage the reader forever. Auel seems obsessed with the most minute details of clan life, and page after page of description about herbal remedies, the process of toolmaking, strange fauna, etc. soon begin to read like essays: Auel seems to want to dump as much information as possible onto her readers. As a result, the actual plot is interspersed with long, dry, boring passages of description that have little significance to readers not interested in archaeology.Auel's narrative style is interesting. Instead of using POVs, she assumes an omnipresent narrative and relates CLAN in a fashion that reminded me of informal storytelling. The approach works surprisingly well, increasing the &quot;prehistoric feel&quot; of the book. However, Auel makes it impossible to become completely absorbed in the setting by scattering the book with anachronisms. Perhaps excusable in the narrative, the words stick out like sore thumbs when used by characters in dialogue. It's difficult to accept the Neanderthals as prehistoric men when they use words such as &quot;menstrual cycle&quot; and &quot;arthritis&quot;.Still, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is a fun read. The characters are well-drawn. Ayla especially is sympathetic, likable, and a worthy protagonist. Her relations with the clan members are real and moving, and there are some genuinely emotional scenes.Anyway, CLAN makes a good afternoon's entertainment, although it didn't leave me with much of an impression. For anyone interested, know that although there is some resolution at the end of CLAN, Ayla's story is far from over: we are left hanging. If you're the sort that hates to be left in suspense, consider having a copy of the next book in hand."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What a marvelous book. I loved the journey this novel took me on and the prehistoric setting was so beliveable.Jean M. Auel is a wonderful story teller and it's a colourful and wonderful world she's given us in this novel, setting it in the ice age.It was gripping, reading about Ayla's journey from a young child to adulthood and the trials she faces living with the Neanderthal tribe who found her.There is everything one could ask for in a novel, adventure, fun, danger, jealousy and love and romance.I especially liked the extensive research J.M.A. has done, and her detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla, was extremely fascinating.I have read the entire series and must say it was riveting.There are 5 books in all:1:The Clan of the Cave Bear2:The Valley of Horses3:The Mammoth Hunters4:The Plains of Passage5:The Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I reread this book recently after having read it for the first time 15 years ago and I enjoyed it again. The setting is somewhere in Eastern Europe about 35,000 years ago. The premise is that 2 divergent human species occupy Europe at that time. After a horrible earthquake, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear finds an orphaned and injured young girl of the \`Other' type of humans. Ayla is cared for and loved by the aged and scarred priest Creb and his medicine woman sister Iza who act as her parents. But she looks different and her way of thinking is different than the ways of her adoptive people, (presumably Neanderthals, while she herself is Cro-Magnon?) and she struggles for acceptance.The story covers approximately 9 years of Ayla's life from the age of 5 until the age of 14. Although we are lead to believe that she was born to people that are taller, more agile and more innovative than the Clan people, Ayla is the only person of her kind that we encounter in this story. The traits of Ayla's people are determined based on her fragmented memories and her own emerging talents as she grows. The Clan people are stockier and stronger than Ayla and communicate mostly with sign language while Ayla recalls communicating verbally.The Clan people rely heavily on inherited memory and have clearly defined gender roles, which Ayla continually grapples with. She cannot restrain her curiosity and she is constantly challenging the rules with her aberrant behavior. Ayla wants to learn to hunt with a sling, but it is forbidden. She learns the art of healing from her new mother, but because she is not a birth daughter, the members of the clan have reservations. She has a grasp of mathematics and the gift of sight that would make her a good priestess, but that path is not open to women.We have all felt out of place and therefore everyone can identify somewhat with Ayla. I liked Ayla's spirit and the way she excels at everything she sets her mind to. I particularly loved the herb lore and descriptions of tribal living in the cave. I like learning how the clan hunted, clothed themselves and managed to live through winters. The religious ceremonies were nicely drawn and the funeral descriptions give a sense of the spirituality of our evolutionary forefathers. A warning to readers that there is some sexual violence in this novel.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"it is the 2nd book i read from this series(i read the 5th book first)..it is certainly the best book of the series and i am rather disappointed by the quality of the other 4 books after i read this, it talks about the life of ayla in the clan(considered animals by people), her unusualness, and her life there, and it does not have the scenary description like in her other 4 books, a truly must read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've re-read this book yet once again.

Thanks for the great read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the most different books of a series that I have ever read before and I truly LOVED it! Clan of the Cave Bear is action-packed,and very engrossing all the way through from beginning to end.The story centers around the little girl, Ayla, who loses her family in an earthquake and is left alone all by herself at 5 years old trying to survive. She becomes ill and survival becomes almost impossible. Finally, she sees a cave, and sees acave lion. She gets away, but then passes out unconscious.The Clan is hunting and they see her. Yet, most of them don't want to help her because she is not one of &quot;THEM,&quot; she is born to the &quot;OTHERS.&quot; However, Iza, a member of the clan has a heart and takes her with them, whether the other members like it or not. She helps Ayla to get back on her feet, but they wonder where she comes from.The Clan about has to take her in, against many of their wishes with the exception of Iza, who has always loved her. The Clan adopted her a ways into the story, but not without hatred by some. Especially Broud.Ayla learns Clan ways of living. Women are subserbviant to men, ALWAYS. Yet Ayla at times rebels and gets many punishments along the way. Broud, is the one who most of all, HATES Ayla with a passion and is always making constant trouble for her.Ayla does learn many skills along the way in this first book of the series so that she can survive on her own. don't wish to tell too much here in the review though, as to ruin the story for some of you who are looking to read the book. As you read along you will see how the whole story ties in together with the basic facts I mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end. I laughed and cried and got mad and then recovered and then did the emotions all over again.A good read is a book that allows the reader to learn (as I definitely did about prehistoric times and about botany) and also to love the characters like Creb, Iza, and of course the main character Alya. To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious. I am already on page 200 of the next book to read after this one. &quot;The Valley of the Horses&quot;. I love it also and can't wait to see what is going to happen next! What a wonderful series! See ya on this review board on the current book when I am finished!:)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The mysteries of the first book in The Earth's Children series are a magnificient way to keep the readers coming.

WE'LL EAT! (and i'm not even a hunter). the later books seemed to suffer a little. perhaps victims of success? ............ though i'd buy the next one in a second! hats off to ms. auel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first 6 chapters of the book may seem boring to the average reader, but the story gets more appealing to the point you can't put the book down, mostly around the 10th chapter. Though the character names may be confusing and hard to remember, the book does have a name and description for each character either in the front or back of the book. As the story moves through the chapters, you will find yourself more familiar with the characters and who they are. I found the detailed descriptions of how the characters lived with Mother Nature fascinating! The reader will begin to appreciate modern life and fantasize what it must have been like living in the great outdoors. In addition, Jean Auel is not shy about detailing mating rituals and such. All her books will fascinate the history hater as they move through time, teaching the reader the ways of the people while following a love story written with great fire and passion. Steep yourself a cup of home made tea - mix some sprigs of anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, fruit peel grinds, and honey and kick back and read her well written visually detailed books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT?

I somehow managed to...skip over parts, so when I read it again, I got a whole new storyline. I have managed to read it at least once a month, and I rant about it incessantly. Just ask my friends."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"To write a book set entirely tens of thousands of years ago and not make it a bunch of flaky porn full of scantily clad cavefolk is a feat in itself and it is one that Jean Auel accomplishes with style. Truthfully, you could juxtapose this story into almost any time period and it would speak just as clearly of a person's struggle for individualism in a narrow society. Auel is incredibly imaginative in her descriptions of the Clan's customs, communication, and other folkways, as is her creation of characters with names such as Creb, Iza, Brun and Broud. At the same time, she writes with such intelligent awareness of anthropological fact, taking digs at places like Shanidar Cave and creating colorful human lives from bones."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this, the first in the Earth Children Series, and was immediately hooked! These books are written with such attention to detail, and are so obviously well-researched that you really get a good visual and feel for what the early human experience may have been like. (Some items are obviously not plausible, but they are few and far between.)Yet, even with the full attention to detail, and somewhat lengthy descriptions of the surroundings, the books are easy to read and enjoy. They are a true pleasure and my only complaint is that I am still waiting for the sequel six years after having read the series!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book for the first time while in college. It was purely for entertainment purposes, but it brought out a sense of who I am as a young woman.

I STRONGLY recommend this book to other young women trying to find an identity."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just read all four books in the series again, and I think they are exceptionally well written. I urge everyone to read them. One small word of warning. Leave a couple of weeks in between books.

Yes, it was a little mature for me, but i fell in love with the story, no, legacy of Ayla. I'm in college now and the entire series is still simply sensational to me! Her strength, determination, and modesty is an example for us all. Whenever I have the urge to read something and have no new novels, I return to this or one of the other novels in this series.

The author of this book is Jean M. Auel. I would say that this book is fabulous. Also from a one to ten rating, I'd have to say that this book, at least deserves a top ten. The whole story takes place in the time of the cave men and cave women, which really amazes me. It sounds so amazingly beautiful where they live. It is so much nicer to read a book like this one because it lets you imagine their world and what it was like back then instead of reading a book which leads you to thinking all about the cities and all of the bad things in this world. Therefore, this book takes me away, and I think that's one of the neat things books can do for you.The whole story is about a young girl named Ayla and all of the things she goes through and experiences after the loss of her parents . After a while of barely surviving, another clan comes across Ayla and finally decides to rescue her. Ayla is about seven at the time. Ayla is from a clan with very different ways as opposed to this one and she speaks their language. As Ayla continues to grow into a woman she finds herself very different from the other women in their clan. She is very strong and skilled. She loves to do things that only the men are allowed to do, like hunting. She's even better than the other men are. At first, she is beaten for even talking about these things.I really enjoyed reading this book. I think that this is a book that everyone should read because it teaches you so much. It is a very interesting book. In some ways, it lets you experience things you might have never experienced, just by reading this book. Even though it's about things so long ago, it still seams so realistic. Whether you're interested in it because it takes place so long ago and it has to do with the cave men and cave women, or for the survival in it, or then the spiritual and down to earth ways about it, whatever the reason, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"they are really splended! i just hope that jean m auel can write the follow up to the last one..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is an unusual heroine.

I rate this series right up there with Tolkien (LORD OF THE RINGS) and Herbert (DUNE) for creating a wonderful world of fantasy, except this one could be true!

Besides that the books are EXCELLENT. I began reading them when I believe I was 12 and I've fallen in love with them!

Why? Because I miss Jean M. Auel's characters. They inspired me to go on a journey with them in Jr. High, after the birth of my first son in 1985, and now. I walked through a bookstore and recognized them as 'old friends'. Since I knew the ending, I read it this time with a clear eye on Auel's style. The novel's strong setting and physical descriptions are what really draws the reader in, as well as the interaction of the characters. I was just as entertained as the first time I read it, maybe more, since I now realize all the hard work that goes into writing a book.Chrissy K. McVay'author of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The author Jean M. Auel wrote this book to take you back to the cave days. The author gives you a vision of the past through her writing. She writes in such great detail you can almost feel as if you were there with the characters. The Clan of the Cave Bear is changed with the presence of a new comer to the clan that is a female and looks totally different from the rest of the clan. Ayla is from the others and is faced to adapt to the new customs of the clan and it becomes a long tough journey for her. Ayla does things that women can't do and is faced with death if caught. Ayla is tall with blond hair, colored yes and is very smart. I give this book two thumbs up because it's very well written. It's good from beginning to the end. You will be able to vision how cave people lived during that time. It was a difficult life style and it's so amazing how they survived. Trust me you won't want to put this book down because it is full of adventure. I don't read much and I was able to read it, finish it, and enjoy it as well. Give it a try you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the better book series out there. You grow to love the characters, and they are quite realistic. Talk about going back in time because of a book! Jean Auel has a wonderful way of doing that for the reader. Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was only ten years old when my mom urged me to read this beautiful work. It was a little overwhelming at parts, but I've never regretted. The pure soul that Auel gives her characters is something that has been achieved by few other writers I've read. The work and passion that she has put into this world she's re-created is astounding. Although scientific findings have discounted many characteristics of the Clan (such as the intact hyoid bone found recently, indicating that Neandertals had full spoken language) the idea of this amazing species of hominid is compoletely engaging. And after reading this, who doesn't want to suddenly be as intelligent and powerful as the amazing Ayla? A wonderful book, which (in tandem with its follow-ups) inspired a great number of obsessions in me."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear Crown Publishers, 2002, 468pp., $29.95Jean M. Auel ISBN: 0-517-542021The Clan of the Cave Bear is an extremely emotional novel. You will have mood swings all throughout the book. At one point you will be excited for a successful hunt, then crying over a tragic death in a family.It all starts with a little, blonde-haired, five-year-old girl, Ayla, living with her mother in prehistoric Europe, 25,000 years from today. A terrible earthquake kills Ayla's mom and she is left alone. She ventures away from the constant aftershocks for a new home. She his hanging on the thread of her life in search for a miricle.Jean Auel has a very descriptive style of writing. I see metaphors and personification all through the novel. She sometimes switches from scene to scene every chapter. She also writes cliffhangers. It really motivated me to read the next book, and then the whole set of books. There are five books in all.I recommend The Clan of the Cave Bear to anybody who enjoys a novel full of magic, tradition, and adventure. It might not be suitable to younger children, it has a lot of violence and adultery related items. If you are above 13, you will love this book.-Anita Better Book Review VI"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An amazing epoch of what life may have been like prehistorically. The struggle for life. What is more important? Instinct or adaptability? Both have benefits and both have downfalls. But, historically and PREhistorically, mind has always won out over brawn, and speed and agility... This fictional novel depicts the lives and the emotion and the humanity of those that came before us and the struggles they may have dealt with. Some of the antics of our heroine, Ayla, may seem too ridiculously heroic and comic book character like, BUT the author is trying to envisage evolution for her reader, making neccessary some grand gestures. The mixing of neanderthal and cro magnum species is a unique and thought provoking setting. The driving force of this epoch is the humanity and the creativity that has set apart and driven mankind through the millenia. Ironically, a must read for hard science fiction buffs... as an understanding of where we came from....a glimpse, a picture of what may have been, sets the stage for where we are going and what we are capable of overcoming."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"As a teen I loved this book, and it was my first read over a couple hundred pages. I'm sure I'd like it today too, but a few things in it are a little too simplistic and repetetive for my tastes as a adult."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the most tandalizing books I have ever read. You are lifted into a time that is dated back into the prehistory time of man. Where a little girl, who's family has been killed by an earthquake, has been found by a clan of Neadrathals. Who then adopt her and raise her as her own. This little girl, as she grows up, learns about survival and life and love through the new family she has found. But the book comes to a sad end for a young woman who has lived her life as an individual and never allowed someone to take who she really was away from her."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Now, I am VERY picky when it comes to books. But this book, while slow going at times, was fantastic. I am not a quick reader so for me this book took a little time. But once you get past some of the slower parts (in my mind specifically the background of locations etc), the contact between these people is amazing and interesting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's been quite awhile since I read this book and the others in the Cave Bear series. This book was definitely the best of the bunch. I have not read the latest one yet, but intend to in the near future. This is the story that lays the plot for all the books in the series, and it is a stunner. It is so real that it's like Ms. Auel is writing of someone we know. We all feel that we are friends of Ayla by the time we get into the story. I found that Ms. Auel whetted my appetite for other prehistoric novelists, and that turned me to Kathleen and Michael Gear, who I also recommend by the way."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just finished reading this book and wow!!!!! I am starting her 2nd novel tonite! I love all the characters and could not put this book down for anything. I want to tell you that I feel like I experienced neanderthal ways of living to the point that our commercialized life is sooo wasteful and boring compared to this saga. I love Ayla with my heart and sole and cried when my favorite characters had fallings of any kind. I love Brun, Iza, Creb and many more!!!!!!!!! My advice!? READ IT!! :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"(although I am sure everyone knows by now what's happening in the book, I still won't go into detail, as it might spoil the fun!)I have read and re-read all four books in different editions and languages and I am still not tired!Realizing that there is light at the end of the tunnel (long wait for the fifth book), I started reading the whole series, yet again, to refresh my memory and be ready to dive into the Shelters of Stone.The first installment is simply breathtakingly captivating. Although this was not my first reading, I was still very moved and lived Ayla's hopes and fears and struggle to be accepted by the Clan.Fascinating details about the life and rituals of the Clan, their beliefs and values are told through this gripping pre-historic thriller.The whole series is a definite must for every shelf. I can't sit still waiting for the Shelters of Stone!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read &quot;Clan of the Cave Bears&quot; three times, and it just keeps getting better!! It is one of the most wonderful stories that I have ever read. I have read the other 3 books in the series, and I can't wait for the 5th. I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Customers certainly do not need my oppinion, but I need to give it. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the first books I have ever read of its kind. I was obsessed with surviving and occupied my childhood with studying plants and animals, disgusted by people who depended so dearly on civilization. Greatfull for my safe home, I still ventured out every day hunting around my backyard for wilderness adventures, and swear I pretended to live the 'survivor series' so popular today back when those who produce it now were in their own back yards dreaming the same thing. I am convinced Ms. Auel has somehow BEEN to the time of the Clan...."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What an incredible journey into prehistoric times! This book is so vivid, so moving, and has exquisite detail about Ayla's world- both her personal feelings and experiences and the civilization she finds herself in. Do not miss this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love the Clan of the Cavebear written by Jean M. Auel she has written a very good story on the life of early man and it was well researched and well done. She went threw alot of history and facts and research to tell a good story with characters you like and love, the story is so well done that you feel that you are right there in the middle of everything and seeing it first hand. the story of Ayla who loses her parents to an earthquake is left on her own at a young age and is found by a group of people called the Clan of the Cave Bear, who except for the medicine woman want nothing to do with her and ends up being raised by them. To quote the back cover of the book it is a saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love as Ayla struggles to grow up with her new family and learns there ways and one by one gains there trust (excpect for one) and live with them. a great book that I enjoy reading time and again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I must say, my first impression, from just hearing about the book and reading the first page or so was not good. I had to read this book for one of my college classes, and once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book (and all of Auel's other books) to everyone. Especially those interested in history, it's amazing. The thing I found most, interesting was her depiction of the paleolithic age. It was really different that others would imagine."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Don't expect anything profound here, but this is a verydetailed and absorbing glimpse at the prehistoric world, even if allof it is pure speculation. Ayla, the protagonist, is basically your typical wonder child who realizes her destiny as a superior being after being raised by a more primitive tribe. Other characters are also fairly one-dimensional, and I cared about them only fitfully. That being said, Auel's description of the Neanderthal culture, social order, and proto-religion is fascinating from an anthropological standpoint. I was compelled to finish the book out of simple curiosity... and it was worth it. Long, descriptive passages are Auel's cup of tea, and she can be eloquent sometimes. I will probably read the rest of the series at some point--perhaps in a hotel lobby at 3 a.m., where I read much of Clan of the Cave Bear. It's that kind of book-difficult to justify setting actual time aside for..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Wonderful story. I bought this on my Kindle, and I enjoyed it so much I will be buying it from Amazon as a set.The contents of the book makes you appreciate where we all came from.Jean Auel writes so well, you feel as thoughyou are actually \\"in\\" the story."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Several times over the years I've tried to read this..but every time it just didnt catch my interest enough....still,i was pretty sure at some point it Might be worth trying again..... So after many years i finally downloaded it to kindle and wow, it was terrific... Now i'm hooked on reading the entire series. Try it, YOU might love it too!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it as a child and it has inspired a desire to lean about wild herbs that has latesd to this day. It is a really great fiction story. I would recomend it to anyone with an interest in the ice age or survival stories."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Excellent book.

Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A beautiful story. Couldn't put it down. So well written that I felt like I was there with Ayla and the clan."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the Cave Bear is a fantastic story, one which fascinated me. In what other book do we get to read about what Neanderthals may have been like? And it was not only stimulating to the intellect, but to the soul. The story is truly heart-wrenching and I really felt for the characters.My only complaint is that the book needed some serious editing. Auel is a talented story-teller...but her writing skills leave something to be desired. Namely, she switches point of view so often in this story that I often had to reread a paragraph to find out whose thoughts were being shared. She'll switch from Creb, to the narrator, to Iza, to Ayla, and back to the narrator again--and often within the same paragraph! Very sloppy writing, and confusing for the reader.However fortunately for Auel, the story speaks for itself. I fully intend to read the rest of this most interesting series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm usually a romance fiction type - but decided to try reading something different. I couldn't put this down. The research that went into this had to be tremendous and it is very believable. Who's to say how things were when humans were developing. I've had a few weeks break now I think I am ready for #2 in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the best books i have ever read. You can tell that the author took a lot of time preparing to write this book in her extensive research of the Ice Age and the people that lived at that time. The story could take place in any time period because it is about a person who is adopted into a culture completely different from her own and has trouble fitting into the strict lifestyle. I would definetly recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Well, I don't think that I have to convince anyone that this is a good book and the beginning of a good series. I wanted, instead, to express my gratitude that there is a standard-size harcover edition of The Clan of the Cave Bear again to buy. The other three books in the series have remained in print for years, but I could never locate a hard copy of the first novel. A couple of years ago, they re-released the hardcover, but it was in a smaller format, so it didn't match the others.Now, there is the hardcover again, along with the sneak peek at the new novel!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've been rereading this book for the past 20 years. It is one of my favorites...as are all of the books in the Earth's Children series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I picked up this book because it seemed like the best of a lot of bad choices, but once I read a little bit, I was lost. There are plenty of reasons to list on why this book is an excellent read, but don't take our word for it. Pick it up for yourself. This book was enlightening, encouraging, heartwrenching and always interesting. You just had to know what happened next. I've been impatiently waiting for the fifth book in the series, and I've pre-ordered well in advance. I wish I could thank Ms. Auel for providing such a wonderful heroine, who's world is too easy to get lost in."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've had this novel for the past year or so, But I could never get into it, so it sat there for months and months. I was going through my books recently, and came across it, so I thought I'd attempt to read it again. I must say that this novel is fascinating!! The novel is about a little girl who is separated from her Clan and is taken into another Clan who finds her barely alive. The novel, I think, is about coming of age, and acceptence of ones self and of others. I think it's about growth and basically life. Ayla who is the main character in this novel, goes through many things. She had her ups and downs with the clan of the cave bear, and it gave her an identity and independence that no one in that clan had ever had: least of all women. However, this novel is brilliant, and it made me cry at the end. I cannot wait to continue the series, and I will definetly write a review for the second, third, and fourth!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a really great book. I loved the descriptions of the different herbs and flowers. It was the kind of book that made you want to find out what's going to happen next...I could hardly put it down!But, towards the end of the book it got sad and depressing. The ending was sad too. But other than that, this book was great!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I own the entire earth Children Series but Clan of the Cave Bear is my personal favourite! This book is awesome! There is no other description."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read the 4 books by Jean M. Auel (twice). I'm sure the story has not ended yet. I cannot sleep because I want to know what happens next. Please Mrs. Auel could you finish the other books as you entended to do ? A suggestion : the story is very strong on its own. No need to waste paper by inserting a full description of their love-life every twenty pages. I'm sure you did it for commercial reasons and not because the story is incomplete without these descriptions. Thanks for the many hours of joy I had with your books. Hope I did not make to many mistakes in English.Anita"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I gave birth to my daughter, Summer Rose, when I was 17. Shortly after I noticed such a drastic change in my lifestyle. Throughtout my life the only time I picked up a book was in school when it was assigned. Never had I dreamed of reading for recreational purposes. I thought my own mother was crazy for even willingly picking up a book. However, ever since I was a child my facination with pre-history and native american history has always pulled at my blood and has crept not only in my brain but has made a place in my heart. Becoming a mother myself gave me the leverage I needed to finally pick up a book and see what the written word has provided for individuals such as myself. My first book to read for the reason as just because was The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel. Not only did it grasp my attention but it blew me away. Never in my life did I expect to love reading as much as I read this book. I thought the details and research was to my knowledge accurate (but of course I'm no expert!) The story line was believable and very hard to put down. I thought nothing would ever top this until I heard that there was a sequel..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first published and have never tired of it. Jean M Auel has obviously done her research before embarking on this novel and by doing so has managed to recreate the ancient world of the Neanderthals in a totally believable way.This is such an evocative book you can visualise the clan and their surroundings almost as if you were sat among them. The sights, sounds, smells are described so well that they feel almost real. It makes for a fascinating glimpse in to an ancient, forgotten way of life.Interwoven with this, is the wonderful tale of Ayla, a young Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted by a clan of Neanderthals after an earthquake leaves her orphaned. Her 'adoptive' mother, Isa, along with the clan's Magician, Creb, try hard to integrate Ayla into their community but not everyone is as welcoming to this strange child who not only looks so different, but acts in a way that is so alien to them.A young clan male, Broud, hates Ayla with a passion and unfortunately for Ayla, Broud is destined to be clan leader one day. Her struggle to be accepted among the members of the clan and the interaction between all of the characters, along with the richly detailed descriptions, make for a fascinating and absorbing read. This book works well on all levels and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I absolutely love this book. I can't say enough about it. Out of all of the books, I find that this one is the most fascinating. Jean Auel is an amazing writer. I have loved this book since I was 13 years old. I have read it so many times that not only have I memorized it, but I have had to replace my battered old copy. This book will make you laugh and cry and get angry. I have never been able to find a book that I love as much as this one and believe me, I have read a lot. Jean Auel makes you feel the characters and makes you believe in her theory about Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. Her wrirting and characters are vivid and unforgettable. This one is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end. I laughed and cried and got mad and then recovered and then did the emotions all over again.A good read is a book that allows the reader to learn (as I definitely did about prehistoric times and about botany) and also to love the characters like Creb, Iza, and of course the main character Alya. To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious. I am already on page 200 of the next book to read after this one. &quot;The Valley of the Horses&quot;. I love it also and can't wait to see what is going to happen next! What a wonderful series! See ya on this review board on the current book when I am finished!:)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel has written one of the most compelling series I have ever read, I can't ever get enough of these books"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was 14 years old when I read this book, and quickly followed with the next two. The other reviews focused on the plot, so I will omit that. I am going to instead concentrate on how it made me feel. As a teenager, reading about this young woman's struggle to fit in when she was so different really struck home. The story also concentrates on freedom issues that face women. How many times I identified with Ayla(main character) when she was yet again having her uniqueness stifled, or having her love rejected I cannot say. I found myself learning to stand up, and become strong physically and emotionally from her example. In short, I wanted to be her- an intelligent, strong, independant, loving healer who had to guts to defy the patriarcal system she grew up in. This book also has some wonderful information about herbal medicine and food preparation. I would especially highly recommend this to young women, because of the wonderful example it sets. I have to say I love the second book as well for it's theme of being tested by solitude, and facing predjudice. In truth, I love them all but the first two are by far the best. And I too waited over ten years for the fifth book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first in the Earth's Children series will make you a continuing reader of the rest of the more recent books.

Respecting his opinion, I picked up the book. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The contrast and conflict introduced by having a young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neandertals was a an excellent vehicle for the story. The author seems to have done her homework on the ice age as well. Although I don't know about her speculations on the nature of Neandertal society and their brain structure and function, they were fascinating. These people become such an integral part of the story that by the end of the book when you begin to realize that they, as a group, are going to pass away soon, it brings a poignant sadness. Well written, excellent characterization."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book I read was The Clan Of The Cave Bear. It is about a girl named Ayla whose mother dies in an earthquake. She wanders around until a cave lion attacks her and after that she faints. When a group of Neanderthals pass by they pick her up. She grows up with them and when she nears the age of nine, she begins to hunt with a sling, which is forbidden by the clan. If you become interested you should read the rest of Jean M.

Its not as if its possible to tell what the people were like in that age. Very interesting idea's, well written with great characters....I loved the ending, it made me have to read the sequel which is good. I must say the rest arent as great, but still really good. One minor problem in my opinion is the extensive detail about the settings....to me it was boring and i usually skipped those parts. Still a great book give it a try."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I was just looking for something to do on a long bus ride to one of my Cross Country meets. But since the Earthquake on the first two pages, Auel's lovely description and wonderful storytelling skills has had me hooked. After reading this book, I was incredibly eager to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is excellent. It is not any ordinary story, and is a fantastic veiw of what might have been. The conflict is created and developed perfectly, and everything that happens is believable. When reading this book, you will laugh and cry at times, and also learn a lot about the age- about neanderthals, the ice age, medicine, toolmaking, and more. Auel displays an amazing theory of why the Neanderthals might have become extinct when the Cro Magnons did not. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to be drawn into a world completely unlike our own and escape the daily schedules to have an experience to remember without even leaving your bed."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I did the unabridged audiobook. 14 tapes of prehistoric immersion into the culture of the clan. Very satisfying, very informative, very revealing and very thought-provoking. You get to know these neanderthals better than your own clan (and maybe they make more sense in their own way!). I wish I had a smidgen of their herblore knowledge and I got to admire their common sense approach to problems. What is you animal totem? It now seems so important somehow. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me a long time ago and I should not of waited.I got hooked on it from the first chapter and I could not stop until I finished reading the last chapter in the series.

I couldn't put it down. The characters are so real, and Ayla is an amazing woman. This novel is more than just fiction, it is based in archeological truths, so I did a bit of learning about early man/woman. One note...don't watch the movie version of this, its terrible and doesn't even touch the strength of this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Reading this book was an emotional experience. The author was able to describe scenes so accurate that I actually felt as if I were that little 5 year old girl, lost in the wilderness, hungry, cold, tired, delusional, and frightened. I was captivated with this series and reread all four books five times already. I've learned more about survival from this book than I have from 12 years in our public school systems. Great job.

And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa.

Please hurry, Jean!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read the Earth's Children series more than once and will read it again once the fifth book comes out. What I like about this series is the fact that each book is relatively stand alone in understanding the characters.

But I brought myself to read it, and loved it! I loved every word! It is 500 pgs, and I read it in 3 days. It was so excellent.

The story \\"gets\\" you on page one. Jean keeps building an amazingly plausible fiction of how we (mankind) only made it to number one spot by luck and a more efficient design. The Clan dominated their world and would have succeeded but for a design flaw - and not an obvious one. I am a sci-fi adict and have read most of the classics and many other not so well known titles.

It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distant related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I never would have guessed that this book would change my whole view on the past.

Well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the &quot;clans&quot; are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really loved this book. I read it when I was seven and I still remember it. There are some graphic and parts that may not be suitable for smaller children, but it is good nonetheless!

I never read anything as creative and imaginative as this enjoyable piece of literature. Admittedly, it is a lot of pages, but well worth the time reading it. It truly transports you to another world ... one so remote, but yet made to feel so real and vivid by the author. When you're done, you feel left wanting more ... and, guess what, there is more -- those wonderful sequels!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a wonderful and compelling novel to read. I read it as a fourth grader. Yes, I was what nine years old when someone reccommended that I read this book. It was an extremely well written account of life for Ayla in the prehistoric times. I instantly hated Broud, and after reading a few chapters knew he would rape her. But, look beyond the graphic sex. Sex is a part of life. You can't shelter yourself from it. Those scenes were there to help tell the story of Ayla. Without it, her hatred of Broud would not have been complete. This book deserves more than five stars. I give it two thumbs way up.P.S. Yes, I was a fourth grader when I read it. I've also read the other four books and await the fifth in earnest. Those of you who think that the sex in all of the books makes them trashy, get a damn life!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"These books are fantastic. I was fascinated from the very start - It is hard to imagine how a 5 year old girl can captivate so many people but Jean Auel does it somehow. Ayla seems such a strong independent spirit and I feel like i know her so well. This is one of the few books that has made me weep but at the bit where Iza dies I had to stop reading because it upset me so much. Me and my friend tried learning sling-throwing in the garden so we could be like Ayla- she made such an impression on us. I was so excited when the film was on - I got up at 2 in the morning because i couldn't wait until the morning to see it!!! It doesn't even touch the magic of the book but is still definately worth seeing. The other books do not reach the same standard of tCotCB .Although in book 3 you can draw interesting comparisons between the way of live of neanderthal and Cro-magnon people, the plot fades into the background to make way for descriptions of plants, animals and sex, sex and more sex! But despite this I still kept reading (and re-reading)and I am eagerly awaiting book 5 -i want to find out whether Ayla has a boy or a girl!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm only 11, so my opinion may not count much, but this was a really good series! The story of a person going through so much and yet still surviving is one worth the effort (although it didn't take me long to read the series). Even if they were printed before I was born, it seems like an eternity for the next book to come out. What's the deal? Oh well, I'll comfort myself with the other four."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book provides entertainment, education based on historical research, and leads to thought about our earliest beginnings.

I had the entire \\"Clan\\" series and de died to reread.i really enjoyed the story, though how the main character made all the most important discoveries of mankind was a little far fetched.

It also showed that there was discrimination, even in early man."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book I read some time ago and missed placed the bool. So, I bought the book again for a friend."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family. She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M. Auel series.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book soon after it was released when Women's Lib was at its peak. I am listening to it now as I take my daily walks only because I bought the cassette tapes for practically nothing. I agree with all the criticism of Auel's writing. I have listened to many florid books after buying them on closeout and I know bad writing when I read or hear it. I have one main criticism of this book - and I don't think any other reviewer has mentioned it. The Cave Bear Clan is supposedly nearly subhuman and the members speak only in sign language. How then do they mentally form and then articulate conplex feelings and reasoning? At every turn some clan member is explaining with complicated twist and turns of reasoning why something is happening. And all of this is done with hand gestures! Amazing! People with this ability to think critically would soon understand the relationship between sex and pregnancy. They would see how counterproductive \\"clan ways\\" are. Ayla lives with the clan for six or seven years and yet no one dies of disease or accident. Ayla's amazing skills are credited with saving those lives that are threatened. Ayla seems to be the only person with any interest in cleanliness and with all of the duties assigned her in the book, she wouldn't have had time to keep her hair clean. I really think today that this is a ridiculous book but I understand the social context in which it was written. Truly good writing survives changes in social norms, but this book is truly dated today. I will finish listening, but I will continue to shake my head and make critical comments to the author out loud as I walk. Let's pat Auel on the back for her feminism and interest in anthropology. Then let's assign her to the vaults of history."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Excellent Book. The whole Earth's Children series is fantastic. Such a good read you don't want to put it down...."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"After reading \\"The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),\\" the sixth and last book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, and happily catching glimpses of the more human side to her eventually Wonder Woman-esque protagonist, Ayla, I decided to re-explore the original offering, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" to rediscover the roots of my initial fascination with the \\"Clan\\" universe. Even after thirty years, \\"Cave Bear\\" still maintains its high standing in my world of notable characterizations.When Auel first published this novel in 1980, she may have had an educated inkling based on her own extensive research of now known facts regarding modern man's DNA and its relationship to that of Neanderthals. In 2010, biologists, led by Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany announced that by comparing the Neanderthal genome with those of various present day humans, science can conclude that about 1 percent to 4 percent of the genome of non-Africans today is derived from Neanderthals. The implication this presence suggests infallibly that which archeology has not yet proven: that indeed interbreeding between modern humans (\\"the Others\\" as Auel calls those of Ayla's race) and Neanderthals (the \\"Clan\\" or the more derogatory \\"Flatheads\\" again part of Auel's nomenclature) had definitely taken place and that certain characteristics perhaps thought inferior were not in terms of ultimate evolutionary survival. Indeed, the entire premise for \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is given a scholarly nod with the advent of this newer information. Hats off to Auel and her prescient cleverness!But it is not only her scientific savvy that sets \\"Cave Bear\\" apart from her other stories featuring Ayla. Human drama, whether it be Neanderthal or Cro Magnon, when it is well done, begs for attention, acting as the hub of a wheel of storytelling that is repeated and enjoyed over and over again. Ayla's story is just that, a symphony of human emotions that hit the reader at the basest level, immediately engaging him/her and sustaining interest throughout the highs and lows of the protagonist's journey of inner and outer growth.From the start, Auel presents the five-year-old Ayla, wandering in the aftermath of an earthquake that has not only orphaned her but has set her adrift in a brutal environment sharp with tooth and fang of predators both two and four-legged. No reader can fail to empathize with her plight or her dogged bravery as she stumbles through the void of hunger, illness and an attack by a she-lion. Even when she is discovered unconscious by a pack of Neanderthals displaced from their home cave by the same earthquake, the immediate interplay between Isa, the medicine woman and her two brothers--Creb, the crippled albeit great shaman, and Brun, the Clan leader--evokes the strong desire to cheer when they take her in, fully realizing that this avant-garde decision will cause problems for the routine-minded tribe. As in all good stories, the reader senses the conflicts to come and awaits them with enthused anticipation.Auel crafts an entire Neanderthal societal structure which the reader discovers as Ayla becomes more aware--not only of her Cro-Magnon differences but, of her function as an individual within such a tightly dependent group where tradition, compliance and strict thinking within \\"the box\\" are tantamount to the group's identity. As one would expect from a novel written in the ERA era of the 70s, the idea of a lowly woman pitting herself against the brawn of hairy, bow-legged hunters does enable Ayla to flaunt her more highly evolved brain to great advantage. Nonetheless, in \\"Clan,\\" Auel hones and shapes Ayla's supremacy with a good storyteller's ease. Ayla may eventually become the stuff of legends, but in this novel, she struggles, grows and realizes her path with the same expert finesse as any other literary character worth his/her salt.All this results in a rather unique \\"coming-of-age\\" that includes remarkably unforgettable characters. Auel paints with a palette of primary emotions that depict all the humans whether they share the ancestral memories of the Clan or can quickly grasp the concept of numbers beyond the quantity of digits of one hand. Isa exhibits all the quintessential traits of the world's best mother; her concern and frustration with Ayla's differences and the repercussions of these on her future remind the reader that maternal love remains an undiluted absolute. Creb's fascination with Ayla and his awareness of what her intriguing attributes will eventually mean for the Clan never detracts from the fierce love and protection he feels for the girl. The mutual dislike shared by Ayla and Broud and the contest of wills that ensue between the two of them adds pungent spice to an already tasty stew of human interaction. The leader Brun contributes an intrepid nobility and honor that sets him high on a pedestal where few Cro-Magnons can reach. Indeed, all of the characters add something unique to the mix and despite their guttural names sweetly vocalize and pantomime a full range of all that life, good or bad, ultimately represents.Bottom line? Jean M. Auel's \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" epitomizes modern storytelling at its best. Filled with a rainbow spectrum of human emotions, mindsets and sensibilities, \\"Cave Bear,\\" may depict the struggles of early mankind to survive and illustrate from an ersatz anthropological perspective various aspects of daily life, but succeeds, first and foremost, in its portrayal of the dynamics of family, adoptive and otherwise. Unlike some of Auel's other novels featuring lead character, Ayla, \\"Cave Bear\\" maintains a quiet dignity where small actions and nuanced impressions round out a story filled with the normal roller coaster of emotional development to perfection. In this novel, Ayla wins and loses without becoming the too-perfect super human of the other installments. Highly recommended, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was well worth the time revisiting. Sandra Burr performs this audio-book with charm and a wonderfully nuanced voice that gives voice to the characters without being overdone.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Usually I do not re-read books but when I first read the \\"Valley of the Horses\\" I went back to \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and then continued with the rest of all the 5 books on the market. I have now read all of them at least 6 times. \\"Mammouth Hunters\\" was my least favorite because I kept wanting Ayla and Jondalar to just talk to each other!! (It did turn out OK, finally!) I have been ANXIOUSLY looking forward to book 6 and --!! Any idea when it will be available? When I pulled up Jean Auel on one source they listed book 6 and 7. Are they ready?

I first read the series 20 some odd years ago and I STILL remember the experience of reading it.. discovery and adventure for a young girl..Please read this series.. it IS that good."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just read some of the 1-star reviews, and found that while I do agree with some of the objections, I still enjoyed the book on this, the fourth read.I agree with one person who points out the unbelievable regularity with which Ayla makes discoveries. However, I chose to overlook it and just enjoy the story. If you want accurate factual history, you may want to look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, read the book.I am impressed by the amount of research Ms. Auel obviously did regarding herbal medicine. I understand that she did a lot of research and some of the incidents in the story portray a possible reason for some of the archaeological finds, such as the inclusion of certain unusual objects in a burial cairn.I enjoyed the book, and look forward to the release of the newest book, Land of the Painted Caves. Since it is always such a long time between books, I like to refresh my memory, and greatly enjoy so doing."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This novel was a first in a number of respects. It was Jean's first book, also the first in a great series of four books and lastly the first of its class in the now popular prehistory genre. The four novels in the series are &quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot;.Set in the transitional time between Neanderthal and Cromagnon, we are told a tale like Kipling's, &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Only Mowgly is a little girl named Ayla and she is raised by Neanderthals rather than wolves. But this is no children's story.Ayla is an outcast in her adopted tribe and struggles against ostracism and physical assaults. Any thing she can do better than her tribe is frowned on as not appropriate and she struggles to do the things that the rest of them take for granted. Some of these include the obvious displays of great strength but also the clever supposition on the authors part, that Neanderthals memories are passed down through the generations by inherited genetic traits. How can little Ayla ever achieve that.It all comes to a head in the first novel when Ayla has a malformed baby. Not malformed in fact, just a half cast. I wont go into any more detail. Suffice to say that I was hanging out for each new novel in the series and then gobbled each in virtually a single sitting when they arrived."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"when oh when will jean auel write the next book, we asnxiously await the final chapter"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M. Auel, I was captivated by the spirit and life of the Clan. At the start of the novel, these people seem almost like savages. By the end I was in tears when Alla lost a loved one. The struggles and accomplishments Alla, the main character, experienced, seemed to be my very own. The story begins with an earthquake that tears a little girl away from the only family and home that she knows. Wandering lost in the wilderness, Alla is chosen by the great cave lion to bear his totum marks for the rest of her life. As the child lay dying of starvation and infection from the giant gashes which the huge cat tore into her leg, Alla passes out along side of a path. The Clan, a group of neandrathal cave people, is searching for a new cave at the time, stumble across Alla's broken body. Isa, the Clan's medicine woman, lifts the child up and decideds to raise her as her own. As the story unfolds, we see the human child, who not only looks different than the people of the clan, but by nature, acts and thinks differently, growing up and trying hard to understand how she can possibly be normal when she looks, feels, and seems so totally different than the only people she can ever remember. This is an exciting, interesting and inviting story that I would recommend to anyone. The book is not really suitable for children under age 14, due to some topics of natural human life that cannot be avoided. However, I don't think that it would be considered offensive to anyone. I personally bought the audio book. This makes it possible to do other things while listening to the story, such as sewing, drawing, computer, etc. IT'S A GREAT BOOK! BUY IT OR BORROW IT RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The saga of Ayla is beautiful to follow. A riveting book that makes us look forward to the other series. It is full of heart and compassion"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"No, really. This book falls under the category of being too well-researched. It reads like an odd combination of margin-scrawled Mary Sue and a Geology textbook. Right in the middle of potentially deep plot twists we are assaulted with a treatise on plants (some of which are not native to Europe, though for all her research the author hasn't got that figured out yet) minerals (pyrite ahoy!) and all sorts of boring details that could have easily been transformed into the main character's observations of her world in a much more subtle and readable way. As they are, it's merely distracting, and pulls attention away from character believability.I can see why this book is so popular, and why the series simply will not die. However, it seems that all the issues that happen in the book (A struggle for a woman who wants to achieve social equality, birth/death/euthanasia of deformed children, the concept of insecure men trying to justify their manhood by raping women, being rejected as an outsider from society, etc) are, to be fair, issues that do, in some ways, transcend all times and places. However, Auel seems to be trying to make a comment on our own society through this struggle in her books by making the Neanderthal men the scapegoats for everything that is wrong in the world.On top of all that, her main character, Ayla, is purposefully set apart to completely walk on water. She sings (wow!) cries (egads!) discovers reproduction, weaves baskets, makes knives, hunts, gathers, invents gloves, wrangles wild wildebeests with her BARE HANDS, memorizes herbs, cooks, hunts, is given equality with the men for a short time, learns everything super fast... oh yes did I mention she hunts? And she doesn't ever, ever have any sort of opposition besides the uninspiring force of society against her, which doesn't work at all for a struggle because she's not from their society in the first place. There is no sense of bringing the people who raised her with her progression either, because the whole society is written to be so stupid and only serve the purpose of making her look better.And while we're on the subject of looking better, can we please, please, for once in the history of published Mary-Sues *not* have a character who is tall, athletic, blue-eyed and with \\"Wavy, thick blonde hair?\\" I don't care how perfect you are, you can't keep long hair (which of course Auel describes as \\"fine\\" earlier on in the book... go figure) free of tangles and healthy and shiney when you're more worried about hunting (oh yes did I mention she can hunt?) and providing for your family.Except they're not her family, and even though we keep getting told that there are others like Ayla, we never see it, and Auel makes many frustrating presumptions upon an ancient society that it is not her place to make. Yes, you can research axes and spears and whatever still remains, but you have no right to assume that these people were really that dumb, especially when the only reason that they are dumb is to, what else, make your own character look that much smarter.Bottom line: This book is written by a well-meaning, somewhat well-researched woman who either has issues with her own gender and status in society, thinks men are all stupid brutes, really really wants to be blonde and pretty and talented... Or all of the above. And when that is easy to see, the rest of the plot, however interesting, just falls flat."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"OK, where to start? The first time I read this I thought, \\"This is great!\\" But I was a shallow reader then, easily entertained, and so I missed many of the (wrong) facts presented here. Only recently I have begun doing my own research on the Ice Age/Neanderthals/Cro-Magnon, and find that Jean M. Auel has very much butchered what could have been a great story.First, the characteristics (hair, skin, eyes, etc) of people are determined by where they live, not only by genetics or evolution. The region where the Neanderthals lived had a cold climate, and so they probably had lighter skin, and fair hair (what Ayla has, except she's Cro-Magnon. Ever notice how the Neadnerthals are all basically tan, dark brunettes?) Besides that, look at animals for another example. A certain species of animal can have many different colors, and so can hominids. Who on earth is to say that the Neanderthals were all dark haired and eyed, whereas the Cro-Magnon were all (*CoughNazicough*) blond haired, blue eyed, and basically the Aryan stereotype?Also, as one reviewer so beautifully put it, Auel sets Ayla up to just walk on water. Indeed, many of the things Ayla \\"discovers\\" were, in all probabilites, known to the Neanderthal. In the time period where both the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon lived, I don't think that the difference in intelligence was so completely staggering as Auel writes: Cro-Magnon are so smart and civilized, the Neanderthals are savages. Almost like Columbus' perception of the Native Americans. That aside, Auel then makes Ayla a genius, figuring out stuff that probably took many people many generations to solve. Yet it seemed as if she just came up with all the answers at once, which--even today--isn't how the human mind works.Honestly, if you ever want a good idea of pre-historic life during the Ice Age, either do some research, or if you're a fiction buff, rent the movie \\"Quest for Fire.\\" And I agree with the same reviewer who said Ayla was set to walk on water; it does seem as if Auel is using the Neanderthal men as scapegoats for everything that is wrong in our society. Almost like she's trying to make a feminist statement (which in itself isn't bad) but based way too much on conjecture.All said, this book is OK, good for an English book report (tear it to shreds, though!) or maybe for reading on a plane or in the car. Don't waste your time if you're looking for great lit, though, because this certainly isn't it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"For years, various friends have suggested I might enjoy reading THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, and finally this summer I did. Auel's tale is speculative. Recent discoveries suggest it may contain some inaccuracies (the Black Sea may not have been salty as Auel suggests), however other findings support her ideas.Auel made good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs (although some of plants she names are native to North America not Europe where the action takes place). Her use of the extant knowledge of the fossil record, as well as geological and climatic information is excellent. However, her allusions to the sexual practices of traditional people appears to draw heavily on the work of Margaret Mead whose research on the sex lives of adolescent Samoans has been challenged (humans may be too jealous to have ever practiced \\"free love\\").Auel's great gift to the reader is that she enables him to \\"see\\" life as it might have been lived by our ancestor(s) during the last Ice Age. Was it nasty, short and brutish as the 18th Century philosopher suggested, or was it one long sojourn in the wilderness where one could find all the food, medicine and other goods required to sustain a reasonably happy life?Imagine being able to see the vast array of stars that make up the Milky Way. There are only a few places left in the Western United States where one can see the stars without atmospheric pollution. How stupendous it must have been to sit on a hillside at night looking at the heavens when the only light came from the moon, the stars, and a campfire. Is it no wonder our ancestors worshiped the natural world?On the other hand, camping out all winter in a cave has it's downside. Depending on your location relative to the cave entrance you might be pretty damp and cold. But you could wrap yourself in warm furs and campfires would cheer you. Not knowing when the cold would end as food supplies dwindled would be frightening. Viewing a grazing herd of Aurochs or Mastodons must have been awesome. A first hand encounter with a cave lion would be terrifying.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name, but the reader senses they are Neanderthals, and that the \\"others\\" are what we call \`modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world as \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect. What if cause and effect are merely an explanatory principle converted into a religion of sorts. Those who believe in the metaphor may doomed to the Neanderthals' destiny - extinction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel's read of the perhistoric world can be summed up in two words: entertaining and informative. There's not a moment of boredom in 495 pages that record young Ayla's first seventeen years of her life - from the moment that she is seperated from the people of her race (known as \\"The Others\\" - mainly those that look like modern day human beings with blue eyes and blonde hair) to her rescue by Neanderthals (early human beings believed to have evolved from apes with bow legs, a barrel-like body, extremely large foreheads...etc) to the rather heart-wrenching ending.First of all, the plot of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is extremely well planned. Auel couldn't have done it better. This isn't your \\"just write until a plot form\\" sort of book - each chapter, each event is carefully mapped to intermingle and weave carefully with another chapter.I'm still debating on Ayla's character. At times, she seems believable - cowering in fear, becoming frightened - but at other times, it seems like Auel turns her into this goddess/Amazon woman/femenist/genius/beauty - basically into the perfect woman. Ayla always seem to save the day whenever something disatrous happens - whether it's saving a young child from drowning or a hunter from the claws of a dangerous bear. She also has an unbelievable amount of inner strength that seems a bit tad too unrealistic at times. It's true that Ayla's character and personality is very different from the Neanderthals, but it doesn't mean she can confront every problem she runs into with courage most war veterans never earn. The flaw in Ayla's character is that she is too perfect.Another thing that bothers me with the book is that it's too femenistic for this day and age. There's nothing wrong in being a feminist, but in this day and age where women are already considered men's eqauls in many parts of the world, Auel seems to be grave digging an issue that had long died and should be laid to rest. But seeing as this book was written nearly 20 years, perhaps the whole \\"women gets opressed by man\\" and \\"strong woman overcomes man\\" plot wasn't as overused as it would be in this decade. It becomes a bit tedious to read Ayla's struggle as a female in a male-dominated world over and over and over again...Although I do have to applaud Auel for making all the Neanderthals find Ayla incredibly ugly even in all her glorifying white skin, blonde hair, and pale blue eyes which is a complete thumbs-up as oppose to suddenly making her the object of all the males' desire because they find her exotic and beautiful.Overall, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an interesting and informative read on the prehistoric era. Despite a few minor flaws and an extremely disturbing rape scene, it's a well-written book worthy of a read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I HAVE READ THE WHOLE SERIES OF CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, IT IS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME. I THOUGHT BY THE TITLE I WOULD HATE THE BOOK. BUT MY FRIEND, LINDA GILES, TOLD ME TO JUST READ A FEW CHAPTERS AND THEN DECIDE. I DID AND I LOVED IT. I READ THE WHOLE SERIES TWICE AND CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE NEW ONE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED. PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT. NOT ONLY IS IT A GREAT READ, BUT SHE DID ALOTT OF HISTORY ON THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR SELF LEARNING AS YOU ENJOY."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read all 4 books and I thought Jean Auhl is a fantastic author. Alya overcame many obsticles throughout her life. Everything she was put through made her a better person. She was smart, beautiful, and even grasping a sense of humor in spite of her up bringing. Ahul was so clear in the message that she was portraying through Alya. Alya was a messenger who was spreading the message of equality. She would have been a great feminist."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Earth's Childrend Series, especially The Clan of The Cave Bear is the most awesome tale of the struggle for survival. It is easily the best book I've ever read, by far. I can't seem to put it down whenever I read it, and I've read the series 3 or 4 times by now. I have to say Ayla is my hero. The first time I read the book, I was 12, now ten years later I am in the middle of it once again. Auel captures your heart with the struggles, loves, and losses Ayla has to go through, throughout her life. I just wish Auel would finish the last book; she has left us all hanging."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just finished the first book and can't wait to see where the second will take me. I can't imagine how much more can go on in this girls life! I found myself taking myself back into that day and age that I beleive we all wonder about and find it hard to beleive that there was actually life before the 1800's! If you are having a hard time reading it, please continue. It is truely an interesting and insightfull novel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I would like to know what fate awaits her. Is there another tale in the waiting?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first started reading Mrs. Auel's series when I was a sixth-grader, three years ago. I am now &quot;addicted&quot; to this series. I love these books for how they portray all of the human emotions there are: love, heartache, sadness, romance, happiness, excitedness, and the feeling of being alone. I have read others' reviews of this series, saying that starting with the second book, the series becomes nothing more than trashy romance novels. I DISAGREE 100%!! Jean Auel has a tremendous talent for writing human emotions. I believe that Ayla's and Jondalar's love for each other is fitting. So much that it makes me cry sometimes. I, as a teenager, understand what Ayla goes through to feel accepted; I feel her pain. Sometimes I find myself quoting pieces of these books when I am with my friends and they just smile... they know of my &quot;obsession.&quot; Really though, I am just obsessed with good literature. Please, Mrs. Auel, I have heard rumors of you having cancer. If this is true, please give your readers one last gift: the last two books in this series. I sincerely love you Mrs. Auel, you have helped me &quot;see the light.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's hard to guess that we know very little about the time in which this book is set and the way their societys worked. This book makes the past seem as real as the present. Ayla's life and struggles seem to show how little humanity has changed since the beginning of time. It's easy to identify with her in her struggles against prejudices in the early world"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It has an interesting plot and alot of great information. I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"While reading this series it seemed to always slip into my mind throughout anytime of the day. It became so facinating that I would ponder it constantly. I am marveled at the talent Mrs.Auel has been blessed with and grateful she has shared her blessings and given us a true heroine in Ayla. This will been a series I will treasure and will love to read again and again.The time she has put into researching truely paid off.You feel as if you are right there treking along on the steppes. Reading this series has been such a wonderful experience."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My best friend first introduced these books to me probably when I was 14 or 15. Since then, I have not been able to put them down. I don't know how many times that I've read, and re-read these books. They still get me every time. The detailing and description really makes me think, and visualize what Ayla sees. I often wish that I could be her, sees what she sees, and Jondalar! How cute is he? I know every book almost off by heart. I know what's coming, and how they will all end, but I still anticipate and agonize every time. I haven't bought many other books because the Earth's Children Series always satisfies, and leaves me wanting more. I too, am anxious for the next book(s) to come out. Hurry up already!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read it book years ago (when it first came out). Then my parents read it and we all thought it was great. We agreed that it was the minute details of everyday existance that the author gives us that made the book the masterpiece that it is. I have the entire series and have reread the first two several times. I have caught myself drooling over the descriptions of the simple but good foods that Ayla gathers and prepares. The plant lore in the books is amazing and fostered my interest in plants that led me to study wetland botany. In my personal opinion the later books contained too much sex and not enough substance. The first book, Clan of the Cave Bear, is a masterpiece. The second book, The Valley of the Horses, is just as good. The rest don't live up to the standard of the first two. They are more like historical romance and are somewhat of a letdown."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book when I was 13. I read the other 3 right after and have several times since! I love the characters and the descriptions Auel used and the way I feel I am in the story and picture EVERYTHING as I read. They are the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've been waiting years for the 5th book. Anyone known if she is breathing?? Any news on the new book at all???"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 14 years old. Since that time, I got the others in the series. I cannot tell you how many times I have read and reread this story, as well as the others. At one time, they came together in paperback, and I bought it. Now, they are so ragged they are held together by tape. I have been awaiting the time when Mrs. Auel comes out with another book. I would definetely be in line for that one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved all 4 of these books!!! I have been waiting 12 years for the 5th book to come out and have in the mean-time re-read them over and over, collected first addition copies and created an online discussion group to talk about them, the Summer Meetings that other fans are starting in different regions, and other book related aspects of life, including cooking like the characters in the books!!!I recomend for EVERYONE to read them, expesially young women! I read them at the age of 13 and Ayla gives a great example of what a strong independant woman is!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first discovered this wonderful novel in a old book store a few years ago. Once I opened the first page and read a few lines I knew I was hooked. Since then I had the joy of reading all the books currently published by Ms. Auel and they have all been a delight to read. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book so much. Ayla is sure to be a classic in liturature to come in the next decade or so. She is a great role modle. I think this woman has major courage! If this is your first book in the series, keep reading it's worth the time and effort, I promise!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book and story are wonderful. I attempted to download to my iPod. The tracks, author name of book etc were all mis-identified. It was a nightmare. Clan of the Cave Bear (the first in the series took 7 hours to download and properly identify. Valley of the Horses took almost 11 hours. I'm sure people who ordered books by John Lescroart, Nora Roberts, and author Robb............will be highly surprised when they have Clan oft he cave bear identified as what they purchased. Mammoth Hunters took 8 hours yesterday to down load 5 1/2 tapes and properly identify them and then there was a 'fatal error' half way through disc 6. Although I love the series the recording was less than substandard. I won't bother with the last two in the series. They're too expensive to waste all these hours of 'fixing'!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is in my opinion a very creative story. The story brings out the characters living in the Upper Paleolithic era. The amount of research Jean Auel had done to create this novel is very apparent. The heroine, Ayla is a jewel and I could help but root for her as she struggles to make her place in this male dominated society. A wonderful book and I highly recommend it to every reader"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Masterful! The way she describes a race that has been extinct for 30 000 years is astonishing! Their language, beliefs, knowledge and respect for the environment and how they react when a strange human enters their carefully structured society. This book required deep research and a vast imagination. I can't wait to dive in to the other books in the \\"Earths Children\\" series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"who introduced me to this book. I was a naive child and this book began an incredible journey for me. Buy it, read it and then buy the rest. You'll love them... one drawback I've found would be the detailed explanations about the wildlife. I get a little lost in that but it doesn't detract from this wonderful series. This is book one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I told a friend that I was reading Clan of the Cave Bear, he retorted,\\"What!....that is practically a Feminist Manifesto!Fortunately, his comments did not dissuade me from finishing this most important and ever life-changing book, which is the first in the Earth's Children Series.Written by Jean Marie Auel, Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most touching and insightful books on human nature I have ever read.Jean Marie's effort is also an excellent exercise in anthological conjecture based on adequate research of known fossil remains and other anthropological research. She also explores the possible etiological origins of homeopathic and sympathetic magic with fiction that is touching, real, and tender.What fascinated me most about Jean Marie's book is how she elaborated on the theory that two human species, namely modern-anatomical humans and Neanderthals, may have coexisted side by side at one time prehistorically.In her writing, Jean Marie explores the nature of prejudice inferring its origins are natural and deeply rooted in our evolutionary past. She treats it however by demonstrating that through love & acceptance, common traits of humanity shared by many cultures, can help even those with great differences between them to overcome their prejudices and still find a way to get along and live together in harmony. Despite her treatise, the end of book one has an interesting twist."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I purchased this copy of \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" to help complete the set of \\"Earth's Children\\" books.

Though I didn't agree with everything in Auel's world, I was fascinated with it all nonetheless. This is a page turner and brain burner as well. Now I have to scramble to get the next one after staying up to finish it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is good in its detailed descriptions of Neanderthals' way of life, customs and beliefs. I enjoyed reading about the climate, flora and fauna of the region and how people adapted to it, especially about the medicinal purposes of so many \\"modern age\\" plants. Who would have thought that willow bark is a painkiller? Despite some really ridiculous claims like the ability of Neanderthals to inherit the memories of life evolution on Earth (complete with water-to-earth and back to water transitions of marine mammals), the book is overall believable and makes an enjoyable weekend read.But reader beware! This is the only book of the Earth's Children series worth reading. All the sequels to this book are progressively worse, loosing any shreds of realism (and plain common sense) and overflowing with absolutely ridiculous historical claims and repetitive sex scenes. If you don't want to be bitterly disappointed, resist the temptation to read sequels to this book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"That's right, the next book in the series will hit shelves in May 2002!!--THE SHELTERS OF STONE--"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ms. Auel is one of the greatest story tellers of all time. Her writings kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I have her complete set, both in paperback and in hardcover, and wouldn't give them up for anything in the world. Please Jean, write more."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is by far the best book I've ever read. The story starts off about 35,000 years ago, in ice age Europe with a young 5 year old cro magnon girl, named Ayla, who gets seperated from her family in a series of events that would change her life forever. Young, naked, starving, injured and completely defenseless, the helpless child began wandering until a migrating clan of ancient Neandertal people find the girl unconscies and on the brink of death.The clan, Clan of the Cave Bear, was made up of group of people that deeply worshipped Ursus, the spirit of the Cave Bear. Because of the strict customs and beliefs that made up the society they had lived in unchanged for nearly 100,000 years, they saw cro magnon man, people they referred to as &quot;the Others,&quot; as an outsider that didnt belong in their land.Because the clan was homeless themselves from a similar chain of events and she was deffinently different from themselves, they decide to write the young girl off and leave her to die. It wasnt until the clan medicine woman begged the clan leader to let her help the girl and raise her as her own daughter did luck start to turn for the helpless girl. Though she was very different mentally and physicaly, the whole clan came to accept the girl as one of their own, well nearly everone except the clan leaders son Broad. Though Ayla tries as hard as she can to fit in with the ways of the clan people and follow their firm ancient customs, from the moment he first saw her, Broad hated the young girl and had a lifelong desire to make her life miserable. Through all of the lifelong abuse and downfalls she had sustained, Ayla still found away to remain strong and cope with it all.Jean Auel found away to make this story so descriptive and detailed that it's almost as if it takes you all the way back to ice age Europe. Though very sexually disturbing in some parts and not a book I'd reccomend for any minors under the age of 14 or so, it has a well written plot and a turn of events that make it an incredible story. &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; deffinently has my 2 thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was such a good book!!! It is the first book I have ever read from this author, but i enjoyed it immensly. I fully intend to read the secod book of this series, The Valley Of The Horses, as soon as I can get my hands on it. Ayla is the most wonderful heroine. She overcomes every thing thrown in her path. She has such an independent sprit it is had for her to fit into the customs of the Clan. This causes many problems for her especilly with Broud, the leader of the clan's son. She is taken in by Iza and her sibling Creb, the clans Mog-ur, they protect her aganst Broud. However they cant protect her forever and when Broud becomes the leader of the clan he death curses her and the book ends with her leaving the clan, alone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is great. Once you read it you will want to read the following books. It is a book you can get a romance reader, sci-fi reader, history reader, etc. or for that hard to buy for person. It can get a bit long winded but is worth the reading. I have read and re-read all the books and am just waiting to read the next. The characters and the situations they and the earth go threw are very interesting. My 10 year old is starting to read the first book. He likes it so far. He is an avanced reader so maybe most children should be older but you never know. When you pick this book up you won't put it down."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this in a matter of days after seeing the title mentioned in another book and remembering how popular it was when it came out.

I immediately went out and got the rest of the series and ended up reading them all in about three weeks time. This one is the best, very addictive."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the Cave bear is a wonderful story which wraps the reader with every sentence. The length Auel went to authenticate her story are admirable and marvelous. I loved how she explored the spirit world and the intricate language used by the clan. The level of research that has gone into this book is amazing. Auel know so much about plants, animal, and herbal cures that might have been used at this time, that you forget she is writing about a pre-historic period which has left us with only bare-bones of what life must have been like. In Ayla, she creates a remarkable character who readers move with through struggle to overcome every trial (of which there are many). At times heartbreaking, often hopeful, this is a truly beautiful novel about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a wonderful book that is exciting and new. If you are looking for an original book that contains adventure and a bit of mystery, this is the book for you. The sequels to this book lag a bit though. &quot;Valley of Horses&quot; was good but not quite as good as the first book (Clan of the Cave Bear). The rest of the series are acutally really boring because they keep on repeating the same stuff that was in the first and second book. I am in the middle of the third book, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and I find that I have to force myself to read it because it is so boring."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance.

Hope it is as good as she said."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When looking for something over a pre-historic tribe of men, i looked and looked and found this. I read page one, then page one turned into half the books gone, then it was done, i read it it somewhere between 5-10 hours. It is an amazing novel and i hope to read and buy the others as well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Loved the story. And have now read the next book Valley Of The Horses, and am in the process of getting the third book, The Mammoth Hunter. Great Author."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel makes you feel that you are there, experiencing the events of this story. So well written; this is my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I read the book, &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot;, I was stunned. I couldn't believe that someone could create a type of novel that touched me that much. Ayla is the most astounding character in the novel. She learns lessons in that book that should have taken more than a life time to understand. When she was found by the Clan she was near death. Iza healed her and treated her like her own, like part of her blood line. Ayls was not understood by most of the clan but she was loved by most of the clan and she was respected. When she took the sling that she found on the ground and learned how to use it took great courage. When she was cursed with death for using the sling to save a childs life I thought it was unfair, but it was the way of the clan. I couldn't believe that she could survived through the winter in that little cave she had found to practice her sling throwing. It took great knowledge and courage to survive on her own. Broud also affected Ayla in a way that she would never forget. The constant raping when she bacame a woman got her pregnant. When the baby was born she almost died giving birth to the part of the Clan and part of the Others. Everyone thought the child was retarted. The child was supposed to die. It was not allowed to live. But Ayla being so strong decided to fight the system. She was also allowed to hunt because of her strong will to become what her totem wanted her to be. I look forward to see if I will be as fearless and determined as Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I STARTED TO READ CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR AT THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR. I WAS DONE WITH ALL FOUR OF THE BOOKS IN THE SERIES IN ONE MONTH!!! I COULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN. THEY SWEEP YOU UP INTO A UNFORGETABLE JOURNEY THAT YOU WILL THINK OF FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU WISH YOU WERE THERE RIGHT BESIDE AYLA. YOU LAUGH, YOU CRY, YOU DO IT ALL. I STRONGLY SUGGEST READING THE WHOLE SERIES, AND I WANT THE 5TH BOOK !!! I'M DYING FOR IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A historical,adventuress,love story, all rolled into one could'nt put down book. Auel really did her homework, in this epic,(and all the other books in this series I've read all four of them.)Ayla is a heroine, whom you'd love to get to known she portrayed her so real, and a wonderful person.The book might be considered boring to others but, I feel the amount of research put in and gathering prehistoric iceage information wasn't easy for the author.I just wish she'd pull her socks up bit and hurry to finish the last book, I'm sure everyone is eager to know how it all ends."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was reminded of how much I enjoyed this book when i read it years ago when the movie came on the Encore channel. It was really great to read. I thought the movie would be the same, but somehow, they did a really lousy job, and the movie reviews pointed out deficiencies which I hadn't really noticed when I read the book, such as: would a woman really get away with breaking all the clan's rules, would one person really invent everything, there has been a long movie convention of tall, blond Nordic people being the intelligent ones over the short, brunette, dirty lesser ones (nazism?). So when you see all these caveman movie conventions written down, you notice that Jean Auel has used them in her book, and it sort of takes away from the enjoyment of it. But I still remember it (the book) fondly, and recommend it. Now if they could remake the movie and do a better job, I'm sure it could be a big hit!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"35,000 B.C.A five-year-old Cro-Magnon girl loses her family in an earthquake and is found, near death, after an attack by a cave lion, by a group of Neanderthals. They are the Clan of the Cave Bear. They adopt her and, when she recovers, she tries to become one of the Clan. This series, chronicling the life of Ayla, as the Clan name her, unfolds as, firstly, she grows into adulthood in a society utterly different from the one into which she was born, and then secondly, as a fully mature and much sought after woman, she has to re-adapt to the culture to which she was almost certainly born but has blocked from her memory as a result of the tragedy, loss and trauma she endured as a child.This series really does has everything; joy, sorrrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been three hundred and fifty centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.The characters, and the cultures, in this series are arguably the most highly developed you will find in any books, anywhere. With them we feel the highs and the lows, we share their hopes and their fears, and we cannot help needing to discover the outcome of every single decision they make, no matter how crucial or trivial they may appear, because all of them are vital to the story. We feel as though they are our best friends and that they confide in us as such as they think without speaking aloud to other people in the story. We get to know them as well as we know ourselves and plan what we would do in the same situations.Aside from the obvious entertainment and joy the entire series will provide for all who read it, or listen to it, it teaches us many lessons which are relevant to this very day, particularly about relationships with and respect for people, not only on personal and individual levels, but also on social levels, and within a community.On the surface it may appear to have been written as a throwaway paperback for the consumption of twentysomething women lying in the sun to top up their tan, (sadly it is often shelved as such in bookshops), but, be assured, it most definitely is not. It has been reprinted many times in many countries around the world, and in many foreign languages. This is a clear sign of its widespread and enduring quality and appeal, although I would suggest that it would definitely not be suitable for anybody under the age of twelve and even then I would recommend waiting to about sixteen to fully appreciate the meaning of the book and withstand the impact it will make. I believe that a lot of young people, both male and female, would benefit greatly by reading it, and taking it seriously. I first read the Clan of the Cave Bear when I was seventeen, when I bought a copy that my local library was selling off for a few pennies. I read through it in two or three sittings; I was so engrossed, the pages seemed to turn on their own. When finished I immediately loaned the other three books in the series. I now own all the books and all the cassettes, and in the last three years I must have read or heard each of the (to date) four books at least thirty times. Like millions of others, I eagerly await the fifth volume, and so will you.Thirty-five thousand years ago people just like Ayla, and everybody she encountered during her life and journeys, really were alive and, hopefully, in us they shall live on."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A thoroughly original novel that takes sci-fi and fantasy genre into the stone age. Even if some of Ayla's super-woman exploits challenge the imagination, you will enjoy the speculation of religious and cultural life in Neanderthal society. Also the natural surroundings are captivating. DO NOT, however, read further in the series, unless you like trashy romance novels. They degenerate quickly, with the Valley of Horses ok at a 6 or so, then the Mammoth Hunters about a 2. At that point I wised up and stopped reading Ms. Auel's filth. Let me know when she finds originality again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Originally I did not want to read this for I was not interested in the beginning of mankind. Imagine my surprise, when I found myself unable to put this down, read through the night, called the office asking for annual leave, to continue reading until my eyes literally hurt too much to stay open. I even bought hardcovers for the next books finishing this story (valley of horses etc), somthing I NEVER do. I just could not wait. The insight of how we came to have everything normal to us these days, and the incredible style of her writing will make you treasure this series forever. Are you interesting in history, herbalism, magic, love, romance, sex and crime, animals...it's all here. It will also give you a little more strenght to fight for happiness. Ayla survives everything womanhood is threatend by from the beginning of time, and then some. If she can do it, all by herself, and only come out of it stronger and purer, so can the rest of us :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of only four books I could ever give a ten rating to (read the rest of the series to find out the other three). If you are even slightly tempted to read this book, go ahead, for you are surely missing out on something by not reading it. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. While reading this you will be oblivious to what's going on around you, everything else will be put on hold while you are reading it. The story of Ayla that stretches into the other three books is remarkable. The characters are as real as fictionally possible. I read the four books every year or so, just to refresh the great memories and each time I read them I learn something new. My only advice to Jean Auel is to hurry up and write the remaining two novels she promised to write. It would surely be an amazing tragedy if she didn't write them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I found The Clan of the Cave Bear to be a wonderfully written book. It is my personal favorite. The story is about a young girl whose is left alone, by none of her own doing, and must fend for herself. The author writes the book in an extremely moving and realistic way. Although the clan that finds the young girl is one of very few words, Auel portrays their emotions as if they were speaking right into you're own heart. The beginning is not at all slow or hard to get into. Instead, it starts out beautifully, by introducing the main character in a bubbling flow of descriptive words. You will not be able to put the book down once you start reading it, so I'd recommend grabbing a rather large box of tissues before you begin. The book may be a bit too challenging for somewhat younger readers, and has some sections that they probably ought not be reading. I really recommend this book, I loved it and I'm sure you will too"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read & review books on this site & if I enjoy it I give it 4 or 5 stars. However as entertaining as those books are very few have left such an impression on me as has this book. This is a thoroughly enjoyable faction book which focuses just as much on plot as it does on the period & setting which for the most part is fairly accurate. (although not perfect)I found this a joy to read as did my Dad whom I recommended this to. Life in neanderthal times doesn't particularly intrigue me until I started reading this book.Very Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Although no one can truly go back in time and put themselves into the mindset of a Neanderthal, Auel comes close. I thoroughly enjoyed being swept into a world both alien and familiar--a world of frustrating customs stacked up against the protagonist. Her rationale for the clan's customs was amazing, and it created a pleasantly disturbing dissonance in my mind: at times, the clan's customs were so strange as to be almost alien. At other times, their behavior rang of our own way of thinking, suggesting a common element of humanity even in our most primitive relations. Ayla is a sympathetic protagonist, and it was the development and resilience of her character against the rigid rules of the Neanderthals that made me want to keep turning the page."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"For some reason I downloaded this book to my Kindle even though my genre is mystery and thriller type books. At the time it was offered for free and something about the description and reviews prompted me to get it. Well downloading this book was one of the best decisions I have made.I was hooked on the first two pages of reading this book and have not stopped until briefly last night when I finished it and had to pay for and download book two of this series. I could not go on to other books in my Kindle, literally hundreds of them now, without continuing the stories in this series.The Clan of the Cave Bear was facinating to read with characters and storylines so real and well written I found myself going through all kinds of emotions along with them, especially Ayla, the main character. They came to life in this well written novel so well that I had to keep reminding myself that it was after all a novel, a work of fiction but one with well researched historical information many thousands of years ago.No matter what types of books or genres you like to read, I can pretty much guarantee you will find this book as fantastic as I have."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An interesting premise for a story and told fairly well. A orphaned human child taken in by a clan of neanderthals who roamed the world at the same time as our ancestors. Some Interesting ideas about our pre-historical past and how we may have developed. Overall I enjoyed the story and am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by: Jean M AuelI have a new and greater respect/understanding for women who write on subjects of this type. My second reading of this book was 10-years after the first time I read this most excellent writing. (2nd reading more enjoyable and harder to put down.)Research, personality, writing style:(a gift from God), to place word after word in such an interesting and enjoyable visual web is beyond something special. I reserve such praise and gratitude to few \\"Writers\\" I am acquainted with.To quote J.M. Auel's publisher Bantam: \\"Ayla, (main character} for in her blood flows the future of humanity.\\"Auel's 2nd Book: \\"the Valley of Horses\\" a must read, is even better.

Not only is the book captivating, it is very educational as well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!!!!! i went on to read the whole series!!! recommended to everyone over 15 and likes a good read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jane Auel was an unknown beforeThe Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One). She created a series that will go down as the best-loved, most-read in all of historical fiction. The main character, Ayla, is a Cro-Magnon girl taken in by a medicine woman from the Clan--a small band of Neandertals. The setting is tens of thousands of years in the past--the time when modern man and neandertals shared a sparsely populated Ice Age earth.No matter how hard she tries, Ayla cannot fit in with the clan. She is tall, lanky, and blond where they are short, stocky, and dark. It is refreshing how Auel never imposes modern man as superior over their close cousins. Rather, the Clan is portrayed as equally intelligent, but culturally distinct. This parallels very nicely with myriad differences in nationality, race, and religion today.In Book One, Ayla learns the traditions and complex language of the Clan from Iza, a medicine woman who ranks as first among all women. She has trouble adjusting to a fiercely hierarchal and patriarchal society. Broud, the son of the Clan's leader, has a passionate hatred for Ayla. He forces her to do unspeakable things in an attempt to bring upon a death curse that would purify the Clan of this outsider.The sole drawback of Clan of the Cave Bear is that Auel reiterates descriptions of characters in exactly the same way--distracting from of the narrative's richness. This is not merely a flaw from a debut novelist. Needless repetition is a trait that permeates all six books of the Earth's Children series.Lack of outstanding writing is more than made up for with Auel's impressive research and storytelling ablities. Earth's Children is a testament to the unexplored possibilities of a genre that lacks mainstream consciousness among the reading public. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I listened to the audio of this book and the narration was decently done. For some reason I had put off reading this book for years, but I am glad that I finally read it. This book is long and the story is told in a very simplistic way yet woven in are historical facts. It is a historical fantasy book but yet had such a realistic feel to it. Jean M. Auel had me emotionally invested in Ayla and her relationship with people in the Clan. Her struggle with the bullies and despots was gripping and beautifully developed over time. My only complaint is the very closure of the book. I loved the development and the victory that Ayla accomplishes but the ending was heartbreaking and I wish it could have been done differently. I appreciate how Auel set the ending up so we would have faith that the characters would be okay, but I still was heartbroken.Despite the heartbreaking ending it was still a victory for Ayla and I was happy for her. I am glad I read this and I recommend it to people who enjoy historical fantasy or survivalist themes books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first book in the \\"earth's children\\" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels.

I .intend to read it again next year"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book years ago and had an urge to re-visit it. Once again, I enjoyed the anthropological slant to the story- even though it's conjecture based on studies. It's interesting to think about how early societies must have formed, behaved, planted the seeds fot our modern society. I never read the rest of the series but will continue this time, although a science-minded friend of mine said that the story lines become more soap opera-y as the books progress."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I very much enjoyed book of one this series. It gripped me and I had a hard time putting it down. This was when I was reading hardbacks and not kindle versions, so I was pinned under this book for many nights and all night long. :) While I would suggest this book to many people as it does cross genres I may not suggest the 2nd book in the series which got to much like a history book for me. I would love to see a new movie made for this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love CotCB. It has made my favorite books list. I strongly suggest you read it. It is the story of Ayla, a five year old girl, who's family was killed in an earthquake. Alone in the prehistoric wilderness, Ayla wanders off to find help. She encounters starvation, dehydration, roaring waterfalls, cave lions, and sickness. She collaspes, almost dead. And there, she is found by the Clan of the Cave Bear, a clan of neaderthals. They are looking for a new home, sence theirs was destroyed in the earthquake. Iza, the medicine woman, begs Brun, the leader, to let her care for Ayla. He allows her to, and begins Ayla's life with the Clan.The Earth's Children series has six books, Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of the Horses, Mammoth Hunters, Plains of Passage, Shelters of Stone, and Land of the Painted Caves. After CotCB, the books start going down hill, so you don't have to continue, but if you do, they are very addicting and you won't be able to stop. All in all, read CotCB, but not the others."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book and the entire series. It gives an educated glimpse into history. I am not a scientist and cannot verify any of the things written to be true; but anyone who has even a slight interest in prehistory ,or just a good story, should look at these books. I have always been a fan of series books and these have a good continuity and satisfying endings. There is a great deal of mysticism running throughout and should be taken \\"as is\\", that is, conjecture on the part of the author. The sex scenes can be embarrassing but the story supports the attitudes of the people as just another natural human condition."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you have someone with reading difficulties, this is a great way for them to learn how to read. By reading and listening the get to enjoy the story while listening."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Thanks for very prompt service. Used book in excellent condition. Have read book before many times but misplaced original copy. A book I will continue to treasure."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times. It is a fiction for both sexes, as both my son and daughter loved reading and listening to the audio cd's."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an incredible story. The characters are interesting and endlessly sympathetic. Dont believe the negative reviews. It is extremely well written, historically interesting, and anyone who believes Auel portrays the neandrothal race as simply stupid or scapegoats is not reading it thouroghly. My sister is an anthropoligist, and she says that even though there are some small leaps made, it is highly believable from a scholarly point of view. Overall it is the beginning of one of the best series I've ever read. I cant wait for the sixth book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A bit difficult to start. But once I got past the first chapter I was hooked. Pre-History Fiction - never thought I'd enjoy it, never thought I'd read it. Jean Auel did a wonderful job with her vivid writing style; just what I need to get through any book. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was very well done. It keep me interested every minute. It was set during early man. It was a chronicle of a young child that lost her family during an earthquake. She was a homosapin taken in by cavemen. It was filled with interesting facts related to communication, man vs woman, customs, tool making, and cavemen vs noncavemen. I could not stop listening. I was so into it I bought the follow up book. This was not a book I would have purchased. A friend recommended it. I am so glad I listened to her."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book! I finished it in 3 days, I just couldn't put it down. The story traps you immediately, and it deals with subjects such as equality of the sexes and racism. The characters come alive in your mind, and even though some notions are a bit fantastic (like the genetic memory of the Clan), which doesn't make it very credible historically, still the story in itself is enthralling. I can't wait to read the next one!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Who'd a thunk it! A riveting story about cave dwellers. You follow the life of Ayla, a cro-magnin girl, orphaned by an earthquake and saved by a group of different humans, the Neanderthals. By the end of this part of her story (there are 5 books, so far) you are drawn into her dangerous and complex world, where such a simple thing as a smile is seen as a threatening gesture and where men dominate the culture completely.Ms. Auel puts a great deal of descriptive narrative into her work and brings this foreign world to life, making it easy for the reader to picture what it must have been like to be alive in this primitive environment. Then she layers her tale with full details of the culture these people followed; their spirituality, their tribal organization and even the celebrations and sorrows experienced by the clan. My favorite book, all time. Which is why I bought the audio version, it makes my daily commute much more enjoyable. PS. I have all 5 books on audio and actually look forward to my drive time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was one of the first \\"pre-historic novels\\" that I ever read. Although hokey in places and with enough sex to make it appealing to the romance novel readers, it is a fascinating story with a fully-developed prehistoric world and culture. It was great fun to read. If you like Jean Auel, you will probably also like Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear's books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book, and thought it was amazing. I truely recommend it to anyone. I've read several of the reviews where people are stating that there is false information about the ice age, plants, etc. in this novel. I'd like to remind these people that this is a novel, and she never claims that everything stated in this book is 100% accurate. At the time of writting, far less was known about these people. I say just sit back, and read a wonderful story! Most of the information is quiet accurate anyways, and it gives us a glimps into the lives of our ancestors."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the first in a series to capture my imagination. To me, a novel that holds my interest must hold *some* realistic bearing of truth. At the same time however it MUST have a severe overlay of fiction. Believable, but definitely fiction. That's what I love about books. And this series is beyond fact, but it inspires my creative senses and imagination.Gotta love a book like this. I began reading this series YEARS ago..when I was in middle school. I read the first two, and havne't had funds/memory to pick up the rest.Wow. I definitely recommend this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Why did I read this book, you may ask? I shall tell you.My school has this thing so that if you want to be in honors classes, you have to read books from a list over the summer. This book sounded vaguely more interesting than 'Yellow Raft in Blue Water' or whatever, so I decided to get this one.It's about a little girl named Ayla from the Others who loses her parents in an earthquake. She runs away, terrified, into the forest (well, wouldn't you be terrified if a huge crack opened in the earth and swallowed your whole home?)About a week later, she collapses on the ground from being dehydrated and from an infection on her leg from a cave lion. A lady from The Clan finds her, and she gets accepted into the Clan's tribe.The Clan is a group of primitive humans that have brains formed so that they can remember things from past generations, but have problems learning new things. Ayla, on the other hand, comes from a tribe of the Others, a group of primitive humans that can't remember things quite so well, but can easily adapt and learn new things.Ayla forces the Clan to change, and she is influenced by them. She even has a baby from one of the men in the clan...I would give this a PG-13 rating because it describes in detail how exactly Ayla was... blessed... with her child."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love this book in the &quot;Clan&quot; Series. The characters are fresh and exciting, the story is new and bold, the details are fascinating and exquisite. To read how the people of prehistoric time could have lived and communicated was a great treat. The girl Ayla adapts and grows to live among the Clan people, but never really gives up her inner self which is freed to develop in the later books. This particular book is excellent as a stand-alone story and should be enjoyed by itself, since the rest of the series leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan Of The Cave Bears is a story of a young girls journey from a homeless child to a young woman raised by a people different then those biologically related to her. Ayla was five when her people were killed in a devastating earthquake. After wandering alone for weeks she is found unconscious by a medicine woman of a homeless Clan. The leader of this Clan sees her as a pet project for his sister Iza, the medicine woman, and believes she would die even with her help. After being nursed back to help she is raised in the ways of the Clan by Iza and her brother, Creb. After a series of events leads the leader's son to an intense hatred of her, Ayla's life takes a different turn than she imagined. She struggles to cope with her differences between her and the people she loves and for acceptance of the Clan. The book takes you through age five to her early teenage years. Jean M. Auel never fails to show the changes in Ayla's personality and thoughts and she becomes a woman. The people of the Clan change as well: Ayla changed their lives forever giving them a unique status when they join several Clans for the Clan Gathering.Ayla discovers many different things, that extend well beyond her own inventions and into cultural differences of her foster-people and her. Her difference from the Clan extends well beyond appearance, but that is conquered by her love for her foster parents, Iza and Creb, changing her and their way of thinking forever. As the first in a series of five books this is a wonderful beginning to the life of Ayla, a young girl lost in the woods of her differences to her \\"family.\\" I found this book wonderful to read and could not wait to read the next in the series after this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The main reason I was interested in reading Mrs. Auel's Earth's Children series was the unusual setting. There are very few fiction books that deal with the beginning of men as a species.Auel's work must be praised because she was able to picture a very vivid Neanderthalian clan; most of what we know today about neanderthals is speculation based on anthropological findings, since they lived in pre-historical times. Auel's researched is very complete and extense, and it shows in her book. Characters, situations, huntings, clan-dealings, everything is easy to imagine and follow as we read, because tha author's style of writing is smooth and visually powerful. This story is, obviously, just another speculation, but a very interesting one.The main character is Ayla. She's not a Neanderthal; she comes from the Others, a different sub-species, more advanced physically and mentally. Ayla lost her parents in an earthquake when she was very small, and was found and rescued by the neanderthalian clan. There, in spite of her differences, she struggles to be accepted and respected as a member of the clan.Auel's book is good because the characters are deeply developed, not only Ayla, but most of the clan people as well. There's a little difficulty for the reader to get acquainted with the unusual names and the function of each clan member, but once past that the reading is great. There's not much action in the story, but it never drags on. The main feature is, no doubt, the relationship between Ayla and the rest of the clan.I hope the other books in the series keep the good writing.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear \\" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first book of the Earth's Children series I read was &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot;, found on the bestsellers rack at a Wal-Mart in Wichita, Kansas, where my mother and I were visit relatives at the time. It look interesting, so I picked it up, took it back to the Best Western we were staying at. In the three days that followed, I finished all 700-something pages of the book, craving for me. When we returned home, I got &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; from the local library. It took me one and a half days to read the cinderclock sized novel. I was hooked. Since then I have re-read the entire series, but &quot;Clan&quot; remains my favorite. Ms. Auel has done a fantastic job of protray her Cro-Magnon character Ayla, who is adopted into the Clan, a group of Neanderthals, an ancient race who fears and avoids the newcomers with their ingenious thinking power. Ayla is one of the &quot;Others&quot;, the Cro-Magnon peoples who would evolve quickly into humans as we know them today. Robbed of her home and family in a violent earthquake, the child Ayla wanders aimlessly around the terrain of ancient Europe. Finally she passes out in fatigue after being attacked by a cave lion, the animal that would later become her totem. The Clan was robbed of their home and families as well in the same quake, and are now searching for a new cave. The Clan happens upon injured Ayla, and would have left her lying there if it hadn't been for Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan. She rescues the girl of the Others and nurses her back to health. Soon she is accepted into the Clan, and into Mog-ur's fire. Creb, the Mog-ur, finds himself bonding to this strange girl. However, she has much to learn about the Clan before she is truly accepted, and she has found an enemy in the form of a young man, Broud, the son of the leader's mate. Broud's hatred of Ayla results in the thing that Ayla will come to love most, but she can't do anything that may cause it to be taken from her..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you're looking for a story that has beauty and depth, excitement and emotion, as well as the strength of character that so many books lack, than this one is for you. Free of the commen stereotypes that plague so large of percentage of modern literature, this book has everything going for it. The writing is excellent, the characters believable, and the plot exciting. The story centers around five year old Ayla, a human being, who, after losing her family to a natural disaster, is reluctantly taken in by the Neanderthal Clan, and slowly nursed back to health. As Ayla grows older, many members of the Clan are increasingly disturbed by her strange tendancies and quirks, which rise to the surface no matter how hard she tries to be a proper clan female, and the question is; can Ayla conform to her new suroundings, and, more importantly, does she want to? This is an excellent book that will make you laugh, cry, and, for a short time, feel as if you too live in prehistoric Europe. This book has some disturbing subject matter, including a violent and graphic rape scene, so I have to say I wouldn't recomend this book or it's sequels to anyone younger than sixteen or seventeen."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's obvious that a lot of research went into the writing of this book, and Auel included just enough factual detail to barely qualify the story as historical fiction. But it is a soap opera - a well-written soap opera - and only time and setting separate this story from modern life. In fact, the characters, and their complex thoughts and emotions, as well as their ability to reason and communicate, seem more advanced than us (which is not saying much, I grant). Ayla is exceptional, almost super-human in every way, and by the end of Book Two in the series I expect she will have invented the hunting rifle, discovered calculus, cured cancer, and opened up day care centers for orphaned and deformed children. Who says blonds are dumb? I've heard from other disappointed people who are big fans of this first book that the rest of the series resembles a Harlequin romance, but I will not find out for myself."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an incredibly original undertaking, and I have to give Jean Auel a lot of credit for that.What ultimately kept me from really loving the book was the way in which Ayla (sp?) makes discoveries about her environment. For example, she comes to the conclusion that pregnancy comes from sex, not spirits. However, we are treated to no logical thought processes about why she would think that at all- it's somehow just a revelation she has. Auel could have had her say &quot;I had sex, and now I'm pregnant. I don't think it's a coincidence,&quot; which I would have accepted, but instead, every insight she gains in the book just sort of happens. Knowledge doesn't work that way. New insights come from evidence and reason, and Ayla's knowledge NEVER comes that way. Also, new conclusions are often wrong. Aylas never are. She just magically ends up with the right answer about how everything works without thinking it through.My mom has kept me privvy to what Ayla has been up to in the subsequent books (which I was not interested in reading) and it sort of sounds like she's become the professor on Gilligan's Island and is making nuclear reactors out of coconuts or something. I suppose she needs something to write about, so Ayla has to keep making discoveries. It also sounds like it's degraded towards girl porno towards the end of the series as well, which is too bad. Of course, it's not fair for me to comment on the stuff I haven't read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book would be great if it wasn't for the writing. Seriously, the editing process should have pared it down, eradicated some over-used figures of speech, and challenged some of the obvious sci-fi creations that advance the plot.The premise of modern humans and neanderthals having contact and more has been explored quite a bit. Auel does bring an interesting flavor with the story of Ayla, a presumed cro magnon who is mercifully adopted by a clan of presumed neanderthals and the culture shock this brings to all parties.Auel's clan is very human in many regards. Sophisticated language, medicine, tools and hunting help them to survive. A flawed, but coherent mythology and religious structure guides their morals and their strictures. They display many of the human emotions and failings as any modern community, and certainly crave more than simply the basic needs of survival. The politics and personal dynamics that form the plot have a timeless and universal character.Unfortunately, several aspects of the writing style, and several major \\"suspension of disbelief\\" plot devices made it difficult to finish. A few that come to mind:1. The author has clearly done extensive research (or can fake it) on medicinal plants in this era. Unfortunately, it's just not that interesting to most readers given the amount of detail poured into the story. Chapters are interrupted for long discourses on yet another set of medicines and their preparations, when in fact the details add nothing to the story.2. Too many ancillary characters with similar names to keep straight. The tribe boasts an Ika, Iba, Eba, Uba, Ovra - whatever. Many of the characters only appear every hundred pages or so and you just can't recall why they matter. Strangely, the basic motives and traits of the main characters are often repeated, which you of course should know, but these side characters just drift in and out with their similar names.3. The pre-verbal communication is all done with hand gestures, yet they convey sophisticated sentence structures and long diatribes and grand ceremonial rites for hundreds of viewers. This just isn't believable. If anything, a species that has to rely on their hands as hunters, gatherers, and craftspeople would not be able to use those hands for such communication.4. Repetitive figures of speech. \\"Ayla wasn't the only one who...\\" comes to mind (a way overused transition into a new paragraph - when you start to notice it and count them, that's bad).5. There is a completely unnecessary sci-fi aspect to it, dealing with the mental abilities of the clan and in one case, the ability to see into the future (a cringe-worthy montage). Everything else in the story was at least plausible without this addition.One more warning that is a bit of a spoiler, and also not the fault of the author. The book jacket cover on the paperback edition I read states that the clan eventually comes to worship the main character. This is false. \\"Accept and respect\\" would be accurate, but there is never any worship.I'm disappointed by this fact - I would love to know what happens to the characters as the saga continues, but I won't subject myself to that writing style again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an outstanding book; the first and by far the best of the Earth's Children Series. In telling the story of Ayla and the Clan, Jean Auel opens a window to the life of our ancestors many many centuries ago. The primitive beliefs and customs, the tribal ceremonies and rituals are fascinating and the play of human relationships between the various characters makes for a very good read. The characters themselves are many faceted (except perhaps Broud, whose persistent villainousness seems more 21st century!) and Jean Auel manages to get the reader in sync with the thoughts and actions of each character. It is educative to see the clearly defined roles people had in those days; the chieftain, the medicine woman, the priest. Against its backdrop of another time and place, the story itself is age old. A newcomer to a group upsets the set norms of existence and questions ideas and rules that the group takes for granted. Some in the group appreciate the challenge, others insist that the norms are set in stone and cannot be challenged. This is a book for any student of human nature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written.

Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, &quot;Burn it!&quot"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's been more than twenty years since I first read _Clan of the Cave Bear_. I picked it up again at the start of a long airplane trip, and was frustrated that the plane landed before I could finish the book. If the test of time is a sign of a book's quality, then _Clan of the Cave Bear_ passes with top honors.I enjoyed Auel's vivid recreation of the landscape shared by our Neanderthal cousins and our Cro Magnon ancestors, I was impressed by her imaginative rendering of what was known about these people's prehistoric technologies and lifestyles, and I was caught up in the interpersonal dramas that unfolded very believably, yet within a radically different culture and worldview. If anything, I enjoyed re-reading the book more than reading it for the first time. Highly recommended.Robert Adler, author of Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really enjoyed the Clan of the Cave Bear because it was descriptive and interesting. The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had heard so much about the Clan of the Cave Bear, and Valley of Horses, they had been on my 'read someday' list. Recently I picked these two up cheap at a library sale and, despite the daunting length, was all set to escape into a well-researched, engaging tale of the early days of humankind. I did not get very far. The first book began with an utterly absurd premise, that the 5-year old girl loses her mother because the little brush shelter of theirs, in which the mother is residing, is swallowed up when a great earthquake shakes the surroundings and finally opens up the ground beneath it into a huge crevice, which then closes up behind it.That's right. There are so many believable ways for a stone-age child to lose her mother: Mom could be killed by any of countless large predatory animals, the impetuous girl could have fallen into a river which she was warned to keep away from, a flash flood, etc. And at the first sign of an earthquake, why did the mother not race out of the tiny hut in search of her child?I almost stopped here, but decided to continue. In another page or two I learn the small child has no idea how to find food in her world, and in danger of starving. (Did Mom go out hunter-gathering while the child stayed in the hut watching cartoons?) In a dangerous prehistoric world, outnumbered by big, hungry predators, most likely the mother would not have let her only child out of her sight, and the presumably bright child would have surely picked up some useful information over the years about what is edible. Every mammal on the planet teaches its babies what to eat and how to find or catch it. Children in aboriginal cultures are already caring for their smallest siblings at the age of this helpless young protagonist.With so many glaring plot holes in the first few pages, I could see no reason to commit a massive portion of my valuable time to this writer's work. It is obviously enjoyed by many readers but it completely lost me by page 4 or so."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book came within a week of when I ordered it.

So unless, you're a physical anthropologist or a microbiologist. Please be quiet.The Earth Children's series has impacted my life in two ways: It's why I minored in lingustic anthropology in college (I actually wrote a paper on the Neanderthal language) and why I got a dog (Wolf is the best).Ayla is amazing, I suppose a little too amazing at times, but she is really a symbol of major milestones in human evolution and culture (domestication of animals, usefulness of flint in starting a fire, the idea that sex makes babies, and an explanation for the extinction of Neanderthals (they intermated with modern Homo sapiens).My favorite Earth Children's in order...1)Clan of the Cave Bear2) The Mammoth Hunters3)Shelters of Stone4) Plains of Passage5) Valley of Horses (just get through this, it's worth it)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a work of art !

Her strength is remarkable and her discoveries a bit unbelievable but all worth the while. I have read this entire series, over and over again.

So I'm making it clear that I like it. After saying that, I don't know how else to praise it. It gets a thumbs up for being absorbing and emotional.Now for the negatives. It makes a lot of assumptions about Neanderthal society that I hope are entirely unwarranted, and it gives us a cartoon Supergirl. It is telling us basically that Cro Magnon, namely us, are just so superior to Neanderthal, to an unreasonable degree. Here are some examples.A little Cro Magnon girl with no hunting experience is able to very quickly outshine all of the experienced Neanderthal men in the use of the sling as a weapon to bring down animals. This girl is a little \\"David\\" with that sling, using it like a repeater rifle that can bring down a hyena from a long distance away. Baloney. I don't buy that a little 8 year old girl can become such a killing machine. We're Cro Magnons now, so show me this 8 year old Supergirl today. It makes Cro Magnon seem so superior to Neanderthal, to a comic degree, to an unbelievable degree. Our little girls make far greater warriors than your experienced hunters. No, that smacks of silly superiority.Neanderthal society is a society of utter domination of women by men. Even violent rape is allowed, and the woman has no rights at all to object to getting beaten to a pulp and raped three times a day, every day. This also reeks of Cro Magnon superiority. My guess is that the author is Cro Magnon, no? I'd like to see a similar book written by a Neanderthal. I'm sure that the Neanderthals wouldn't come off as a bunch of, a bunch of, a bunch of Neanderthals in that book.So, to sum up, this very absorbing and emotional book is an insult to all of us Neanderthals. It makes us look like stupid, misogynistic boobs who can't even wield a slingshot as well as a baby girl of your society. All I can say is, put me up against any little baby girl you've got, and I'm sure I can do better than she can at slingshotting hyenas.And by the way, we happen to have a female dominated society. The men among us hunt wooly mammoths all day while the women watch Home Shopping Club.This applies to the audio cassette series, which is read beautifully by a Cro Magnon woman, though the speech she uses for her characters is not at all good when the characters are male. I wonder why they don't hire more than one reader to orally interpret books. Hire a cast of characters. It would help to differentiate the characters and it would prevent the ridiculous attempts by the reader to do a voice of the opposite sex. I'm sure the producers could get a full set of readers very cheaply."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a &quot;must read&quot; for women as young as 10!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have just read the Dutch translation of this book and the three next ones. They are all very good written, I couldn't stop reading, and because of my busy job I unfortunately couldn't read them as fast as I could, so it took me a month.Normally, I don't like romantic books. But these are of a very different class, and I consider myself to be very cynical (hey, I even write this review).What impresses me are not just one major point, but a lot of things. The depth of the characters, the broad description of the surroundings and the way of life, the humour, the change of pace in the storylines, the good continuity and internal consistency, the many details and still an eye for the whole story.In thick books and series of books, the details often are not consistent with the previous chapters and books. I couldn't find such inconsistencies here.The stories are written in such a way, that I often felt like Ayla. I could see the people, the nature, the animals, in my imagination. It's nice to go further than the books go, like imagining what happened to any survivors of the earthquake, or how Durc is developing into manhood, or how Broud might be dethroned as leader of the clan.The only minor point I can think of is the description of the sexual intercourse, which happens a lot over the four books. Some older women I know personally made me clear that it is very special to have it described as this in good books as these.It is indeed quite emancipatory for women, to read about a girl that dares to do things that are not commonly accepted. When she grows up, she becomes a self-aware woman, almost a hero like Odysseus, inventive, brave, strong, beautiful, smart and with a pleasant character. Who wouldn't like to be like her?The four books also give me a good feeling about the era in which the stories happen. It almost makes me understand the human race better, it almost makes me a bit less cynical (how is it possible that the human race survived after all the things it went through, after all the atrocities and stupidities...).All in all, I think Jean Auel wrote four fantastic books and I can't wait for her to finish the fifth. And now I know there is a movie about Ayla, I want to see that as well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla.

Maybe just need to set it down and try again in the future. My mother raved about it, which is why I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In preparation for the final book in the series coming out, I decided I would reread the books of the series again. I've read them many times and they continue to be one of my favorite collections of books that I've read. Of course its not the most perfect series ever written, but I find it so entertaining that I am able to forgive a lot of its problems.Ayla is a young girl who has been left alone in the world after a horrible earthquake steals her family for her. She sets off alone at the tender age of five and after being attacked by a cave lion and collapsing, she is found by a tribe of Neanderthals who are searching for a new cave after their previous one collapsed in the earthquake. At first they aim to leave her behind, but the clan's medicine woman Iza finds some tenderness for the child and begs to bring her with them. Brun the clan leader decides that she may but feels (and will continue later) like he doesn't know if he has made the right choice or not. Since Ayla is of the \\"Others\\" she doesn't have concept of the Clan's language (which is mostly done through sign) and with Creb's (the clan's Mog-ur spiritual leader) help, Iza teaches her not on the language but how to be a proper clan woman as well. Ayla grows quickly and learns at the same pace and Iza decides that she will be a medicine woman as well and begins to teach her the art. In secret though, Ayla begins learning another skill that could put her in danger with the clan. She learns to hunt with a sling. Such things are forbidden to woman and clan woman would never think to hunt, nor to disobey or do anything that isn't of a domestic art, but Ayla is different and cannot abide by such restrictions. Her secret skills are not the only danger to her however; Broud, the proud son of Brun hates Ayla with a passion and will stop at nothing to make her miserable because of his jealousy. Between him and several other trying instances while she lives with the Clan, Ayla has yet to discover if she is truly in her proper place in the world.The characters in this series are developed really well and every one is important to the story. They all evoke some emotion as well. For example, I can't stand Broud, respect Brun, have affection for Creb and feel that Iza is a motherly figure. Ayla, is a good mix of character and has actions and emotions that are both good and bad and keep her seeming real (this will change in other books of the series but for this one, is done well).The writing is very descriptive but doesn't slow the story down. There is some violence and rape scenes and if this bothers you, you should probably not read this book. I'm sure there are discrepancies with some historical, botanical, etc. facts within this book, but as I don't know much about any of those subjects, it didn't make a difference in the enjoyment of the book for me.Overall I highly recommend the series and even the worse of the books is still entertaining. This edition, Clan of the Cave Bear, especially is one of the better books of the series and a good read even if you don't plan on reading the rest.Clan of the Cave BearCopyright 1980468 pagesReview by M.

Auel is truly a gifted Writer. Simply a FABU BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot.

I had read &quot;Neanderthal&quot;, &quot;Almost Adam&quot;, etc. and a friend suggested that I might find Auel a nice progression in the theme of Pre-Historic life. What she did not tell me was how sensitively written the series was and how visually exciting the words were in the mind. I could not put them down and, in fact, became a bit like Ayla, my bedroom akin to her cave, her isolation a parallel to my own not seeing anyone or doing anything except finishing all four books in a single bound of a few weeks! They are perfect beach reading, perfect down-time reading (but make sure you have plenty of time to savor each word and to gleen as many of the bits of historical and botanical information that you can.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This has been one of the best searies of books i have ever read.

In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her &quot;tribe&quot; gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book!

I'm dying to read the next one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I learned a lot about herbs and what they were used for ..loved the honesty and overall good characters in the book"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I started reading Jean Auel's Earth Children series many years ago. I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"\\"Nothing in her experience ever gave her reason to doubt the shelter and those within it would be there when she returned,\\" the perfect opening line to a series of books like The Clan of the Cave Bear. Jean M. Auel wrote this line to help the reader understand the point in life where this young girl stood. She relied on others to take care of her and now she must face life on her own.Ayla a young girl, alone in a world of strangers, is forced to deal with the power struggles and taboos of the clan. Brun is the leader of the clan and is the soul determiner of Ayla's fate. Iza, the medicine woman, decides to save the girl from starvation. The holy man of all clans, Creb, learns more from Ayla than she does from him. Broud, the son of Brun, is an arrogant man, who seeks revenge on Ayla. Born out of a violent rape, Durc is the future of the clan. Ayla is my favorite character because she changes the most out of all the characters in this novel. As a young girl, she is ruled by taboos and traditions of the clan. As a young adult, she's stronger and more knowledgeable than any other clan member.Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age is large-scale area for this novel. The extent of ice and change in coastlines during the 10,000 year Interstadial, a warming trend during the Wurm glaciations of the late Pleistocene Epoch, extending from 35,000 to 25,000 years before present time was occurring during this period. The novel takes place in a cave for a large part of the story. The cave is where the clan live and a smaller cave's where Ayla contemplates clan activities.Ayla, a young girl who is lost and must survive using only her inner strength to guide her. The leader of the clan and one of the people who help decide Ayla's fate is Brun, a bearded, barrel-chested man. Iza, chief medicine woman of the clan, takes Ayla in. Creb is the magician, but most refer to him as the holy man of all clans. Broud is the son of Brun and is set to take over the clan. Durc is the Ayla's child, born out of a violent rape and shall be the future of the clan.The main story within the novel is Ayla's growth as a person. Seeing her as a young child lost and confused about life. She does not know where she belongs and struggles to find her place in this group of people. As she grows into a young woman she learns survival techniques and picks up knowledge from other clan members. She wants to be more of a factor in the clan and play a part in the power, but the leaders will not allow that to happen.The language in the book uses everyday terms except for in the dialogue between characters, in which it changes to nomadic language. Auel has a good knowledge of early plants helped make the medicine woman more believable. The novel was written in third person point of view. Auel wrote the characters to have a range of human emotions. She writes about not only physical human survival but mental as well. The flow of the story is very smooth after the second chapter. In the first chapter you start with Ayla being lost and confused. In the second chapter you are immediately introduced to the clan and in the middle of the chapter Ayla appears again. At first, it was somewhat confusing but when you kept reading everything transitioned well. I felt the story was strong in all aspects, but Auel's strongest writing feature is her knowledge on the time period.When reading the novel you can compare it to the present day issues and power struggles, so any person would enjoy the novel. This quote fits the description of Ayla in the novel, &quot;If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend told me I should read this book, but I never got around to it. Then, last week my mom found the book in a thrift store and asked if I wanted to borrow it. Finals were over, I had a week before school started, so I figured..What the hell..I can always quit if I don't like it.This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little time on their hands and wants to go into Ayla's world. The characthers felt so real to me, that I hated to see the book end. I have ordered the second book, and ran across the third in the series in that same thrift shop today. I can't wait to read the others! Absolutely Excellent! As a side note: If you see the movie starring Darryl Hannah as Ayla, for clan of the cave bear..It is a horrible adaptation of the book. I was bored with the movie, but the book held my attention and was excellent..(Did I say that already?) Buy the books, rent the movie."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a fascinating book. I learned a lot about the early days of the human race through this book, and the story was great too. Ayla comes from the race of The Others, the more highly developed humans who are mistrusted by the clan who adopts the young orphan girl when she is five. The clan is deeply rooted in tradition and customs and doesn't like change or deviation from the norm. So taking Ayla in takes some getting used to. But through the years, they adjust to her presence, and she grows up as part of their culture. She's different from them, though - she knows it and they know it and it's always hanging over them. But she pushes on, overcoming obstacles and standing up for herself every step of the way.I won't spoil the ending, but I was sorry it ended at the point in the story where it did. It would have been far more satisfying to see what happens after the events at the end of the book. There would have been a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the inevitable decline and destruction that would most certainly occur under the new leadership. Alas, I guess we'll just have to imagine it in our minds."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is absolutely awesome. However, if you aren't interested in The history of man kind, then I sugguest you read another book. While reading the book, I almost felt like I was the main character and it kept the pages turning. This indicates a great book that is worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book so much!

This book was definitely the best of the bunch. I have not read the latest one yet, but intend to in the near future. This is the story that lays the plot for all the books in the series, and it is a stunner. It is so real that it's like Ms. Auel is writing of someone we know. We all feel that we are friends of Ayla by the time we get into the story. I found that Ms. Auel whetted my appetite for other prehistoric novelists, and that turned me to Kathleen and Michael Gear, who I also recommend."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I originally read this book about 20 years ago and found it pretty fascinating. I started waiting for each new book in this series to come out. Have now read them all, and really enjoy the adventure, the look-back to early human history. I like to keep books that touch me and just re-bought this 1st in the Earth's Children series after my original edition went missing. I highly recommend the whole series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a great book and a great start to the series. It pretty much made me feel every emotion imaginable.

I recommends it to everybody. Regards."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was very different. Who would have thought you could write a work of fiction from Cave Man days. It kept my attention and I can't wait to start on the second book in this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book over 20 years ago and am rereading it now for the 3rd time.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel allows us to peer through her literary jewelers loop into a time so distant that the mists have congealed around the foundations of society. We are reminded that even then, the human spirit sought to acknowledge a higher power; saw itself as superior to the brute beasts that surrounded it and strove to rise from the morass of self survival. Her story of a young girl&#8217;s conquest over the brutality of life becomes the conquest of mankind over his environment. Aylas journey from near death to the joys of self sufficiency is the Sirens call for us all to choose the avenue which is good and pure over the one which leads to destruction.Calvin Howell"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read this book a few times since it came out. It had to be replaced because it was faling apart and I could not find anyone to repair it. Looking forward to getting the last book in the series in hardback."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"actually, an intriguing and literally epic idea. especially when I first read it, years ago, the idea of a female protagonist being the central figure not only of the story but of this stage in human, earthly development, was absolutely unique. I still find it so (I reread it)..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The best thing about this book is that the setting is completely new and refreshing compared to the typical swords, dragons and wizards fantasy books. The narrator puts you in a know-it-all position that is very instructive about ancient history and the origins of our kind.I gave it 5 stars to excel it about some very good 4 star books, but it would get 9 out of 10 only because the superhero of the story has things a little too cut out for her. Every bad thing turns out to be good and it insinuates a &#34;...and lived happily ever after&#34; ending (despite it not being so). I would have made it a bit flatter and more realistic for my taste, but it's not enough to lose the 5 stars.The author really did her homework for this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel 's EARTH'S CHILDREN series, starting with CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, is my all time favorite read. The final book of the series, THE LAND OF PAINTED CAVES, however, was a HUGE disappointment. I want the author to know that after waiting over 10 years for this book, she really let her readers down.Again, Clan of the Cave Bear, is a MUST read! The next book in the series, The Valley Of Horses, is as good! Enjoy!Jennie Porter Storch"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This story was great! As I was reading I totally lost my self in the story. The descriptions and well researched information took me back in time and I could almost hear the grunts, the crackle of the fire and smell the meat roasting! Sometimes though, details were a little much and I felt anxious to get on with the story when the author was explaining the tedious steps involved in making a weapon or such things like that. After finishing the book I have a yearning for simplicity. I set out to enjoy nature and nurish my body with the earth. My fitness trainers have been bothering me to try this new Paleo diet, (where we eat like cave men,) and after reading the descriptions of Ayla's lean long body I have decided to try it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is a people of the others. An earthquake happened early in the morning when she went swimming. Her family went into the cracks between the earth. When this happened Ayla went into the forest for many days. She got scratched by a cave lion. The Clan people found Ayla lying on the ground, weak and sick. The medcine woman, Iza, Convinced the leader,Brun, To let her stay. Ayla was given a powerful totem that was meant for males, and males only. People thought she was very ugly. In her 7th year she secretly watched a hunting ceremony, which was forbidden. She taught herself to hunt. She had a son named Durc. A couple years later she forced to to leave everything behind to find her people.Ayla was a young girl and was taller than all the men in the clan by her 6th year. She was a very adventureous person, and was very daring. She has blonde hair and light eyes, well the people of the clan had brown and dark eyes.I liked this book because it was very exciting and there was always somthing exciting going on. It taught me about the primative people and what they might have thought. Sometimes the book got boring and dragged on and on. And it did have some difficult language and it was hard for me to understand sometimes."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book must be the best book I have ever read, and I have read a ton, trust me. Clan of the Cave Bear is a great story about a girl named Ayla, who is orphaned after an earthquake. She is adopted by lesser-evolved humans, who decided she is \\"ugly\\" and the outcast. When her totem is a high one only males have, ( males dominate the clan, and totems are spirits that protect the clan), the leader's son Broud grows to hate her. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give it away. You should read this book, you won't regret it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I \\"read the book\\" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously \\"too perfect\\" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the &quot;Others&quot;, who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\\\\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read all the books by this author that I have discovered by any chance,because I am a French reader.

I watched this movie in Social Studies class in seventh grade and it was one that i actually stayed awake during. Usually books are better than their movies so i decided to read it. I wasn't very into it in the begining but then i never put it down. I finshed it while in the car riding from Pennsylvania to Nebraska. I stayed in nebraska for 5 days and had to read the second one as soon as possible(i got it fron the local library. The book was greatly written. Iza and Creb's love (as well as the rest of the clan except Broud) for a girl of the others was great. I cried a couple times during the book due to how descriptive some things were(broud beating Ayla to a pulp!) I wished when she was cursed she would have taken Durc. it was sad to have to give your son up."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and was eager to reads it and eventenially I hope to read all of Jean Auels' books in the near future."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Love this series, this is the first book and it starts slow but once you get into it, you can't stop!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love this book! I read it years ago and when I discovered the fifth book is out in paperback, I bought it again since I knew that winter was coming. I needed something to keep me busy in those long winter evenings. This book is the best medicine for us winter-weary folks!The book starts with Ayla who loses her parents in an earthquake and was found, wandering around delirious with pain from four lion scratches on her legs and delirious from hunger, by Iza, a Medicine woman. In spite of her &quot;otherness&quot; Ayla is adopted into the clan. And that is just the beginning of her tribulations and trimuphs. Ayla is not perfect but she's such a fascinating character to read ~~ I don't care if she's almost perfect. I can escape into her story and be glad of a cozy fire at my feet while the wind is howling outside!If you're interested in historical fiction with a good story ~~ this book is it. It's engrossing and full of rich details of primitive lifestyle ~~ it makes you wonder if they really are that different from all of us. They live, hunt, eat, love and bear babies and die ~~ like us. Just their tools and surroundings are a lot cruder than our living standards. It's a great book to escape into. Perfect for those long winter nights.2-2-04"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"After having this book in my bookshelf for years I finally decided to give it a go.

As she wanders the vast land trying to find someone to hopefully be there for her. Along the way Ayla has started to fall ill and needs help.As The Clan of The Cave Bear heads off to find a new cave, along the long journey Iza finds a young child. A child that doesn't look like her people, but is still in need of care. She takes Ayla with her in hopes that Ayla will feel better and be on her way. Iza doesn't expect that this child could be the lucky one who will change people.After agreeing to allow Ayla to live with Clan Ayla is met with some troubles with the other people of the Clan because she doesn't look them and she isn't one of them. But as time goes on she proves to people that she can be like them. She has many mishaps with the people in the Clan that make them still belive she isn't one of them, but still they let her stay with them.Ayla has to adjust to staying a woman of the Clan and that means being submissive to the men of the Clan and learning many new things along the way.The charactors in this book grow on you and you don't want to leave them for anything you want to be there to see how they grow and what they learn.This is a great book and I can't wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had nearly forgotten about this book, read years ago, when someone told me that book 5, &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot; came out. I just read it, also an excellent read! It brought a nice circle to the story and was very well written. Once you meet this character you wont ever really forget her. I recommend the whole series. You can't help but to love the main character, Ayla, and picking up Auel's newest book, which brings the earlier books into a nice circle, brought back all the memories of this one and the whole series. (Reading these in order will put all the characters and relationships into perspective.) This book is a can't miss, and I'd recommend the whole series just to get to book 5!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an amazing book. My name on Amazon isn't just because I'm a crazed fan of the series, it's because my mother named me after the herion of this book. I think it's amazing how Ayla overcame the hardships in her life and learned to used her healing and keep her calm over Broud. She's an amazing role model to look up to, for me, and for anyone who reads this. I highly recomend this. If you won't listen to the older readers, listen to me. I'm thirteen years old, and this is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love to read, and I especially love to see a movie for the first time and find out that it was inspired by a novel. The Clan of the Cave Bear movie was good, but the book is amazing. Jean M. Auel tells an engaging story. Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep. I try to reread it at least once a year. If you like books that grab your attention and then refuse to let go-This is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have to admit it took a while for me to become interested in this type of book. It's the perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover. On first glance it seems like all those other adventure books that put you to sleep with the first sentence, but I promise if you pick up this book you will find it impossible to put down. It only gets better each time you read it, too! After reading this book, I had to read the others in the collection and believe me, the rest are just as good as the first!After reading this book, you can't help but be impacted by it. It has impacted my life and I think helps me each day to be a better person. It really has made me take a good look at myself and strive to have the qualities the main character, Ayla, has: honesty, integrity, and self-confidence. Those are just a few of her special characteristics, but are what I continually strive for each day.I'm telling you, read this book and you will see exactly what I'm talking about and what millions of others mean when they say this book is by far the best ever!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this book! I have an interest in anthropology, have always heard of it and have been almost embarrassed not to have read it! I bought it just to see what all the hype was about, but was quickly absorbed and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I rarely have time to read fictional novels, but I stayed awake four hours on a red-eye flight to finish it!The main characters and story are great, some parts are a little far-fetched and certain characters are exaggerated, but the overall story is captivating. It left me running to buy the second Earth Child book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read the series over 5 times and each time I enjoy it more. I am so excited about the new book. I hope it can stand up to all the others. I thought this was an excellent book. It is not as violent as some of the other books by Sarabande. Thanks Jean."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just happened to pick up this book out of a drawer at work on a slow night and I couldn't put it down. Not only does the author relay a very good story, she has done a tremendous amount of research on herbs and put together an assembly of characters that touch us all. I can't wait to read the other books in her series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I feel like I am the only one who has NOT read this story; I put it off for years thinking it was going to be a throw back of 1,000,000,000 Years BC, or something; after all, how intersting could Cave people be?!? Wow was I wrong!This story has it all! Myths and legends that I hope I can remember so I can tell them to my daughter as a story someday. Spiritual beliefs that are beautiful and daunting at the same time. A sense of community that is like no other that I have seen. A look into our past and the &quot;start&quot; of humans and humanity, and characters like no other!The Mog-ur, the highest magician in all the Clans, he speaks to the spirits, he is the one that holds all the rituals and ceremonies for the Clan, and he is the one that I would want on my side. He takes to a little girl, Ayla, who is found on the way to a new cave by the most powerful medicine woman in all the clans, Iza. Ayla is different, she is one of the Others. She brings to the Clan luck (?), because of her strong totem, and causes more controversy than this Clan has seem in 35,000 years!Ayla's story of trying to fit in, trying to overcome her &quot;ugliness&quot; and her differnces, trying to be accepted into the only family that she can remember, despite the fact that she has so many &quot;different&quot; ideas than a good Clan woman, is truly wonderful. Each one of her struggles pulled at my heart, and the writing is so good, I found myself reading long into the night, wanting to find out what happened next.This woman loved the whole story! :)Enjoy,Debbi"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book I read was The Clan Of The Cave Bear. It is about a girl named Ayla whose mother dies in an earthquake. She wanders around until a cave lion attacks her and after that she faints. When a group of Neanderthals pass by they pick her up. She grows up with them and when she nears the age of nine, she begins to hunt with a sling, which is forbidden by the clan. If you become interested you should read the rest of Jean M. Auel's series, the books are in order.The Clan of the Cave BearThe Valley of HorsesMammoth HuntersThe Plains of PassageThe Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's not as vast as the worlds created by Frank Herbert and J.R.R. Tolkien but ambitious enough to continually remind me of their work.I really liked the set up of the story over the first half of the book. A reader can experience a very foreign place and time that feels increasingly familiar as each event creates more insight into prehistoric landscape, society, species, races, thought, religion and language. The description of the mental, physical, spiritual consistency of the Clan race and the Others was fascinating and believable. The use of a five year old girl trying to fit in and bridge the gap between her younger forward thinking race and the more ancient memory ridden Clan of the Cave Bear was a perfect way to show differences and similarities.Through the second half of the book, it settles into a good story but doesn't reveal as much of Auel's amazing depiction of the prehistoric world that I found so captivating in the beginning. The characters started to remind me of people today with the same free thinking, tradition bound differences and similarities that we enjoy and struggle with.I really enjoyed the end of the book and found myself out the next day purchasing the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first time I read this book, I fell in love with the darling little orphan, Ayla. Thrust into a family that was not her own--one whose members disliked and distrusted her--Ayla survived years of mental and physical abuse, sadly assuming that she deserved most of her punishments. As much as she tried to please the clan, to fit in and become one of them, she was and always would be an outsider; something she realized but could not change. Without them, however, she would surely die. Aylahad little choice but to stay with the group for as long as they would let her (which, periodically, became a social issue) and do her best to survive in their world.Her inner strength and courage often brought tears to my eyes; her spunky personality made me grin. Ayla's story was a gripping, intense tale that just wouldn't let me go until I had read every last word of that book.Then, of course, I had no choice but to re-read it; it's just that kind of book. The second reading was an altogether different thing. I was drawn right through a time tunnel...and was there! By Iza's side, I witnessed life with the clan and struggled along with them to survive the hardships of their day.I learned to love Iza--mother, teacher, friend--as much as Ayla (and must commend Jean Auel for allowing Iza to be such a warm, wise, brave, intelligent and knowledgable woman). This was Iza's story as much as it was Ayla's and, for awhile perhaps, mine. We were family. We were Clan. I was there. It's just that kind of book.When the last page was read, I felt a twinge of regret about having to return to my own time and return the book to the shelf. And so I reached for \\"The Valley of Horses\\"...and began to read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just got done reading the clan of the cave bear. This is the best book I ever seen. From the very sart it is one of the best books in the world. From when Iza finds a little girl that is so close to dieing that olny Iza's best work can bring her back to the last line this book it's grate. This is the book that you have wanted all of your live. Form the time that she is 5 to the time she is 11 she dose not stop warming your hart."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"i would just like to say that i believe that i one of the best examples of historical fiction existing. not only is it informative, the plot is rich and subtle, and the whole book is full of twists and turns. i sinverely hope that the rest of the series are just as good, and that many other people will have the chance i have to savor this masterpiece of writing. also, this review is dedicated to adrienne(if she happens to be reading this) and to my hated tx history teacher who recomended it. the only worthwhile thing he's ever said!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I knew that this was a novel that has been heralded as a feminist novel - a story about strong women and their struggles with society. And eventhough I have never really considered myself a \\"strong feminist\\" I really liked the book...P>The book is fascinating, the characters interesting and the setting is awe-inspiring. I couldn't put the book down once I got into the story. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I thought this book was in a word, amazing. I loved the idea of a novel being set over 25,000 years ago. The plot was unique and suspenseful and I found myself reading long into the night. The author kept the story very realistic and congruent with actual theorys and new archaeological discoveries; I found this facinating. I found myself sympathizing often with Ayla and hurting when she hurt. Broud was a powerful antagonist and while I was forced to hate him, it was hard not to see things from his point of view as a fierce supporter of Clan traditions. While he was arrogant and unforgiving, he was a good opposite for Ayla and kept the story moving and exciting. Iza and Crub were wonderfully developed characters, both stern and compassionate. I absoutely loved how little things in the story stuck out about what life may be like in the future. The golden hair and blue eyes. Straight legs. How children are conceived. Everything. It all fit to how the reader knew things would end up thousands of years later when the mammoths would die out along with the Clan. The only main complaint I had about the book was that Ayla was always in trouble. She never got a break and I found that sort of frustrating. I know it would be hard to keep a book interesting if the protagonist was always carefree and happy, but I found it a little unrealistic that Ayla would be brought before Brun with a death sentence that many times and still come out unmarred."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A FRIEND OF MINE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ME APPROX. 1 YEARAGO AND I HAVE BEEN HOOKED ON PREHISTORIC FICTION EVER SINCE.CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

It is a fascinating story, always engrossing! One of those that will stay with you forever - in a good way. None of the sequels have been nearly as good as this first book - but you still read them, hoping. I picked this book up near the register at the supermarket while waiting in line and was hooked after the first page. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Auel will get the main character (Ayla) back to the Clan for the resolution of this series. Whether she does or not, this book stands on its own. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book when I was 18 and recently read it again(atthe age of 21) and I read it in 2 days........Its a large book but Icould not put it down!

I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have been able to read at a very high level since sixth grade, and finally have found an author that I can read and still feel confident that I am reading at my level.

Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today.

Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read.."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I saw the movie about 5 years ago, it was great. But then I heard about the book and read it and I must say that the movie doesnt even come close to the book. When I receive the book I wanted to read just a few lines, but I could not put it down. Now two days later I am done and I cant wait to buy the second one in the series. You just have to read it!!! Like I said, this book is simply amazing!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading, and I had heard from many different people that it was very interesting. I was almost anxious to read it and judge for myself if it was all that it was cracked up to be. Once I started reading, I felt that it was going to be a very hard book to get into. As it went on, past the first 100 pages or so, I found myself unable to put it down. This book made me feel all of the different emotions: anger, sadness, happiness, etc. Some of the descriptions of ceremonies became a little boring ,and I was skimming over those parts, but all in all, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What a marvelous book. I loved the journey this novel took me on and the prehistoric setting was so beliveable.Jean M. Auel is a wonderful story teller and it's a colourful and wonderful world she's given us in this novel, setting it in the ice age.It was gripping, reading about Ayla's journey from a young child to adulthood and the trials she faces living with the Neanderthal tribe who found her.There is everything one could ask for in a novel, adventure, fun, danger, jealousy and love and romance.I especially liked the extensive research J.M.A. has done, and her detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla, was extremely fascinating.I have read the entire series and must say it was riveting.There are 5 books in all:1:The Clan of the Cave Bear2:The Valley of Horses3:The Mammoth Hunters4:The Plains of Passage5:The Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is the first book in Jean Auel's series Earth's Children. Over the years, many friends have suggested this series to me, so I've meant to read it for a long time and finally did just that. In reading, it is important to remember this is speculative fiction, based loosely on fact, and not fact.Throughout the book, Auel makes good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs, landscapes and climates. Little idiosyncracies can usually be overlooked, like the use of plants native to North America instead of Europe where the stories take place, discussion on land masses and bodies of water which aren't consistent with what we now know can usually be overlooked, and so on.Auel's strength is that she enables the reader to see life as it might have been lived by our ancestors during the last Ice Age. She makes you wonder about behavior of ancient man, what is must have been like to sit under unpolluted skies or spend the winter in a cave. While a cave may be pretty damp and cold, the damp and cold may be the least of your worries as you'd also yave to worry about food supplies as winter progressed and may also have to fend off wild animals like a cave lion.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name but ones senses they are Neanderthals, and the \\"others\\" are closer to what we'd consider 'modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world in terms of \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect? A good question."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M Auel, was a fantastic book. The idea of Ayla's family being killed and then being separated from society and found by a group of 'uncivilized' and 'under developed' Clan, makes for a great story full of adventure and excitement. There is never a dull moment around the tall, blue eyed Ayla and the rest of the people in her Clan. You find yourself not able to put down the book because you want to see what sort of trouble Ayla will get in, if she'll finally master the art of her sling, or if she'll finally be accepted into the Clan.Auel captures each character and the Clan as a whole so well and you learn so much about them. She created a 'society' for her book without leaving out any detail. Auel created their 'language', social rank, hunting habits, religion, etc. which really helps you understand the Clan that much better.Overall I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a heroic main character. It's a good book to pick up when there's nothing to do and you're looking for some entertainment. And after you read The Clan of the Cave Bear there are four others that follow. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Before I begin, I want to mention that I am making any events from the book as vague as possible while I write. The book is full of twists and turns and I don't want to take any surprise from you if you choose to read this book. The book as a whole is a work of art. Such a thick book might scare people away, but as soon as you begin to read the book you can't tear your eyes away from it. From the moment the book begins till the moment it ends it is full of action. Never a dull moment happens in Ayla's life. (Ayla being the main character of the book.) The characters are deep and full of life. Auel gives such rich descriptions and life to the characters. You feel as though you've met them and have actually become friends with all of them by the end of the book. Every book is not with out it's flaws, though; And this book is no exception. Auel obviously did extensive research on plants, animals, and the life and times of cave people. Her research does not blend well with the book, though. She describes scenes and settings in &quot;over detail.&quot; It seems as though she is &quot;showing off&quot; her knowledge rather than describing to the reader how things look. She will go into detail about the plants and unless you are a botanist, these details are meaningless. You can skim over these details easily, but you can't skim over a rotten book. Lucky for us, the book is great except for the over details. There was one other problem I had with the book. Inconsistency. In one part of the book, Ayla is banned from a certain activity and even from speaking of it. Continue reading for a while and you will find her not only doing the activity and speaking of it, but teaching someone else the activity. I may have been mistaken and somewhere missed it when the ban was lifted, but this ban was a punishment that I could see no reason for revoking. This doesn't take anything away from the book; It is still wonderful despite this! Time strains to change in the book. It doesn't blend seamlessly like it should. It is an abrupt change and you feel as though you have missed something. When so much time passes without telling the reader, Auel could have at least told us Ayla's current age! But you are forced to guess her age at each time change, which really makes getting a good mental picture of what was going on difficult. I hate to end on a sour note, so I'll continue on for a bit more. The plot of the book is amazing! I knew just from hearing about the topic that this book was going to be great. Some books dwell on events and seem to take forever to get interesting, but not this one! Things are quick, but not so quick that it becomes hard to understand what's going on. I cannot wait to read the entire series. I encourage every one to at least pick up the 1st book (The Clan Of the Cave Bear) and read the 1st chapter. I guarantee you'll fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Admittedly, The Clan of the Cave Bear has parts that feel a bit like a V.C. Andrews novel set during the Ice Age, but I still enjoyed it immensely and am now fascinated with the joys, hardships, knowledge, limitations, and legacy of the Neanderthals and their differing counterparts, the Cro-Magnons. Jean Auel writes in an extremely detailed and interesting style; her in-depth understanding of Ice Age flora and fauna is undeniable, and many of her characters are unforgettable (Ayla, the lucky and resourceful Cro-Magnon heroine adopted by the Neanderthal Clan after a terrifying earthquake leaves her orphaned and wandering the gorgeous but dangerous landscape; Iza, the loving surrogate mother to Ayla and the Clan's talented medicine woman; Creb, a father figure to Ayla as well the respected aging magician--or \\"mog-ur\\"--of the Clan).The Clan of the Cave Bear is packed with information regarding the rituals, customs, and home of the Neanderthals. While I am sure Auel has taken literary license in the Clan's acceptance of Ayla (an \\"Other\\") and the thoughts and motivations of the members, one can't help but become enthralled with the aspects of prehistoric life and daily survival, especially when Ayla is forced to fend for herself. I suggest The Clan of the Cave Bear for anyone remotely interested in the end of the Neanderthals' era--or, really, for anyone who enjoys vivid storytelling."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of an orphaned little girl being adopted by a neanderthal clan in the latest ice age is very original, especially the description of their language, food, medicines, and ways of life in general. But what disturbs me about the book is whether these facts are actually correct: forMrs. Auel's saying her book is based on a very vast study of the subject. But a few years ago I've read an article about how neanderthals could talk just like us if anybody bothered to teach them - this is a MAJOR slip for a book that's supposed to be more or less accurate... I do understand how the fact that the Clan's language is not a vocal one enhances the plot of this book and the following ones, but maybe this inaccuracy should have been mentioned right next to Mrs. Auel's statement about her vast research... This way, I feel I can never be sure about any other 'facts' in the story.Another issue I wasn't comfortable about in the whole series is its feminist message. Even though I'm a woman, and believe in women's rights, I think that the importance of each gender's role in the clan wasn't given enough attention just to stress the 'unfairness' of it all. I think it's wrong to judge a society so different from our own, in time, herritage and customs, by our own standards of right and wrong."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a wonderful way to escape our every day mind set and slip into the endless adventure of the characters portrayed. If you love history you will certainly enjoy this novel as well as the others to this set. I own all the books and have read them at least twice. I would love to know when and if there is going to be another book? The author is a delightful writer with percision and style. This book and set is a must have."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you are looking for an engaging story, not fluffy but not too ponderous, and one that is a little off the beaten track, this would be a good choice.The previous negative review surprises me. I have read Unmeel's other reviews and believe that his inaccurate review of this book is not worthy of his talents. Author Jean Auel goes to great pains in this book not to portray the CroMagnon girl as &quot;superior&quot; to the Neandrethal clan that has adopted her. The Neandrethals survived for 250,000 years, far longer than we have, a fact which Auel reverently acknowledges. This story is set during a time where the characteristics of one hominid species (Neandrethal) would, through a certain inflexibility, bring about its demise, while the characteristics of another, CroMagnon, would enable it to continue as earth's surviving human inhabitant. Since this book deals thematically with this transition, it is essential that it looks at the differences that brought it about. Nowhere does the book explicitly or through its tone suggest that the difference meant the Neandrethals were inferior. In fact, they are portrayed lovingly and respectively.Indeed, Auel's view seems to be that the Neandrethals were in several ways superior to the CroMagnon, but that overall their inability to adapt to the forthcoming changes ultimately rendered these advantages meaningless.The plot is far fetched, and of course a certain license must be taken when writing about how people lived some 30,000 years ago, but the tale is carries you along, is often touching, and is refreshing in its refusal to impose 20th century values on prehistoric societies. The writing style can be uneven, making me think that perhaps it was written over a long period of time with gaps in between, but when all is said and done we have been introduced to several memorable characters. The most appealing is that of the Mog-Ur, the medicine man, proving that Auel's bias is not toward the &quot;new and improved&quot; CroMagnon."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jeam M. Auel's The Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most moving and interesting books I have read in a long time. It is the story of a woman, Ayla, and is set in the world of prehistoric man, about thirty thousand years ago. Ayla is separated from her family at a young age after an earth-shaking natural disaster. She is adopted by a travaling Clan of Cave People. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon, and as she grows up, the author shows her readers how the girl's mental and physical deviations from her adopted family change both her and them. As Ayla grows up, the story becomes an epic tale of her struggle to both survive and fit in with a group of people she is destined to overtake through evolution eventually. Of course, Ayla doesn't know this, and the story is moving in that it shows how Ayla's love stretches all bounds, from her adopted mother and father, to her son, Durc, who was born from a brutal rape.Auel obviously did a lot of research for this book, which is shown by her seemingly unboundless knowledge of the prehistoric landscape, animals, plants, and lifestyles that surround her characters. She vividly depict the Paleolithic setting, making the reader almost believe he or she could visit the endless grasslands or glacier mountains the author writes of. Overall, The Clan of the Cave Bear is an epic book, very captivating, and definitely a real page-turner."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My sister got me hooked on Auel's series over 10 years ago and I've read all 4 of the current novels at least 3 times/each. I am impatiently awaiting what I believe may be Auel's best book ever, as Ayla returns with Jondalar to his home in what is now present day France. I look forward to seeing how Auel will again weave prehistoric facts into her beautiful fictional story. If you're not convinced that you'd like a story of prehistory, let me persuade you to give The Clan of the Cave Bear a try. I too was skeptical of liking this type of book, but after 3 chapters, I was hooked. Auel's literary greatness is, I believe, her ability to make us believe wholeheartedly that what the characters did in these books not only COULD have happened, but DID happen."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is.... well not very good. It's got lots of history and details that paint an interesting picture of the time the story is set in, but Auel is just not a story-teller. I think she wanted to write a history text-book, and did this instead. When she tries to give us a narrative or get us to care about her characters, most of the time she fails.*SPOILERS (if you care)*The story centers around Ayla, a cro-magnon who is orphaned and taken in by a clan of Neanderthals called the Clan of the Cavebear. The clan is very male-centric, and the women are essentially a slave class. They communicate in a version of sign-language and age much faster than modern humans.Ayla somehow *cough*plotcontrivance*cough* survives an attack from a cave-lion despite this apparently being really hard to do. She then stumbles off and gets lost and passes out. When she is found by the only truely likable character in the book, Iza, she is dehydrated and suffering from a nasty infection on her scratch-wound from the lions, making Iza take pity on her, despite not being supposed to interact with &#34;The Others&#34; (aka, the cro-magnons) and stop to help her. Her brother, the clan leader, tells her to leave the girl there, but Iza begs him to let her take the little girl with them, because she can't bear to see a child suffer, no matter what the species. Since Iza is the clan's medicine woman, and he doesn't want her to be upset and do her job badly, he allows her to keep the child, at least temporarilly.Ayla, of course, grows up to be a mary-sue to end all mary-sues. Ayla can cook, clean, make leather thongs and bone tools, bowls, etc, better than just about everybody. She's also apparently somehow magically a better medicine woman than her foster mother, Iza, for no apparent reason aside from the apparent magic of having a cro-magnon brain. She also manages to endear hersef to some of the clan's men, including the Mog-Ur (shaman) and a few of the hunters. They still treat her like crap, but typically don't smack her around like some of the others do. She is good at EVERYTHING, except making Broud, the clan's resident psychopath/sociopath/future leader, like her. Though he apparently does enjoy raping her, so there's that very icky detail.A lot of the story ends up being repititions of &#34;women are submissive and men are dominant, so it's totally weird that Ayla doesn't like being submissive!&#34; &#34;Ayla's not supposed to hunt, but SHE TOTALLY DOES!&#34; how much she totally wants to have a baby, and can't figure out why she hasn't had one yet, because she's been living with the clan for like, forever, and she's totally 8 now, so it's definitely time! and how sad she is that she's so &#34;ugly&#34; which is clearly a huge wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the reader, since she's described as absurdly conventionally beautiful when they describe her looks. She also figures out how conception, pregnancy, and paternity work, just because, and for some reason, is not killed after the first time or two she does something she's not supposed to and cheeses off the group's leadership.The other kind of creepy thing about the story is the subtle racist undertone of it. Ayla is somehow lily-white despite being out under the sun all the time, and is ridiculously perfect at everything except being a submissive woman. She's portrayed as this beautiful, super-talented, super-intelligent creature, so abused by the mean old Neanderthals. Aside from the annoying mary-sue nature of that characterization, the Neanderthal clan is described as dark, having large noses, thick course dark hair, and being generally not very bright. Hm... lily-white, blonde, blue-eyed, perfect, put-upon woman living amongst course uncivilized dark-skinned clan of idiots. Nope, no racism there. No sirree.If you're just looking for a very detailed text-book like description of the world of the Neanderthal, this is a good book for that. So, however, are many actual text-books. If you want a story or real characters, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Esta est&oacute;ria de beleza e poder &eacute; uma saga sobre pessoas, relacionamentos, amor e sobrevivncia.Atrav&eacute;s do relato de Jean M Auel, somos levados de volta &agrave; aurora dos seres humanos.

This is truely a special novel about Ayla's childhood journey when she is separated from her family by a natural disaster and adopted by the Clan."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Back in the 80's when the book was written, I didn't read it because it wasn't factual and scientifically accurate. It seems that with the passing of time, I've become more interested in a good story line and less critical of journeys into the realm of pure fantasy.The story is captivating. A child found and raised by a tribe of people from another branch of the human evolutionary tree. As the child grew to be a woman she was accepted by the tribe. She was valued, even loved but always different. Jean Auel has created a wonderful character in Ayla, smart, practical, loyal and loving, yet fundamentally different from the people she shares her life with. Fascinating from start to finish this book will leave you wanting more. Happily there are more books which continue the story of Ayla and I plan to read them soon."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I remember during the eighties everyone was reading 'Clan of the Cave Bear' by Jean M. Auel - and they were raving about it. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to reading it, but finally I have and now that Auel has finished the six part series, I haven't stopped reading this saga (just finished number three 'The Mammoth Hunters').The reason why I finally picked it up to read was because of a recommendation from a friend who I regularly 'talk books' with. She was astounded I hadn't read it and demanded that I did so pronto, and I dutifully downloaded it. So, what is it about this book that gets people talking? For me it is the fascination of where we have come from as a species, and how we have become the people we are today.The story is set in prehistoric times, roughly 30 000 years ago. It follows the story of Ayla, the protagonist, who is separated from her parents at a young age and taken in by a travelling group of 'clan' people, they are Neanderthal.This story interests readers on a number of levels. Firstly, Ayla's struggle to belong and fit into a vastly different group is heart wrenching. The emotional journey she experiences is so engaging to read. Ayla is a highly likable character. She is intelligent and caring and we sympathies with her readily as she attempts to learn the cultural norms, taboos and language of a neanderthal society. As she becomes interested in healing and medicine, the story interests us further and we become privy to the magic of the plants used to heal in prehistoric times.Secondly, the life of the Neanderthal, the way they existed and their differences from humans makes for fascinating reading. Auel's ability to bring research to life is intoxicating. I found myself doing a little of my own research as I read this book, wanting to learn more about our evolutionary cousins. One thing I came across is that it is likely some human beings today carry Neanderthal genes. Fascinating! It is so interesting to read about a human species that is now extinct. One thing that is particularly intriguing is the differences in the brain structures. Neanderthals had very large back brains and Auel capitalises on this by showing the clan's remarkable capacity for memory.Another aspect that makes this an exceptional read is the detail in terms of the daily life of prehistoric people. The clothing, food, tools and housing are all described in fascinating detail along with how they were made. Humanity's capacity for innovation is celebrated in this series. But at the same time we are reminded of the dire consequences if we ever lose respect for the earth and all that it provides. Auel cleverly reminds us of this and we wonder if we have already lost it.The only real criticism I have is that perhaps Ayla is too perfect. Surprise, surpass as we read on in the series, not only is she altruistic, intelligent and innovative, she is drop dead gorgeous! Sometimes her perfection and her innocence about it, \\"I am not beautiful\\" gets a little irritating ... but only a little.I am up to the fourth novel, 'The Plains of Passage', but for me, so far, 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' has been a favourite. I highly recommend it for those who particularly enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first book in this series The Earth Children's Series was very informative. The Story begins. The author has a tendency to repeat things in the book series that was very annoying to me over the next 6 books. I found myself skipping over details as se repeatedly described the same senarios over and over again. I wanted to see how the story ended so I stayed with it. The books have a great story line. The author has really done her homework on the cave man and his previous life. I enjoyed the knowledge that came along with the books. I feel like she needed a partner to help her with her struggling story lines at times.I enjoyed the series I didn't feel they were worth the money I paid to read them. I would wait until the price drops before purchasing them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the first novel of the epic saga of Jean M. Auel Earth's Children series. The novels are set in Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age, approximately 35,000- 25,000 years ago when the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal people coexist. This is a marvelous book; it will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 31 years. It is the first volume of a powerful series. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Her story provides an insight into the prehistoric life of humans.The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, has little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees Ayla as a fellow human; worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. As Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle. From this point on, a strange world unfold. It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time it allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\". In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, shedding light and introspection into hunting methods, social relationships, stone technology, herb doctor techniques, weaponry, the comfort of familiarity with its dogged dogma and whatever other aspect of a civilization one may be interested in. This series really does have everything: joy, sorrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been two hundred and fifty plus centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, & how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was somewhat disconnected, because her technique moves from \\"head to head.\\" But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza, Creb and Ayla's characters, while even nasty Broud is one of my favorites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. The research she completed is phenomenal; every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive- right out of the pages. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arrive back at his homeAnd the newest, the sixth of the series recently released March 29th 2011:The Land of Painted Caves ... It's been 31 years since readers were introduced to the first book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" The Land of Painted Caves,\\" her sixth and final installment, picks up where \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" left off. Ayla is now mated to Jondalar and mother to a baby girl, Jonayla. She's come a long way from the outcast of the first book.Over the years, her journey has engrossed fans and turned the series into a bestselling phenomenon -- more than 45 million books sold. No small feat considering that the books average about 600+ pages. But readers have loved the uncertainty of Ayla's hazardous future as well as the detail Auel brings to Ayla's world. (The only thing more detailed than one of Auel's descriptive passages is probably an entry in an encyclopedia.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Readers should be warned: This book contains an abundance of descriptions of the land, the plants, the food, and life of the Neanderthal. Jean Auel is extremely knowledgeable and adds a great deal of facts to her novel. Although I find this impressive, I think this takes away a little bit from the story. At times when I wanted to find out what would happen next to Ayla or the clan, I found myself reading about plants and their healing powers or of local biology.The story as a whole was very interesting and I think it is very relevant in today's world. The characters are lovable and I was emotionally invested in them. I'm truly glad I invested the time to finishing this book. I'm not sure if I will read the next one because I was hoping it would follow both Ayla and the Clan but as I understand it, the reader only follows Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I first read \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", I couldn't put it down. I have read all the books in the series and this is by far my favorite. Don't equate the Movie to the book - there is absolutely no comparison. The book is BY FAR superior!Jean M. Auel descriptions of the life of these two diverging lines of mankind are fantastic. Auel immerses you into the lives of the Clan members, by way of the daily struggle to survive: hunting, gathering, medicines, landscape and cave life; and Ayla's conflict of staying with her mother and the need for her own kind progresses as she grows until it reaches a climax. Ayla never sways from who she is; she continued to fight for the right to be equal, and although she is banished from the tribe, she leaves with her head held high knowing she can rise above almost any obstacle.I did find the descriptions of herbs, plants and medicines a tad lengthy - however, it is a great read -- I highly recommend ALL of Jean Auel's books in the series.(NOTE: There are a few \\"suggestive\\" sections that may not be suitable for younger readers.)** Spoiler Alert **During the period of the Ice Age, the main character Ayla finds herself orphaned at the age of 5. Wandering, and near death after an attack from a tiger, Ayla awakes in the arms of Iza, a Clan member who has just lost her young daughter. She refuses to leave the young girl behind to die, and eventually becomes the child's \\"mother.\\"The Clans' only form of communication is through grunts and hand gestures, which Ayla finds foreign and difficult to understand. The Clan first considers her stupid, but Ayla, is actually of the more advanced tribe called \\"Others\\".Broud, the next in line to become leader abhors Ayla, and habitually abuses her -- physically and mentally. Women are subservient and Ayla does her best to fit in, but her natural curiosity and advanced ability for knowledge eventually rebells and gets her banished from the Clan, but not until she has gained the respect of all the tribes (excluding Broud)."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It made me look at how our ancestors had to struggle to stay alive and how pitifully pampered we are. It's amazing we are all here.I'm delightd that the book is about a young girl and her adventures and courage -- it's about time!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"For anyone not familiar with Jean Auel's work you're in for a real treat!The first book in her Earth's Children series is the beginning of one of the mostimaginative, well-researched, darn tootin' good stories ever written. Fascinating, memorable characters and therare chance to learn a little something about the earth in its ancient pre-history days are only the beginning of what Auel has to offer in the Clan of the Cave Bear.Also note, if you've seen the movie adaptation starring Darryl Hannah (or likely the first twenty minutes before giving up) you'll be happy to know that the bookis nothing like it. I think there are many elements of the story that really do not translate well into a movie format. Since I've read the book, I enjoyed a few aspects of the movie because I already knew what was going on.The book is a delightful read. Tough to put down and the kind of story that stays with you and really makes you stop and think about people and how we came to be the way we are. If you've made it this far in my little love rant over this book, you've just gotta buy it!! You won't regret it, and neither will the people you lend it to after you've read it. But be careful about lending it. The reason I'm writing this book review is because I had to buy a new one since my first copy was borrowed and never returned!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Little nonsense with great characters, what more can one ask for in a novel??? A plot, yep a pretty good one.The story carries itself from begging to end with a slew of people (or flatheads) that inspire emotions such as pity, fear, hate, or just interest.Speaking of hate, Broud is a punk that if I ever ran into him in an alley..... I would run for my life, the flatheads are really tough and he is one mean dude."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This piece of fictional literiture has been researched and tho the charicters are fictional they are alive in this book.this is a 5 star novel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this series of books by the great Jean Auel in the 80's & reread them all a second time in the 90's. I think I'm going for a 3rd turn now in 2010! This is the first book in the series & a movie was made from this starring Daryl Hannah in 1986. If you like variety in your reading material, this is a wonderful series to sink your teeth into! It is about an \\"Other\\", a little girl that loses her family to an earthquake when she is very small. She is raised by the \\"Clan\\" people whom are pretty much cavemen & cavewomen.She is made fun of for being \\"different\\" but Ayla is a survivor & the reader can't help but love the brave & feisty character of Ayla. She has a very difficult & lonely life in the first book & cannot find a mate as she does not look like the people that raised her. The one time she meets another \\"other\\" like herself at the annual tribes meeting, he is killed by a bear. She is taught how to heal people with many medicine remedies found from herbs & plants, etc. from the cavewoman that raises & loves her like a daughter. This old woman is a great medicine healer & of extreme importance to the tribe. This healing knowledge endeavors to bond Ayla to the clan & gives her a little bit of worth to them, whereas she was deemed worthless before she grudgingly earns their respect.There is so much to this book & it is incredible the vast talent that it takes to write a book such as this. There are four more books in this series & they are all magnificently intriquing & once you begin reading, it is impossible to put the books down for long. This is probably my favorite series of books that are unlike anything I mainly love to read - which is mysteries, true crime, true survivor stories & celebrity auto/biographies. If you are looking for something to read, please seek this book out & know that there is a whole lot of pleasure awaiting you with four more books after this treasure. I give this book over 10 stars, five just is not enough. The movie was not even half as great as the book but I still enjoyed the movie. It's hard to get into the movie since in this book, the clan people really do not \\"talk\\". They use signals (a sort of sign language) to talk & other than grunts, there's not much dialogue. I recommend this series of books highly! The series of books just gets better as they go. Once Ayla meets Jondular, another \\"other\\" like her & they fall in love, the books are an even more compelling read! Spectacular!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An excellent AUEL written story that you cannot put down, Many suprises, and life as it was thousands of years ago.

The story brought me in and held me captivated from cover to cover. Author Jean M. Auel does such an amazing job of making you interested in the characters and investing the reader in their lives. I love her details and description of, well, everything. She sometimes goes overboard with some descriptions of flora and fauna, but with these books it seems right. Some of the parts are pretty graphic and not the best for younger kids. I started reading her books when I was 13 and eagerly anticipate each one. I never want the saga of Ayla to end."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Experience life some 35.000 years ago and be amazed.Before you start reading this book make sure you have plenty of time available, because you will not be able to put the book done once you started reading.The story and fate of little Ayla will draw you in and you will feel her fears,be afraid for her life, and breathe easier when the medicine woman takes charge of her and becomes her protector and supporter.Follow Ayla, a 5 year old human, as she struggles and tries to adapt to life with the Clan of the Cave Bear after her parents were killed in an earthquake. Life with cavemen is much different than the life she used to lead with her parents. Through all her struggles she perserviers and becomes a member of the clan, changing the way the clan views humans and forces them to accept her differences.Although a fiction, the story could have happened just like it's told in the book. The attention to details and descriptions allows the reader to get a clear picture of Ayla's world. The characters are strong and never fail to live up to their potentials and their individual characteristics.The writing is imaginative and interesting.

Everyone at the club said they enjoyed it. From the wonderful imagination that enables the writer to tell you what the day to day life of people in cave man times was like; to the research that gives you an idea of what the geography and environment were; to the incredible story of courage and perseverance that the heroine lives, this is an excellent read.

Besides the fascinating world that the author creates, I think the heroine is what kept me glued to the pages. Ayla is gifted with extraordinary abilities due to the life she has led, and we are privy to that life, and therefore as her abilities develop they seem absolutely believable. The heroine is probably one of the greatest characters ever created on paper, and for that reason alone, this is a must-read novel. The bonus is the rest of the world and characters the author has created, a riveting plot, and fantastic adventures. The entire series is on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Currently rereading the Earths Children series...Loved these in Jr High, but never knew it went past 3, until recently, so freshing up on the first 3, to then read the next 2.Finished this up today. Nice to put the general sense of memory I had about the story back into definite order. It has been a LONG time and many book in between reads on this.If the measure of a writer or a book is getting a reader to care about the characters in the story... Then Jean Auel is a great writer. I can overlook the horrendous historical lapses, as long as she keeps me interested in what is happening to her characters.

Exceptionally written book that you won't want to miss out on."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"\\"[Ayla] was a woman, and she had more courage than you...more determination, more self-control\\"Ayla is a five year old child when an earthquake forces her to flee her destroyed home and her dead parents. Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear, stumbles upon her and takes her under her wing, but Broud, the proud son of the clan leader, Brun, takes an immediate disliking to the young non-Clan girl. Ayla grows up among the clan and struggles to find her place.I've heard so much about this series of books, particularly with the most recent (and apparently last of the series??) release ofThe Land of Painted Caves. While I had read that that book wasn't so hot, I did read reviews that praised the first few books. So I went out and got my hands on an audiobook of the first in the Earth's Children series.First off, I have to give kudos to Auel for all the research and time she put into this novel. This woman didn't go, \\"I'm going to write a pre-historic novel\\" and then just throw in some almost modern humans in a wallpaper world. This book transports you back before cars and computers, before women's rights and civil rights, into a fantasy realm of what the world might have been like before the modern age. It was vibrant and meticulously detailed. I loved how the Others could speak but the Clan could not; how the Clan could access memories but were bad at new innovations while the opposite was true of the Others. A lesser author, like I said, would have seen the work needed and given up; Auel pushed on and produced a damn fine novel.Besides the vibrant setting, the characters were detailed and intricate. My favorites were Iza and Creb, but I also liked Ayla herself, Brun, and Ooba (sp?). I liked how Iza embraced Ayla and was thoughtful enough to pass along the medicine woman trade, trying to think of Ayla's future. Iza was a warm, loving, kind-hearted, strong woman. Creb was fantastic. I thought he was sweet and kind, a good father-figure for Ayla, and I loved the comparisons between him and Ayla and between him and Ayla's son, Dirk. Ayla was a great character; she grows so much throughout the book. She tries to find her place in the clan; she is constantly testing the boundaries, but not because she is always defiant. Ayla is just not Clan; she is of the Others, and that breeding comes through. I liked the differences that she accented between Clan and Others: speech, crying, differences in body shape (I really liked how the Clan had a different perception of beauty). There were a few times when she (or her son) got really close to that Mary Sue line--the amount of times she breaks rules and is able to keep from being killed is pretty astonishing. However, I think Ayla did have enough faults, and was legitimately punished enough that I didn't focus on it too much. (I wonder, though, how far it is into the series before her turn to Mary Sue-ism comes is complete.) Brun was a great strong leader; he listened to his people, but wasn't afraid of action, afraid of punishment. And Ooba became such a sweet, loving sister to Ayla. I couldn't help but think of me and my sister when I read about the two.The story meanders along Ayla's life, her struggles to become Clan, and her tension with Broud. I loved how she learned to hunt with a sling, and I liked how she became a good medicine woman, how she would drop everything to try to save someone's life. I got to learn so much in this book, my mind was bent to new depths--what would life be like living in a cave? What was the world like before?If anything about the story bugged me, it would be the sudden departures into talking about mixing medicines. As I said above, I loved the research Auel put into this book; that said, inserting several passages ONLY to show what plants mixed with what roots would make a cure for this ailment got old. Fast. Fortunately, there were not TOO many of these scenes, but there were enough to be noteworthy.Also, there is quite a bit of violence/abuse in this novel. Women are basically treated like property. Men can beat women and be completely justified--this happens to Ayla quite a few times in the book. Men also can force a woman to have sex whenever the desire hits them--even if the woman is not their wife. Again, this happens to Ayla quite a bit, in a rather uncomfortable rape montage (nothing is too graphic, however). While I am sure this is more realistic than having Clan women burning their bras (or whatever they would have used for bras), it is not for everyone and was rather uncomfortable at times to listen to. Sometimes, I wanted to smack some sense into these Clan men--how dare you treat someone like that! Being female does NOT mean being stupid and being unable to think for yourself! Ultimately, I appreciated how Auel did NOT resort to writing the Clan as if they were wise, with modern sensibilities about feminism...but I still hated the abuse.I honestly cannot wait to start reading the next book. I am desperate to know what happens to Ayla...does she meet up with her people? Does she find a mate? I've read enough reviews to know some of the answers to my questions, but that doesn't make me any less eager to read for myself. I greatly enjoyed reading this prehistoric journey, and I definitely recommend--with the caveat that there is some abuse/violence to be on the lookout for.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Because of my native american heritage i bought it that evening when i got home. At first when Ayla is walking on her on in the wild, it seems a little boring. I kept thinking of how she was the same age as my daughter, and my daughter couldnt have done that, but then again, it was a long time ago. When reading keep in mind how long ago this story took place, and stick with the book. I promise by the middle of the book when Ayla is living with the Clan and learning their ways, you will be hooked. I think this book is a wonderful way for people to learn how life use to be before the world began to change. You will learn things along the way, and by the end of the book wont be able to even take a break befor starting the second one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a wonderful read, fascinating, insightful, and moving, as well as just entertaining. However, Auel really stretches reality in some places, particularly with the telepathy and the \\"ancestral\\" memories that allow them to remember back to the dawn of life (and even let Creb see the future at one point). Given that for the most part she seems to be trying to rely on anthropological knowledge, these things bugged me, and they were entirely unnecessary to the story; she could easily have gotten her point across in another way.On the other hand, I do like that she notes their lack of adaptability as the probable cause of their extinction, which I believe (if I can remember from my college Anth. classes) is accurate, and was interesting to consider in the context of a story. She did an excellent job of fleshing that theory out with examples, and it stimulated my thinking on the topic. Likewise, she did a good job of highlighting the cultural and anthropological differences between Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens, although I think some of her data is outdated now (which is obviously unavoidable). She did such a good job with this that it was hard at times to remember that this is a work of fiction and much of it is based on extrapolation (whether hers or the anthropologists of her era). Kudos to her in that regard.On a more basic level, some things about the book bothered me. For example, she makes such a big deal of how set in their ways the Clan are, but Brun is constantly bending rules and making subtle (and not so subtle changes). While he made an excellent character and helped the story flow (and allowed it go the way Auel wanted), it also totally contradicted her theory of their extinction. If Brun can change and be flexible, other Clan members must be able to also. And if that is true, it's harder to believe they would not have changed to resist the forces pushing them to extinction.Likewise, Broud's character got really old by the end of the book - I think she let it go on too long. He was a good and useful character, in that he was a good foil for Ayla and helped the story flow, particularly with regard to the ending, but he was such an annoying character that his repeated appearances got grating toward the end. I think the book just was too long - by the end I was thoroughly sick of the interactions between Broud and Ayla and Broud and Brun, just because Broud was such a jerk.I see a lot of people bashing the way she portrays the Neanderthals, but I honestly think those people aren't reading the first book very closely - she portrays specific characters that way (mostly Broud) but there are also kind, relatively intelligent characters in the Clan, especially Brun and Creb. They might be more primitive, but they are not unintelligent.Overall it was a great story, and it definitely stimulated my interest; I was tempted to dig out my old anthropology textbooks and notes to check some of her facts. Her characters are rich and interesting, and she definitely gets the reader to identify with them. She brings the environment and culture richly to life. On the other hand, the book went on a tad too long, and portions of it (particularly with regard to Broud) became a bit repititious. All in all I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wasn't sure how I would like this book as there isn't a whole lot known about Neanderthals and Cro-magnon peoples in terms of their daily lives. Let me tell you, this book hits it out of the park! All my concerns were for nothing and this will be one of my favorite reads of 2011.Auel makes the very distant to us Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon come to vivid life. We get a very believable description of how they may have lived life - from the clothing they wore, to the spirits they could have believed in, the food they ate, how they hunted, and what they may have thought about each other. A vast amount of details would have to have been supplied by the author as aspects such as their belief system will likely never be known - but they felt seemless and believable.As strong as the writing is regarding the culture and setting, the characters are where the writing shines. There is quite a large cast of main characters and even more supporting characters, however Auel constructs all into well rounded characters that you can identify and connect to. Even the supporting cast does not get pushed into the background. One way that you know you have great characters is when their actions or things that happen to them can bring you to tears - and at several points in this novel that happened to me. You can get so emotionally connected to these characters. One of the characters that I loved the most is Brun, the leader of the clan. I really enjoyed how he would weigh all of the options and really tried to do what was best for everyone.I didn't want to put this book down and eagerly anticipated getting back in the car to listen to it - I didn't love that it usually meant I had to be on my way to work though! Although I want to jump right into the rest of the series, I have heard mixed reviews of the other books, so I am waiting until my love for this book dies down a little bit."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was and is good but there are some boring and annoying parts. First, with the annoying parts. it bugged me and sometimes got me mad how she kept going against clan ways. I just could not belive that she kept doing it I mean at first with the weapon thing I said fine, but the a few more things and a few more things and the gosh darned baby thing and the breaking of Iza's bowl and drinking all that ceremony crap instead of just throwing it away and going into Mo-gur and the mens clan gathering ceremony. Ha! this girl is so hardheaded and self-righteous I rooted for Brou sometimes. The boring parts were the long drawn out descriptions. This is good but it is not the kind of book you read over and over. You want a good book? try Lord of the Rings. 'Nuff said. Grunts in satifaction and tells you to go get him some water. ;)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books. The end is so sad that three days after I finished tears still came to my eyes when I thought about it.

I have all four books and their pages are constantly re-read by myself and by my daughter and nieces. Im sure if i had a son, he would enjoy it just as much as we all did. Our books are bound together with tape and the spines are all crinkled, but the story of Ayla remains beautiful and intact. All the pain she went through and how she healed emotionally. Jondalar is a sensitive being who has become Aylas soul mate, the one she always knew she had. I wish that Jean would write the last two books so that i could see how Ayla fits in with Jondalars people, and see if her baby is a girl and what she calls it. Also whinney is a true friend who reminds you just what an important role animals play in peoples lives. I love all the attention Jean gives the book with reference to flint. herbs and clothes and mainly Feelings. I will treasure these books always.

This book and series are a must for any home library!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Rich and deep, some stories are threaded together, some are spun. This is the first book in a planned series of six which could be classed as a tapestry. The story of one girl who forged our destiny more so than anyone in the history of man.

Who would've known then that I stuck gold. This book is the beginning of a wonderful series that has kept me deprived of sleep for many years. It's funny how I first saw the movie with Darryl Hannah and didn't pay much attention to it. The book Clan of the Cave Bear was purchased out of curiousity as to whether it would compare to the movie. Believe me when I say, THERE IS NO COMPARISON.These series of books have developed and enhanced my love for reading. I agree with every word written by previous customers regarding the enthralling way Ms. Auel depicts Ayla and her adventures. I can only comment on how it has affected me.I highly recommend these books. THEY ARE ALL THAT AND A TRUCKLOAD OF CHIPS!!!Ms. Auel, if you are reading these posts, please, please... we beseech you.... please give us the remaining books. Let Ayla's long anticipated saga continue. We await with eager anticipation Ayla's story.We are praying for your speedy recovery from whatever illness you are stricken with, Ms. Auel.

Not only are the characters brought into vivid relief but the feeling of living in the Upper Paleolithic is so strong one could almost feel the ice from the glaciers, and taste the salt of the water. The first breath of air and the blows of Broud. This wonderful novel sets up the heroine, Ayla, for her destiny with the tall and handsome Jondalar in the following books of the series and does it so well it is a pleasure to re-read this book again and again. I wouldn't trade owning this book for anything"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time but I could never get a chance to pick it up and read it. While I was in 8th grade this year, my English teacher gave us a reading list on a certain topic. And on the list was &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear.&quot; I immediatly decided that this was the book that I was going to read. What a marvelous book! I couldn't put it down. Jean Auel has a gift for writing. The characters were built with such detail and emotion that I thought the characters really existed somewhere in that time.With all the research Jean Auel has done for this book, and the others, you feel that you are actually there while all these events are taking place. This book was also educational for me, which no school textbook could do about these past times. I have read the three other books by Jean Auel and I am anxiously waiting for the fifth book"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I usually read techincal books and actually bought this novel because it was recommended to me while inquiring about books to get for my 16 year old daughter for the summer.I picked up the book while in a hotel room with the family asleep in hopes that it would lull me off to sleep but, I was wrong. Instead it led me down a path of time travel that brought me a kind of knowledge and understanding that kept me captivated from beginning to end.

However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal \\"mind meld\\" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"&quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot; by Jean M.

It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE!

Wow! First off, Bessie rarely reads anything except diet books. Secondly, a book about Beer!!! Well, as is often the case with my angry fifth spouse, I was once again overloaded with misplaced optimism. This is not a book about some Cave Beer Clan. Instead, \\"The Clan of the Cave BeAr\\" is an overwrought, overwritten, overblown feminist ode to some silly notion about evolution filled with research and adjectives.I'll be honest, once I realized it wasn't about beer, I didn't so much read as skim. Really skim. I enjoyed the fact that the heroine was blonde with blue eyes, but I didn't like how much the author seemed to be in love with her. I also grew rapidly annoyed by this author's overuse of adjectives. It did make skimming a lot easier, but I was still annoyed. Additionally, while I can relate to the brutish sex-starved male as Cro-magnon stereotype, I didn't particularly find it made for good reading. I'm still not sure why my brooding spouse is reading it unless it's to reinforce her already firm opinion of me as an apeman. Or maybe there's a diet somewhere buried within the books 9,142 pages.

I am 108 pages in, and I have to say that I am less than mystified by it. I find many aspects of it boring, like the long descriptive paragraphs that I usually try to skip over. Don't get me wrong, this book is good. I find it interesting and I am trying to get into it. When does the books pace pick up? It seems like the first 108 pages are nothing but an opening for the book. When does the book get into the stage where so many people say I won't be able to put it down?

A test of a good writer is the ability to sustain the quality of the writing across a series and the richness and reality of the world in the story. Auel does this in the latest novel.

I'm only doing Amazon reviews on great stories and skilful writers."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"[ ... ]Few writers ever do as much homework as Jean Auel did to produce this book and its sequels. The story of a homo sapiens five-year-old girl's wandering alone in the wilderness after an earthquake killed her family, rescued by a Neandertal band based on real archaeological discoveries, and raised by them, with problems with one bully who ultimately drives her away from the clan and from her son, is famous world-wide and really needs no further reviews, but how could I not review this book? My husband asked me once why all the intelligent women he knows--and he finds women very boring unless their IQ is over 130--love Ayla. I answered, \\"She's our mother.\\"He then read it for himself and figured out what I mean.My brother, who is one of the most brilliant oilpatch engineers of this century, keeps her books in his office rather than in the family library, but he loves them more than his wife does.Highly recommended for anybody old enough to read it. As my father once told the librarians when I was in junior high, \\"This is my daughter.

I purchased the set from Pristine Books through Amazon.com. Overall I was very impressed with this seller, and would certainly order from Marguerite again. I received the order quickly, and all five books were carefully packed. Upon arrival I was very happy with the last three books of the series - they were first editions and in excellent condition. I was initially disappointed with The Clan of the Cave Bear (it was a 2001 rather than 1980 printing) and The Valley of Horses (it was a 1982 printing as hoped but the maps on the inside of the cover were discolored). I emailed the seller through Amazon and Marguerite responded promptly to my concerns. She went out of her way to replace both books, and I am now very happy with them (both are early prints in very good condition). Marguerite shipped the replacements at no additional cost and paid for the return shipping of the original books. The first two books of this series are apparently more challenging to find, so if an early print or first edition is imperative to you I would recommend you contact the seller prior to placing your order. If Marguerite does not have them in stock I'm sure she will do her best to find them for you.

I had the entire series up to The Shelters of Stone but unfortunately lost them in Katrina. Between that and my 1st edition collection of Harry Potter hardbacks I still swallow a sniffle. An epic tale, deeply rooted in historical fantasy, the series is a wonderful view of pre-historic man's (woman's) life and a series that I cherished for a long time. While the last book that I read The Shelters of Stone was a disappointment, the other books were highly enjoyable and up there as a Top Ten PJV Series Favorite.REVIEW: The series focuses on a Cro-Magnun female named Ayla who loses her parents in an earthquake and is raised by Neanderthals. Being a member of a more evolved species than Neanderthal man, Ayla is distrusted by a lot of the Neanderthal clan, but loved by the woman Isa that adopted her, and her brother, the spiritual leader of the clan. The first book covers Ayla's life within the clan and the trials she must face as a child of the Others, never to fully be accepted by her adopted people.In later books (you might want to stop reading here if you would like to avoid spoilers) Ayla travels from her life within the Neanderthal clan to find her own people. On the journey she finds out just how diverse her own people are and how even distrust runs through them when an unknown element is introduced. Ayla even finds something that she would have never found within the Clan. She finds love, the love of a man and with him she finally finds acceptance and home. Their journey is what plays out in the later books, always hinting at a final bloody conclusion that matches Clan with Other, the son she left within the Clan and the son she will bear with her new people.The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children)You can't pass up this series, I really recommend it. Auel spins a tale in a voice that will resonate through you. The research she put into writing these novels shows within every sentence. I felt as if I could be living within the cave walls with these people, instead of just reading about them. Ayla as a character took a place within my heart as few characters do, and I love to visit her every now and again to check in and see how life is treating her in the harsh Paleolithic world.I enjoyed every book in this series, except for The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children). I did read it through though, but it's poor plot and excessive repeating of back-story was a major disappointment and left me with a sour taste in my mouth regarding the series. But don't let that hold you back from reading the first four!RECOMMENDATIONS: Fans of fantasy and early man historicals should enjoy. But I also recommend this to anyone that would enjoy a good epic adventure that has a bit of romance, a lot of action, along with a ton of information that just might school you along the way."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Set 35,000 years ago this story takes you back in time effortlessly to a time of neanderthals and living in caves. When Ayla's parents are killed by an earthquake, the 5-year-old wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla,represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was thrown, because of the way she moves from head to head. But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza and Ayla's characters and even nasty Broud is one of my favourites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. the research she must have done is phenomenal, every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive one the pages.My final verdict is that this is definitely worth reading. It is intimidating because it is such a long book and it is one you have to really get into and focus while reading or you miss a lot. I imagine I could read again and again and each time find a new detail or nuance in the writing. I am going to read her other books as well. Of course, I'll be spacing them out, its heavy reading for me. I don't often get quiet time.So great book, amazing and talented author, and I highly recommend reading. I'm a fan."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Yes, you read that right, Science Fiction. Many people think that SF is all rocket-ships and ray-guns. But any novel that is based on Science and then some conjecture is basically Science Fiction.This is not an \\"Historical\\" novel as some have said, as it takes place in \\"pre-historic\\" times. So by definition it cannot be Historical.Auel was a technical writer, as I am. Technical writers will never win Nobel Prizes for literature, but they can write succinctly and accurately.She researched this book thoroughly, and the technical data in the story is very accurate as of the time it was written, although she takes liberties with some things to make the story work. And since the time it was written, Science has moved on.So if you look at this book as some sort of \\"accurate\\" rendition of what life was like for cave people, you are deceiving yourself. We cannot glean detailed parts of Neanderthal life from archeological records. But much of what she does put in seems based on sound conjecture.The central premise of the book, however, is pure SciFi/Fantasy - that Neanderthals had some sort of \\"racial memory\\" whereas Cro-Magnons had the ability to learn, and thus the Cro-Magnons were destined to displace the Neanderthals. (In one clearly SciFi scene, Ayla, in a drug-induced stupor at a cave ceremony, visualizes 20th century earth, if for a brief second - if that ain't Science Fiction, I don't know what is).From the various reviews I have read here and elsewhere, it seems that many people believe the story as historical fact, and not a work of fiction.It is an enjoyable book to read. But it is an entertainment, not a Scientific research paper. Don't take it as an historical record, as no such records exist from pre-historic times.Hence the name, \\"Pre-Historic\\"."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Amazing and fabulous.I read this when it was first published and was overwhelmed by how Ms. Auel created a pre-human civilization with such clarity. Makes Planet of the Apes look like the schtick it was!Beautiful writing and a heroine that, without words, made this reader completely bond with her.Incredibly inventive story with such diligent attention to detail that you could almost convince yourself that it was nonfiction. This was no accident as Ms. Auel definitely had done her homework and research.Simply a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel is the first novel of the Earth's Children series. Her story provides an insight into prehistoric life of humans. The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Suffering from extreme hunger and weariness, she inadvertently finds herself in the middle of a lion den. The male lion, fearing the woman that had encroached upon his territory, attempts to attack Ayla. Only by sheer luck does she manage to hide and escape with only a deep gash in her leg. Near death, she collapses near a river, where a clan is traveling in search of a new cave to live in. The medicine woman of the tribe, Iza, sees Ayla and receives permission to take her and treat her wounds. From there Ayla, a Cro-Magnon, is adopted, if not completely accepted, into the Neanderthal Clan with Iza taking the role of her mother. She will endure many trials for being one of The Others and the novel ends with her being presented her biggest problem to undergo.This first story of the Earth's Children series is a well-written and researched book with a few obvious but necessary liberties by Auel. She does an amazing job describing a landscape in great detail and providing very believable story of what may have happened so many years ago. Since reading The Clan of the Cave Bear, I have since read the four books following the series and eagerly await the final story detailing Ayla's unusual and impressive life. While I found the sequels to be a bit more interesting than the first of the series, it is essential to read it. Any reader must understand the different way of life The Clan has and how it affects Ayla and her actions later in the series. However, that is not to say I did not enjoy the first novel. I greatly admired the way Ayla responded to the adversity she faced due to her differences and I applaud Auel for the effort she put into her works that led me to become so entangled within the story that I felt as if I was almost there sharing the joys of a successful Mammoth hunt and the pains Ayla felt as the people closest to her died."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an awesome start to a really great series. I'm almost done with the third book, Mammoth Hunters and they've all been really difficult to put down!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm almost finished this book and can't wait to get on to the others. This is entertaining, engrossing and educational. It has taken me forever to get through it but I'm learning so much about our ancient ancestors that it's worth each page."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first in a series of very good books following the life of a prehistoric woman. She uses creativity intelligence to live in a difficult environment."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is for the avid reader who is into prehistoric man, herbs, and a good love story!! I read this book years ago and passed it along to someone else, I had to buy it again to re read it and it was better than the first time! I love this book. Be prepared to buy the rest of the series and I can't wait for the 6th book in the series to come out!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is very, very good. However, I only gave it four stars because it is a bit long-winded and its sentences run on. (It would have a long phrase, a comma, and then another long phrase. It got kind of tiring.) Ayla's abilities do not seem unnatural to me; Jean Auel did an excellent job of sculpting them into the story. Whoever said that Jean Auel \\"really, really wants to be blond\\" is sadly mistaken."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean M. Auel's \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an epic adventure into our human past. Four-year-old Ayla lives happily with her prehistoric family until an earthquake takes her entire family away from her and leaves her to fend for herself. In this harsh world where humans are not on the top of the food chain, Ayla escapes death. Her saviors are a clan of bipedal cousins to her own homo sapien family.Ayla has to adopt the ways of the new clan and withstand an onslaught of taunts from antagonist, who feel the outsiders do not belong in the \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" With the help of Iza (Ayla's new mother) and medicine man Creb, Ayla prospers in her new home.What makes this story great is the dynamic descriptions Auel gives us on her views of how the world of man triumphed after the last ice age. Reading \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" gave me a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of the Twenty-First Century."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel deserves credit for all the research she has done, and for the concept of this story, set before recorded history. The reason I picked up the book was because I thought it would be fascinating to read about people from that time period. Unfortunately, Auel is a much better researcher than she is a fiction writer. She spends just about every single page in this long book TELLING the reader what people did and thought, rather than showing. This becomes T.E.D.I.O.U.S. I picked up the book to read it, but I never did. Instead, I skimmed it because the writing was so flat.In reading comments by others who have read this book, I conclude that there are two distinct types of people who read fiction. One type does not mind being told, as in the old storytelling tradition, where listeners sat around and were told what characters did. There were no scenes, just narration. The other type wants from fiction the kind of showing, the kind of richly developed characters, the kind of tension and drama created by novelists such as Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. Sometimes it seems to me that never the twain (pun intended!) shall meet."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I picked up \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" years ago when I had nothing else to read. I was immediately enthralled and hooked...couldn't believe there was a series and quickly read all available. It was truly difficult to wait for the last 2 books to be written and published...as of now I am anxiously awaiting for \\"The Painted Caves\\" to come out in March 2011...The story line in \\"Clan\\" shows how life may have been in pre-historic times with the co-existence of two species..the Cro-magnon and the Neanderthal...While the differences are obvious they are also alike in many ways...Ayla, a five year old Cro Magnon child, is left orphaned when her family is lost during an earthquake. She is found, near death, by a clan of Neanderthal searching for a new cave following the same earthquake. Their lives are immediately intertwined. I won't give anymore away..it's is too good to tell anything else.. Suffice it to say that you will be unable to put it down! I envy anyone having that first reading experience of this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This saga is a creative story and is probably the tightest book in the series (mostly before Ayla becomes a bit of a \\"Mary Sue\\" character. It also has some absolutely fascinating descriptions of what prehistoric life might have been like - it's even well researched, though now some of the theories that Auel decided to go with are outdated."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Absolutely THE best book (and series) ever written. Jean Auel creates a world you want to be a part of over and over again. I have read the entire series at least 8 times. Ayla and her family are characters you will never forget.Warning: once you read this series, other pale in comparison."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is a carefree young girl (five years of age) with long blonde hair, a small nose, a lean build, and clear blue eyes. A Cro-Magnon girl, she lives with her family near a river. But when a devastating earthquake leaves her with no one but herself to rely on, the lonely little girl must wander the forest using what little survival skills she has to stay alive. After giving it her all, she finally collapses and is near death when a traveling group of Neanderthal people (called \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" in honor of the cave bear spirit they worship) come upon her. The kind-hearted medicine woman of the group, Iza, takes Ayla in and soon she is learning the ways of The Clan and is slowly forgetting her past language and culture. But her \\"ugliness\\" in comparison to the stocky, dark-haired, dark-eyed people of the clan and her constant rebellion against The Clan's strict rules continually seem to seperate her from her new family. Even Iza and Ayla's adopted father, Creb, the Mog-Ur (magician) of The Clan, begin to doubt her ability to be one of their kind. And the proud, self-absorbed soon-to-be-leader of the Clan doesn't make things any easier on her as he begins to develop a deep hatred for the girl that causes him to explode on her with anger and violence. It is a long, hard journey that Ayla must face, but she does what she can to make the best of things, even if it means leaving her carefree ways behind.This is without a doubt my all-time favorite book. The author, Jean M. Auel, put so much research and heart into the book, and it is obvious in her absorbing storyline, incredible writing skill, and knowledge of the people we now call \\"cavemen and cavewomen\\". It took a while to memorize all of the characters involved in the story, but she pieced it together so that the story wasn't rushing on and leaving you wondering who was who; she slowly introduced them and taught you about them so that you were able to better understand their emotions and personalities. I often felt like I was right there with Ayla, and I have to say I got pretty emotional at times. Most of the humor is just smiling humor, but I did laugh out loud once. I cried quite a few times. I ended up having to grab a box of Kleenex and wipe my nose while I read. I just grew to love Ayla so much that whenever she would suffer it really made me feel for her, even though she is just a character. I recommend this book to teens and adults looking for a good read that you won't want to put down. I do not recommend it to kids, as there was a lot of violence and very mature content. (Remember, cave people were very primitive.) But I can hardly wait to read the next book and am ordering it shortly. The ending was a cliff-hanger and the suspense is killing me."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel captured my imagination with The Clan of the Cave Bear. Since I first read it in high school, I've re-read it at least 8 times. I just can't get enough. I've recommmended her to family and friends alike... all of whom have enjoyed the book immensely. She has actually inspired me to try my hand at writing. Hopefully I will be able to develop my characters as completely as she has and also tell a story that grips the imagination."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The upcoming publication of Auel's fifth book has renewed my interest in the EarthChildren series. I'm now re-reading the books and reviewing the first, which I originally read almost 18 years ago. Am I allowed to reminisce like this? Am I out of bounds? Well, don't try to stop me. This book is still clear in my mind after nearly two decades. In the early 80's, I thumbed through it at an Albertson's checkout line, finished the first chapter, and told my parents about it. I received it a week later for my birthday...and loved every minute of the story. Jean Auel's narrative powers swept me into a past rich and alive with people, creatures, smells, and sights that are immediately familiar, yet breathtakingly foreign. That's what first caught my attention. Then I began to care about Ayla, the skinny, pale child caught in an earthquake. I followed her story with keen interest and ached over her insecurities and alienation. This is a story about people with all the feelings and emotions of you and me. And though some tried to ban the book for one particular scene of forced sex, I found it in no way glorifying the act. In fact, as a teenager, it made me more aware of a female's struggle in a male-dominated society. I'll never forget the experience--indeed, that's what it was!--of reading this novel. To go back and relive the story of Ayla all over again is a treat. I can't wait for &quot;The Shelters of Stone.&quot; Only rarely does an author create a world so rich and believable that we could almost call it home."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"To celebrate the upcomming release of Jean M. Auel's new Earth Series release, The Land of Painted Caves, due March 29th, 2011, we have a bargain kindle release of the first book in the series.If you have not read this series, you are in for a treat. The novels are set 18,000 year ago at a time when the Cromagnon (us) and Neanderthal people coexist. Although certain poetic license is taken with the series, the novels are thouroughly reseached and have received a great deal of praised for their accuracy.Ayla is a five-year old Cro-Magnon girl who is suddenly orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family's camp. She is found, near death, by a group of Neanderthal people, the \\"Clan\\" who are looking for a new home after their cave is destroyed in the same earthquake. A brother and sister, Iza, the medicine woman of the group, and Creb, the \\"Mog-ur\\" or shaman, adopt the young girl. The first book in the series focuses on Ayla's experience growing up amoung the Clan where she never quite fits in because of the differences in her nature. She lacks the Clan's strenght and 'memories' but is quicker to learn and to adapt to new circumstances.If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea - at least try the sample anyway. This is a truely extraordinary series that no one should miss. Fans wait patiently for years as each new book is researched and written, and then savor it as an extraordinary treat.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arive back at his home."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This amazing book remains one of my favorites ever. This might sound 'sappy', but it's true! With beautiful writing, a well-researched setting, an engrossing plot, and lovable, if debatably human, characters, what more could one ask for in a novel? I normally read fantasy, and this exotic, nearly made-up setting sometimes qualifies at that -- but this is simply better than just about every fantasy novel out there!Set in Ice Age Asia, this chronicles the life of a woman named Ayla. It begins with her as a young child, orphaned, who is adopted into a clan of Neandertals. Just about every novel I've read including Neandertals has them act human -- but these people are individual and distinguished from their Cro-Magnon contemporaries, without acting in the slightest like caveman savages. Jean Auel explains their larger brain mass, factoring it into the personality of the members of the 'Clan of the Cave Bear' (describing all of this race, not merely the clan Ayla is adopted into).The young Ayla is different from the Clan people -- while not exactly 'smarter', she is far more creative. Not only that, but she's a tomboy. She defies Clan tradition by acting male -- something Clan females would never have considered. Yet the Clan members are no less special for their traditional actions. Iza, the clan medicine woman, and Creb ( a 'mog-ur', or shaman), are wonderful characters. And Ayla is amazing, throughout her life in the book.Giving away the plot in this would be pointless. But &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; -did- make me cry at the end. I don't see how anyone couldn't cry. I've cried at it every time I've read it. It's just that beautiful.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. If you haven't already ordered this...do so! It's great. The only complaint I have about this is Ayla's ingenuity. She manages to come up with so many new ideas, ones that would be revolutionary even by Cro-Magnon standards, that it didn't seem realistic. Still, this doesn't detract from the story at all.5 stars out of 5, no question about it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story's compelling, but often Auel's writing comes off as amateurish -- the quickness that Ayla grasps certain concepts, for example, such as when she guesses at the true cause of childbirth, or that she is \\"ugly\\" compared to Clan women, happen far too abruptly, even if she is a modern human. Something more dubious, though probably more forgivable if looking at the book as a work of fiction, is her decision to give the Neanderthal characters the gift of \\"racial memory,\\" an ability to regain memories of their ancestors. that is connected to the enlargement of their brains toward the back.Secondly, Auel's writing is not advanced enough to allow her to 'show' things rather than 'tell' them. This applies both to her characters and the society she is trying to depict. Most of the time, the characters -- Ayla being the exception, probably because it is easier for us (and Auel) to understand a character who is 'human' in the same way we are -- come off as somewhat flat. Potentially interesting character traits that Auel insists that these characters have are often negated when they act or speak. For example, she tells us that Creb is feared -- or at least seen as 'cold' -- by the Clan, but we never see this. She never shows us Creb's tenderness towards Ayla, we're merely told he feels it; She never shows us that Brun doubts his own authority, she simply tells us he does; both Creb and Iza treat Ayla with less love than we're told they feel for her. In addition, the 'formal' Clan way of speaking comes off as stilted and doesn't ring true, even if it's supposed to be a translation of sign language.This same concept applies to Auel's depiction of the Clan society itself. She consistently fails to SHOW us the way the Clan functions -- she usually is forced to make a long digression from the story to explain to us a certain part of their way of life that is necessary for understanding the next part of the story; this has the double downside of being distracting and boring, as well as giving us a big clue as to what's about to happen -- she doesn't have the skill to use foreshadowing in any long-term or meaningful way. The effect is, of course, that by the end of the novel Auel's writing is entirely predictable.But despite all of her faults as a writer, Auel is clearly a knowledgeable person, and even her digressions don't fail to carry some interest. Her prose, if not sophisticated, is usually clear, even if it does occasionally feel like reading a text book when she wanders too far from the story, or if she renders most of her characters faceless."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read Clan of the Cave Bear so many times, that I've had to buy another copy. Along with her other books in the series, this is a must for everyone's personal collection. Jean M Auel weaves so much historical data in between the story lines,in fact, it is an integral part of all that makes up Ayla's life. The strength of the heroine combined with her human limitations makes Ayla come alive for the reader. I am driven to find out as much about Ayla as I can in reading this book and in the three succeeding novels in the series that continue with Ayla's saga. The books are grand, epic tales of a young woman's growing up and maturing in prehistoric times. Losing her family in an earthquake, 5 year old Ayla sets out in search of other humans in a sparsely populated prehistoric Europe. A clan of Neanderthals stumble across an unconscious, lion mauled Ayla. The Medicine Woman of the group,Iza, cares for Ayla. The clan is initially wary of Ayla, the first of &quot;the others&quot; that they have encountered, but she is gradually accepted by them. She has much to overcome, and Clan of the Cave Bear concludes in line with Ayla's difficulites through out the entire book. The story is picked up in &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;. I recommend that you read the entire series, and then wait, like the rest of us Auel-o-philes for the next book in this series. It's been over ten years since the last book (Plains of Passage)and I think I can speak for everyone when I say: Please Publish SOON!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book, and the rest of the series, when I was in high school. I think every woman who reads these books wants to model herself after Ayla. Brave, honest, beautiful, sincere - I mean, what more could you ask for? Her totem is a cave lion, for pete's sake! Jean M. Auel has an extraordinary gift for making her characters so real and alive - Ayla was probably my best friend when I was 16. She made me take a hard look at who I was and how I wanted the world to see me, and she gave me courage to overcome some of the teenage social situations I thought I would just never make it through. Funny how a work of fiction can make such an impact on your life. I love this entire series, and The Clan of the Cave Bear started it all. (just a note: I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone under 16 - some strong sexual content)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Earth Children Series:1.)THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS2.)THE VALLEY OF HORSES3.)THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS4.)PLAINS OF PASSAGE5.)THE SHELTERS OF STONEWhat more can I say that 244 Amazon reviewers has not. This book is full of adventure and it let readers see through the past, on how early humans (cro-mags) live their life. Their cultures, beliefs, custom and tradition. Ayla, being born to Others was found almost dying by one of the Clan of the Cave Bears. She was eventually adopted by them and have to adjust to her new family, new environment. The challenge was overwhelming and I ache for the little girl. But then again, this is also where I admire her courage, strength and determination. The affection between Ayla, Creb and Iza was a heart warming read. I admit some parts of this book falls a bit verbose, other parts I find a bit far fetch or a bit hard to believe considering the time plot. I am not an Anthropologist so I may be wrong but Ayla's intelligence of finding and realizing things on her own sometimes left me doubtful especially for a girl her age. However, it's really not too deep to distract me. In fact, it piqued my interest all the more and made me read on. Overall, this book is imaginative, educational, entertaining and worth your time.This is definitely a different reading material compare to my usual historical romance novels but I am thankful my mother in law suggested this book to me. It's the first of Ms. Auel's Earth Children Series. I am now in the middle of the second book of the series and so far, it is as interesting as this one. My mother in law waited 10 years for the fifth installment of this series and I'm glad I don't have to wait that long. It'll be out next year, 2002."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When young Ayla's parents are killed in an earthquake, the 5-year-old is left to wander the pre-historic earth on her own. She roams for days, looking for other people, following a stream into the vast wilderness. Overcome by hunger and thirst, Ayla is attacked by a lion. Narrowly escaping death, the small girl manages to squeeze herself into a crevice to hide from the lion. The lion's paw can fit into the crevice and the lion scratches Ayla, leaving severe gashes. Thirst finally drives her from her hiding place and she passes out near a stream.At the same time, the Clan of the Cave Bear, the neolithic peoples we think of as \\"cavemen\\" happen upon the dying child. The Clan's medicine woman, Iza, takes pity on the child, even though she is of the Others, and begs the Clan leader to let her nurse the child back to health. Grudgingly, Iza is allowed to care for the child and Ayla is eventually accepted as part of the Clan. What appears as a great stroke of luck for the child, being saved by the Clan, also becomes one of the hardest things Ayla will ever have to do. She must learn to speak the Clan's language, a language not of words, but of gestures and sounds. She has to learn Clan customs and taboos and how to behave as a proper Clan child. If all of that weren't enough, Ayla also has to deal with the mockery and scorn of the Clan leader's son, Broud. Broud hates Ayla and does everything within his power to torment the little girl.As Ayla grows older, Iza trains Ayla in the ways of the medicine woman to ensure Ayla a place in the Clan when Iza and her brother Creb, Ayla's adopted parents, die. In secret, Ayla begins learning to care for herself. She finds an old sling that was discarded by one of the Clansmen. Ayla teaches herself how to use the sling, which is strictly forbidden by Clan rules.As Ayla continues to grow older, she struggles with her own place in the Clan, a group to which she doesn't belong. She tests the boundaries and borders of the group dynamic and in some cases, she pays a terrible price for learning those lessons.Friends have been recommending this novel to me for years, but I was somewhat reluctant to pick it up. I had seen the horrible Darryl Hannah movie that was made in the late '80s, and though I shouldn't have, I judged the book by the movie. Recently, though, it was recommended to me once again and I decided I would give it a whirl. I am completely glad that I did. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding. I didn't want to put the book down. Jean M. Auel, the author, is quite talented. She brings the characters and the settings to life in such a vivid manner that the reader forgets their modern surroundings while reading and is transported to the ancient world of the Clan. Her moving and beautiful portrayal of the Clan and Ayla are simply magnificent.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection.

This book is very different than any other book I've read before and it was a pleasure to see how all the characters developed, read about the clan customs and how Ayla tried to fit in, how she was loved even though she was different and how she loved most of the Clan members back even though sometimes it seemed life was hard for her.I'd highly recommend the first book in this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is a fantastic read. The story's pace, depth of characters, and historical background is exceptionally well done. You can't help but be drawn into the novel's unfolding drama that is told from main characters' well developed thoughts and emotions, told from eons of time passed long ago.The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One)."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved reading this book a few years ago and my son Michael read it again for the second time, and we both love it. It takes you into a world of survival,compassion,love,and tenacity, streght of character from all the characters. I could not put it down. Annabella"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Some books are pleasant diversions to pass the time. Clan of the Cave Bear is pleasant, but it is profound and has enormous impact on the way we think of what it means to be human. This is not a book for simply passing the time, but for pondering over time. This novel is life-changing, and is certainly among the handful of novels that one must read before one can claim to be educated. Ayla is one of the most interesting characters in fiction, but the backdrop for her story is possibly the grandest I have ever seen developed in a novel. This novel is unique. Reading it was an experience I will never forget."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the best out of the whole series, though Valley of the Horses is a close second. The first time I read this book I was 14 and I instantly fell in love with it. In the past 15 years I've re-read it at least 5-6 times (pretty much every time Jean M. Auel released a new book I re-read Clan of the Cave Bear). You can read a synopsis of the book in the jacket so I won't go into the plot. All I will say is if you did a search for it you're at least mildly interested in reading it.....DO IT!!! You won't be disappointed. The other books in the series are good as well and you will most likely want to continue the series as each book ends a journey while at the same time starting a new one. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In 1977 writer Jean M. Auel began research for her first book, an evocative historical fiction novel which dramatically intersects the lives Neanderthals and Cro-magnon humans in prehistoric Europe.\\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", the cornerstone in the Earth Children series, tells the tale of a Cro-magnon orphan Ayla, who at five years old survives an earthquake and an attack from a cave lion before she is rescued by the kind and wise medicine woman Iza. Though Ayla's appearance is vastly different, and in the eyes of the Neanderthal clan even ugly, the young girl wins a place among the clan when the holy man and Mog-ur Creb decides her presence is in fact a good omen.Leader Brun remains conflicted between the steadfast traditions his people have long relied upon for their survival versus the benefit of this strange new creature among them. Had the spirits, their totems, really sent this unusual child to them for \\"luck\\", even when everything she does inevitably challenges their philosophies and customs?From the way she communicates to the way she expresses emotion, Ayla learns early on she must continue her struggle for survival by integrating with them and behaving as a Clan woman should, rather the ugly outsider she is. However having evolved past what her adopted people are able to do, this proves problematic for the earnest young girl.Whereas her Clan relies on \\"memories\\" and instinct, she has the ability for analytical thought and deductive reasoning. Whereas her Clan adheres to strict tradition, Ayla is able to adapt and evolve. She finds herself unable to abide constrictive cultural expectations in her ever growing desire to challenge herself and to push herself to the limits of her ability.For a group of people who rely on conformity for their sense of security and balance, she provides a constant source of conflict. This is especially true with Broud, Brun's son and leader to be. He resents her presence and does whatever he can to make her life miserable, longing to steal from her what he can never possess.Ayla, in her attempt to survive her sometimes dire circumstances, ends up an unintentional hero for feminism itself. What the Clan see in her, and alternately fear in her, is the strength that will carry over in all Homo sapiens for millenniums to come. Her strange behavior, thoughts and feelings are the very things that ensure the survival of her race while highlighting the limitations of their own.It is through this young child who ages no more than a teenager through the course of the novel that we once again are reminded of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Author Jean Auel herself demonstrates this spirit by the thoughtful and thorough way she researched for this groundbreaking series; not only did she do extensive study on the Ice Age but physically learned many of the survivalist skills she describes in her books.It lends an authenticity to the tale that will keep the reader vested intellectually, while Ayla and her struggle to survive will emotionally engage audiences for many years to come. Though the prehistoric world they live in is vastly different from our modern times, the themes are widely universal. From racism to sexism and cultural divisiveness and superstition, the dynamic characters of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" speak a language in which we are all familiar."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a marvelous book; it deals with Ice Age and the coexistence of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon. It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era.It is the first volume of a powerful series.The story is as follows: Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold.It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, looking into stone technology, herb doctor techniques, hunting methods, weaponry, social relationships and whatever aspect of a civilization you may be interested it is shown.In the present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"just got a Kindle so thought I might revisit some older books I've read before. This was just as good the second time around :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"These books were made for people who love to dive into fictional characters. Auel is by no means lacking in detail and I'm not going to lie, there are places I found myself starting to skim, but it's truly amazing that the characters and detail are based on graves, tools, and general domestic items excavated from dig sites that Auel visited herself. Creb is quite literally based on remains found at a dig site that led archeologist to understand that these prehistoric people cared for one another even when they couldn't physically contribute. But Auel isn't just an in depth researcher, she's a dedicated story teller who brings to life characters she clearly loves. This is the first book of my favorite series of all time!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"At the outset, please note that this is an amazing work of art that most everyone is going to soak up and find impossible to forget. It's a moving tale of a human child raised by a clan of neanderthals. The way the author manages to fit so much meaning and depth into characters who spend a great deal of time unable to or rarely communicating is astounding, to say the very least. And it is also fair to say that this is sure to be unlike anything else you've ever read.My only warning to potential readers would be to point out ahead of time that you are going to encounter plenty of detailed scenery description. On one hand it is often insightful and goes to show that the author has really done her homework on the period. But the average reader may find it to be a bit much at times. I say that because I found it to be too much at times, and I'm generally overly fascinated by these sorts of additions. One could easily compare this aspect of Auel's writing style to Tolkien's obsession with sharing the historicity of each location and character in his otherwise steady-flowing works.Regardless of whether or not you love or hate this aspect of Jean's style, one thing you will not be able to deny is just how breathtaking this story ends up being. And you'll want to finish it in any case. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It was a co-worker who recommended to read this series..

Over all it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"i love this book. if i lived back then i would have wanted Ayla for my best friend. she is a very independent woman. she is very strong willed and survival minded.

I have to keep reminding myself that it is a fictional story. This is a facinating story about life during the Ice Age and one girls struggles to become a respected woman. I have also read the other three books in the Earth Children's series. As I neared the end of one book, I'd rush to the store to purchase the next. But on the fourth book (I new the fifth was not out yet) instead of rushing through to the end, I put myself on a reading diet and would only allow myself a few pages a day....I didn't want it to end. Not only has this book increased my knowledge of pre-historic life, it has also given me an interest in herbs. It was great and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An excellent read! I feel the characters are portrayed in depth. The character's interactions with each other were excellently planned and displayed. The scenery is beautifully described and promotes images in the reader's mind.

Auel has written a one of a kind story in my opinion. I've never read anything like THE EARTH'S CHILDREN series. I've read all four books more than once. They are not only well written but the research that went into writing them is so complete. But don't think her account of the people in the stories represents history. Remember, these books are sold in the fiction section. They're fiction, fantasy and romance. She did a lot of research and you can really get a feel of what the land must have been like 25,000 years ago.

People of the Clan, as they call themselves, refer to what we know of as the human race as the &quot;Others&quot;, a newer, younger breed that had adapted better to the changing world around them in Ice Age Europe to replace this breed of clan people. Ayla, a girl born to the Others, is adopted by clan people when orphaned in an earthquake. Auel twists a tale of intriguing suspense and a sense of adventure and excitement as she takes us along Ayla's journey into a culture born with memories of how to behave, what is expected of them, and what life was like years before. They cannot accept change, and Ayla struggles to change her natural way of being to fit into the culture of the clan, even without these memories. But the Clan makes it difficult, thinking her blue eyes, blond hair and straight limbs are ugly, thinking her crying eyes are injured, her quickness to learn evil and odd, and her ability to speak strange. Read The Clan of the Cave Bear and experience the dawn of the life of man as we know him today from an interesting and remarkable point of view presented by Jean M. Auel"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change.

Hurry with that next book"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An engrossing fictional story based on mankind's earliest years. The heroine, Ayla, has been separated from her family by a massive earthquake. Though she is only a small child, she embarks upon a journey that will have repercussions down through the ages. After wandering for days in an unfriendly environment, she is found, nearly dead, by a band of Neanderthals who are engaged in their own quest for a new home. Though they are suspicious of the &quot;Others&quot;, she is taken into the clan and cared for by the medicine woman, Iza. She wins the heart and loyalty of the most respected and revered member of the clan, Creb the Mog-ur (holy man). Through him and his sister, Iza, she learns the ways of the clan with difficulty and, at times, resentment. Because she is so &quot;ugly&quot;, Iza teaches her the art of being a medicine woman so that she will have some usefulness to the clan. Iza fears that she will never mate or have children because of this &quot;deformity&quot;. She teaches herself to hunt with a sling, although it is strictly forbidden for the women of the clan to hunt or even touch weapons. She soon becomes the most skilled hunter in the clan much to the chagrin of the clan leader's son, Broud. He is determined to put her in her place and he discovers the perfect revenge, brutal and malicious rape. Soon after, at the tender age of eleven years, Ayla gives birth to her son, Durc, who is destined to be the clan's link to the future. Broud is enraged that the infant, whom the clan deems to be deformed also, is accepted and named into the clan. Immediately upon being named as the new leader of the clan, he curses her with &quot;death&quot;. The clan can no longer &quot;see&quot; her and those that loved her mourn her &quot;death&quot;. She becomes a &quot;spirit&quot; whom the clan fears will take them with her if they &quot;see&quot; her. Suddenly, at the ripe old age of thirteen years, Ayla is once again alone and on her own. She is forced to leave her son and the clan behind her to begin a new life. This life is chronicled by the succeeding books in this enthralling series. I have read all the books Ms. Auel has written in this saga at least twice. I am anxiously awaiting the next book to be released so that I can continue to participate in Ayla's amazing story. Please hurry Ms. Auel, five years is a long time to wait for the next book in the series and I desperately need an Ayla &quot;fix&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Do you feel different from people around you? Do they resent your ingenuity? Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs? Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth? Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!(I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the \\"aryans\\"- who interbred with \\"subhumans\\" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture. Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.Also? Enough rape scenes already!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Thats right, you must be prepared to spend the next month reading this book and the other 3 sequels. If you have any doubts whatsoever about reading this book, I recommend that you squash them right now.The aim of a book is to involve yourself with the characters, and this certainly happens. The enduring story of a young girl, seperated from her people, and forced to live in a society that doesn't accept you, really appeals to many people. (Face it, everyone has experienced unwantedness before). The main characters likeable, and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are hateable. The quality of writing makes the even scenery and small details interesting, for a book with a lot of archeological research. Jean M Auel creates aa new/old world that many of us never begin to think about, but this book creates a glimpse into our past. Utterley believeble and intensly realistic make &quot;The Clan of The Cave Bear&quot; is easily read for such a long book, and I guaruntee not a disapointment. Can't wait till the 5th installment of the series comes out."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm giving a four star rating because this story is absorbing and emotional. So I'm making it clear that I like it. After saying that, I don't know how else to praise it. It gets a thumbs up for being absorbing and emotional.Now for the negatives. It makes a lot of assumptions about Neanderthal society that I hope are entirely unwarranted, and it gives us a cartoon Supergirl. It is telling us basically that Cro Magnon, namely us, are just so superior to Neanderthal, to an unreasonable degree. Here are some examples.A little Cro Magnon girl with no hunting experience is able to very quickly outshine all of the experienced Neanderthal men in the use of the sling as a weapon to bring down animals. This girl is a little \\"David\\" with that sling, using it like a repeater rifle that can bring down a hyena from a long distance away. Baloney. I don't buy that a little 8 year old girl can become such a killing machine. We're Cro Magnons now, so show me this 8 year old Supergirl today. It makes Cro Magnon seem so superior to Neanderthal, to a comic degree, to an unbelievable degree. Our little girls make far greater warriors than your experienced hunters. No, that smacks of silly superiority.Neanderthal society is a society of utter domination of women by men. Even violent rape is allowed, and the woman has no rights at all to object to getting beaten to a pulp and raped three times a day, every day. This also reeks of Cro Magnon superiority. My guess is that the author is Cro Magnon, no? I'd like to see a similar book written by a Neanderthal. I'm sure that the Neanderthals wouldn't come off as a bunch of, a bunch of, a bunch of Neanderthals in that book.So, to sum up, this very absorbing and emotional book is an insult to all of us Neanderthals. It makes us look like stupid, misogynistic boobs who can't even wield a slingshot as well as a baby girl of your society. All I can say is, put me up against any little baby girl you've got, and I'm sure I can do better than she can at slingshotting hyenas.And by the way, we happen to have a female dominated society. The men among us hunt wooly mammoths all day while the women watch Home Shopping Club.This applies to the audio cassette series, which is read beautifully by a Cro Magnon woman, though the speech she uses for her characters is not at all good when the characters are male. I wonder why they don't hire more than one reader to orally interpret books. Hire a cast of characters. It would help to differentiate the characters and it would prevent the ridiculous attempts by the reader to do a voice of the opposite sex. I'm sure the producers could get a full set of readers very cheaply."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a &quot;must read&quot; for women as young as 10!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"She had a older book in paper back, but the ex tore it up in spite.

I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do. Though the parts that confused me were the mogur ceremony and the earthquakes. Because in a way it makes it seem as if all the magic is real."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details.

Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them. Why the author felt she had to abandon any attempt at subtlety, and write as if the readers were as ignorant as her characters seem to be is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of Ayla has captured me.

For me, nothing that grabbed my attention happened and the writing wasn't enough to make up for it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I found these books fascinating and so did my husband. It's nice to be able to sit down and \\"escape\\" from our troubled world and read about people who had it a whole lot tougher that we do. A lot of my friend have read them, too and we all agree that these books are very well written, hold your attention and let you escape for a little while. We were not disappointed with any of the books and eagerly awaited the next one. We especially liked Clan of the Cave Bear. She was just a child when she lost her parents and for the most part the clan accepted her. She struck me as a very inteligent person to learn her new tribes rituals and yet was able to keep some of her own that she remembered. I would recommend this series to everybody."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I enjoyed the characters in this story. The complexity of the every day life for these characters is portrayed as though one is sitting right there.

It is a tail of life as it could have been so long ago."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this entire series years ago and loved it.

I first read it years ago when I was in high school and decided to pick it up and read it again earlier this month. I forgot how involved with the characters you became. Creb, Iza, Uba, Broud, all of them stick in your mind and nearly make you cry when something terrible befalls them.Intrigue into the story was added by the authors assumptions that Neanderthal man had genetic memories passed down from generation to generation...something that 'The Others' do not have. An excellent concept since learning was limited to the past and the future of Neanderthal was limited to food stores and the seasons --- their ultimate demise according to this author. An excellent concept.I haven't read any of the other books in the series for a number of reasons. #1 after speaking with multiple readers about them they informed me that the sequels are nothing compared to the original. A sad statement if its true. #2 I just don't have the time or inclination to read something that my friends (whom judgements I trust) tell me that it isn't worth my while.

However, I chose to overlook it and just enjoy the story. If you want accurate factual history, you may want to look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, read the book.I am impressed by the amount of research Ms. Auel obviously did regarding herbal medicine. I understand that she did a lot of research and some of the incidents in the story portray a possible reason for some of the archaeological finds, such as the inclusion of certain unusual objects in a burial cairn.I enjoyed the book, and look forward to the release of the newest book, Land of the Painted Caves.

We were all informed that Clan of The Cave Bear was the book tobe discussed. As a single mother of a toddler with a more than full time job Idoubted I would be able to get the book read. I had tried to read this book yearsago when it came out and never got through it. I got bogged down in the lengthydescriptions of the landscapes. I found that the format of an audio book made iteasier for me to get through and the reader did a good job of separating andrecreating the different characters. I still think the autor is a bit indulgent,giving us more detail than is usefull in the flora and fauna descriptions. But thestory and characters were compelling enough to motivate me through it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first Book in the Earth Children's Series by Jean M Auel. Please see my reviews on the other book in this series. This whole series is excellent. Once you start reading you cannot put it down. You become totally engrosed in the book that you actually become part of it. The best series I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Excellent book, I would recommend it highly. It is evident that the author did extensive research before writing the book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I absolutely love the story of the Earth's Children. I thought listening to the audio would be a nice treat to review the story line. I especially wanted to download the audio to my iPod to take it with me. This is I found most disappointing.... let me tell you why. The titles are saved incorrectly from a filing perspective. Some discs are labeled accurately and some are not, while some are listed as another book title and author entirely. This made sorting the playing order most trying. I've decided I will purchase the remaining discs from iTunes in hopes of avoiding this hassle."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Most historic fiction fans like to learn little tidbits about our ancestor's habits and technologies within the course of a read, and I understand that. However, though I enjoyed reading this book, I would have read more in the series if this first weren't so pre-occupied with the crafting and survival techniques of early peoples.Like most people who would pick up this book, I'm already interested in prehistory, and I read text books and watch the Discovery Channel for those things. What I want from a piece of historic fiction is fiction and adventure. In my opinion a prehistoric fiction novel should dwell no more on minutae of era existence than a good ol' western or medieval yarn. It should be taken for granted, and only that which is needed for the story should be included. It isn't necessary to place the adjective \\"steel\\" in front of knife every time you write it in a medieval book, so why is the adjective \\"stone' required in prehistoric fiction books?Also, I was hoping for more discussion of the brutality, difficulty and barbarism of the age, and was looking for more of a plot than the course of Ayla's step mother's quaint emotions and Ayla's journey of coming of age together with the developement of a sort of revolutionary prehistoric feminism.I did like the fact that the author is allowed to discuss hominid telepathy without being kicked out of her genre and into the realm of fantasy, however... and Auel is a skilled writer- at least as far as an eye for detail goes. I guess I was just looking for a different book, and having said these things I must add that I did appreciate the work. Learning some of the cultural and \\"lithic\\" facts via fiction was more fun than the research by which I usually get that knowledge, even if it tend tend to make the prose a bit contrived and patronizing.The thing is, I have to judge this book as a work of literature and not as a learning aid, because that is what it claims to be. Therefore, three stars.(That's three and a half rounded down by the way).One more thing- I think it's pretty ridiculous that Aule is taking flack because some people think her characters are prehistoric superheroes. Granted, I only read the first one, but the neanderthals at least seemed pretty wimpish compared to what they actually were in real life.An average neanderthal could stand on the 10 yard line of a football field and hurl an NFL linebacker through the goal posts with little effort, and they also had much larger brains than moderns and possessed a much higher theshold for pain. Cro-magnons were several times stronger than modern humans as well, with denser bone mass and considerably larger brains. Both races were infinitely more instinctual and able more able to survive harsh conditions without technology than modern humans.If anything, at least in this first book, Aule has diminished the prowess of Pleistocene man, rather than augmented it.J.

THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!! Ayla is the ultimate survivor of all time. First her mother dies in a earthquake, she survives a lion attack, she gets banned from the clan for hunting, and she contends with the evil son of the leader. The epic goes on and on. Since 1991, I have read this book at least 50 times. This book still makes me cry every time I read it. Thank you for a great story Mrs. Auel!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I enjoy reading historical fiction, and looked forward to reading the Clan of the Cave Bear series. I found it mildly interesting. It's not a page turner, in fact, I'll admit, I skimmed through certain parts that seemed too wordy. I didn't feel like I was learning much historically, I didn't feel like the author did a lot of research on the time period. It felt like I was reading pure fiction based on speculation. All that said, I read through it and am now reading the next book, Valley of the Horses, which I am actually enjoying more.One thing that surprised me about the story was how dominating the males were over females. This is stressed over and over again. Well, maybe it's only true with this clan.

How do I even begin? My only wish is that the rest of the books in the series had been even half the book that this one is... I almost wish she had never gone on... I was so disappointed and bored by the rest of them. But this book... what an incredible tale of a woman's self-exploration and identity!!! I think all young women should read this book at leats once... actually, all women, no matter your age... it is exhilerating and painful and heartfelt and so realistic... and completely and utterly empowering. I am usually into thrillers, so this was different for me, and I was afraid I would be bored but... I wasn't at all... In fact, I couldn't put it down... I was completely enraptured in this woman's life. This book is a work of art, not simply a book to be read and discarded... and should receive much more acclaim... much more notoriety... than it does. Every woman should read it... seriously. You'll never forget it! :) (Oh, and unfortunately I feel my duty to tell you... if & when you do read it, please spare yourself the disappointment of the rest of the series, and end it with this book which does stand on it's own.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I LOVE ALL OF JEAN M. AUEL'S BOOKS! I READ CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13.

This is a painful book to read. There are so many adjectives that I think the writer has used every single one available in the English language... multiple times. I find my inner dialog constantly repeating the phrase \\"okay, all right, I get it, move on.\\" Just for fun, I picked a random paragraph and in those four sentences, counted over 20 adjectives! -- I'm the sort of reader who likes to finish books, no matter how bad, but this one has tested my limits and I am, for the first time since childhood, seriously considering not finishing... and in this case, deleting it from my Kindle library. (I am now kicking myself for reminding myself that I paid full price for this POS.) There is nothing that can be said in the last 35% that will change my opinion. I don't generally write reviews, but I do read them and the high number of glowing reviews, along with recommendations from two co-workers, prompted my purchase. The truth needs to be heard. Clan of the Cave Bear is a terrible read! This book comes nowhere near to earning such high praise and for that reason alone, I submit my rating of 1... only because I can't give it a zero. -- Now, where's that hot poker?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read this book twice, and loved it even more the second time. It's a great read, especially if you have any interest in anthropologie! The detail is amazing and encapsulating!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I was looking for a new series after finishing the Outlander series.The story was engaging, and I enjoyed the historical perspective of living during this era. That being said, the authors repeated use of lists was so annoying that I wanted to throw the book down on multiple occasions. At one point after reading the 35 different varieties of trees found in a particular forest, I was able to predict correctly that the next several paragraphs would be dedicated to the 50 species found in said forest. The intent must have been to paint a picture of the landscape, but it failed miserably. It felt to me as if the author were a student trying to use filler to get the assignment to the correct number of words required. I struggled through the book, and am now reading The Valley of Horses, which is much better, but still has some of the incessant ramblings. I would not recommend The Clan of the Cavebear to anyone. If you are interested in the series, start with The Valley of the Horses and save some of your sanity."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Like many many people, I have read, and re-read the \\"Earth's Children\\" series by Jean M Auel many times since it's debut years and years ago. When the Kindle came out I wrote to Ms. Auel via her website, and received a reply from *I think* her son, saying they were looking at putting the books out in e-format... Well, they are out.. If you can get past the obviously OCR'd text. This is FULL of OCR problems. It's a good thing I know this story by heart, and can easily substitute the correct words in my head.Clan of the Cave Bear (Ignore the pathetic movie) This book is wonderful. It tells the story of a 5 year old Cro-Magnum girl who loses her family during an earthquake one day, and is taken in by Neanderthals, who raise her to be one of them. She struggles to learn things that they know almost instinctively.She teaches herself things that they won't teach her, gets punished, grows up more, has a son (mixed neanderthal & cro-magnum) at 13, and is *cursed* and forced to leave alone at 15."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have written another review on this book, but I would like to explain a little more in-depth about what this book is all about.First of all, I'd like to say that contrary to many reviews, Neanderthals are NOT portrayed as stupid people who can't understand squat about anything \\"different\\". They are, in reality, portrayed as they may have been in real life-an ancient with amazing memories, yet differently evolved people who are resistant to change.Ayla, also, is not \\"set up to walk on water\\". I'll admit that in later books, her lightning-fast mind seems a little ludicrous, but in this book, being strong and remembering things easily is necessary to survive.The only reason I gave Clan of the Cave Bear four stars is because of the grammatical errors, such as comma splices, that cropped up all too frequently.I also enjoyed the research that Ms. Auel obviously worked her butt off to put in. I think anyone who says it's 'too much research' can't appreciate the beauty of this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Never before do I remember reading a book that has so moved me as did Jean M. Auel's CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. I had always seen it, heard of it, but somehow never got around to actually sitting down and reading its pages. The decision to read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was one that I could never regret. While reading it I cheered silently for Ayla, cried visibly for her, and was angry when injustices fell on her. Reading this novel was like visiting another world, allowing me to escape everyday life to live in the past. I was terribly sad when I had finished the last page, but look forward to continuing the series.In the beginning I was skeptic about the quality, but as I continued reading I found that the quality was the highest of any book I have ever read. The details were so descriptive that I could see the cave, the landscape, the people... so much that they became real to me. This novel is not only a great piece of fiction but a world all in its own. I could actually relate to the characters in the book, namely Ayla. I felt her will and determination, and most of all her willingness to sacrfice herself for anything that was important to her. Well done, Ms. Auel, you have created a superb piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial &quot;desert island&quot; situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"That's right, the next book in the series will hit shelves in May 2002!!THE SHELFTERS OF STONE"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend of mine suggested this book for a number of years. Having seen the not-so-great movie (for one reason), the book just didn't appeal to me. But I finally relented and read it. And I loved it. In fact, I immediately read the 4 sequels and I'm anxiously waiting for the 6th and (possibly) final book in the series. Maybe I like them because I'm not a literature snob (that's a friendly snipe at another reviewer).Ayla is a great heroine. She is beautiful, smart, and a survivor! Of course all of her achievements (taken together in this and the later books) aren't realistic. She is an idealized character. She is symbolic of the new and improved, modern homo sapiens. And I dig her!My only criticism of the book is that the frequent lengthy descriptions of the flora are repetitive and long-winded, but after a while I learned to skim through those pages (sorry, Jean).For entertainment value, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and its sequels can't be beat. There are hardships, conflicts, conquests, and loving relationships. But there is much more here than just entertainment; there is an education in anthropology and botany that should be worth a few college credits!I found \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and the entire series to be totally unique -- human drama and lovable characters (all except Broud, that is), when the characters are all cave people! Who would have thought?!? And by the way, after reading the books and then watching it again, the movie really wasn't that bad!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you like well crafted historical FICTION, written by an intelligent and educated author, enjoy suspense and good versus evil, root for the underdog, look out behind you! type storytelling this is the book for you. Jane Auel weaves a rich, rich tapestry in your mind. Who can argue the setting? Anything is possible, it's a never never land really. As fantastical as Star Trek in reverse. But the characters draw you in, you will no doubt fall in love with them.I bought this book because I needed something to read during a long day of travelling on airplanes and was quite reluctant to start it. But I was hooked within the first few pages and I was bonded to the characters from that time on. I am now an avid fan and can't wait to get the second book in the series \\"The Valley of the Horses\\".Politics and scientific inconsistencies aside, implied or overt racist implications, blah, blah and so on, this book is one heck of a good read. Unfortunately for Jane Auel she chose the stereotypical \\"aryan\\" protagonist, but in my opinion, what could appear weaker in any society than a helpless five year old, blonde, blue eyed female? The epitomy of fraility! Those who see this as another nazi theorem, get over yourselves!! This is more a feminist outlook; look at the brilliant Iza. This is afterall, a novel. Anyone that confuses this with a scientific thesis or dissertation, or is offended by what they perceive as racist innuendo is reading well below their level and should go back to their text books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the first amazing installment in a series that will blow you away. The main character starts as a girl named Ayla who is raised by cave people (Clan of the Cave Bear) after an earthquake destroys her family. As an outsider (whom the cave people call the \\"Others\\") she must grow and overcome always being different and an outcast. This is the first book I ever read that actually made me cry. Jean M. Auel really sucks you in emotionally in this story and you are unable to let go. The Clan Of The Cave Bear is more then worth your time and money, I recommend this book above all others.."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Be swept along the gorgeous prehistoric scenery, come in contact with people (clans) you cannot meet in modern-day. While reading it, I completely lost track of time. I found myself really concerned for the safety of the characters and the outcome of their stories.There is something for everyone in \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\". If you are a historian, scientist, social scientist, anthropologist, romantic, or just enjoy a good book, you will love it.Ayla was abandoned as a very small child and take in by a clan of people very unlike herself. Despite the difference of appearance, she was loved. Eventually she would be ostracized and have to leave when she meets Jondalar, a gorgeous man that looks just like her. Together they embark on an amazing adventure together.You witness the first domestication of animals, learn how to make prehistoric clothes, learn to make fire more easily and sample extremely potent brews.Luckily, the story does not end when you complete the book.

It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era.It is the first volume of a powerful series.The story is as follows; Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold.It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, looking into stone technology, herb doctor techniques, hunting methods, weaponry, social relationships and whatever aspect of a civilization you may be interested it is shown.In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have found that many of the books that I am drawn to are books that my mother once enjoyed. I believe that this is me trying to hold onto a slice of what my mother was like. At the same time I know that she could suggest a pretty good book. She had often raved about \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" while she was reading it. So, I had heard some of this story before we decided to read it for the book club, but that did not take away from the experience. This book is a wonderful read with characters and scenes that you won't find any other book. There are slow parts in the long story, but they do not take away from a story of diversity and early human life."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean M. Auel captures efficiently the changing times and landscape of the Neanderthals and the passing of evolution towards the more modernly advanced Cro-Magnons. The story not only provides excellent descriptions of nature and climate at the time, but also captures the customs of the people. The highlight of the novel revolves around the medicinal plants and herbs that are constantly brought up through Iza and Ayla's work as medicine women. The low points of the novel are some of the repetitive elements in Auel's description of the landscape and certain details repeated verbatim. However, the story clings to you as you flip the pages hurriedly, trying to find out about the next stages in Ayla's life. Overall, a good and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My aunt recommended this book to me... she first read it when it came out back in the 80s, and I highly doubted I would ever read it, or if I did, that I would like it. Because I never took any initiative to find it, she got the whole series for me for Christmas. (Its a good thing she did, too, because now I can't put the books down!)I am so intrigued that Auel can capture a world that very few people know anything about and create such vivid pictures and characters with such dimension. Its amazing to get a taste of the world so long ago and to read such a refreshing new style of writing - and thinking. The story is incredible, and Auel's storytelling ability is marvelous... along with the fact that she can have people of all ages addicted to these books. I'm only 15, and I know many people over 50 who have devoured and loved Clan of the Cave Bear.Its an excellent find, and while I may not buy you the whole series for Christmas, I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"REVIEW: The problem with reviewing a book of such groundbreaking magnitude (especially one that has spawned a whole new literary genre) is in the tendency to forgo criticism except on the most superficial levels while basking in the fact that despite the nearly impossible task the author has undertaken she actually manages to pull it off with her plausibility (relatively) intact. Jean M. Auel's \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" tells the story of the dawn of mankind according to Darwin's evolutionary theories whereby the soon-to-be-extinct Neanderthals are about to be overwhelmed by the more adaptable/environmentally and genetically superior Cro-Magnon. After an earthquake kills her family, young five-year-old Ayla is forced to fend for herself until she is found by the Clan Of The Cave Bear which is led by the stoic yet good-hearted leader, Brun: they are a Neanderthal tribe and she is of Cro-Magnon descent. Once Brun decides to accept Ayla as part of his own Clan (in spite of their differences), Auel's tale becomes a neat character study coupled with an in-depth, day-to-day depiction of what primitive life may have been like all those years ago. Her prodigious research and the painstaking re-creation of the spiritual, physical, and mental aspects of a Neanderthal tribe is quite breathtaking in its believability and its humanity. As such it is THIS portion of the book which deserves the most praise. However, as a whole \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" has not aged well. Auel is an above-average writer, but the construction of the book is woefully patchy and badly in need of a good editor. Events are, at times, leisurely paced yet routinely interrupted by drastic plot twists interspersed with treatises on plants and medicinal herbs, hunting, knapping tools, clothes making, food preparation and preservation as well as the meticulous cataloging of ceremonies, rituals, and feasts that are a part of their tradition. The detail is exhausting: yet none of these elements are allowed to blend into the narrative in a cohesive way. Add to that Auel's intrusively modern, feminist point of view (i.e. the promotion of abortion, euthanasia, contraception, etc.) that tends to creep into the storyline; and the resulting equilibrium of the book seems completely off-kilter and at odds with the basic plot. People of the Judeo/Christian faith will also have problems with the Darwinian point-of-view (although Auel does a great job in conveying the seriousness of the clan's beliefs by alluding to their cave bear ceremony as a sacrament equivalent to the communion of bread and wine in honor of Christ's death and resurrection unto glory). However, I find it intriguing that the \\"spiritual element\\" of such primitive people even exists if (as Darwinists proclaim) we simply crawled out of a primordial soup and evolved from monkeys. Since we are, supposedly, the result of a vast cosmic accident: then, by default, religion and the spiritual aspect of man should not exist or even be part of our genetic capabilities. Yet the capabilities are there in spite of all the scientific \\"evidence\\" to the contrary. Interesting. Still, the book is enjoyable, the main characters well-drawn, and the overall story compelling. For popular fiction that is a major achievement, but as a contemporary classic it misses the mark by a wider margin."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I remember seeing the Children of the Earth series in the shelves of my parent's library as a kid. I was always intrigued by the art cover of the books. Now that i am an adult i remember they existed and I reast the first 4 volumes.The Clan of the Cave Bear remains my favorite.The first few chapters were a bit tedious, but as the story unfolds, I was hooked to it. Auel stresses the fact that Human evolution is not linear like a lot of people believe it is.We can compare Human Evolution to a big tree with several branches. Which means the Neanderthal man was not less intelligent than us: they had a different type of intelligence. Ayla represents the new form of Human Evolution but she has traces of the Neanderthal man in her as well. Overall, we are all human and since the ice age (or before that) we faced the same issues:Racism,Chauvinism, struggle for survival, but also love, caring, respect and solidarity. Ayla's story is tragic and beautiful at the same time. We can all relate to her because we come from the same place."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Can't add much to the heaps of praise and descriptions already written, except to say that I read and re-read these 5 books in Jean Auel's Earth's People series. I get more out of them with each reading. I'm hoping she writes more.I've mused about whether I would recommend them to teenagers who are not yet sexually active, and I think I would. Sometimes I am shy about saying how much I enjoy this series because the author put in such steamy sex scenes (which are NOT my prime reason for loving the books), but my opinion is that Auel presents that \\"sticky\\" topic in an extremely healthy way.The imaginative, colorful, probably accurate descriptions of our prehistoric ancestors and their world with problems, large and small, and the adventures they undertake, are what fascinate me most."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Loved the story.

So well written; this is my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"*** minor technical spoiler ***I was really eager to read something about prehistoric times, and to my delight the story started out interesting as it was. But after 30 pages, I was beginning to be really annoyed about the narrator... First person, third person, in every character's point of view, in everybody's head, changing in every paragraph. Honestly, it was bothering me so much that I had to put the book down a few times. I found it dilettant. Then I got to thinking, well, if I wanted to theorize about it, I would say she is playing on the collective consciousness of these people: if they can delve into the memories of the ancestors, by analogy, we can delve into their heads, which could be a reason for the author's choices, but it sounded... just... not right.However, while reading further on, I got so immersed in the story, which is fascinating, original, fantastic and captivating, that narration stopped to matter :) I completely forgot about it! This hardly every happens to me. Incredibly detailed descriptions, relationships well-elaborated on, and all this in a realistic and down-to-earth manner. My compliments. (Just one more thing: I wish she would try less hammering meaning into OUR heads :)Anyhow...Now I can't wait to read the rest :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read the Earth's Children Series years ago.

It is set on Pre-historic earth and follows her life from being found as a five year old to becoming a young woman and leaving the clan. Life is a struggle for Ayla, and she finds it very difficult to fit in with the ways and customs of the clan.Basically it is a struggle for survival in a harsh ice-age world, and I found myself fascinated with the real historical world that Jean has researched and written about.

The language and the story are so wonderful that I couldn't get by without owning this book. I think it's a novel that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book in the 80's and enjoyed it tremendously. I read it again just recently and it still remains one of my most favorite.The story of Ayla and her determination to overcome give me strength. Auel's detailed descriptions of everyone and everything left nothing to your imagination. I laughed and I cried. I felt every heartbreak and every ounce of pride that Ayla felt.The spirits of the totems and the ceremonies remind me of the spiritualism of our Early American Indians. Auel's book, although fiction, is very believable.I love this book. It is WELL WORTH THE PRICE!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In our society time is money...zero to 60 in as few seconds as possible! Well, get in my 80 horse power Nissan and you'll probably wonder why it isn't moving. Before you realize it though, you're doing 65 with the rest of the crowd.That's what this novel will do to you. It starts you off in a Nissan that quicly transforms into a BMW roadster. And the next thing you know you've lost a night's sleep because you can't put it down!Set in prehistoric times when the era of the Neanderthals was slowly giving way to the Cro-Magnons, \\"Clan...\\" follows the life of Ayla, a blonde Cro-Magnon girl adopted by a clan of Neanderthals, as she grows into young womanhood. (Keep in mind that in Cro-Magnon days females became young women in their early teens.) The adventures of Ayla begin at age 5 and continue into her mid-teens.Along the way Ms Auel creates Ayla into something of a wonder woman. For example---clan women are forbidden to hunt or use weapons of any kind. So naturally Ayla finds a sling and teaches herself how to use it in secret. When her secret is found out Ayla, 14 years old and more than 8 months pregnant, is banished for one month in the dead of winter. As far as the Clan is concerned this is tantamount to a death sentence, since in all of the Clan's memories no female in her condition had ever survived such a banishment. But Ayla retreats to a small cave she had discovered months earlier, stocks the cave with wood and bedding materials, hunts for food with her sling, and gives birth to a son. All of this on her own, mind you, in blinding snow storms and only 14 years old.But hey!...it is a work of fiction, right?. And let's face it, females of that era surely had to be just as rugged and resourceful as the males in order to survive. So maybe it isn't so unbelievable after all. One thing is sure, you will be rooting for Ayla from beginning to end.Regardless of how far fetched you may find Ayla's adventures, Jean Auel's fertile imagination (and her obvious research) has created a novel that is truely entertaining and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Picking this book is not. An employee of a chain book store recommended it to me. After reading the synopsis on the back cover, I had to ask if he was kidding. Needless to say I bought the book and after struggling through the first few pages, I found it nearly impossible to put down.

Auel obviously did her research with this making it educational as well as intertaining. I learned a lot from this book about the early days of man.

After reading it, however, I changed my views and went on to read the rest of the series (this book is the best). Ayla, the heroine, is strong and courageous, perfect for this world but unfit for the Neandertals she had to live with. She shows the adaptability of Homo Sapiens. I admire her for this.

Connell, it is easy to read, understand, and relate to. I probably would have read it even if it hadn't been required. I've even loaned it out to friends who were interested in the subject. If you're interested in sex & gender theory or in masculinity/ies, I would recommend this book as well as others by R.W. Connell."},{"Title":"The Men and the Boys","review":"One of the hottest topics in gender studies today is the study of masculinity and R.W. Connell provides a thorough investigation with \\"The Men and the Boys\\". Feminist explorations of gender in recent decades not only focused on women's concerns and life circumstances but also challenged assumptions about how social structures are constructed by gender. Occuring from these gender explorations is increasing interest in men and the social construction of masculinities. To only conceptualize gender in feminine interests neglects to understand how boys and men are socialized to be masculine which is important to our overall knowledge of how gender operates in society.In \\"The Men and the Boys\\" R.W. Connell conceptualizes how masculinities are socially constructed and how they are fluid within historical, cultural, and social constructs. Masculinities exist outside the individual and are defined collectively in culture and are sustained in social institutions. They came into existence during social interaction and are a product of active construction. There is not one masculinity but rather multiple masculinities which can be diverse within the same social setting. Masculinities are hierarchical with some being more dominant while others are subordinated or marginalized, such as homosexual masculinities. The most honored and desired, although not necessarily the most common, is hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity pertains to the image of the professional sports player or rock star that many men aim to be a reflection.R.W. Connell is a pioneer in the study of masculinity, and this book provides a thorough examination of the social construction of masculinity along with social policy recommendations to help alleviate the negative reprecussions of hegemonic masculinity. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this fascinating new subject area."},{"Title":"The Men and the Boys","review":"I have used this book in an upper level communication and gender studies class for several years. It works, even though students often complain that its writing is too dry. They DO learn from it. They learn that masculinities are created, and shows how schools and peers and parents are involved in the processes. They also easily see how different the various masculinities can be, at once underlining several of the lessons we help young people learn. Such insights as aided by Connell's book help students see they have ability to resist social pressures to adopt negative features of some masculinities and to create for their own lives healthy and positive ways of being masculine.

Her younger sister, Amy, is diabetic and needs the constant reminding about not eating too many sweets to overload her system. Grace's father invites a relative from Ireland to come and stay with them and to take care of the family. This of course causes problems as Grace had been the motherly figure since her own mom had passed away. Fiona, the relative, tells Grace the story of Grania O'Malley, the Pirate Queen which is carried somewhat throughout the story. Grace runs into trouble at school when she breaks her teacher's favorite Christmas bell. The real conflict of the story is how Grace deals with her breaking of the bell and the character traits she displays. The newly formed family really comes together when encountering an emergency that really hits home. I felt this book did not have enough conflict resolution and while the traits of the main characters were believable they weren't what you would call exemplary. This may be a good book when discussing character education, knowing ahead of time that the problems and solutions are a bit outdated."},{"Title":"Gift of the Pirate Queen","review":"I loved this book as I have love all other books I have read by PATRICIA REILLY GIFF.

My wife and I both read it after having lived in the Middle East for several years, and were pleased at the author's care to present Arabian life and culture in an accurate fashion. But this is not a story about Arabia, nor is it a story about war; it is an engrossing tale of espionage, love, betrayal, and three people trying to save a precarious government from collapse.

But I do recommend the novel."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"Many Christians feel uneasy about the Enneagram as a way of deepening self-awareness; this is mostly because the test has some connections to the Sufi religion and new age thought. That makes this book by Richard Rohr necessary and helpful to be able to gain the insight of the enneagram from a source that is operating from a Christian worldview. This book has sections on where the enneagram came from, what it is, what the 9 enneagram personality types are, and how Christians can benefit from it without adopting non-Christian ideas. The most helpful part is part II of the book which goes into depth on the 9 types, from a Christian perspective. Most helpful, Rohr identifies the root sin of each type, and how God can redeem that sin into a beautiful gift. He also talks about what gifts the types naturally have, and how we can grow in those. I have heard that the enneagram does not put people in boxes, rather, that it helps people identify what boxes they are already in and how to get out of them. This book is very helpful for understanding yourself and others, and for getting out of the boxes that are keeping you from living in a full and redeemed way."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"This updated version of DISCOVERING THE ENEAGRAM is truly a gem. It does a good job of explaining Enneagram theory and an excellent scholarly job of looking at the history of the Enneagram. In addition, its descriptions of the 9 Enneagram types are well done and insightful. Each of these sections also contains many interesting historical references to important figures and event in Christian history.I have read a lot of Enneagram books including some that were written from a Christian perspective. Within the Christian subset of books, I feel this one is \\"hands down\\" the very best. It is also in general agreement with Riso and Hudson, Helen Palmer and Sandra Maitri on the characteristics of the types. These are three of the biggest names in Enneagram study and each has a useful perspective to offer.Rohr sees the Enneagram as both a useful psychological and spiritual tool for self growth. Psychologists and spiritual directors will really appreciate his rigor and depth. Another Christian author who uses the Enneagram for spiritual direction is James Empereur. His book THE ENNEAGRAM AND SPIRITUAL DIRECTION is also quite good.If you are a psychologist you may also want a copy of PERSONALITY TYPES by Riso and Hudson. This book covers the 9 developmental levels of each type in detail and the associated psychological pathologies. For a general audience, THE WISDOM OF THE ENNEAGRAM by the same authors may be better because it has a more broad focus on theory and keeps the detail on each developmental level to a minimum.Another point worth mentioning is that this updating version of Rohr's DISCOVERING THE ENNEAGRAM (retitled) covers new discoveries about the history of the Enneagram. This includes its use and possible origins in Early Christianity. This section is well-researched and you can find a lot of good references here on the history of the Enneagram."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"I first discovered the Enneagram from Richard Rohr's earlier work, both the first edition of this book and some tapes. It has been life changing for me and I highly recommend it.This book takes a very clear stand as spiritual approach, so if psychology alone is your goal, you may not like this.Even with its religous tone, I find this a great life tool. Not only has it been so helpful to me in self healing and discovery, it has helped me so much in the workplace and social arenas.Richard Rohr is a singular person and I recommend almost all of his works!"},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"As a fan of Richard Rohr, i must confess I found this book quite disappointing. Having engaged in coursework on the enneagram I entered this book with some familiarity with the lens it provided.I was very disappointed in Rohr's generalizations and use of stereotypical terms such as \\"Jewish mother\\" which I find inflammatory. I also found his assumptions as with certain types having had abusive childhoods (when this is not necessarily true). It appears that either Rohr or the other author has some personal issues with the two and seven types. As the tone of these chapters is much more negative than the rest of the book. Incidentally, in the chapter entitled \\"The enneagram and Jesus\\" there is disproportionately less space devoted to how Jesus was an enneagram 2 than any other type.As the book appears to be translated from German and is a republication of a 1989 german edition, I give Rohr the benefit of the doubt and give him 3 stars when I really believe it worthy of only 2 stars. There is some worthwhile information presented but the manner it is presented is questionable at best.Regardless of the author or teacher, the enneagram is a none too gentle wake up call to take a long hard look at our compulsions. Studying it is always painful if one truly invests in its philosophy. However I urge extreme caution in reading this book as I find it to have more potential for traumitization.For a more gentle yet credible introduction to the enneagram I reccomend anything by Riso and Hudson especially THE WISDOM OF THE ENNEAGRAM. Similarly anything by Helen Palmer is excellent. For brief bare bones essentials on the enneagram, THE ESSENTIAL ENNEAGRAM by Daniels and Price will suffice. For an excellent and gentle read on the Enneagram and its relation to Kabbalah look into the two books by Rabbi Addison.For an excellent book by Rohr read HOPE AGAINST DARKNESS: THE TRANSFORMING VISION OF SAINT FRANCIS IN AN AGE OF ANXIETY."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"I first encountered Enneagram literature in the early '90s, and became engrossed, but soon felt bogged down in belly-gazing and type-analyzing, and somewhat depressed by the way the types seemed locked into their weaknesses, according to the sources I was reading at the time. Rohr and Ebert's book, on the other hand, was a breath of fresh air. The \\"Christian perspective\\" in this book is a perspective of redemption and transformation. Knowledge of one's type becomes a key toward growth and transformation, rather than a stimulus for belly-gazing. Also, the book's treatment of \\"wings\\" and different \\"centers\\" (gut, head, heart), as well as its discussion of factors that lead to type-confusion (a person of one type taking on the characteristics of another at a certain point in his/her life), helps account for the unique variations and complexities found in individual personalities. I also found it better than some of the other sources I'd read at pinpointing the essential issues of the types, and after having mis-typed myself for years, I finally made the correct identification.A suggestion to any newcomer to the Enneagram: Explore different discussions to gain a nuanced understanding of it (as well as to avoid the pitfall of narrowing people into rigid categories). One of the beauties of the Enneagram is its complexity. Although the insights in this book were the most constructive to me, other helpful sources have been: audio recordings of Enneagram workshops led by Rohr; The Enneagram Made Easy by Baron and Wagele (a fun quick-reference, and there's a brief but interesting cross-reference with the Myers Briggs Type Indicator); http://www.9types.com/; and http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"The Enneagram is more than just a form of personality typology, it goes to the roots of our motivations and perceptions. For this, I have always felt secure in using the Enneagram to explore my insecurities and thusly, life lessons to be learned.Through my years of struggling to find a simple clear message from the Christian faith, I find this book to be challenging without being offensive nor condescending. I had to put the book down several times just to mull over a single paragraph. This book is an excellent source for learning the Enneagram and, as a bonus, explains the Christian faith in a nonthreatening manner."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"This book hit my personality type totally! With jaw-dropping accuracy, it brought my natural inclinations to light as a typical personality type. All of a sudden, I was not alone and there was reason for my tendencies. This book was great because it bridges the gap between your natural inclinations and where you should go as a Christian. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"Having heard about this book at a religious retreat, I was eager to see what the Enneagram is all about. I was not disappointed with the thoroughness of Rohr's work in presenting the Enneagram in an instructional and insightful way, and am sure that I am benefitting personally from what I learned about the types. My only misgiving is that there are several locations in the book where Rohr makes pretty strong references to Western culture's exploitation of the Third World, and seems to advocate mass redistribution of wealth to correct this injustice. These are brief assertions, and don't dominate the book in any way. However, obviously, the world is far more complicated than a simple answer like this to social economic differences. I found this position particularly striking in light of the fact that he himself states that Third World people tend to be type NINEs, which he says is common for those not yet affected by civilization. He even suggests that such people may be happier than us. I would still recommend this book, but keep in mind that Rohr has a perspective unique to his history, just as we all do. So don't accept his opinions regarding social justice at face value. It's okay to have your own view."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"I have read the Don Riso enneagram books and years ago had read a book by Richard Rohr on the Enneagram with some Christian perspective. I don't even remember the title. In searching for that I stumbled on this and was refreshed to know how this fits in with my faith. I truly believe God creates us all beautifully and understanding each persons core way of thinking (through the enneagram) helps me to view others through Jesus eyes with a more caring spirit.

Fr. Mitch Pacwa learned about the Enneagram when he was in seminary in the 1970's. He says he was involved in every kind of New Age thinking, but later realized what a waste of time all this was. The Enneagram has occult roots, if one cares to dig into its origins. There are so many great Christian Catholic resources for deepening our relationship with God who is \\"crazy about us,\\" we don't need to waste time on occult and inauthentic sources. Spend your money wisely, Start with Fr. Thomas Dubay, Holy Father Benedict XVI, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Therese of Lisieux, Fr. Benedict Groeschel. You will never be led astray. All of these authors along with dozens of others who are authentic teachers of the Catholic Faith and prayer are available on Amazon-check them out."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"I start by highlighting its flaws. The most important thing to know about the book is that its subtitle is misleading; a more accurate subtitle would be, \\"A perspective influenced by Christianity but contaminated by other influences which are erroneous.\\" While the book can be ultimately useful for Christians, to be blunt, it is also full of heresy - and all heresy is destructive.In many respects, the book is actually un-Christian, and smugly un-Christian at points. Perhaps in the name of ecumenism, it plays down the fundamental distinctions between Christianity and other religions, especially early in the book. In some chapters, one gets the impression that mysticism alone is key, regardless of the truth upon which one is meditating. In fact, the authors support the notion of attempting to meditate on nothing and become empty, which unfortunately is: a) never taught in Holy Scripture, and b) ultimately a seeking after a self-induced drug trip and an invitation to demonic influence. (However, in fairness to the authors, they do in other chapters assert (at least circumspectly) the necessity of Christ.) The authors are frighteningly arrogant in their approach to Holy Scripture (and the Apostles), implicitly erasing or at least downplaying parts they don't agree with. Several examples: First, they imply that believing the historicity of the gospel stories is \\"nave,\\" and in this same section (\\"Jesus and the Enneagram\\") they don't say that \\"Jesus is God\\" - which is the clear teaching of Holy Scripture - but rather \\"Jesus represents God.\\" Second, they sneer at the Apostle John's self-designation \\"the beloved,\\" and at one point assert that this apostle actually lies about what Jesus said - as if they somehow have better information than an eyewitness, much less an apostle commissioned by Jesus Himself! Third, they claim that the Apostle Paul was arrogant and gave in to temptation to self-flattery - which certainly calls into question whether they believe that all Holy Scripture is God-breathed. Finally, they assert, presumably on the basis of cowing to feminist wishful thinking, that \\"the literary development of the Bible offers \`rich evidence about how the historical role of women was ... falsified,' \\" use the phrase \\"our fatherly/motherly God,\\" and agree with fanciful claims about how Miriam was a woman who \\"had equal status as a leader with Moses and Aaron.\\"The book also almost explicitly equates Christianity with utopian leftist dogma/religion (such dogma is distinct from leftist values, many of which are Christian). Their heroes are Castro, Guevera, and those of that ilk, and those who idolize them, and would walk in their footsteps. (But a closer look at the historical record, as opposed to the theory, reveals the horror that such totalitarians unleash.) They praise \\"exciting\\" liberation theology, which is a theology that distorts the clear teaching of Holy Scripture on sin and salvation. They disparage the fact that the Roman Catholic church is \\"once again showing its fundamentalist tendencies\\" - although as Christians we are commanded to hold fast to truth, and reject the latest interpretation acceptable to society. Unfortunately, unlike many other Catholic (and liberal Protestant) intelligentsia, in confusion they equate the Christian's personal requirements (such as grace and forgiveness) with those of the government and of social order, thus end up embracing socialistic or communistic theory. They have been deceived into believing that these human philosophies are identical to God's plans (rather than man's attempts to promote utopia on earth, attempts doomed to failure precisely because of sin). They fail to understand that the role of the state is not identical to the role of Christ's body - nor do the same prohibitions and injunctions apply. Furthermore, in point of fact, many of the policies which are implicitly applauded here are often not to the ultimate benefit of the poor, nor to the criminal, nor to the abused. (For example, the economics is painfully flawed; to take one of many examples, the statement \\"...there are structural sins, which we commit as a group, because our prosperity is financed at the cost of the Third World ...\\" is simply wildly incorrect and betrays utter ignorance of the principles governing economic growth. The Third World isn't poor because of the First - although in this regard it is interesting to note that, contra the beliefs of many who claim to care, our protectionist impulses have murdered more peasants around the world than our foreign policy ever did. Rather, just to give a hint at the answer to \\"what causes growth, and what stops it?,\\" the key insight is that economic growth involves increases in the ability to produce goods and services. We are wealthier than those in the Middle Ages because, e.g., we can grow more corn per acre, we can use machinery, we have learned how to make higher-quality goods. Unlike the situation in the Middle Ages, we do not live in a zero-sum world; everyone can escape poverty and become wealthier. Thus, the key question to ask about poor countries is, \\"What prevents productivity growth in these countries?\\" Having said this, an urgent question which comes to my mind is: Why don't Catholic priests study some economics before prescribing flawed, and ultimately sinful, policies based upon human reasoning without foundation? In all seriousness, is this not this failure to learn (prior to proscribing policies) itself sinful? These superficially appealing human philosophies, which promise peace on earth, are in the end empty; it is only through the cross that man is redeemed, only through the mustard seed that heaven comes to earth. We long for utopia, but it is only present in heaven; on earth, sin wrecks all the clever machinations of man. That is why we cannot trust in the market and we cannot trust in government. Both will fail.And, of course, the authors convey the impression that the enneagram is the key to everything. (It is even described as \\"the icon of the face of Christ\\" - !!) Holy Scripture appears to be a distant second, or perhaps even third. At points the authors note that their primal intention (at least) is to call the reader to the hard, stony path of conversion, but here again the authors make a serious error in their slipshod use of the term \\"conversion.\\" The authors fail to make clear that salvation is by grace alone, by a Divine solution to the horror of sin, by the death and resurrection of Christ. The necessary first step to a relationship with God is repentance; we cannot know God if we do not accept His Lordship and His command to follow Him, to die to ourselves. Without bowing to Christ, \\"self-help\\" via an awareness of one's proclivities, and even improvement of one's behavior, does nothing in terms of bringing us into proper relationship with God. As Jesus stated, there is only One Way - and it is narrow and difficult. The book is only ultimately helpful to those who desire to obey, to be transformed into the image of Christ. It is dangerous to pretend otherwise; we are mortally wounded, and band-aids are not going to accomplish our cure.Still, after stripping away these serious errors, the book can be useful. At times, the book is truly Christian. What is good about the book (and the enneagram) is its insight into human nature, and its explanation of this nature in terms of sin (in other words, it informs us of \\"the psychology of sin\\"). Each of the nine types described is typified by an affinity to a particular sin. The way of \\"escape\\" is knowledge of this sin, followed by repentance (turning away) in conscious dependence upon God's power, constant alertness to the particular temptation, seeking the \\"opposite\\" fruit of the Spirit. And, of course, prayer. God's kingdom advances as men turn from their sin and allow Him to work on them and transform them. Thus, I would not be surprised if God used the insights in this book to transform His children.On this note, there are also gems to be found sprinkled in the book. There are many little prods to examine oneself to see if one's behavior is motivated by sin. Also, unlike a popular but misguided viewpoint today, the book is very realistic about the necessity of suffering, and its transforming power.Finally, the book may be useful to authors wishing to flesh out the motivations and personalities of characters in their stories.In sum, the book is dangerously misleading at points, and a disappointment to readers who desire a truly Christian perspective; but a cautious and prayerful reader may be able to obtain something helpful."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"This is very popular among progressive and dwindling (in number and relevance) religious communities. There is no good reason to study this stuff. It is all naval gazing and does nothing to increase your love for God. The Church has linked this with New Age practices which it explicitly condemns. I have attended workshops about the Enneagram and I believe it is a big waste of time. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"I began reading this book with a certain eagerness, because not only had I attended a couple of Catholic retreats on the Enneagram, but my daughter was learning about it in her religion class at a Catholic High School. I love the concept of differing temperaments, and think that it is helpful in accepting others when we understand them better. Myer's-Briggs, the Enneagram, and Carl Jung all emphasize that our differences can enrich us rather than diminish us. And in all these approaches, the point seems to be that although we are all different, no one type is 'better' or 'worse' than any other type. So I was disappointed when I read the chapter on Twos. Richard Rohr had literally NOTHING positive to say about this type. He denied that Mother Teresa was a Two, although that is the designation other sources have given her. He even went so far as to claim that Twos are likely to suffer from 'Borderline Personality Disorder'! This is astonishing to me, and as a typical Two, my feelings were hurt. I am surprised that his editor, or someone did not object to this chapter of the book. It is clear that Fr. Rohr has had an unfortunate experience with at least one person close to him who was a Two, but I would think he would be able to discern that all Twos are not that bad, and that given the design of the Enneagram, it is unlikely that one type would be considered in the light of being so much more undesirable than any of the other types. I have liked other things by Richard Rohr, and this was a very off-putting book for me because it was so negative and judgmental. But I am a Two, and overly sensitive, so if you are a different type, you might really like it. He didn't seem to favor Sevens very much, either. So Sevens might also beware."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"This was a wonderfully well written and insightful book...explores the depths of the enneagram in relation to one's Christian life."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"This is a well written and extremely insightful book on a topic that will open eyes into understanding behavior and the motivation behind it.

Having said that, I now state that this book (for me, at least) has been the most helpful.Through the years, I have taken several tests and have been evaluated by an \\"expert\\". Results that seemed to fit - at the time - for other positions, were confusing because they did not resemble each other and did not continue to \\"fit\\" me after awhile. Although many sources instruct that the Nine will see herself in (nearly) all the positions, I was hesitant to accept this wisdom because the descriptions of Nine did not \\"fit like a glove\\".I read this book, literally without interruption, in two days. I am now firmly convinced that I belong in the Nine position on the enneagram. I do not know if clarity came from the language or style that was used; perhaps I am (finally!?) willing to consider thoughts about my approach to life and experiences from a clearly different approach.The authors do not provide a test to determine one's position on the enneagram. Instead, \\"we recommend that readers take another approach first: it makes sense to begin by reading through all nine descriptions. To some, it will be immediately clear where they are \\"at home\\". Others will need a little time. A good criterion is the following: if, in reading the description of a type, I get uneasy or am even humiliated, it could be that I am on home ground.\\"I found myself \\"uncomfortable\\" in many of the descriptions, but it was when I read the Nine description that I came to the humiliated part. I could resonate to the authors' earlier comment in the preface: \\"It seems that human beings cannot see what they are not readied to see. We cannot hear what we have not been prepared to hear. The 'obvious' seems to have little correlation with our acceptance of it\\".I am guilty as described; guilty, but encouraged. Now, I not only know my faults, strengths, and sins (there's that troubling word!), the authors provide insights and suggestions (based on Scripture and from their pastoral experience of many years) to change behaviours and thoughts to grow to personal maturity and development.The authors are very plain-spoken about the difficulties one may expect on this path: \\"After many years in pastoral care-giving, we are both convinced that there is nothing on which people are so fixated on as on their self-image. We are literally prepared to go through hell just so we don't have to give it up. It determines most of what we do or don't do, say or don't say, what we occupy ourselves with and what we don't. We're all affected by it\\". Each enneagram point experiences different challanges to this surrender.The discussions of the \\"instincts\\", \\"wings\\", and \\"arrows\\" are the clearest explanations of this vocabulary I have encountered and are a great aid in helping to distinguish one's enneagram point.If one approaches this book with humility and a true desire to know in order to grow, the tools of positive transformation are in their hands. I appreciate the fact that the authors use Scripture and illustrations from the life and ministry of Jesus without preaching from the proverbial soap-box. Their tactic is very much like a trusted physician who tells you what you need to know to become healthy or what changes need to be made to regain your health. Sometimes, it calls for a tweak in a lifestyle; sometimes, major surgery is required. \\"Whatever it takes\\" is the most beneficial attitude to the work suggested in this book."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: A Christian Perspective","review":"Richard Rohr makes the Enneagram easy to use for Christians and is very practical in its approach.

This book even looks at neighboring cultures and provides compare-and-contrast analyses so that the reader can see Nabatean lifestyle in context of the region in which they lived.Levy definitely did his homework before writing this book, and even looks at facts such as how much weight a camel can carry, and then deducing from this the total amount (cost-wise) of goods traders' caravan could carry across southwest Asia at the time (about a million dinars). This kind of attention to detail is most appreciated, and you will find it to be intriguing reading!!The only disappointment, albeit a minor one, was that the conclusion left much to be desired.

Previoulsy, Lenson had near commands of other ships and, in \\"China Sea\\", center-seated an obsolete destroyer on a covert sea war against modern-day pirates of the Pacific. In \\"Command\\", it's 1992, and Lenson masters a Tomahawk-armed missile destroyer, the USS Horn. With a mixed-gender crew, the Horn is something of a social-experiment at sea. Sent to mideastern waters to enforce the post-Desert Storm blockade against Saddam Hussein, Lenson will contend with smugglers and terrorists as well as more internal threats - vague ROE, friction caused by the presence of women aboard and outright hostility from colleagues. Unfortunately for Dan, his immediate supervisor is Admiral Niles - his boss from \\"Tomahawk\\". Though African-American, Niles has some intolerant views on women in combat - and considering the bad terms with which he and Dan parted ways, Niles's position bodes poorly for Lenson & The Horn. Following form from his other books, Poyer adds depth to his depiction of sea-life by creating a coterie of lower-echelon crewmembers whose lives will run parallel the intrigue of the larger story - from women sailors aboard the Horn to an American Muslim who runs investigations for NCIS in Bahrain. Departing from the other books, Poyer also gives us the terrorists themselves - especially a Sunni doctor who constructs especially deadly bombs for a certain, never-named organization (though we can guess) that cut its teeth driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan, and now may have Dan's new command in his sites. Lenson must balance these threats/issues while running Horn on a mission that includes blockade enforcement and possible attacks on Iraq.This is great stuff - it's not quite as unpredictable as \\"China Sea\\", but we see more of the crew's private lives than we had in other books. Poyer drops details from his other books, though they seem extraneous - neither advancing the plot nor hindering it for those who haven't read them. Though sometimes seeming abbreviated, Poyer still writes a meatier naval technothriller than anybody else. Poyer isn't afraid of using flawed, sometimes unlikable characters plagued by self-doubt and lacking cutting-edge technology - though \\"Command\\" actually gives us some techno-wizardry without getting in the way of our characters' personality.If \\"Command\\" has a flaw, it's that it creates too many threads without resolving them.

I'm retired Navy, and let me say that I would never want to serve with this guy: his ships always get hammered badly, or worse, sunk. Now about this book: once again we have a pretty good story line, but the character development beyond Henson is minimal. It would be a stretch to call some of them even two-dimensional, more a collection of stereotypes. The jargon is credible, with a couple of notable exceptions that fairly scream off the page. Similarly, especially for us nautical types, sometimes the terms are just ever-so-slightly misused. Not a big deal, but inconsistent with the otherwise solid approach. I felt that the subplot of women on combatants was never really developed to the extent that it deserved. Most of the women were cartoons, with little convincing explanation of their motivation. In fairness to the author, there are a lot of times in the service when one never learns much about his shipmates other than name, hometown, married status, and expected rotation date: that's due to the transient nature of the military, with 50% rotation annually. However, there are always some people that one gets to know intimately: for example, those who share the same GQ station, the same underway watch section, etc. In my experience, even the Captain, lonely though he is in command, normally has a pretty close relationship with three or four people (XO, Navigator, Chief Engineer, Ops Officer). Also, for anyone who's a first time reader of this series, there was little to provide background as to why Henson is so fiercely disliked by some of his seniors in the command chain. A bit more exposition would've been helpful. Overall, not as good as some in the series, but worth a read. Can't wait to see what Henson does next...career-wise, he'll be about due for a deep draft ship or a squadron command.

He won't be able to keep the Spruance thing going for long,they're starting to be scrapped! [EDIT 4/21/2008- Thanks to an alert commenter who points out that Poyer does in fact know the newer Perry class.]It's a good story, except right at the end, I felt he underplayed the effect of the nuclear blast - could the ship really have survived at all? And what about the heavy doses of radiation, his and others? And what was going to happen to the fallout plume? that stuff drifts....I think he set Dan up for a desk job - or maybe no more jobs!

Like all Poyer books, there is a lot of tension and suspense and you truly cannot put it down. On the other hand, the plot is not so skillfully executed. There are a lot of loose ends -- characters that just disappear, characters that are introduced with great fanfare and then kinda go back into the woodwork. I also found the ending unsatisfying. There is an exciting climax (no pun intended, given the subject) -- but then the author just abruptly ends the book without giving the reader closure on some items -- which I won't try to describe here so as not to spoil it.

However, it was like reading any other math book, which in my opinion, are totally useless. There was a lot of formulas and theory, which you do not need. I just want to know the mechanics of solving the problems. Theory takes up about half of the book, and only a few pages are used for describing examples.

There are a lot of things the military isn't telling Pres. Bush (but what would he know about military life, anyway?) This is a place where soldiers routinely get drunk, many smoke hash or even shoot drugs, and heterosexual promiscuity is rampant. And may you find mercy if you're even suspected of being gay.Even so, Hatheway felt relatively safe for a time as he met other gay men discreetly for sex at his unit in Bod Tolz, Germany, and elsewhere. Homosexual activity, he found, was more common than he first thought. Gays still had to be careful: there were several really gung-ho men who got wacked out about them. But if you didn't get caught, it wasn't all that bad.Unfortunately, that's what happened to Hatheway. Just days before he was due to be discharged, an enlisted man invited him to his room for a drink. A bottle of scotch later, they found themselves in a sexual situation. Nothing unusual, until one of the man's roommates barged in. Hatheway's entire future blew up before his eyes.His careful recounting of the subsequent ordeal is fascinating, particularly his allegations of military misconduct in the prosecution of the trial. If true (and we have no reason to believe they aren't), they're deeply disturbing. Hatheway was lucky he didn't end up at Leavenworth. Instead, he became a successful professor of German history at a college in Wisconsin.Someday America's gays and lesbians will be able to serve their country without having to sneak around. Look for it to happen in about 2025. But it may take a couple of generations after that before the American military stops treating them like it did Hatheway. The monster of homophobia isn't going to die an easy death in that super-macho atmosphere. I know."},{"Title":"Guilty As Charged: The True Story of a Gay Beret","review":"Jay Hatheway served with distinction for four years in the Army as a Green Beret -- the army's elite combat force. Jay was indistinguishable from his fellow Green Beret's in training, ability, dedication, and service. But there was one difference that the military establishment could not abide and which overrode all other aspects of Jay Hatheway's military career and performance -- he was a homosexual. In Guilty As Charged: The True Story Of A Gay Beret, Jay has candidly recorded his experiences while in service, including his court-martial, and his dedicated work in behalf of lesbians and gays concerned about their civil rights as men and women serving their country through military service. Guilty As Charged clearly and persuasively details the first constitutional challenge to the prohibition against homosexuality in the armed forces. Enhanced for the reader with footnotes and index, Guilty As Charged is a welcome, articulate, and much needed contribution to the on-going national dialogue on gays in the military and the constitutional issues involved with respect to one of the last bastions of state supported, federally sponsored discrimination. Highly recommended reading, Guilty As Charged puts a human face to a hot-button social issue, and in doing so well serves the entire military community, gay or straight."},{"Title":"Guilty As Charged: The True Story of a Gay Beret","review":"Riveting. This is author Jay Hatheway's story of the nation's first gay Green Beret court martial. Compelling. It happens to be a first person account, as defendent Hatheway, who survived those dark days, remembers the events surrounding the tragic injustice. Transcripts from the actual trial add immediacy to the \\"you are there\\" narration.There is an inclination to think of Jack Nicholson's despicable character in A Few Good Men, but Guilty As Charged is especially vile in that it lays bare the military's bent for public degradation and humiliation of a gay man -- by innuendo and inference. Hatheway's chiling story just quite possibly could have been our own. The telling is painfully detailed.Hatheway never denies to the reader that he has engaged in homosexual activities; the focus here is on the trumped up charges brought against him two decades before the Clinton compromise of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\\" In the military, fraternizing with subordinates is one matter of concern; sex between men -- actual or presumed -- is tantamount to treason.Now it's Hatheway's turn, and he takes us from the cool marble of boyhood infatuation to the companionship of flesh without fatigues that also defines \\"Special\\" Forces.

Browning was a serious poet; even in a poem filled with playful rhymes written specifically for children, he did not \\"dumb down\\" his language, but expected his readers to do a little work in understanding some of his \\"big words.\\"Kate Greenaway (1846-1901) was one of the most famous and popular illustrators of children's literature in the latter part of the 19th Century. She had grown up loving Browning's poem, and shortly before his death she requested and received his permission to republish it accompanied by her own illustrations. This edition was initially published in 1888 under the imprint of George Routledge & Sons, which was at that same time in the process of splitting between Routledge and Frederick Warne. Starting in 1889 all subsequent editions carried the Warne imprint. The book continued to be popular, and Frederick Warne has issued reprints from time to time, well into the late 20th Century. This Warne edition is not in print at present, but used copies with various reprint dates are available from Amazon Marketplace sellers.However, two different reprint editions are currently available, each with the complete original text and illustrations, and each presented with loving care from an eminently respectable publisher, in well-made but modestly priced editions. The Dover reprint (ISBN 0486296199) is full-size, in a sturdy paperback; the Alfred A Knopf/Borzoi/Everyman's Library reprint (ISBN 0679428127) is part of their Children's Classics series, in a very sturdily constructed hardcover with sewn sections that will not crack with use, but the page size is somewhat smaller. Both are beautiful books, and either is an excellent value.As noted in the Editorial Reviews above, there have been other editions of \\"The Pied Piper,\\" with different illustrations, and at least one seems to have been issued with the poem itself \\"retold\\" to make the language simpler; neither of those reviews is discussing this original version. Some readers may prefer one or another of these different versions. But anyone wanting to stick with Browning's original full text and Greenaway's original charming, muted and subtle illustrations should choose between the Dover or the Everyman's, or visit Amazon's Marketplace sellers to look for a copy of the Frederick Warne."},{"Title":"The pied piper of Hamelin,","review":"BUY THIS BOOK!!

Kate Greenaway, noted children's illustrator, has created a magical world of beautiful children, innocent faces, and romantic, nostalgic costumes. The colors on these pages are breathtaking, and the details (although Greenaway is always faulted for not drawing hands and feet well) are superb. This story is not for very young children, as it contains some troublesome themes. For the older child, perhaps 7+, the story might provoke some interesting post-read family discussions about honesty, trust, and the actual state of the children at the end of the tale. This is even a beautiful book to give to adults, as the messages about human nature can be appreciated on a deeper level."},{"Title":"The pied piper of Hamelin,","review":"When you look at the preview of this book under the \\"Kindle\\" tab, all those great 19th century color illustrations are there, and they are goreous. It is at least half the reason I decided to get this editon rather than looking for it in a Robert Browning \\"Complete Works\\". I know, its free, so what's the big deal. The problem is that I see the Kindle, especially in color, is a great tool for delivering books to kids, and there are other similar classic kids books where all the great illustrations are there, intact. And, this is faulty marketing. It is promoting something you do not get. Again, I know, it's free. But I'm still disappointed, and you will be too, if you want the classic art work for children."},{"Title":"The pied piper of Hamelin,","review":"This is the &quot;orginal&quot; version of the classic story. Browning's poem is much less a children's tale about a rat catcher than a brilliant study of human psychology, salesmanship, and charisma.

Browning's nuances, combined with the older language and somewhat sparse illustrations, makes this book much better suited for adults than younger children."},{"Title":"The pied piper of Hamelin,","review":"I picked up this book because it was mentioned in another book I read recently (The Mark Of The Angel).

I know I'd heard the title many times...so my curiosity got the best of me. Well...I've read it. It's a simple fifteen minute read...but worth re-reading another time.

I think I'll gift it to my nephew who will be turning 8 years old on November 2nd.

Few other children's picture books tell a story in Victorian poetry. The book isn't just original; it is excellent. I have always enjoyed Robert Browning's poetry, and this is no exception. I was surprised at how easy it was to read this book compared to some of Browning's other verse, and it was pleasing to read, especially considering that this is focused toward children. I loved all of the poetic techniques used by Browning. His iambic tetrameter in couplets works very well for young readers, and I loved his use of anaphora and internal rhyme. The story is, of course, brilliant. It is the usual folk tale that every child has heard and needs to hear. It teaches its lesson, and Browning's version is even more entertaining than other versions. Also, the illustrations by Kate Greenway are fabulous. It is impossible to imagine this story in Browning's Victorian verse without Greenway's Victorian artistry.

If you are new to this movie style the first chapter, What is 'Noir'?, explains the fascination with the themes, archetypes, visual iconography and dialogue. The other chapters expand on these main points.I was, though, rather disappointed with this book, Alain Silver has done it before with his definitive text book 'Film Noir: An encyclopaedic reference to the American style' (ISBN 0517464675) and also with his photo book 'The Noir Style' (ISBN 0879517220) a beautiful coffee-table title with film stills and long captions revealing the essence of these great movies.Other disappointments include a rather narrow focus on mainly ten movies, Criss Cross, Detour, Double Indemnity, Gun Crazy, In a Lonely Place, Kiss me Deadly, Out of the Past, The Reckless Moment, T-Men and Touch of Evil, which unfortunately does not include The Asphalt Jungle (OK, it's my favorite). No index, I really would expect one in this kind of book. The production, though beautifully printed, all the text is white out of black and I find this gets tiresome eventually, especially the tiny type of the Chronology and Bibliography, not to mention that printed matt black shows up finger marks easily.I think the book is really only worth having as collection of movie stills and at the price is probably reasonable value.***FOR A LOOK INSIDE click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Film Noir","review":"I am new to film noir, and I really enjoyed this book. Although it seems simply laid out, there is a lot of information in the book. When I bought the book, I didn't want to learn about every last noir film that has been made. I just wanted an overview of the genre and some key themes. I have read some essays on film noir, and found them difficult to understand. But this book organizes the subject in an easy-to-understand way. If you're new to this genre, I would recommend this book. However, if you've watched a lot of noir films, Alain Silver's other books, such as \\"Film Noir Reader\\" and \\"Encyclopedia of Film Noir\\" would be more suitable."},{"Title":"Film Noir","review":"\\"Film Noir\\", by noir scholars and pundits Alain Silver and James Ursini, is slick and pretty. I enjoyed reading through it and admiring the photos from some of my favorite films. It's certainly not a bad book, but I wonder who the target readership is. \\"Film Noir\\" isn't comprehensive enough to be a good introductory text, and it doesn't contain anything that readers with a basic understanding of the film noir movement don't already know. Maybe it's just supposed to be attractive. In that, the book succeeds. Its 9 3/4\\" x 8\\" cover is a thick, nicely bound and printed paperback. Inside are attractive black crepe endpapers and 192 slick black pages filled with over 180 (mostly black-and-white) photos and white-on-black text. You may want to wash your hands before cracking this book open. The problem of oily fingerprints on the shiny black pages is significant. The photographs are reproduced nicely, primarily shots from classic noir films with some publicity stills and behind-the-scenes photos mixed in. The photos are 2-to-a-page, full page, and 2-page spreads, all with captions.After the obligatory \\"What is Noir?\\" introductory chapter, Silver and Ursini break film noir down into 10 categories or motifs, dedicating a chapter to each one: \\"The Perfect Crime\\", \\"The Fatalistic Nightmare\\", \\"The Burden of the Past\\", \\"The Caper Film\\", \\"Docu-Noir\\", \\"Love on the Run\\", \\"Male Violence\\", \\"Women in Film Noir\\", \\"The Private Eye\\", and \\"The Darkness and Corruption\\". The authors say a little about each motif and choose one film to represent it. In each chapter or category, we get an analysis of the film, discussion of its origins, and a bio of its director. The photographs are from the film being discussed as well as other films that share the motif. All of the text, including photo captions and quotations, is white on black background. This looks spiffy, but it may be difficult for some people to read. So we have a somewhat cursory discussion of 10 film noir motifs and 10 films, focusing on the classic era. That is followed, in the back of the book, by a chronology of the artistic movements and significant works related to film noir and a filmography of the films discussed. \\"Film Noir\\" is fun. Noir buffs may enjoy the pictures. It's just not especially useful."},{"Title":"Film Noir","review":"I got a copy of this book as a gift (had I paid for it, I might have to deduct half a star), and it contains illustrations which I have never seen elsewhere. Those alone have some value. The problem with the Taschen approach is that it is not only multi-lingual but sometimes seems to be lowest common denominator as well. At this point in their long career of writing about noir, it's interesting to see a distilled text from the authors; but I must agree that in terms of analytical depth, it doesn't quite measure up to their book on \\"The Noir Style\\" or their anthology \\"Film Noir Reader\\" series.

It was much more of an in-depth study of the love of God than I expected. MacArthur doesn't just do an overview, briefly covering the classic texts like \\"God is Love\\" and \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son...\\" and then wrap it up with a little devotional on love. This book is much, much more than that.This book is instead a carefully constructed study which begins with an overview of God's love as viewed in recent church history, the contemporary church, and even the unbelieving world. From there, MacArthur covers the biblical theology of love as seen in God's character, compares the love of God toward believers and unbelievers, and then in the cross, the ultimate proof of God's love.No MacArthur book would be complete without at least a little bit of controversy. In chapter 3, MacArthur uses the story of the reluctant prophet Noah and the city of Nineveh to begin to reveal the love of God pictured in both his goodness and his wrath, how God can both love and hate humanity at the same time. Here, in his own unique style, MacArthur begins to confront the less than biblical views of such great authors as A.W. Pink and many who today have, in MacArthur's opinion, an unbiblical view of how and who God loves. I found this part of MacArthur's book the most revealing and informative.MacArthur builds his case by thoroughly establishing important biblical points like the severity of God by covering God's inflexible justice, irresistible power, infinite mercy, and inconceivable righteousness. Then he quickly moves to addressing wrong questions about God, wrong perspectives of God, hard questions about God's love, and faulty views of God's providence. Then he finally begins to lay out the biblical truth that God does have a universal love for all of his creation, all of humanity, and not just the elect. No, he is not teaching Universalism! But he is showing that God does love both unbelievers and believers, just like John 3:16 says. He just doesn't love them both alike.Most Christians struggle with this part of the doctrine of Divine love more than they are willing to admit. \\"God loves those who reject Jesus Christ?\\" \\"But doesn't the Bible say that God loved Jacob and hated Esau?\\" Can both really be true? This is why MacArthur's book is such a worthwhile read. It contains both the expected as well as the unexpected.In chapters 6 and 7, MacArthur narrows his focus down to two of the most important points in this impressive study on the love of God. He calls those chapters The Love of God for Humanity and The Love of God for His Elect, respectively. This is where he ties his premise that God does have a sincere and genuine love for all of humanity and an absolutely awesome love for his chosen, his elect. According to Macarthur, too many today do not understand how this can be true and have strayed from the biblical doctrine of God's love to a more anthropocentric (man-centered) explanation in an attempt to answer those tough \\"How can a God of love do this or allow that?\\" questions. That's dangerous as it misrepresents who God is. MacArthur admonishes us to just stick with what scripture says!MacArthur closes his study with a chapter entitled Finding Security in the Love of God. He uses the parable of the Prodigal Son to illustrate God's amazing and long suffering love and then shows the reader the doctrine using the Apostle Paul's 8th chapter of Romans. MacArthur's conclusion: \\"Nothing can separate us (the elect) from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\\"MacArthur includes four great appendices in the latter part of the book as an additional treat. Each appendix is an excerpt from a renowned pastor or theologian of the past as a practical application of his own teaching. Men like Glasgow pastor and professor of theology Thomas Chalmers, pastor and writer Andrew Fuller from England, noted Scottish pastor and author Thomas Boston, and Scottish preacher John Brown. MacArthur's book also contains End Notes, Scripture Index, and a Subject Index.I guarantee you will be blessed, challenged and maybe even initially angered or taken back a little by some of the material in MacArthur's book. Like I said earlier, it wouldn't be a MacArthur book if it didn't have a little of all of these. This is not a book to skim through, nor is it one to take lightly. It has already dramatically broadened my perspective on evangelism and the greatness of God and his magnificent divine love.I'm sure there are other good books on the subject of God's love. Some devotional studies and some scholarly attempts to cover this subject. If you're looking for a biblically sound and easy to read and understand book, I don't think you can do any better than Pastor John MacArthur's fine presentation."},{"Title":"The Love of God: He Will Do Whatever It Takes to Make Us Holy","review":"This book is wonderful in that it explains God's love.

Thank you Brien Young"},{"Title":"The Love of God: He Will Do Whatever It Takes to Make Us Holy","review":"A reformed cousin of mine lent me this book over a decade ago to help me as I was wrestling with the issues of God's love and reformed theology. If you are not reformed and your mind has been shaped by a love of God that encompasses all mankind (i.e. something akin to Arminianism), you will not only remain unconvinced, but wonder what the point of such a book was. In my case, it only confirmed that reformed theology still hasn't come up with a satisfying way of explaining unconditional predestination in a way that makes his offer of salvation to all people a genuine offer or in a way that comports with God's love. The view of love put forth by McArthur, while mainstream reformed, is one of the most repulsive doctrines I have ever come across. If the average person is born into sin by the will of God and cannot get out of it, then it is hard to believe that in any sense God can be said to love that person if he does nothing to help him.In my own view, the only non-reformed person who will be convinced that such a view of God's love is true is if they become convinced that this interpretation is actually in the Bible. The book may be one way to make sense of the Biblical material, but does not satisfy the philosophical questions. McArthur does nothing to make the reformed understanding of God's love more palatable. I would love to see reformed theologians put forth a defense of the love of God that also made his goodness evident to non-reformed believers."},{"Title":"Autour De LA Litterature: Ecriture Et Lecture Aux Cours Moyens De Francais : Instructor's Edition","review":"I needed this book for a college level class and I feel that as textbooks go there are definitely better and clearer ones out there. I felt like I had to struggle to understand a lot of the poetry and the stories. I had to keep a French/English dictionary fairly close by at all times. It could have been the class and the professor (both of which I didn't care much for either) but I really struggled in this French class to make sense of the lessons.Also, it's a fairly expensive book and you don't get too much out of it. The CD is great to listen along with to help with your speaking, but really it's just reading some of the poems in the book. If you're buying this on your own I'd suggest you keep looking for something that will help you individually. If you, like me, are using it for class buy it used or rent it.

You begin to think that something like that *may* happen, but won't coz, youknow, we're all used to sloppy endings. But it all fits. The pace of the story works well. Topics raised by the book also keep you thinking, and it still has that bit of strange magical happenings that we expect from Isobel's writing.I throughly enjoyed it.

If you like this series, you'll definately be up thinking about the twist ending long after you finished reading the actual book! This book starts with Kate, Cooper, and Annie's final challenges. They are asked to pull a sheet of paper out of the box and complete the challenge on it. Based on how well they complete their challenges decides whether or not they will be invited to the initation. In other happening, Annie and Cooper go to New Orleans, while Kate stays behind working on her make-up science project with the unbearable Sherrie. When Annie and Cooper get back they are all prepared for their final class at Crones Circle. Cooper is extremely confident they will all be witches next year and their circle will not be broken. After presenting their challenges and how they completed or had not completed them they are asked one at a time to proceed into the back room where Archer will tell them whether or not they are asked to the initation. As Cooper, Annie, and Kate walk in confident they will become witches together, they are faced with the cruel reality that one in their circle might not be ready to be a witch."},{"Title":"Circle of Three #14: The Challenge Box","review":"As the second to last book in the \\"Circle of Three\\" series, our three witches-in-training are on the last leg before their initiation. Kate, Annie and Cooper have nearly completed the year-and-a-day of study in the field of modern witchcraft, and now only one last challenge awaits them: the aptly named Challenge Box.The Box is filled with a number of paper slips, each with a task on it that the girls are required to complete - without telling the others what their individual task is. They have two weeks to understand and complete their challenges before reporting back to the study group - and the speculation of the coven. If Sophia, Archer and the other leaders decide their tasks are completed then they will be prepared for initiation. If not, then they will have to continue their studies indefinitely.Each girl tackles the problems by themselves. Kate's task is to \\"Answer the question that has no answer.\\" Utterly baffled by this, Kate is further upset when her parents forbid her in accompanying Annie and Cooper on their holiday to New Orleans. Instead she must work on fixing up her failing grade in her science class. After a confrontation with her nemesis Sherrie left her with a fail, Kate is given a second chance to make it up. At the same time, she's found herself on the last stage of convincing her parents that her involvement in Wicca is an unchangeable component of her life - but maybe in this conflict is the key to solving her challenge.Meanwhile, Annie is grappling with her challenge: \\"Give away your most precious possession.\\" Realising that it probably doesn't mean material possessions, Annie puzzles over the challenge on her way to New Orleans, where she is meeting her elder sister for the first time. Juliet was adopted long before Annie's birth, and up until a few months ago Annie wasn't even aware of her existence. And again, the events occurring in her lifetime may be directly involved with the meaning of her challenge.Lastly, Cooper is stuck with \\"Face your greatest fear.\\" So far, she's been having too much of a good time in New Orleans to give it much thought, but figures that the challenges of performing on stage and eating crawfish have something to do with it.Within the entire series of \\"Circle of Three\\", this entry is one of the better ones. Isobel Bird manages to juggle all three of the girls' discoveries without neglecting one in particular, and although the Box's purpose as an accurate gauge for judging what girls are ready and what ones aren't are a bit dubious, the book does manage to end on a rather surprising final note.As always, some things bothered me: Annie wandering off alone in the middle of Mardi Gras for one thing (is she aware of the dangers in doing that?!) and the rather pathetic audience that supposedly \\"howled with laughter\\" at Cooper's improvisation on stage - it's funny, but it's not *that* funny.But Bird also treats Kate's relationship with the Catholic Church respectfully (unlike the more one-sided view she took in \\"Second Sight\\" and \\"The Five Paths\\") and miraculously gives us a *nice* representation of a Catholic priest. Also, she asks the fundamental question of life: what do you believe? Her ideas and musings on this question left me thinking - something I certainly didn't expect from these books!"},{"Title":"Circle of Three #14: The Challenge Box","review":"The challenge box is a strange thing. It's a small box filled with slips of paper which have certain challenges written onto it that Kate, Cooper, and Annie have to take in order to become initiated. Each of them has a challenge but it may be harder to complete than they ever imagined. Kate find herself plagues with questions that challenge her faith and beliefs. She wants to become a witch but is she ready? She's faced with another challenge when she's forced to work on yet another project with Sherrie, the girls she despises the most. Annie has finally meet her older sister in New Orleans and she and Cooper are immersed in the rich culture of New Orleans. But there's a question in the back of Annie's mind. Will he sister accept her if she knew she was Wiccan? And Cooper finds herself facing many things that she's uncomfortable or afraid of. Will she have the courage to face her greatest fear?It's sad to see that such a great series is going to be over after I finish up the next book. But as they say all good things come to an end. The Challenge Box was yet another entertaining story about the three girls facing tough questions and making hard decisions about life. And the ending is quite a shocker too. I agree with whoever said it was a cruel place to leave us fans but it was quite an ending. Everyone who has been a fan of this series should read this book. I have the 15th and final book.

The book starts out with Kate, Annie, and Cooper each picking a challenge out of the challenge box. Obviously, none of them understood their challenges. They all hoped that their trip to New Orleans to visit Annie's newly found sister will help them.At the last minute, Kate's parents forbid her to go, after her big science project blow with Sherrie. All the girls feel auful, but life goes on. On their last night together, Cooper gives Kate a box of gifts to open while they were gone. And believe me, that box was full of surprises.Annie and Cooper encounter many, many surprises down in New Orleans. Including voodoo, a strange woman, a terrible case of stage fright, and the best food the girls have ever tasted!!!When the girls get back to Beecher Falls, they've all figured out their challenges, after probably the hardest week of their lives. The story takes a shocking and terrible twist when the girls take their challenges to class and find out who is going to participate in the initiation.

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else, and really is the essence of the story - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\\" (p.223 Penguin Classics, London:2000). For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"E.M. Forster does a remarkable job of illustrating the constricting social values of Edwardian England with humor and acute insight. Our heroine must decide: go along and get along or shirk her \\"dutites\\" and chose a life of remarkable rebellion (for the time).You'll want your own trip to Italy when you're through reading! One of my absolute favorites."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"In A Room with a View, E.M. Forster infuses a formulaic plot with rich characters and social commentary to create an eloquent insight into the human condition. Forster's gift for detailed character description and subtle sarcasm are prominently displayed as he describes protagonist Lucy Honeychurch's transformation from virtuous, obedient girl to vivacious, independent woman.A Room with a View was first published in 1908, at a time when the British Empire was at its apex. The stereotypical images of high British society - proper tea parties, cultured conversation, and mild-mannered ladies- were still commonplace. However, a cultural revolution was taking shape. Women were beginning to challenge their role as symbols of modesty and decorum, while socialists and other freethinkers criticized the insular, intolerant views of the upper class.In the midst of this rising movement of innovation, young Lucy Honeychurch takes a sightseeing tour of Italy. Raised in sheltered comfort at her estate in Surrey, England, Lucy is dutiful, submissive, and subconsciously able to suppress her own feelings in order to please others. In Florence, Lucy meets George Emerson, a passionate, spontaneous man with radical ideas on life. After a brief romantic encounter, Lucy returns to England, feeling confused and strangely dejected. Her sense of propriety outweighs her emotions, however, and soon she is engaged to a well connected, self-important man named Cecil. Cecil exemplifies the haughtiness and superficiality of the upper class. Forster describes him as, \\"Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness\\" (100).As Lucy and her snooty fianc&eacute;e prepare for their wedding, George moves into a nearby villa. His reappearance sparks both feelings of love and contempt in Lucy, who vows to ignore him and devote herself to Cecil. But confrontation is unavoidable, and in their few moments alone, George inspires Lucy to break off the engagement with Cecil. He tells her, \\"Every moment of his [Cecil's] life he's forming you, telling you what's charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of your own\\" (191). Lucy realizes the truth in his statement, but is so distraught, that she rejects both Cecil and George. It takes a heartfelt speech by George's father and a great deal of soul searching before Lucy realizes that she needs George. After all, he is the catalyst that starts Lucy down her path of self-discovery.While the plot of A Room with a View is similar to other period romance novels, such as those by Jane Austen and the Bronte's, Forster's didactic style and witty sarcasm lift the book above the standard. Forster includes comments like, \\"But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and - so illogical are girls - the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done\\" (137). This quote highlights Forster's love of humor and cynicism, but it also brings up another issue that sets him apart from his peers. Forster is a man writing about a topic that is typically covered by women. While his views may be biased at times, his perspective adds a unique element to the genre.Even more amazing, is Forster's ability to portray a young woman's personal and emotional rebirth with such understanding and clarity. Lucy is a complex character who continually struggles with outside influences and her own beliefs. All of her emotional battles are internal, but Forster records them so beautifully that they are just as exciting to read as any external action. For example, he writes, \\"Some emotion - pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong - seized her, and she was aware of autumn. Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring...The scales fell from Lucy's eyes\\" (193-94). Although Forster is a man, he captures the sprit of a woman in his words.E.M. Forster's story expressively highlights human nature, personal growth, and free will through the development of Lucy Honeychurch. Forster has the remarkable ability to be sarcastic one moment and poetic the next. Ultimately, it is his unique style and character development that make A Room with a View an incomparable novel."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Forster's indicment of Victorian England is not as enjoyable as Howard's End or A Passage to India. However his direct style and story telling ability is still preferrrable to some of his British contemporaries.The story centers around that of the ruling gentry and their contempt for anyone a little different from themslves. Interestingly enough Forster's most booring characters seem to be the Anglican clerics who are more interested in gossip and self importance that serving their constituents.The novel begins in Florence admidst the many treasures that adorn that City and concludes in the beautiful English countryside. The hero, Lucy, is embarrassed by her own attraction to the Emersons's, Father and Son, who are clearly not of her class. She is encouraged by her stuufy cousin and a couple of old maids who are staying at the same hotel to avoid the Emersons. Mr. Emerson is a true romantic and his style is much to direct for their comfort and his quiet son George is much too gloomy.Lucy is so taken off balance by young George Emerson that she cuts short her stay in Florence and flees to Rome and then home. At home she becomes engaged to a dull and pretentious man who her Mother and brother dislike.By coincidence the Emerson's let a house from Lucy's fiance and Lucy is confronted with George. Through a series of events,Lucy finally comes to grips with the feelings she has fought so hard to repress."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"E.M.

It's just so much better - the psychology of the characters is much more realistic, the conventions of society are satirized much more aptly. Furthermore, this book is very funny at the right places while still being morally serious.

Lucy wants to rebel against the many rules that govern her conduct, but she is torn. She loves her mother and brother, and wants the admiration of her social set, but she finds so many of these people tiresome and hypocritical. I was struck by how frequently the title phrase is mentioned. There are the obvious references to her room at the pension in Florence and to the view from the salon at her home in England. But Forster also explores the \\"view\\" of one's acquaintances vs the reality of their inner core. It's when this second way of looking at things (pun intended) comes into play that the novel really got interesting for me.I did find the middle section - from the time Lucy and Charlotte left for Rome to Lucy's epiphany regarding George and Cecil - somewhat slow going.

I think I am going to have to dust off the movie and watch it sometime in the near future.I did enjoy this quote from the book: \\"A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood - a rebel who desired not a wider dwelling room, but equality beside the man she loved.

Some fiction achieves a status like Holy Writ. This novel might.The central characters in >A Room With a View&lt; are as follows.1) Lucy Honeychurch:a. \\"I can't think,\\" Lucy said gravely.b. Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.c. She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the armies ofthe benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and marchto their destiny by catchwords.In short, Lucy is searching for a point of view, a sense of self.2) Cecil Vyse;a. Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful manshould.b.

Light and beauty enveloped her.3) \\"Courage!\\" cried her companion. \\"Courage and love!\\"4) George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment, he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He stepped forward and kissed her.Lucy's \\"muddle\\" finally reaches its climax.

If you're not used to reading pieces from this period, you may need to warm up to the style, but once you do, you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"When A ROOM WITH A VIEW was first published in 1908, the sun had not yet set on the British Empire. The Victorian Age was coming to a creaking end, but for most English, life went on pretty much as it had been for the last half century. But under the priggishness that was the remnant of old-style prudery, cracks were appearing in the hidebound and stuffy proper British upper-class morality. Women were starting to clamor for rights. The lower classes wanted more of the economic pie that once belonged unquestionably to that of the upper. Amidst all these nascent changes, E. M. Forster wrote A ROOM WITH A VIEW to satirize gently the entire spectrum of proper British morality that was becoming increasingly clear was not so proper after all.Lucy Honeychurch is your typical Victorian young lady visiting Italy in the vain hopes that she can \\"broaden\\" her vistas, a process that Forster thinks clearly is so much rubbish. Accompanying her is Charlotte Bartlett, an equally stereotypical chaperone whose business it is to keep Lucy from having too good a time. In Italy, they rent a room that they do not like. In the room adjacent is the father and son Emerson family who graciously offer to swap rooms. The stern Miss Bartlett promptly exhibits her social snobbishness by thinking the Emersons are low class clods. The younger Emerson, George, likes Lucy but her higher standing on the social pecking order, discourages him from forming a liaison. Lucy and Ms. Bartlett return to England where Lucy becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly dislikable sort but whose high social standing makes him a perfect choice for Lucy. George winds up in England and learns of Lucy's engagement, which he encourages her to break. After much soul searching, she sees that Cecil is a pompous buffoon and marries George.A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lesser book in scope than A PASSAGE TO INDIA and a much lighter in tone work than HOWARD'S END, but in its gentle satire and in Forster's ability not to take anything too seriously, he has recreated a world of stuffiness that stands revealed in a comic manner that still manages to address such sobering issues as woman's rights and class snobbery. This is a fine book that sheds some much need perspective on an era that not many see as humorous."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I have read \\"A Room with a View\\" about six times. It is a mystery to me why I enjoy it so much. I love the descriptions of Italy and the sense of humor that Forster imbues all his characters with. I feel that Lucy and Cecil represent the tendencies within each of us to escape intimacy and 'real feelings' under the guise of social suave.I also think I know about five Miss Barretts. Forster also captures the essense of the supremely annoying old spinster who 'doesn't want to trouble anyone' and her tragic beauty."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"E. M. Forster's novels just don't wear-out. Reading a classic such as A ROOM WITH A VIEW is the perfect book to prove the point. The form and story has been rewritten by many modern authors, but this original is still the best and on top of must reads before I/you die. The setting makes you want to escape to quickly book a wonderful view. Return to this classic, soon."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room with a View is a wonderful, gossipy book that teaches more than one life essential moral. Lucy, a young woman who finds herself battling with society's expectations, teaches the reader many of these morals as she discovers them herself. Throughout the course of the book, Lucy strives to take a more independent path in which she can follow her heart with passion. The role of social classes is quite significant as it teaches one to not be judgmental or conformed to the rules of society. Forster does an excellent job developing his characters page by page. Miss Bartlett, Lucy's society-driven cousin, becomes Forster's most interesting and mysterious character by the end of the book. Both George and Mr. Emerson, a father and son first introduced in Italy who are of lower class, also become more deeply engaging characters as the book becomes more and more addicting. Part I of A Room with a View takes place in Italy where art, music, love, and society's expectations all emerge. After reaching Part II there was no putting down the book. I became enthralled in the gossip of love, truth, society, and morals. Lucy battles with the ideals she was brought up with and society's pressure as she strives for independence, passion, and true love. A Room with a View is the type of book that makes one feel good after reading it. This romantic book is full with gossip and morals that is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face and warm anyone's heart."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room With A View is one of those light-hearted yet serious books that starts out slowly, begins to warm up, and becomes wonderful toward the end -- leaving one with a warm, happy glow. On the surface, it is a very simple book with a very simple plot and theme -- forbidden love. Indeed, it is not the plot that makes the book so enjoyable; it is the style and the characters. Outside of fiction, E. M. Forster is also well-known for essays on various aspects of literature; he also taught in the English university system. This becomes clear throughout the course of the book; he writes like a literature professor. This accounts for both the slow start and the eventual charm. Always a clever writer (though occasionally too self-consciously so), with tongue never too far from cheek, Forster can definitely turn a phrase -- the penultimate paragraph to one of the later chapters, on Lucy's \\"surrender,\\" is bone-chillingly good --, and the book is written in a generally light-hearted, jovial way. As another reviewer pointed out, he almost seems to be making fun of his characters at times. Clearly a social critic at heart, Forster shows how what seem like earth-shattering tragedies to Lucy -- the prim, upper-crust heroine -- are, at best, but ripples in the pool. Despite the recurring \\"tragedies,\\" the mood never gets too dark and heavy; light-hearted chapter titles help perpetuate this feeling. This raises the book above countless similarly-plotted novels. Forster after all created the concept of \\"flat\\" and \\"round\\" characters, and as anyone familiar with the terms knows, the former is not a pejorative. Forster stressed that a novel needs both to be balanced and true-to-life. This indeed has them: Lucy, the well-rounded, life-accurate heroine who lives, breathes, and grows; Cecil, the walking caricature. Forster's social criticism must also be remarked on once more. In this social comedy, he deflates Edwardian England's puffed-up, self-important upper-class values and leaves us both charmed and amused. The book's deeper element lies here, as he enlightens us about the hypocrisy and xenophobia. His point should not be missed. These elements come together to bring about a delightful, pleasant, and short read that is likely to please most anyone. This is a well-deserved classic."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room With a View is a lovely novel, and this is a lovely little inexpensive paperback version. A love story set amidst \\"class issues,\\" this story may seem slow to a reader who expects fireworks or major excitement, but if you allow the story and characters to unfold before you, you will be taken in and carried along for a delightful, romantic, charming tale. This book contains several of my favorite characters in all of British literature. So take a pleasant journey to Florence and on to Windy Corner, and I think you'll enjoy your trip."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room with a View by E. M. Forster. Published by MobileReference (mobi).'A Room with a View' depicts a young Englishwoman's adventure trying to come to grips with the conflict between her desires and society's expectations.

This classic is a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure that you will love it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"After I saw the 1985 Merchant Ivory film, I was curious about the book. Its not often that the film is as good as the book, but in this it was, so faithfully adapted. When I got the book after seeing the film, I felt I was seeing the film again while reading, the film was sooo faithful to all the key plot and character points in the book and many of the minor ones too. Whether you've seen the film or not, definitely read the book as well. There are one or two typos but its very readable. This is one of my favorite romantic novels, and whats so great about it is that its not a stereotypical \\"romance novel\\", its for guys as well. Read it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room With A View is a novel not only about the journey to find true love, but also about the difficult decisions one is faced with when one must decide to either listen to the expectations of others, or their own heart. In this novel the main character, Lucy takes a trip to Italy with her cousin, and upon her arrival meets the Emerson's. Lucy belonging to the upper class of society thinks she could never have an attraction to someone of the lower class, like the Emerson's. Love was something Lucy was hoping to find in Italy, but as soon as she arrived back to her home in England she promptly became engaged to Cecil, a man of the same social class as her. Lucy soon realizes that she is not truly in love with Cecil, and discovers that she is in love with George Emerson. Everyone Lucy knows expects her to marry someone wealthy and proper, like Cecil, but instead of listening to what others expect of her, Lucy listens to her heart, and allows herself to be in love with George. Throughout Lucy's journey to find true love Forster conveys the message that others expectations cannot guide one to the path of love, only one's heart can. I recommend this book to anyone who struggles when faced with making the decision of following others expectations, or following their heart. This novel will teach its readers that what one truly desires is the only escape to genuine happiness."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Forster's social satire is both poignant and whimsical - a pleasure to read.

You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is the first E.M. Forester book I've read and it affected me greatly. When I write 'reviews', I don't mean to give a traditional book review, but to note how the book affected my real life.This is how: One of the characters, Cecil, is a bit of a snob and looks down on the common homey interests of his betrothed's family. He is good with books,art, ideas and 'things', but when he interacts with real people, his personality 'kills' any chance of having an intimate relationship and thus, his life is one of ideas rather than people.How fiction unwraps itself and reveals itself to be true! This was looking into a mirror for me. What my friends won't tell me, a good novel will! Doing well with \\"books, ideas and things\\" is not the epicenter of living, says Forester, but the nitty gritty give and take of affectionate living is where life's eruption takes place. Art and ideas and books, although glorious, arise from this center, not vice versa. First comes the flesh, then the idea.Thus this 'old' book, written over 100 years ago, performs the magic of all good literature: it makes me act and think differently. I now, attempt to(!), treat the person who stands before me, not as an idea, but as another real, carbon-based life form!\\"A Room With A View\\" tells the often told story of a young person learning to stand in her own place rather than where society demands she stand, yet Forester's characters are so complete that this old story is like a skeleton that is dressed up in finery and begins to walk! I fell in love with the characters and recognized myself in all of them; yes, even in the old biddy Charlotte, who, as it turns out, wasn't so old fashioned and possibly was the master puppeteer."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I've often heard complaints about classic novel's transition into digital format, but in the case of A Room with a View, there should be no complaints. I've read this novel both in print and digital forms and can say that the reading experience was not lessened on my Kindle than my old print copy. For anyone interested in reading a truely classic piece of literature, I recommend trying this book. I find it to be a funny piece of fiction with realistic characters to the time period. As a free digital copy you have nothing to lose."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"At 36, I finally discovered the Edwardian, Bildungsroman romance that every woman I know apparently read several times when they were 17 & 18 years old. It is sweet and transcendental. Forster's generally upbeat take on propriety and class differences makes this probably his most loved and most approachable novel. His characters are symbols, but also very real and very transformative. heroine Lucy is often muddled, and her antithesis (and for for much of the novel her fiance) Cecil isn't just a static foil, but ends up being fairly dynamic.One of my favorite quotes from the novel is, spoken by George (I believe):\\"There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,\\" he continued in measured tones. \\"We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place where you won't do harm--yes, choose a place where you won't do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.\\"Reading the novel makes me appreciate the fine job done by theMerchant & Ivory adaption(from 15 years ago) even more."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This has always been one of my favourite novels, simply a joy to read. I've read all of Forster's books and in my opinion this is his best. Quite funny: who can't help but laugh at lines like: \\"Then never- never- never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.\\" And the characters are priceless- Lucy, George, poor Cecil- and the entire theme is just so fresh... Wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This book, written in 1908, is enwrapped with the then-stereotypical clash of the British castes. In this book, a young British Brahman woman, Lucy Honeychurch, must decide whether to marry wealthy Cecil Vyse or follow her heart after the young and buff, but socially crass (to them but not to us 21st century Americans), George Emerson.Cecil dislikes most everyone, because they are not as gifted or talented as he. And, George - as well as his father Mr. Emerson - ignore the innuendo and scofflaw-like attitudes thrown in their direction by Cecil and people with whom he associates. In fact, when discovering Lucy's engagement to Cecil, George flatly (and out of character) responds, \\"You cannot live with Vyse. . . He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" This sentence is so out of context with his character's dialogue throughout the remainder of the book. But, perhaps more true to the character, it describes his emotions about Lucy and his main competitor for her heart.Lucy is torn between two lovers. She is in what Mr. Emerson describes to be in a \\"muddle.\\" Much of the muddle has been exaggerated by her meddling spinster cousin, Charlotte, and Charlotte's poor choice of a friend, Eleanor Lavish. But, to her credit, she thinks the situation through, and makes a decision which she enjoys, but which most around her do not understand.Forster's dialogue reminds me greatly of Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, or either Austen. The prim respectability often reads constrained when emotions of anger or hatred are expressed. But, the richness of the dialogue and depth of insight for the main characters are masterfully done. That is why this novel still is read today and will be for years."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I found this book as a young pre-teen. My mother handed me a dog-eared copy she had owned since her teens so I would leave her alone during a very long sea-side summer holiday. As a summer novel, it is still one of my favourites.Despite what many of my fellow reviewers have said, I found the character development redeemed many of the characters you may not have liked too much in the beginning. Lucy's growth especially is quite real. Very much something we all end up having to go through in one respect or another as we try to survive our teens. Only her struggle is made all the more aggrivating by all the unwritten rules of Edwardian Society and the meddling relations and aquaintances Forster seems to find an evil glee in throwing in her path.Lucy is a girl caught midway between the tantrums of childhood and expected decorum of adulthood. Through the novel she stumbles her way through all the pit-falls her station and ever-so-proper upbringing keep throwing in her way as she tries to deal with falling in love with a middle-class Bohemian [good heavens]. She starts very much as a young girl still learning the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" way to do things and through the novel somehow find her way past all the expectations of her mother, her fiance, and society in general to become a woman who takes her fate into her own hands and dares to say \\"But I want THIS!\\"It's the pitfalls and meddlings of the other characters that makes this story a treat. Everyone has an opinion and everyone gets in the way. Forster many times seems to be making fun of his characters, pointing our their absuridites with the turn of a phrase, but in the end it leaves you only with a feeling of affection for the whole lot of them.The writing is many times very tongue in cheek and you can't help but smile at the way Forster turns a phase. The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without a Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends.

In their merging, at the end, only then did they feel a sense of completeness and wholeness. Their obstacles in getting there were amusing and cathartic all at the same time. From the moment that Lucy witnessed the death of the Italian, life wasn't the same; the death signified a death within herself, and only through a love as deep as she had for George would she be able to understand the concept that love and death are very close together in feeling - the type of love that comes but once in a lifetime.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; can certainly be taken as little else than a charming and amusing Eduardian love story. But to do so is to belittle the true grace and beauty of this stunning piece of literature. Like so many of Forster's works (indeed, like so many of his contemporaries), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is about grappling with the infinite in a world so seemingly, &quot;flat, stale and unprofitable.&quot; Through the medium of a story, Forster brings to light the heroine's own internal struggle from childishness, to mindless conformity (&quot;the ranks of the benighted&quot;), to a sort of &quot;awakening.&quot; In short, Lucy Honeychurch's own journey is parallel to the historical changes in mindset that have formed our modern restless society. The book is rife with meaning and symbol, found in action as well as chapter titles. The language is beautiful, the characters charmingly (and sometimes sardonically) drawn, and the sense of place outstanding. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is an excellent starting place for those interested in reading the works of Forster, both because of its brevity and also because of its historical youthfulness (his first novel). Although I felt the ending lacked in explanatory action, and I was not wholly satisfied with its philosophical conclusion, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is doubtless an excellent piece of literature that works on several levels. Lovers and scholars of the various liberal arts would do very well to read this, as well as lovers of Eduardian and modern British novels."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Forster has a knack for making the ordinary extraordinary.

Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence, Italy by Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange for them. The strict and drained Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of life and later confesses to her fianc&eacute;, a priggish intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with great strength.A Room with a View has everything a reader could ask for. Not only does it contain a beautiful and romantic love story that will capture your heart, but it contains the most simplistic comic relief, that it forms the perfect balance. Just as the story starts to get involved in deep romance, Foster will roll in a statement that will lighten the whole picture, and leave the mind simply happy.Foster writes in a way so calm and gentle that you want to fall in love with the book itself. He makes every word seem like it has such a great importance, that without it, the story will fall apart. One can tell this novel was written with a passion for life and love and with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind.However, this gentleness leads to an extremely slow moving plot that sometimes winds up dragging along the reader. At some points, I found myself getting swallowed by the words and not really fully digesting them the first time. The key to aptly appreciate this novel is to have patience, knowing that the conclusion is well worth pacing the plot.Foster also created such a basic and easy plot that some chapters seemed to drag on until the idea was pulled through. Nevertheless, since there was not a complicated plot scheme to follow, the reader was able to concentrate on the language and characters illustrated in the novel. This way, it was also so easy to make yourself a character in the book and put your feet right in the room or scene to get the full effect of the atmosphere.Another aspect that was interesting to follow along with is how the novel conveyed very differently each level of society was looked at and thought of. Even though these thoughts on society may not have been the primary theme, they were definitely prominent throughout the novel. The lesson that can be learned from this aspect of the novel is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion and the natural instinct.The greatest fallback would have to be the British language used by Foster. I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording at little times to be a slight bit clumsy and awkward to follow. Although this stood in the way of the greater aspects of Foster's novel, it was definitely not a reason I would give for not recommending this astounding novel.This would have to be one of the greatest novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Anyone who believes they have the patience to appreciate this accomplished writer's work, will be utterly satisfied. The book is at every facet entertaining, no matter what genre of novels you're partial to."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I guess I am not a fan of Forster. I didn't too much care for \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" and this second try was no better. He shoots for social commentary and hits it, obliquely, but his characters are flat and so not elicit sympathy. Worse, his Italy, so much a part of the book, is generic and without character.It is not the sympathetic and even sappy story, or the stilted behavior of the English gentry I dislike. I am a fan of Austen and the Bronte's. I think that it is Forster's treatment of the material and characters."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This book can be read on different levels; eg. simply as a love story, on a deeper level as a study of the &quot;muddle&quot; of life or the struggle in to maturity etc. I found it amusing (during the talks given by author to reader), well written with many descriptive images of Florence etc., and romantic. Forster manages to give the reader the feeling that they are looking in to these character's lives without their knowledge (perhaps even as if you are looking upon them from a &quot;room with a view&quot;) and you feel very involved in the story despite the third person perspective (lapsing in to occansions with the author speaking directly to readers).

They quickly prove they have a tongue. George and Lucy have many interactions. First, they exchange rooms on account that Lucy's view is not what she wanted. He also helps her home after Lucy sees a bloody fight in the town's square. They also take an excursion to see a beautiful valley, where George makes his intentions known that he appreciates Lucy.When Lucy returns to England, George once again is put in her midst. With George's influence, Lucy begins to see that Cecil is stifling her. Challenging her Victorian principles, she must decide between the free willed George or the controlling Cecil.I enjoyed the book a great deal. It reminded me of a British version of a Sinclair Lewis novel where Lucy must challenge her societal roles. There is also a hint of women's liberation in the book as well. The idea is similar to Lewis's &quot;Main Street&quot;. However, I did find the book challenging to read; I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording a little clumsy and hard to follow.

But not on first read. Yep, like everyone else here, I read this book as part of an English literature course. And, the first time I read it, I felt like setting fire to the damn thing. But, like the Velvet Underground, if you force yourself to take this in repeatedly, you eventually fall in love with it. The story itself is so basic, so obvious, a standardised Romeo and Juliet fantasy, but the language, social commentary, and at times plain flippantry of Forster's writing just infiltrate your mind like a brain tumour. Call Forster Coupland in a chastity belt. Touching, life-affirming, and, in a twist for books you study at school, some characters you care about. The sexually frustrated Mr Beebe, the hateworthy Cecil, and the greatly underrated Miss Bartlett. If you've ever been in love, and something's gone wrong, then this book was written for you."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Old-as-time plot line (young woman growing up and going against convention) is livened somewhat by Forster's interesting heroine, Lucy.

I found this book a fine mix of period portrayal and timeless observation (a characteristic, I suppose, of all good art), and after finishing it, one of my biggest reactions was to be grateful that I wasn't living in the choking society of Victorian England. The acuteness of the author's evaluation of human relationships reminded me his literary forebear, Jane Austen, yet with a keener, more biting edge.

It ended up being a lovely mix of all three. The story centers around Lucy, a young woman who realizes, for the first time, that she has ideas of her own. In other words, it's about Lucy learning how to make decisions for herself, and learning what she truly wants out of life.The book is full of delightful characters and beautiful passages. Yet, Forster isn't above seeing the humor in life, and many characters are quite amusing, and the chapter with the pond is probably one of my favorites!I was surprised, a little, by the ending, but in looking back I can see where it fits.

However, most of this author's fiction was completed in the first 20 years of the 20th century. \\"A Room With a View\\" is a gently satirical view of the English abroad and at home in the late Edwardian Age. Perhaps we can view England as the cozy room of normality and routine while the sunny Italian landscape provides us a view of a wider world outside our usual gaze.The short novel is divided into two parts. In part one we are introduced to a group of English travelers in Italy. We meet Charlottean old maid aunt who is chaperoning the upper middle class young lady the fetching Lucy Honeychurch. (Charlotte reminds one of the governess types described with right on accuracy by Charlotte Bronte). The women want a good view of Florence so reluctantly switch rooms with Mr. Emerson (a dreamy transcendentalist like older man who reminds us of the philisophical musings of Concord sage Ralph Waldo Emerson) and his stra handsome son George. (George is to become a knight saving Lucy from the clutches of the effete snob aesthete Cyril Vise). On a sightseeing picnic Lucy and George kiss and then depart. Lucy goes to Rome meeting her future fiance the artistic and bookish Cyril.Part II is set in England. After several complications the course of true love is finally set on its right course. Lucy jilts Cyril and finds true bliss with George. The novel is cyclicalbeginning in spring and ending with Lucy Honeychurch's honeymoon with George. This occurs in the same Florentine hotel in which they met. A year has passed and it is spring again for these young lovers.Forster provides a gallery of colorful characters: Mr Beebe the clergyman who hopes Lucy dumps Cyril for George; Eleanor Lavish a comically drawn mystery writer; Lucy's brother Fred and a Cockney hotel owner in Florence.Forster wishes to open the stuffy door of Victorian fiction with a new frankness on sexuality and freedom of expression. His scene in which the major male characters bathe in a pond is an example of this theme. Forster favors physical and intimate love to the aesthetic passionless p love which Vise has for Lucy. George is athletic and earthy while Vise is a nerdy bookworm. Forster's book is good in the use of witty dialogue. His understanding of the British class system leads him to satirical comments on its rigidity.A quibble. The characters don't have much depth seeming to be actors in a stage presentation. Forster is worth reading for his advocacy of true love and emotion in a society of elaborate and often hypocritcal rules. He is a good author worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room with a View is a delightful novel by E.M. Forster. Is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written. The main character is a young lady named Lucy. Lucy and her cousin Charlotte have traveled to Italy, and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel. The Emersons are a middle-class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views. Lucy learns a lot in Italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse. The Emersons and Cecil have dramatic effects upon Lucy's life after she returns home. She discovers conflicting love within her life, and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be. Lucy observes that \\". . . even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about-religion-was fading like all other things.\\" Lucy struggles to find out who she is, what she wants, and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life. Lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society.I would rate this book relatively highly. It is only two hundred and thirty pages long, but the language is difficult. It is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance, which most girls like to read. However, there is quite a bit of philosophy, which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century. I had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning. Wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise, however. A Room with a View is a good novel to read, but the language makes it a lengthy and difficult book to understand."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A timeless classic, written in 1908. All through this book, I saw the movie. How perfectly they matched! Dialogue was almost word for word. Much better match than \\"Howard's End\\", because that was a better book, with far more depth that couldn't translate to the screen. But this one did, and perfectly. Most of it lies on the casting. Whoever did that deserves most of the credit. How this book would read if I hadn't already known the outcome, I am curious to know, but I never shall, of course. Still an enjoyable read, especially being able to visualize all the characters. You can see the beginnings of all the wisdom that comes forth in \\"Howard's End\\" and culminates in \\"A Passage to India\\".

I couldn't understand some of the characters actions and motives.I almost felt like parts were left out - and this could be possible from what I have heard about some of the Kindle book versions.

It deals much with society and one's place in society, of a woman torn between two men, one from her class and another from a different class. It was a bit difficult to separate what part of the book was intentionally placing characters in their societal place and what part of the society issues were a result of the time the book was written.

Mr. Emerson and his son George are amazing people with wonderful ideas of the world, but they are frond down upon because they are different from the norm.

This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time. It's not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries. This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just enjoyable.Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted. It will help you to understand about other places and times. All that is important for helping to understand where we are now."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I found this book as a young pre-teen. My mother handed me a dog-eared copy she had owned since her teens so I would leave her alone during a very long sea-side summer holiday. As a summer novel, it is still one of my favourites.Despite what many of my fellow reviewers have said, I found the character development redeemed many of the characters you may not have liked too much in the beginning. Lucy's growth especially is quite real. Very much something we all end up having to go through in one respect or another as we try to survive our teens. Only her struggle is made all the more aggrivating by all the unwritten rules of Edwardian Society and the meddling relations and aquaintances Forster seems to find an evil glee in throwing in her path.Lucy is a girl caught midway between the tantrums of childhood and expected decorum of adulthood. Through the novel she stumbles her way through all the pit-falls her station and ever-so-proper upbringing keep throwing in her way as she tries to deal with falling in love with a middle-class Bohemian [good heavens]. She starts very much as a young girl still learning the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" way to do things and through the novel somehow find her way past all the expectations of her mother, her fiance, and society in general to become a woman who takes her fate into her own hands and dares to say \\"But I want THIS!\\"It's the pitfalls and meddlings of the other characters that makes this story a treat. Everyone has an opinion and everyone gets in the way. Forster many times seems to be making fun of his characters, pointing our their absuridites with the turn of a phrase, but in the end it leaves you only with a feeling of affection for the whole lot of them.The writing is many times very tongue in cheek and you can't help but smile at the way Forster turns a phase. The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without A Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends. Its apparently rather rare, but I would recommend it as I would recommend this book as a whole. Still one of my favourite light summer reading novels despite having read it almost every summer for the last fifteen years."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is the best love story I have ever read.

As a result, there are by now maybe four or five different editions scattered throughout the landfill that is my domicile.The Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition is by far the best one I know of. You're certainly on the right page. (The \\"Dover Thrift Edition\\" stinks.)It has an introduction by Malcolm Bradbury that is nothing short of marvelous (what would you expect?). He also did the footnotes, which are chocked with insight.This is one of those slightly oversized paperbacks, as I suspect all the offerings in Penguin's \\"Twentieth-Century Classics\\" line are. It's a thin volume, though."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I was greatly impressed by the grasp that this male author had on the sometimes vague nature of emotion - his understanding, especially of women and their emotions, may stem from the fact that his father died soon after he was born and he was raised by his mother and two other women. This book is amazing, not only for the statement that it makes about women and their changing role in society at the time, but for it's great insight into the important aspects of life. For example, (and this is a running theme throughout the book)in the words of a little old lady at the pension: &quot; ...have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time - beautiful?&quot; This philosophy of life highlights Forster's obvious favor of Lucy's brother Freddy and George Emerson - the silly ones who go for a romping swim in a pond - and makes plain his disfavor for Cecil Vyce, Lucy's stiff and condescending intended. This philosophy of life comes to full fruition when George kisses Lucy and even dares to kiss her again. By the rules of society, he is an indecent cad, but Forster would encourage us to find the beauty in it instead. Furthermore, this is not merely a story of a brainless girl who is tossed from an unfeeling fiance to an affectionate suitor. Rather, it is a story of a girl's realization of herself and her will. She triumphs as a thinking and feeling girl at the end and that's what makes the finale a sure victory for the author - he has not fallen into the usual trap of creating a two dimensional heroine."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers?

I laughed out loud many times at the way Forster worded things, especially the chapter titles (eg. &quot;How Ms. Bartlett's Boiler was so Tiresome&quot;). At the beginning, he seemed to be making fun of his characters - at their simple-mindedness and lack of depth - but then he commenced to transform them (mainly Lucy) and make them into wonderfully admirable people. It seemed that justice was served to Cecil when he served as the means through which Lucy and George were finally united.

After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her. It then goes on to become steamy when he kisses her the moment after her fiance goes off to find his hat.Forster recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A young Englishwoman's \\"coming of age\\", E.M. Forster's acclaimed 'A Room With A View' is set in the Edwardian era of England's history. The heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, is a well-bred upper-middle class girl who possesses an extraordinary vivacity for life. However, her future happiness and fulfillment in life seems ultimately doomed by the decorum and pretensions of society's expectations.Little does Lucy know that her life will be changed forever under a loggia in Florence and amidst the beautiful Tuscan countryside. On a Baedecker-style grand tour of Florence, Lucy is accompanied by her chaperone and elder cousin, Charlotte Bartlett (an incompliant spinster \\"much discomfited by any unpleasant scenes\\"). They stay at an eclectic pensione filled with British expatriates. There, Lucy becomes acquainted with the handsome and unconventional George Emerson, a modern freethinking Englishman who is staying at the loggia with his like-minded father. The two men kindly exchange their rooms with a view, with Lucy and Miss Bartlett, who were given rooms with no view.The plot revolves around Lucy's inward struggle with what high society expects of young women, versus what she desires for her own future. Lucy frustratingly finds herself at a crossroads. Should she bow to society's \\"rules\\" of 'proper' women of her day, and marry the stuffy and priggish Cecil Vyse back in England, a wealthy and learned gentleman who embodies all things viewed with favour in England's high class society. Or should she follow her heart and marry the broad-minded and genuine, yet penniless, George Emerson?Forster's delicate and playful story-telling spirits us from an escapade through in the cobble-stoned alleyways of Florence and the lush fields of Tuscany, to the ceremonious rigidity of English lawn parties and drawing rooms. 'A Room With A View' is brought alive by the impetus of a perceptive and contemplative mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"At its core, \\"A Room with A View\\" is a simple, pleasant romantic comedy, no less predictable and sentimental than many books in the genre. But this is E. M. Forster, who suffuses his story with both droll dialogue and a satirical touch that somehow manages to be simultaneously lighthearted and acidic.Lucy Honeychurch is the young British heroine who visits Florence with her prim, proper, and priggish older cousin. (Even before I saw the Merchant-Ivory movie, I imagined Maggie Smith in the latter role.) Early in the book, two events shatter Lucy's oppressive Victorian facade: first, she witnesses a murder on the streets of Florence, and then George, a carefree, young man staying in the same pensione, spontaneously and forwardly kisses her in a meadow.Following her \\"embarrassment,\\" Lucy returns to England and becomes engaged to Cecil, an appropriately named cad whose stiffness and artificiality exceed even those of her cousin and who \\"should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" Soon after the engagement, Lucy's newly respectable life is thrown into disarray once again when George and his father become neighbors. \\"It is Fate that I am here,\\" exclaims George to a minister friend with a rationalistic bent, \\"but you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.\\"Into this formula, Forster blends both social satire and political themes. The novel's political views are far less developed and serve more to define the characters than to present the struggle between aristocratic affectations and democratic (even socialist) principles. Most comically, Cecil's overt professions in favor of egalitarianism are little more than a patronizing, haughty, and occasionally cruel pose.The social satire, however, is integral to the book: skewering the \\"mediaeval\\" pretensions of Victorian England, he portrays Cecil as \\"the type who's kept Europe back for a thousand years\\" and George as the progressive visionary who decries the brutish \\"desire to govern a woman\\" and argues for a world in which \\"men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.\\" Lucy finds herself caught between their nineteenth- and twentieth-century views; it's an unfair struggle between those who long to remain mired in the past and those who march bravely into the future."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A witty comedy with literature beauty which is expressed through the clever exchanges, personal thoughts and philosophic lines (but not causing your temple to creased). Lucy Honeychurch, a young girl from a bourgeois middle-up class, decided to look at the world by visiting Florence in spring time, chaperoned by her elder cousin, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. What was started by an argument about a room with a view developed into an impulsive kiss from George Emerson amid the violets thus ended the Florence period in a flight to Rome, away from the 'bold' suitor.Now, George Emerson was not a brackish bold person. He was just a passionate one, who had deep feelings about anything and was in a distress mood over 'everything doesn't fit' and there was no reason for him to enjoy life, though he didn't intend to commit suicide. While his father is an outright-spoken person which didn't fit nicely with English stiff etiquette style. Together, they were misfits among English tourists in Florence's Bertolini Pension. But a murder scene just took place right before Lucy's eyes and George, coincidentally, was able to help her away from the mass. From then on, his dour view of the world was changed and he discovered the wanting to live his life and Lucy found some extend of the deep emotion of a George Emerson.His impulse to kiss Lucy is understandable for a passionate guy, who was unprepared, caught the most beautiful sight of a lovely Lucy, who had revived him, among the violet blooming on the hill where you can have the best view of Florence. But unfortunately, the kiss was also seen by Miss Bartlett and that certainly put a chaos feeling to Lucy. Being forbidden to tell the accident to her mother or anyone else and fled to Rome the very next day, she did not have time to think her feeling over and quickly countered and proposed by Cecil Vyse, the son of her mother high society acquaintance in Rome.The uncertainty, self-denial and buried feeling masked all her actions. The frivolity and passionate spirit that loved the Beethoven music just went under beneath the hypocrisy of 'clever' society standard. Would she discover her true self and feeling at the right time? Or should George go back to his previous gloomy state? What would the so called clever society think?Find the funny but thoughtful lines in between and be invigorated by Beethoven!"},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"One of Forster's earliest novels, Room with a View generally lacks the depth and literary importance that his later works justifiably claim. Nonetheless, it is astute, enjoyable, concise, and incredibly funny. A first reading isn't enough, really; I've read through the novel several times, and each time I find a new level of meaning, a new, ever more subtle layer of humor or sadness or pathos. What seems on the surface to be merely a cute story of a delayed romance turns out to be, on further inspection, a witty and relevant critique of English society and latent Victorian values."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"We are spoiled by modern fiction. As great as the writing is, it is more straightforward and literal. Do you ever find yourself starting a classic and not finishing it??? You weren't getting into it immediately and lost interest. It can be the same with old movies. We watch through different eyes than the time when it was written or produced. My book club did this book this month. We all struggled. I chose this one because I wanted us to try a classic, but I wanted it to be short and pleasant. The \\"flow\\" started later, and it was more laboured to get there.It is so worth it to keep with it. It is not that we are not capable of understanding the language. We are so used to graphic, and explicit, and straightforward language. We need to train our brains, and it can take up to half the book to get to the point where you are really drawn in, forgetting to concentrate and just enjoying the ride.This is truly a lovely story. I love Florence. It is a timeless city that infects you body and soul. So will this book if you let it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"It's hard to know which to praise more, E. M. Forester's witty comedy of manners, or Joanna David's nuanced and entertaining reading of the book. Clearly, the combination of the two is that rare marriage of great writing brought to life by a talented actress. If you only listen to one audio CD this year, you would do well to make it this one.Forester writes about an England that is long gone . . . but not forgotten. The middle class has its wits and its respectability to defend itself from the vagaries of a challenging world. Naturally, the middle class prefers its own company and so-called manners are merely an excuse to keep everyone else at bay. The absurdity of this way of living is highlighted when Forester takes a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch (don't you love that name?), off for a trip to Florence in the company of her maiden cousin, Charlotte, who also serves as chaperone.A variety of English tourists are gathered in a small Italian pensione in Florence when Lucy and Charlotte arrive. Both women had asked for and been promised rooms with a view. Upon arrival, they got just the opposite. Complaining over dinner about this, two men, a father and his son, immediately offer to exchange rooms. This offer breaks most rules of good manners at the time, and the women turn down the kind, well-intentioned offer. Thus far can manners cause one to go against one's best interests. During their time in Florence, the women find themselves confounded and redirected by the honest helpfulness of the Emerson men. But the familiarity raises dangerous challenges for Lucy, and she flees their company.The rest of the story looks at the consequences of the flight and focuses on Lucy's attempts to find a way of life that makes sense for her . . . rather than being a slave to social convention.Describing the story's plot doesn't do justice to the witty satires and ironic comments about the pompously respectable. It's a delicious romp, and Ms. David makes it all the more so.If you are like me, you'll find yourself racing to the end to find out what Lucy does with herself."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Forster's turn-of-the-century novel about British snobbery opens in the Renaissance mecca of Florence, Italy, where middle-class tourists clash with both passionate natives and judgmental expatriots. Chaperoned by her prim cousin Charlotte, young Lucy Honeychurch finds herself closely guarded and overprotected in what should be an Italian paradise. Struggling to be reborn--as a living and compassionate being--she is shocked at the rituals of propriety daily served before her naive eyes. Whom to cultivate, whom to snub, what is and is not appropriate behavior vie for dominance in her gentle soul, as she is obliged to surrender her neophyte will to please demanding elders.Much worse still Lucy is not permitted--nor does she permit herself--to explore the forbidden territories of her own heart. The examples of unrestrained natives and a bold kiss among the violet-covered hills of Fiesole result in their precipitous departure for Rome, but continue to haunt her memory for a year. The Emersons (father and son) prove new inpsiration in Lucy's circumscribed social milieu. Against her better judgment she is charmed by their disingenuous manners and the expression of frank feelings. Inspite of her inflexible upbringing, her mind is fascinated, even if her heart does not feel attached, by the father's unselfish kindness and the son's eager grasp of life. Their unusual philosophies and behavior throw fresh air into the drafty corridors of contstraint in which she has been reared.It all starts with the Emersons' courteous offer to exchange their own rooms in the pensione, so that the ladies might enjoy a room with a View of glorious Florence. It takes Lucy one year to realize that her own life has needed a clear view, which she can only obtain through George Emerson. Evenback in England the Emersons inadvertantly displace two elderly ladies as tenants when they rent a villa near Lucy's home. How did poor Lucy ever come to be engaged to a boor like Cecil, with his limited world view of masculine control and maternal domination? Lucy can not imagine him unless he is inside a room, without a view, while he rightly considers her a living view of the world. Lucy is dishonest in denying her growing attraction to George; both of them individually plan to flee the anguish of frustred, forbidden proximity. Then there is the ubiquitous poor relation, Charlotte, meddling, bungling, misunderstanding and misdirecting Lucy's little life--Despite the best intentions. Will Lucy realize her error before it is too late? A quiet, insightful read which will charm students of Edwardian England and the human heart."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A short, pleasant read, which is also very satisfying - I read it as a palette cleanser, so to speak, between Great Expectations and Crime & Punishment, which is not to say it's by any means a frivolous piece of fiction.

The many references to Italian culture and British politics in the beginning confused me and made it hard to get into. However, after a little research, I understood the story better and really liked it. Get past the beginning, and you'll be fine. Forster presents very relatable characters in this story: characters trying to discover the meaning of life and feeling. He presents great ideas in this book about happiness and love.

The strict and pinched Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of LIFE and later confesses to her fiance, a priggy intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view.

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\\" (p.223 Penguin Classics edition). For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"In Forster's A Room with a View, sheltered young Lucy Honeychurch (what a name!), traveling abroad with her spinster aunt, happens to meet George Emerson and his doting father. Lucy is not quite sure what to make of the pair, as they seem kind enough but are unpolished in their manners and way of thinking. One morning, during a day trip to the mountains, George comes upon Lucy amidst a field of violets and impulsively kisses her.This indescretion is hurriedly hushed up, and Lucy returns to her home in England. There, she becomes engaged to a respectable young man, a good match by all social accounts, but with whom she has very little in common. Who should happen upon the scene but George Emerson? Lucy finds herself conflicted and confused, unsure of whether to make the socially advantageous match expected by her friends and family or to make a break with convention and think for herself a bit.While this novel starts out VERY slowly, it picks up speed as one goes along, providing a very satisfying ending. Lucy is so intolerable at the beginning of the book that it is difficult to keep reading, but, thankfully, as she becomes more in command of her own thoughts, she is much easier to relate to. (I find this often with female characters in \\"classic\\" literature. It is all one can do to keep from shaking them by the shoulders sometimes. I understand that women were more repressed - oppressed?- when these stories were written, but it can be awfully trying for a modern woman to read such characters. In that respect, reading contemporary novels is sometimes easier.)I also found the novel's debate about expatriates/natives versus tourists interesting, as the same arguments are traded around travel circles today - i.e. the \\"ugly American,\\" those who are inseparable from their guidebooks, etc. It's funny to see that people's views on such a subject have really changed very little in the past 100 years!Though some of this novel is set in Italy, do not expect much of the rich, atmospheric descriptive passages one would hope to find in a contemporary novel of this sort. During the primary character's time there, she is still very much mentally confined, and because we are seeing things through her vision, the novel is more concerned that she see the \\"right\\" paintings and statues so that she can say she's seen them.

I thought that this book was great because the style of writing had it set up so that the scenery and the characters come to life. The author writes about England's pastime. The book kind of gives you a gut feeling to find out what happens at the very end. The story also has a bit of comedy in it, which is very enjoyable. Now in this story, there is a man named George Emerson. George Emerson is a really passionate guy, who fell in love with a girl named Lucy unprepared from the first site. Now the whole story basically revolves around Lucy and her family. The story portrays Lucy and her family's everyday life. The whole story has an easy to follow plot, and many symbolic views of the characters.

His story speaks of a young girl by the name of Lucy and her struggle to understand the people around her and her views of the world. She grew up in a family where looks, style, and behavior is what determined the person. People had to be sophisticated and seem almost perfect. When Lucy travels to Italy with her cousin, she meets a man by the name of Mr. Emerson. His ways seem strange to her. He is simple, indifferent of what people might say about him. Lucy tries to ignore his, but her feelings are even more confused when she encounters the young George Emerson, the son of Mr. Emerson, and falls in love with him, something she could not admit for very long. Lucy comes back home to Windy Corner in England and is engaged to Cecil Vyse, a sophisticated and well-bred young man. Everything seems calm, until the Emersons move into Windy Corner as well. Lucy is lost, scared, and embarrassed, but slowly she realizes what she must do. Finally understanding that Cecil, who is too bland and \\"perfect\\", is not right for her, she breaks off the engagement and finds true love and true life with the right person -- George, who is in love with her even since they meet in Italy.Besides the plot of the story, there is a deeper meaning to what Lucy went through. The book was written almost a century ago, so some concepts are lost to us, but the theme is still applied to us. Lucy wanted to know how to be and how others should be. She didn't know what was right and what was wrong. Isn't this something many people, especially teenagers, go through? It isn't exactly the same, but we all wonder how we should be and how others should act. Lucy felt that Cecil did not give her freedom and helped her do everything to make it the way he wants it--perfect. Many of us feel that too--in a relationship with someone, with friends, and with parents. Although it is written in a strange way, this book shows some struggles people of any time in history go through. Our appearance, our actions, our behavior... We question all of it and hopefully find right answers.The thing that really caught my attention about this book was the descriptions of various places the author used. Forster actually traveled to Italy before writing A Room with a View which is another addition to his vivid and somewhat poetic words. Lucy's first morning in Italy was in a room \\"with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.\\" As she opened the window, she leaned \\"out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.\\" The autumn in the Windy Corner, Lucy's home, \\"approached, breaking up the monotony of summer, touching parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the heights, bettaliens of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.\\" The author describes so well \\"the pine-woods, the deep lakes of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.\\" His words seem simple, but together they come to create a picture of a world that you can feel. If you carefully read the passages of the descriptions, you somewhat sink into them, thinking you're almost there. Forster also knew how to put someone's feelings onto the paper. When Lucy frowned, lost in her emotions, he described her as \\"a brave child\\" who \\"frowns when he is trying not to cry\\". The simplicity of these words is what paints the picture of Lucy, trying to be strong and fight her troubles. I believe that E. M. Forster is an extraordinary writer who's words are unique, simple, and yet mysterious poetic.As in almost any book, this one also has a down side. Since A Room with a View was written almost a century ago, its concepts might be somewhat strange to us. Also it is written in a way that is difficult to read, especially for younger people. Sometimes you can miss minor details as the text is unclear or too complicated. These might be the reasons why this book is hard to get into. When I started reading the first few chapters, I thought it would be a bore and a burden to finish this book. It went on better and easier to read though, especially as the plot of the story developed. The key is to have some patience with this book at the start.A Room with a View is a book that may seem different and boring at first, but overall it is an interesting piece of literature. The places described inside make the book very vivid and it nicely shows the way people looked at each other many years ago. Its concepts--the way people judge each other and treat each other is something we can all think about and relate to. Whether you're a teen or an adult, after finishing the book, you won't consider reading it a waste of time. A solid 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Forster's touching, funny and insightful novel toys with the conflict between passion and propriety in the British upper classes in the first years of the past century. Like a good Austin novel, we enjoy the journey despite the inevitable conclusion. In fact, it's not crazy to suggest that this is a book Austin may have written had she lived 100 years later.The movie, starring Helena Bonham Carter, is faithful to the book and worth watching. But read the book as well."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Britain's answer to Henry James here provides us with the tale of Lucy Honeychurch and her forbidden love for George Emerson, the unsuitable young man she meets in Italy. While social mores dictate that she make a match with the more proper gentleman, Cecil Vyse, who is courting her, Lucy is torn between passion and propriety. Ultimately, she chooses Emerson who reminds her of &quot;a room with a view&quot; offering her a new vista on life.This is a comedy of manners, as we can see from the subtlety of characters names: Vyse represents the constricted vice-like society, Emerson is &quot;nature&quot; a la Ralph Waldo &amp; Thoureau. And, of course, the lesson we learn is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion &amp; the natural. This common theme of the top 100--we've seen it in Edith Wharton, &amp; others--seems even more moronic as we close the century, the elevation of passion over morality has never looked worse than in the wake of the Clinton scandals. Further, as we now know, this admonition must be read in light of Forster's own homosexuality, adding an altogether different cast to the call for discarding social convention.If you feel compelled to read Forster, I advise sticking to A Passage to India.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"It is okay.

The story is about the daily life of Lucy and her family and the few adventures Lucy partakes in, some with acquaintances which she meets on a few month excursion. She takes a trip to Florence, Italy to discover a cultural world outside of England, but instead, discovers a new side of her self that, when she returns home, she misses and finds herself wanting to revisit. Lucy encounters many new things and unorthodox people in Italy whom she tries to understand and finds she cannot. A startling romantic incident during her trip causes Lucy to become puzzled and contemplative. When she returns home, she is immediately engaged to a family friend, Cecil Vyse, who is a young man who disapproves of her family yet seems to think she is quite appealing. Soon, though, some individuals, out of complete chance, come to live on Summer Street, near her home, and soon the enigmatic emotions she experienced on her summer vacation are back to haunt her. Lucy has a choice to make which consumes her and makes her seem very troubled to her family. A Room with a View is considering a comedy because it's numerous satirical suggestions towards society and it's quirky, but well developed, characters.

There, in a pensione, she meets an iconoclastic father and son, honest, rough-hewn, plain-spoken, who insist upon trading rooms when they overhear the prim aunt complaining that she booked a room with a view.

Lucia's companion becomes flustered when offered the kindness of a better room (with a view)- as the offer comes from persons of a lower caste. This offer is met not with gratitude, but with befuddlement (what is one to do in this situation?), and Miss Bartlett (?) affects indignation, recognizing this to be the proper 'feeling' when put upon by the presumptuous lower bourgeoisie. Further offense is given by Mr. Vyse's practical joke: the letting of a property to a lower class of people amidst the elite. Adn the most tragic bewilderment is Lucia's refusal to recognize her love for George: this sentiment being improper, she laboriously attempts to come up with another name for this sentiment, or to identify and name a passion that a lower caste could properly induce in her. The roles that the charcters force themselves into are humorous at times; and the temper of the times induces more pity than outrage."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room with a View is what a romantic novel should be: light and fun, entertaining and sweet- I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!

As for those of you who gave this wonderful book a poor review you must be young and/or you are an avid reader of literary geniuses such as Danielle Steele.

It's about love that can't be ignored or stopped and it has a happy ending. I think that one of the things the author tries to say with this book is that you sometimes should do what your feelings tell you to do. Just because a thing has been considered right or wrong for a long time, doesn't always mean that it actually is.The main character, a young English girl, has a hard time trying to figure out what she really feels inside. She loves but she is not sure if it is right of her to do so. The old English thoughts and beliefs influence her very much, but when she manages to get rid of a few of them, she shows her feelings more openly and is not ashamed of them.I think this book is just as good as the old English classics, a well-written, overwhelming love-story"},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I didn't like this book. Short, written as gorgeously as anything else Forster wrote, there just isn't anything worthwhile going on.A comedy only because you laugh at how annoying everyone is, the story verges on outrage because nobody seems to matter. Oh, sure, they care desperately about everyone and everything they're supposed to be involved with, but the characters are pompous, the resolutions are forced or indifferent, and I can't say I recall much of anything that actually happened shortly after completing the text.Another thing to draw it down is the fact that I tended to think of other things while still reading this book. Not while it was set aside, waiting to be vaguely experienced, but while it was in front of my eyes going on.In spite of all this, three stars is accurate because sometimes Forster comes up with an accute anatomization of why these people act this way. A stirring, psychological portrait of people I couldn't care less about."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Never has such a book been written that combines with such artistry the romance and charm of Florence with the passionate love of two idealised and idealistic yet incredibly indeering charcters.

But you unless you are interest in social studies or the antrophological development of romance, you will find most of the situations downright silly. Maybe what particularly bothered me was that the writter did not make any significant effort to provide clues of why the characters fall in love. Actually, their attraction seems to be a mere infatution of inmature personalities, presented to the reader as a great romance."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A rich and scandalous story of a young woman who falls in love with a solemn, clumsy sort of man in his arms, literally.Oddly enough I don't see any hype in this book, which is the best thing, no hype."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Though a romantic story with good character development and scene painting, it can be difficult to enjoy if the main character is inconsistent throughout. Lucy admires George, but commits to marry Cecil. She rejects Cecil because she adopts George's assessment of Cecil's character. She will not marry George the Truthful because he does not fit Cecil's standard of propriety (though the author does not quite tell us that). She is indecisive and is making everyone miserable, when finally some odd man with absurd philosophies pushes her to make a decision which, our author tries to convince us, was the correct one. Here is the message: It is perfectly fine to lie to everyone. After you have dodged them, hurt them, and confused them, \\"it will all come right in the end\\" and you will live happily ever after. The message appeals well to an age of utter selfishness. Our heroine shows some sign of repentance: He will never forgive us. But she immediately takes it back: I mean, he will never be interested in us again. But the selfish character wins and the reader is to applaud her \\"courage.\\""},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room with A View is a romantic book, which teaches more than one important lesson of life. Lucy teaches the reader many great morals through her battling of society's expectations. We also see these morals being taught with her struggle to find what she really wants. Throughout the book, we see Lucy start to develop a sense of independence and passion by following her heart. I think E.M. Forster does a great job of reflecting the 18th century in this book. Through Lucy he portrayed a woman's strength and a woman's changing role in society. This was also happening at the time in the 18th century to many other women. In this novel, social class is a huge factor in teaching us not to be judgmental or obey the unfair rules of society.This novel teaches us to think for ourselves just as Lucy did. Lucy meets a man of lower rank than she was. His name is George Emerson. He teaches her the things in life that are important such as her musical talents. He shows her the truth, and passion that she soon with discover. Nature is also conveyed widely in this book. Forster does a great job of connecting man and nature showing how they affect each other. Forster teaches us the lesson that man cannot be taken from his natural state. When the novel ends, we see how man and nature are all tied together. With the help of many people and by traveling to Italy, Lucy finally grows into a strong woman. She is now passionate, independent, and aware of what she wants. This book takes the reader through the adventure of a young woman's struggle with her heart, and with the society."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A very chatty book with little description and almost all dialog.

It has fixed line lengths which wrap awkwardly on the Kindle, making it very difficult to read."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is what you could have called &quot;Proletarian literature&quot; in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British &quot;proper&quot; society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I hate to be the one to write a bad review about this book, however I feel there is a lot of hype surrounding this classic that is not deserved.

Some scenes in this Edwardian book I agree or slightly amusing, but it is not worth the read."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"It is difficult to imagine a girl in the 21st century over-reacting to a rather innocent kiss, as is the case with the inciting event here. But this is exactly the situation a century ago with a girl from a respectable English family. And this is what makes the novel difficult to grasp for readers of our present day.Not all that much happens. There's the kiss and then a whole lot of agonizing over it, trying to hide news of it, pretending that it wasn't meaningful, to the point that the poor girl's life is in turmoil, her engagement to another is broken.The characters are wispy--we never quite see clear pictures of them. The dialogue is stilted by current standards. (Did people ever really talk that way?) The atmosphere of Florence, Italy, and semi-rural England is also a trifle wispy; the reader never quite feels as if he has benn taken along for the trip.There are great many annoying editorial intrusions in order to puff up this lame plot, and most of the actions are internal. I'm not saying that an explosion or a car chase would have been necessary, but something more might have happened. There is a murder, but it is of no consequence. All in all, I'd say the novel is just a tad over-rated. I believe it was Mark Twain who said that a classic was a book that people praised and no one read. Few people voluntarily, rather, in this case."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A Room With a View is hardly what you could consider fine, classic literature. The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The stories are the same: a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends. The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing: change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.Holly Burke, PhD.Georgetown U."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"If you like Dirty Harry, Terminator or Rocky, don't read this book!!!

After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is a romantic comedy, and as such, it follows the typical formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. This basic plot is, of course, embellished with a lot of comical characters, exotic settings, and convenient misunderstandings, but none of this mollifies my opinion that the novel, although well-written, is not very interesting.Two fussy English women, the nubile Lucy Honeychurch and her older cousin Charlotte Bartlett, are staying in a small hotel (a pension) in Florence, Italy. There they meet the Emersons, a father and son, who do not seem to have much money and are hinted to be &quot;Socialists,&quot; which reflects a prejudice on the part of the allegers and doesn't even really mean anything within the novel's scope. Lucy has a brief romance with the son, George, even though she knows he is not quite suitable for her social status. A few other characters also are introduced in Florence, including two clergymen, Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, and a romance novelist named Miss Lavish.The action shifts back to England, where we meet Lucy's doting mother and frivolous, immature brother Freddy, who could be a progenitor for P.G. Wodehouse's aristocratic loafers. Lucy is courted by a snobbish young man named Cecil Vyse whom she has known for a few years and accepts his proposal for marriage. Trouble arises when George Emerson and his father show up as tenants in a nearby cottage, and Lucy must decide whether she is going to submit to social convention and marry Cecil or follow her heart and go with George. Care to take a wild guess about the outcome?Forster obviously intended this novel to be a comedy, but his humor is stilted and contrived. There are subtle jokes about English class distinction, blatantly symbolic surnames that sound like they came from the board game &quot;Clue,&quot; juxtaposed sentences that purposely contradict each other for the sake of painfully overt irony, and satirical snippets that affect Oscar Wilde-style wittiness. The novel's humoristic tour de force is a scene in which Cecil remains oblivious to the fact that Lucy and George had a fling in Italy, even though he reads a direct account of it in a novel penned by Miss Lavish, who fortunately has disguised the names of her hero and heroine. Simply put, the book is as funny as burnt toast.Colorful but predictable and simplistic, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; may have been an important Edwardian novel, but it seems innocuous compared to the hard realism and bold sexuality of D.H. Lawrence's imminent works. Even the author himself acknowledges the novel's fabrications when he allows Mr. Beebe to state, &quot;It is odd how we of that Pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another's lives.&quot; Funny, I was thinking the same thing."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Initially, I was disappointed because the covers are really weak, but it's a really good price, so I'm satisfied.

The story itself involves several generations and portrays the contrast between two main cultures and lifestyles; one in the West, that is Britain, the other one in the south laid-back Mediterranean Europe, namely, Italy. The protagonist, a young lady, searches new experiences and heads for an adventure, whereas her older companions strive to make her think before she leaps, speak wisely and counsel her. So far, it looks as if their life is as it should be. However, things are not always as they seem at firts. The narrative takes some twists and turns and eventually the so-called generation gap starts to diminish, while the moral values are more or less reevaluated. Whether there is a happy end, you should look forward to finding out for yourselves!

Lucy Honeychurch is a well-bred young middle class girl on holiday in radiant Florence. She comes from a family overconcerned with respectability and is therefore overprotected by a dessicated spinster named Charlotte Bartlett. One wonders if Forster had in mind a more famous Charlotte B. when he drew Lucy's protector, a woman \\"much discomfited by [any] unpleasant scene[s].\\" Forster playfully tosses barbs at this don't-let-the-servants-hear-you world the English try to maintain on foreign soil. Less playful with sanctimonious Puritans or hypocritical clergymen, Forster lets them foil themselves.Under no circumstances will Miss Bartlett allow Lucy to pursue (or even examine) her affection for the handsome young George Emerson--his father is far too unconventional with his modern notions about honesty and freethinking. Duty must reign . . . mustn't it? Ah, that wild transitional phase between the late-Victorians and the early-Moderns!Forster writes gently and calmly, but with a passion for life and love welling up beneath the surface. A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lovely book, vital with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind. There's even more to this book than it seems--highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Concerning Lucy's passionate playing of Beethoven upon the piano, the Rev. Mr. Beebe once said, &quot;If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting--both for us and for her.&quot; At the time of the remark, Lucy is a very conventional young woman, with perhaps occasional rebellious thoughts. The Emersons, father and son, are somehow not quite acceptable in her social circle, and though George is so bold as to kiss her impulsively, she is determined to forget him. Instead she finally gives in to the repeated proposals of Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly fashionable young gentleman, if not very exciting. So the stage is set for this splendid satire on the English social strata of the early part of the 20th century, a time when the formal structure of the Victorian era was beginning to fray at the edges. Vyse is a delightfully drawn male chauvinist prig; nobody likes him, but everyone is willing to accept him, and Lucy convinces herself that she is in love with him. However, Vyse's own penchant for getting his way by playing rather cruel practical jokes brings the Emersons back into the picture. Confronted by the contrast between the not quite classy but intelligent, thoughtful (and bold) George Emerson and the arrogant, boorish, but elite Cecil Vyse, Lucy finally decides to live as she plays Beethoven, with exciting results. This early work of Forster's is a pure delight, with a light and well-controlled tone throughout. Although there would be a danger of stereotyping to illustrate the different social classes, Forster skillfully makes the characters well rounded and unpredictable, as in the scene when Lucy breaks her engagement to Vyse, expecting his feelings of masculine superiority to precipitate an argument, but instead being somewhat dismayed when he behaves as a perfect gentleman. Although HOWARDS END is usually rated above A ROOM WITH A VIEW, I prefer this slighter, but consummately well-done, novel."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This charming little novel which has recently celebrated its centennary can be easily put down as a period piece. E M Forster foresaw it already in his note which he added to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first edition. Yet a prospective reader would be most wrong to disregard it. There is a lesson here which still needs to be learned by many.The title gives away some of the content - the main heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, needs to get away from the stuffy atmosphere of late Victorian England in which she was brought up - the symbol of which is for EMF the room. Her escape takes place in stages - the first of them is her trip to Italy where she finds landscapes and people most different from those she was accustomed to. It is also there that she meets the man she falls in love with, George Emerson. Yet these changes come too quickly for her. Lucy yields to the demands of her chaperone and escapes back to England, finding on the way a more appropriate suitor, Cecil Vyse.When the three young people meet again in England, a fight for Lucy's soul begins anew. Lucy has to decide whether she prefers Cecil who will keep her under his protection in his house as a work of art for others to admire, or George with whom she will have to face the challenges of the world but be free.What is the lesson for us today in a world where there are neither chaperones nor stage-coaches? We also must make similar decisions - choose freedom which always comes at a cost or safety for which we must pay with our soul. We choose between being true to ourselves or satisfying the demands of others. Lucy's adventures may serve as a perfect food for thought for those facing seemingly dissimilar but actually very similar decisions. It is the more valuable as Forster does not show easy decisions or easy solutions. The happy ending never comes free and yet still it is worth striving for."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Best of all, this is one of the very very few books to be made into a movie and come out unscathed, perhaps even improved in certain aspects. If you can't stand to take a chance and read it, see the film at least.Yes, the premise is somewhat similar to Madame Bovary. However, I found the difference between them to be that I hated Mme. Bovary and adored A Room With a View. To clarify, there is a part in the latter where Forster, discussing some sonatas of Bethoveen writes, &quot;they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.&quot; Flaubert plays on the side of despair, while Forster, like his character, &quot;loved to play on the side of Victory.&quot;All of the characters are vividly drawn. They speak as real people speak and act as real people act, or once did. The language and mores have changed since the Victorian era, but they are motivated by similar things to those that motivate people today and they are fully-developed.Forster has the knack of describing his characters in a few well-turned sentences that tell you all you need to know to picture them. They get themselves into situations you can believe, and they do not always act in their own best interests, just like real life.I have re-read this book several times over the past 10 years, and what strikes me is how much detail Forster managed to sneak in with out making the book feel weighted or heavy. It is a light read, and yet every time I pick it up to reread it I find some new passage I had overlooked previously, each lovlier than the one before. He also makes some very interesting philosophical statements, without bogging down plot or pacing. Forster was obviously influenced by the Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau), one of the main characters is even named Emerson, so if they are of interest to you, this may be as well."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"While not approaching the magnitude of A Passage to India, or even Howard's End, A Room with a View offers an entertaining enough, if not rare, look at the middle class British (traveler's) life. Consumed with the self-discipline and propriety dictated by the national character and emulation of the upper classes, Lucy Honeychurch finds herself between her stodgy cousin's checks and George Emerson's unconventional, bold, and straightforward sincerity. In the backdrop, just as in Howard's End, is the burgeoning realization of female identity and the possibility of greater freedoms.Forster creates rather familiar characters in the oppressed but promising Lucy, stuffy and financially dependent Charlotte, and traditional, sarcastic snob Cecil, whom Lucy opts to marry after several rejections, in order to avoid confusion about her own future and the doubts the Emersons have introduced. George Emerson, of course, is the modern knight--uncouth and unsmooth--but dangerous and attractive on a visceral level.What makes Room with a View special is not the content--covered territory, or the dialogue--witticisms and comedy of manners, but Forster's special insight into the characters that lets us know eveything they are and everything they can be, without deeply probing the people. It is a respect and dignity he grants his creations that makes them real."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I'm embarrassed to say that I had avoided Forster's work because I had wrongly assumed that, given the time in which he was writing (early 20th century), his fiction would surely be stuffy, dry and dull. I was completely wrong. In fact, this short novel's charm stems from it's casual, leisurely pace and the surprisingly winning chances it takes in terms of style (the chapter titles, Forster's penchant to pause the action and speak directly to the reader).Others have noted disatisfaction with the ending. I partially agree. I think the conclusion does wrap up things a little too neatly. But since this is an early Forster effort, it's understandable that he hadn't quite discovered how to end a novel with a bit more complexity. On the other hand, I cannot help but read A Room With a View through the lens of the classical definition of Comedy (which is the antithesis of Tragedy) where we are given a situation that begins with harmony/order and slowly slips in to crisis/chaos, only to surface in again, in the end, in a state of general cheer. And if one compares A Room With a View to, say, the Comedies of Shakespeare (Much Ado About Nothing, for instance), I think that Forster was very much trying his hand at novelistic Comedy: the foreign setting, a quirky cast of loveable (yet somewhat typecast) characters, chapters that function as Acts, and a somewhat formulaic (yet Classical) plot structure. I heartily recommend this slim wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"What a relief! This was a short, simple, easy read that I truly enjoyed. The young and beautiful Miss Lucy Honeychurch, accompanied by her dear older friend Miss Bartlett, is first introduced to the reader in Florence, just arrived at the pension they will be staying at during the course of their holiday in Italy. The ladies are vexed to find that they have not received rooms with the views they wished for; overhearing them, an elderly man and his son offer to trade rooms with them, for they have rooms with perfect views; and hence the title of the book.This is when Lucy first meets George Emerson, an attractive, if not unconventional, young Englishman. Lucy encounters him again when she witnesses a public murder in the streets, and George attends to her after she faints. This is when his passion for her is first ignited. This inward flame is only stoked more when he and his father are accidentally invited on a daily outing with Lucy and her friends, and George sees Lucy alone in a field full of flowers, beautiful and surrounded by beauty. He cannot help but kiss her, which is entirely un-gentleman-like. Miss Bartlett witnesses George's display of affection, and decides that to keep her young companion's innocence safe from George's intentions, the two of them must leave immediately for Rome, without so much as a goodbye to George or his father, and stay with some family friends, the Vyses.The story opens up again in a quiet, small neighborhood in the country, with Miss Lucy Honeychurch engaged to Cecil Vyse, whom she became better acquainted with in Rome. Then, by mere coincidence--or is it fate?--George Emerson and his father, whom Lucy never expected to see again, reenter into her life, and complicate things. Should Lucy flout convention and follow her heart, which is leading her to George, or will she remain with Cecil, the safe and respectable choice, who she knows can never make her truly happy?Find out for yourself! Forster does a great job of painting with certain clarity and humor the scenes and characters of this story. This classic is a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure that even if you aren't a huge fan of British Literature, you will love it."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This is one of those rare books made into a film, where the film actually does justice to the story.

It was the perfect traveling companion for that adventure.I fell in love with Lucy (the heroine of the story) - she is hard to describe, a sort of expressive cipher - on the surface she is a somewhat callow, bored teen aged girl.. But as Mr. Beebe the perceptive Parson immediately notices, there is something extraordinary about Miss Honeychurch... There's hidden passion there. And EM Forster is the master at presenting her to us, along with the rest of his subtly drawn cast of characters.Forster thought her intriguing, himself. Forster was a lifelong bachelor, and a closeted homosexual. He usually treats his female characters with a certain dispassionate distance. But Lucy was his favorite of them all, and she stayed with him. In fact, he wrote a short story detailing her later life after the end of the novel.**So, this story, like everything Forster wrote is a comedy of manners focusing on the mores of the early twentieth century English middle class, highlighted against a foreign background. It is witty, philosophically interesting, and rife with good companionship. These characters will inhabit your imagination.If you like Jane Austen, George Eliot, or even stuff like Evylyn Waugh or Oscar Wilde, you will probably enjoy this book.[**The four page sequel is titled \\"A View without a Room,\\" and it was published in 1958 in a private edition, which is now very hard to find. It was reprinted though, in the Penguin Modern Classics edition of a \\"Room with a View,\\" which is where I read it.The text can also apparently be found in the New York Times Book Review of 27th July 1958.]"},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"This elegant little novel totally swept me away. It is so perfect from any angle I look at it. I know that this will be one of those novels I will always keep in a prominent place on my bookshelf and return to my whole life.This exquisite novel primarily concerns Lucy Honeychurch. The novel begins with Lucy on a trip in Italy. She is accompanied there mainly by members of her own society, the upper class of England among which she has been raised. While in Italy, though, Lucy is confronted by the Italian society where she notices the classes seem to mix easily. She is also confronted with George Emerson. George is simple, direct, and of a lower class, and he is having existential worries. Despite themselves (or their pasts), the two begin to fall in love with one another, and their experiences eventually lead to their realizations of what their hearts really desire.As it is with all of my favorite novels, I really cannot do A Room With a View justice with this review. This is a truly lovely book. The prose and the pace is perfect. There are so many sentences which are just perfect little gems by themselves. The characterizations are complex. The plot is romantic and funny. The thought behind the novel is meaningful and life affirming. There's not much more that any novel can do. A Room With a View is perfection."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I listened to \\"A Room with a View\\" by E.M. Forster on audiobook. Written in 1908, it tells the age old story of a girl who has to choose between the socially acceptable and her heart/mind.\\"It is a great opportunity, the possession of leisure.\\"The story starts in Florence, where the naive young Lucy Honeychurch meets the brutally honest George Emerson, and has a brief moment (and I do mean moment, as lovely as it is) of passion with him.\\"The garden of Eden which we say is in the past is yet to come. We shall be equal when we stop despising our bodies.\\"It then continues to the English countryside, where Lucy decides to marry the stodgy Cecil Vyse (him of good snobby stock) but has all her plans upended by George's arrival and ardent engagements.\\"Choose a place where you don't do very much harm and stand there for all you're worth facing the sunshine.\\"The landscape is beautifully laid out, and the language is precise and hilarious, in that way only the English can describe.\\"She gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who followed neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destinies by catchwords.\\"E.M. Forster skewers society and its stuffy hierarchies and mincing debates, and not a bit of is dated, despite the Edwardian era. If you like this sort of thing - clever funny period pieces that resonate in the modern world, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I decided to read this book for the wrong reasons (our upcoming trip to Italy and my incessant need to immerse myself in all things Italian) but by the time I'd finished reading the first page, marveling at the beauty of Forster's writing, I knew I'd found a new addition to my list of Books You Must Read.Our main character, Lucy Honeychurch (what a great name!) is off to Italy with a relative. She meets a man, George Emerson, who startles her, frightens her, with his intensity, and she bolts back to her secure home in England and quickly becomes engaged to a comfortable man. But it is too late for comfort, and when she finds herself unexpectedly meeting up with George again, Lucy must choose between a life and a semblance of a life.Beautiful writing. You will love this book."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. The plot may be relatively basic, but it's a medium for Forster to convey his message about how important it is to seek real love and connection.Instead of a cast of heroes and villains, Forster gives us a bunch of realistically drawn people. It would have been easy to make Miss Bartlett the butt of every joke or Cecil completely without redeeming qualities - but he doesn't do that. The point of the book isn't to transport you to Italy (in fact, I think he makes the point very well that the social and mental strictures of the characters put them in a sort of bubble that prevented them from authentically experiencing much of anything, no matter where they traveled)."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I'm not sure how a voracious reader like me missed this classic novel, but luckily, my book club picked it and I promptly downloaded the audio (narrator: Wanda McCaddon). I found myself immediately transported to Florence, italy, and completely captivated by the travails of young Lucy Honeychurch. Everything about this book is perfect: the descriptions of Florence and the muddy Arno (where I visited long ago and toured with my then-future husband); the stinging digs at tourists who go abroad only to stay clumped together with others of their same nationality (in my experience, tourists have not improved at all since Forster's time); the characters with their personal foibles, dreams and fears. Even the titles of the chapters are wonderful: \\"In Santa Croce with no Baedeker,\\" \\"Lucy as a Work of Art,\\" \\"Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants.\\" Many times I laughed out loud, often caught my breath at the beauty of particularly beautifully written passages, and constantly ached with longing to be young and in love again. The narrator was wonderful and I found myself wishing the book would never end."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I have re-read this book every couple of years for well over a decade now. Indeed, it does take some work to understand the cultural politics of early 20th century Britain, but it's so worth the effort. Forster's writing crackles with wit all of these years later. Honestly, I've always loved this book because it's a quick read and it's such a delightful little costume drama. Locations and characters are carefully developed and doted upon because the story keeps such a tight focus on Lucy, and the narrative never goes to melodrama. Yes, Merchant and Ivory made an excellent and faithful adaptation of a movie, but what it misses is Forster's omniscient point of view. Only in the book do you get the full insight into the inner mechanics of the characters."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"Short and beautiful, a classic Forster. vivid, colorful prose and intriguing characters and the struggles between free mind and societal proprieties, passion and duties...

One of my favorite books. Period."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"A simple love story about turn of the last century English society and individuals set in Florence, Italy.This classic is well-written, engaging, rich and moving. The conflict between social norms and individual behavior is well illustrated. The characters develop through the chapters, becoming familiar and human, even if they are not all lovable or psychologically deep. The limitations of being too conformist, aspiring or rational are shown. The heroine, Lucy, seeks personal growth through travel, experiences and music. She is unsure of herself as she grows, unsure of where she wants to go or how to get there. Yet, through the simple act of showing up and having a small amount of self-confidence and self-awareness, she does grow and achieve some of her ends. Forster's writing style is appealing and approachable. Both the particular details and the eternal themes resonate a century later. As noted by the critics, the plot is a bit erratic at times and relies upon improbable coincidences to weave the ending. Nonetheless, this is an easy read with several layers of depth and meaning."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I teach literature at the university level. I read E.M. Forster decades ago, and saw many of the films based on his books. (A Room with a View and Howard's End were excellent adaptations.) For some reason, after listening to a panel discussion on the radio about a new Forster biography, I decided to pick up a copy of A Room with A View. I found Forster's writing, in certain places, stiff and archaic (even when taking into account the time period), more so than (a much earlier) Austen's writing, perhaps because he is not quite as witty as she. However, the beauty and passion of the Lucy-George love story, and Forster's powerful philosophy of undying, truthful love that undergirds the story (primarily delivered in short speeches by the elder Mr. Emerson)overrides any twisted or cement-like sentences. Unlike some other readers, I felt terribly sad for and empathized with Cecil Vyse. I do not think he is a bad man; he is simply a different kind of man than George, and Forster makes a point of contrasting the two. However, another type of woman, not Lucy, might have found him quite fine. If you are a hopeless romantic, no matter your age, you will love this novel."},{"Title":"Room with a View (Bantam Classic)","review":"I listened to this on the Communter Library audio version, read by Wanda McCaddon. I didn't find that listed here at Amazon so I'm posting my review here. I did, however, want to give special praise to Ms. McCaddon's reading. I've listened to quite a few audio books and I've found that performance of the reader can add or detract from the words. Ms. McCaddon's readings of the old, the young, male or female are wonderful. I completely forgot that an actress was reading the lines.I had just finished another audio book of Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence. The theme is the same: the choice the protagonist must make between his feelings and his obligation to the social standing of his family. However in my opinion Forster's work is far superior in the sense of its quiet, subtle, gentle tone and its wisdom. He doesn't hit you over the head with the details of the social inequalities that poor Ms. Wharton did. She was certainly justified, given her personal experience but she loads you with so much verbiage that I found it much less interesting than this book.These characters are well rounded, not just stock types, as Wharton's were. Lucy appears to be a rather ordinary young girl but we see, through the perceptive comments of Mr. Beebe, that there are depths in her of which she is unaware. I appreciated Forster's portrayal of the rector, Mr. Beebe, avoiding all of the stereotypes of the English clergy of the time that one would easily fall into. Her mother, her cousin, Charlotte, and the amazing Emersons are all real people, with their faults as well as their virtues.There is so much wisdom, inserted in quiet ways in this little story that at times I wanted to pull my car over and write down a sentence. One of the gems that I did remember was Forster's remark that although Lucy's dilemma seemed to be a choice between personal feelings and the dictates of society, that it was really between reality and illusion! I had just this thought when I was listening to Wharton's book and was so happy to hear Forster articulate it.There is a lot of light hearted humor in the book, too. I loved the scene of the three fellows bathing in the pond. And the scene where George Emerson finds Lucy in the field of violets is amazing! No wonder he was gripped with passion...who could resist all those violets on a hillside in Florence?I'm sure I'm missing some of the othere virtues of this unpretentious but wise little book.

From the Pre World War II days beginning in the twenties through the end of the war, readers are carried along on her reflections of the past; her photography career, the love she bore for two remarkable men, her adventures and her regrets. Whether airborne or at sea, in the calm and amid bombs falling around her, Kate's determination to know no limits shines through. Readers will find that words paint a portrait as clear as one of the photos she might have taken thanks to the great detail given to accurately portraying the world she helped shape. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"A Woman of the World","review":"Kate Goodfellow dreamed of becoming a photographer and with a steely determination she has made her aspirations come true even though it cost her marriage. In 1935 in New York Kate meets writer Hopper Delaney and soon they marry and collaborate on books together. Kate is on top of the world, but will not allow family or love to stand in the way of her globetrotting to take pictures at hot spots.In 1942 Kate is on her way to North Africa when the vessel she was on is sunk. While stranded with others in a lifeboat, Kate looks over her years with her box camera fearlessly going to locales and doing things women do not do, pondering whether she would have changed anything different like raising a family.Readers will admire the guts and spunk of the heroine as she visits hot spots to take pictures around the world. The story line reads somewhat like a memoir as Kate looks back at the highlights of her life and the choices she made. To learn whether she is second-guessing and filled with remorse, readers will have to read this fabulous tale that shines quite a spotlight on world events circa 1930s to early 1940s.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Woman of the World","review":"As pure, engrossing story telling, the author hits a perfect ten with A Woman of the World.

Of course, not everyone will use their wiles the way heroine Kate Goodfellow did, but that is exactly what makes this such engrossing reading.If Hollywood still made movies for women--or made more than one a year--this would be rushed to the screen with Annette Bening or Kate Blanchett or Julia Roberts or any one of a dozen other good women playing Kate."},{"Title":"Energy Efficiency Manual","review":"This is a good book for energy efficiency professionals.

It covers everything from light bulb selection to rooftop chiller maintenance. The depth and breath of coverage is amazing.This is not a hippie guide to backwoods eco-conservation. It is a practical manual, firmly grounded in science and economics that explains different strategies for maximizing comfort while minimizing energy use. In every case, the author examines both the pros and cons of the measure, and calculates the expected payback term. It is so helpful to have a book that is realistic in its treatment of energy conservation. Lots of books outline promising energy saving techniques, none I've read before talk so frankly about the problems you will encounter when you implement them.Quite technical in many places, the text excels at explaining important concepts that are often ignored in other texts. I have a background in physics, but not until reading this book did I have a good grasp of the operation of absorption coolers or how the spectrum of a light bulb affects the visual comfort of the scene it illuminates. The concise overview of heat transfer mechanisms is more thorough than any thermodynamics textbook I've ever read.Most important of all is the practical advice that is clearly based on a huge body of real experience. As the book so frequently points out, energy saving measures are useless if they break or are defeated by building occupants. Hundreds of (non-obvious) examples of these failures are given, with pictures.This book would be great for anyone with responsibility for designing or maintaining buildings of any size.

For example, talking to the maintenance manager of a hospital, we looked at the diagrams of hot/cold deck multi-zone systems while discussing the pros and cons of upgrading a constant volume air conditioning system to a variable volume system. It is by far the most useful book on energy management that I have ever read (well, in the case of the Energy Efficiency Manual, that I have partially read - its an enormously large book!), and the ratings of each of the measures are particularly useful, along with the practical, no-nonsense approach.

For westerners in the post-Schwarzenegger world, \\"sun and steel\\" conjures images of ye olde California body-building culture, and Mishima's work has some aesthetic connection with that, too. However, it needs to be remembered that sun and steel in the Japanese context have very different meanings, referring both to the Japanese artistic and martial traditions and to Imperialism and militarism. While it is not the topic per se of this book, the meaning of the book is the conflation in Mishima's mind of these three things--the physical body, traditional Japanese aesthetics, and WWII-era totalitarianism. While it is not quite fair to call Mishima a fascist, one does need to answer the question of why Mishima's costumes for photos included loin clothes, swords, and modern military uniforms, but not traditional armor. Or why his books are about soldiers and martial artists but he didn't write historical novels of the Edo or Sengoku periods. Or why he studied karate, kendo, and iaido rather than enrolling in a traditional school of martial arts. Or why he took up western-style body-building rather than engaging in traditional Japanese physical culture. In discussing the Shield Society, his private army, Mishima described a triangular relationship between comrades and the Emperor, where the Emperor acted as a mystical bond between men. And in an interview, the headmaster of a school of traditional bujutsu described the emphasis on death as a modern and decadent misunderstanding of the samurai, who valued life, as they valued service and success over romantic death.Sun and Steel is a fascinating book, eccentric if not unique. And it will probably be enjoyed by anyone seriously at odds with modern times. But it is not written by a true reactionary so much as by an aesthetic who remained true to the visions of his youth. Mishima's opposition is to the democracy that forcibly replaced the mid-20th century Imperial system, not to the modernity that supplanted Japan's traditional values, arts, and politics."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"This author gives you his very self, unadorned, and he is breathtaking. The most stunningly powerful book I have ever read. His work is an inspiration. This is my first encounter with Mishima, but it will not be my last."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"So Mishima finds out through exercise that he's been wasting his time with the writing. He writes all about that. Attention liberal: this review is helpful."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"In Sun and Steel, Yukio Mishima, one of Japan's most important writers, offers an intimate look at how he reconciled his life with the creative process.From the outset, it is clear that Mishima advocated an &quot;active&quot; creativity and that he held in contempt those who used words to convey experiences yet denied their own heroic capabilities.For Mishima, art, action and creativity had to embrace the tragic. To be a hero meant sacrifice of the highest order and suffering life's strangest and most difficult problems. &quot;He who dabbles in words can create tragedy, wrote Mishima, &quot;but cannot participate in it.&quot;Mishima begins Sun and Steel by telling us that, for much of his life, he held an unnatural view of the world, due to the fact that his awareness of words preceded his awareness of his body. This isolated him, he says, and he spent much time at his bedroom window simply watching the world go by.&quot;Words,&quot; says Mishima, &quot;are a medium that reduces the world to an abstraction...and in their power to corrode reality inevitably lurks the danger that the words will be corroded, too.&quot;Mishima explains how he attempted to overcome this &quot;corrosive function of words&quot; with physical discipline of the body. Because his early years were suffused with words, as an adult, he seeks balance in life with a preoccupation with the physical. His body, he says, came to be a metaphor of the human condition and allowed him to directly experience the tragic in life.Life, says, Mishima, can be intellectualized, but the only thing that imposes dignity on life is the element of mortality that lies within. Here we have the key to both Mishima's writing and his own life and death.As Mishima continues to impose a rigorous discipline over both his mind and body, he comes to realize that the mind and body are truly inseparable. &quot;I was driven to the conclusion that the 'I' in question corresponded precisely with that physical space that I occupied.&quot;In taking up the practice of Kendo, Mishima comes to the realization that he desires neither victory nor defeat unless he also has conflict. The battle is emphasized, not the goal.Anyone can conquer what lies beneath him, says Mishima, and it is the process of overcoming higher and higher obstacles that brings one into the sphere of the tragic.Mishima finally comes to the conclusion that, &quot;The most appropriate type of daily life...was a day-to-day world destruction.&quot; Mishima had thus become a nihilist, a hero who could look death in the eye and choose to act anyway.Although seemingly severe and extreme in outlook, Sun and Steel reveals Mishima to be a man who advocated moderation instead. His desire to create is balanced with a desire to nothingness; he lives his life in an area that is inaccessible to words or action alone.Those who have read Mishima's fiction and found it inaccessible will benefit greatly by reading Sun and Steel. Those who have read and enjoyed his words will, with Sun and Steel, arrive at a deeper and fuller understanding of this complex and fascinating man.Had we only been able to read these words prior to November 1970, we might have been able to both understand and appreciate the circumstances surrounding Mixhima's tragically heroic death. It is still not too late."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"This book is a literary type that was once common in Japan, the self-obsessive partial memoir. But Mishima's style, tone, and content are absolutely unique.He writes about the relation between world and word, body and mind or spirit. But to me, the most interesting aspect of this book, and Mishima's whole outlook is something that's often overlooked. It is this, he could not stand ugliness. He shrank from (his own perception of) ugliness as we would from a rabid rat. So then, how did he define beauty and ugliness? You may call it shallow but no matter, this book makes no apologies: beauty or ugliness lie in physical appearance, body and face.To most of us there are many kinds of beauty, and maybe that multi-perception keeps us going - we see or imagine the beauty of inner virtue, selfless giving, artistic projection, humility or humor and so on. A wide expansive definition.But there's room on your bookshelf for somebody who takes an uncompromising view: beauty is the beauty of your body and your appearance. While it can be crafted and guided by external method (who knows what Mishima would have thought of the cosmetic surgery craze now sweeping China), ultimately physical beauty to him is the only important projection of the soul.The insanely monomaniacal American football coach Vince Lombardi once said \\"Winning isn't everything - it's the only thing\\". This book, despite all its meandering and subtle threads, is really saying just that, about beauty - it's the only thing. And Mishima, at mid-life, was losing all illusions about attaining or retaining any personal beauty.Of course what sheds the interesting backlight on this book for most readers is Mishima's dramatic seppuku at Ichigaya Japan self-defense force headquarters. (Reminds me of the wit who stated, when informed of Sylvia Plath's suicide, \\"Good career move\\".) People read this book to try to unravel the mystery of it.But in light of what I've said above, about beauty and Mishima's uniquely narrow definition of it, this book leaves no mystery to his action. Just as Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray slashed the ugliness accumulated on his horribly aging portrait, Mishima, lacking a magic painting, did just the same to his own body - sentenced it to death for the crimes of aging and ugliness.It is entirely summed up by the following single line from 'Sun and Steel':\\"I had already lost the morning face that belongs to youth alone.\\""},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"Sun and Steel is most accessable if you are already familiar with the life of Mishima. It is his most honest, unadorned writing. It is filled with his death romanticism and also with his frantic quest for beauty, strength, action and his obsession with aging and longevity. It is a passionate piece of writing, consisting of one paragraph around 100 pages in length. His fetish for militarism is evident towards the end of the book, and he begins with an almost embarrassed admission of his age and stature as a &quot;mature' writer, reflecting his obsession with eternal youth and glorious death. To sum up, this book is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it is quite likely the most honest and naked autobiographical writing ever."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"This isn't Mishima's best work. Mostly because he is too close to the subject. At once a guide book on his beliefs and how he transformed himself from \\"bookish\\" into a physical specimen. But you can see his troubled focus shift from the internal Mishima to the external Mishima.To me this is an explanation of something even Mishima doesnt understand. More of a catharsis of the self than a clearly defined work.Many of the descriptions of Mishima's internal evaluations sound almost as if he was dealing with aspects of Borderline Personality Disorder. Which would make his style of death even more ironic and symbolic.Don't get me wrong, this is true Mishima -- makes us think and examine ourselves even as he talks of himself.Any work by Mishima is worth reading and adding to your collection. It took me years to find a copy, now it is available for everyone -- I wouldn't hesitate to buy or read.-Mike"},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"Every author should write at least one of these books of personal reflection. This is not the only place you can get a glimpse of the inner workings of Mishima's mind (&quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;Patriotism&quot; are good examples).Of course, this is assuming the book accurately reflects the author's views. If you have read Mishima biographies such as Stokes' &quot;Life and Death of Yukio Mishima&quot; you might agree that &quot;Sun and Steel&quot; is a true reflection of the author's feelings. Otherwise, you might not have a good frame of reference.It's a good idea not to make this the first of Mishima's works that you read (the aforementioned biography and &quot;Confessions of A Mask&quot; are suitable prerequisites). However, it is an interesting work in its own right.My main reason for not giving this book 5 stars is that I was longing for more depth into his character than could be provided in so short a work; but maybe that's just because of my fascination with the author's life."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"Mishima's life and philosophy is something which conventional thinkers seem to find frightening enough to label \\"mysterious.\\" Or perhaps they're engaging in some kind of rictus orientalist trope in using such words. The fact that this book exists indicates Mishima isn't mysterious. Mishima's motivations are much like the motivations of many other men, across many cultures. He lays his ideas out logically, clearly, and in a fair amount of detail. I'm not surprised some people continue to find him mysterious: someone who isn't a man, literally or figuratively, will have a hard time with it.Mishima wished to live a proper life, rather than the decadent urban life of the mind he chose early in life. The proper life for a man is that of the hero. Mishima knew that heroism involved having the body of a hero. This book is about his quest for physical perfection, and how it relates to a life of actions. You're probably not going to understand any of this unless you're a philosophical man who has pushed his body to the limits. If you're a smug cube monkey or a college professor, unless you lift weights and get into fights to test your mettle, you have about as much chance of understanding Mishima as I do of understanding the psychological and physiological intricacies of menstruation. Rejoice though, cube monkeys: even though this book will always remain opaque to you, the modern world is yours.No, this isn't Mishima's best work. It is however, his most personal, and perhaps his most important work. No, he didn't kill himself because he was an aging fairy who wasn't pretty any more, like some numskull said in a review above. That's an object lesson in how one can read and comprehend the words, and not understand anything, because you haven't lived the same kind of life. You certainly don't need to read \\"confessions of a mask\\" to understand this book. You just need to be self reflective and have lived to physical extremes.Who should read this? Weight lifters who like philosophy, anyone who fights for a living, people who Nietzsche was writing for, serious martial artists, political radicals are the types of people who could get something out of this book. Pretty much everyone else might as well try their hands at Swahili poetry, or becoming a Kumis taster."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"Sun and Steel is a book-length essay which describes Mishima's effort to recover himself from the \\"corrosive\\" nature of words through developing his physical beauty and prowess. On the most superficial level it is about bodybuilding. On another level, it is about a man attempting to reclaim his identity later in life, and doing so with discipline and knowledge of the nature of time.I am honestly not sure that this book is worth reading unless you are generally familiar with Mishima's biography and work. I would recommend that people interested in this book first read Confessions of a Mask and at least one of the novels.The exception to this recommendation would be readers looking for specific work on bodybuilding in literature. As I side note, I found it interesting to note the similarities between what Kathy Acker and Mishima had to say on the subject. (Wouldn't Mishima have been horrified by the comparison?)The essay seems written more quickly than other works in the Mishima canon. I had trouble engaging with it at times, and found it more interesting biographically than as a work in its own right.The book is bound with an Epilogue called F104 and a poem called Icarus. The Best translation felt competent, although there were some noticable typographic errors which I hope were corrected in later editions of the book."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"Whoa! I can hardly say anything bad about this book, except that the author must have been at least a little nuts to write it. The passion and honesty with which he writes about his own (self-diagnosed) shortcomings, as well as his obsessive attempts to remedy them, are pleasantly eerie. In an age when physical valour counts for little, and in a discipline--literature--where so many practicioners despise the cultivation one's own flesh, this book is an original. Highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"An honest work that challenges you to do or go one more..unafraid to look in the mirror and face what he saw."},{"Title":"Sun and Steel","review":"This book is a series of essays and recollections from a writer that would rather kill himself than betray his beliefs. If you ever saw the movie \\"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters,\\" most of the dialogue comes from this book. The opening line is the opening line in the movie. He recounts his life and his transformation of being a wimp into a modern day samurai literary warrior. At times it is a difficult read and then you get to the very Zen-like (I hate using that phrase) line: \\"For me muscles had one of the most desirable qualities of all: their function was precisely opposite to that of words.\\" Japanese artists make their greatest impact with their subtlety, at times there is none in this book and at other times it is too overwhelming.

But it is certainly among the highly recommended ones.Feynman was an original thinker - his thinking was always \\"different\\". On the other hand, his thinking was also very ordinary, in a sense. He was a very good teacher. He could always understand what is the \\"natural\\" conclusion that most of people make about a question, and he could identify where this thinking goes wrong. This is where he focused his teaching energy.This book contains less equations than most other technical textbooks about the subject. This feature may have some disadvantages, but it certainly has advantages, too. You really need words, not just equations, if you want to explain why some common interpretations of the formalism are misleading, and Feynman does so at many places.Feynman uses the power of jokes - for example when he defines the concept of a velocity. (Well, the feminists are probably not too happy about this joke, but they are probably not among the readers of this book anyway.) The book also carries another message: about the very basic principles of science as such. What does it mean that a scientific theory is successful? He makes it clear that the physical description of our Universe is one of the main parts of the real culture of our era - and he also humiliates most philosophers.Even though this was not the main textbook that taught me physics, I still remember several Feynman's points that were important for me - such as his explanations of resonance. But the most remarkable is Feynman's approach to quantum mechanics. Feynman himself is the originator of the \\"sum over histories\\" approach to quantum mechanics. But of course, it is not the (only) approach that he wants to explain in the book.Nevertheless his approach to teaching quantum mechanics is unusual, too. He does not really start with the wavefunctions of a particle moving on the line, which is what a typical textbook does. Instead, he studies several systems with two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It is an extremely useful approach for the reader to understand the interpretational issues of quantum mechanics.What do I mean? The wavefunction is not a classical wave, even though it may look so. It is a mathematical object that encodes the probabilities, and the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces make it more transparent. His examples also make it more obvious that different bases in the same Hilbert space (and different operators) can be equally important and natural, and should be treated democratically. Finally, he also explains the errors of the original reasoning of Einstein (and Podolsky and Rosen) when he suggested that quantum mechanics led to \\"paradoxes\\".Other textbooks often lead the readers to believe that the position operator is special after all, and various deterministic interpretations of the wave function (such as de Broglie's and Bohm's theory of the pilot wave) can be valid - and it is exactly the position of the particle that should also have a \\"classical\\" value. Feynman was among those who understood quantum mechanics properly and he chose the right strategy to explain it.The interpretation of quantum mechanics is not a subject that we teach too carefully, and the students (and not just students) sometimes do not know what is the \\"canonical\\" answer. Even though Feynman was a really original physicist, he leads the reader to understand the \\"orthodox\\" version of quantum mechanics."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"I was fortunate to use these as an undergraduate in1964 when they first came out. My Physics professor,Dr Carl Bailey, worked with Feynman on the Manhattenproject and had the forsight to use it in our class.We were fortunate to have early access to this serieswhich is just as exciting and informative today as itwas in 1964.

It isn't a textbook and it doesn't address any of the subjects contained within it as rigorously as texts that are devoted to the particular subjects. Still, the lectures contained hererin present material in new and enlightening ways. Even if you already know the material through a different text, Feynman will get you thinking about things you never thought about and might make things more conceptually clear. The lectures read quite well and often can be read out of order. One word of caution: there are a couple books out there, like &quot;Six Easy Peices&quot;, that are just scaled down versions of this set of lectures. No need to buy those books if you own this."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"These lectures are a gold mine about physics. I use the analogy of a precious metal lode in its full sense; nuggets that will make you wealthy mixed in gravel. For example, Feynman's discussions on Brownian motion, leading to the derivation of Binomial and Gaussian statistical distributions and the Central Limit Theorem are so insightful and profound that they border on being revealations. On the other hand, he spends just as much time talking about storms and lightening. (If I were one of his students in the lecture hall, that's when I'd work on the homework for my next class.)Overall, this an extremely \\"rich mine\\"; regardless of the depth of your knowledge of physics, you will be enlightened, enriched and entertained by Feynman. The way he homes in to the heart of a problem -- \\"cut to the chase\\" -- when he lays out the first defining equation to a phenomenon, you know you are in the presence of a rare and great mind.These are LECTURES, a professor sharing his interests and demonstrating how he thinks to his students.

I have used the electricity volume as supplemental information for an E&amp;M course I taught with success. But I could not have turned the students aloose by themselves. These books are full of errors in math and even some in physics. Feynman never meant these books to become the holy grail of physics they have sort of become. These books are the babies of an experimental freshman physics course at Cal Tech designed to reduce the outflow to the EE department. Feynman considered the course a failure partly because of his lack of time and involvement. Nevertheless, I have read some of the material with a great deal of enjoyment. If nothing else these books can bring a tear to the student's eye over what could have been."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The Feynman lectures on physics is a transcript of some of the lectures Feynman gave at the California Institute of Technology to freshman and sophomore students. It was somewhat of an \\"experiment\\"; feynman had never done this before. He purposed to adress these lectures to the most \\"intelligent\\" of the class. It should be no surprise that these lectures are difficult. Remember this is Caltech. Feynman assumes knowledge of certain subjects, such as calculus (the review inside is very elementary) and very basic physics equations such as Newton's Gravitational Law. These things aside, this texbook is one of the best college \\"texbooks\\" you can get; captivating, and very challenging (boy i've spent nights wrestling over certain abstract topics). Feynman at his best; he can be quite humourous at times: for example when he pokes fun of philosphers. My biggest complaint is Feynman lack of sympathy to those of us that need a bit of clarification. So buy the books, but don't get discouraged if it's hard. However, DO NOT buy this if math is not really your thing and you have no experience of college-level physics."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"I read all three of these books over a six month period. They are a fairly comprehensive study of college level physics at a beginning to intermediate level. The most through treatment is given to the subject of Electromagnetism.As others have mentioned the style is very informal which may be why it appeals to many. I however found the style to be too informal and in particular lack mathematical rigor. At least for me lack of mathematics made understanding the issues more difficult.These books do not have any exercises. In my opinion it is impossible to really learn physics without doing problems. The more problems you do the better your understanding. I would advise anyone using these series to complement it with books with problems such as Schuam's outlines. You will need to get the appropriate Schuam for the particular subject you want to dive deep into.On the whole I found the experience of reading them rewarding. I would recommend these books but not as the only source for the subjects."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"This book is classic. Generations of science students have read through these pages and, in general got absolutely in love with the subject AND the author. Feynman is one of the most charismatic characters of the Physical Sciences, in much a way as others like Einstein. The difference is that Feynman is someone that is discovered, usually by students in an undergraduate level, especially through this book. And the reason why the book is a classic is very simple: basically, it is very good. The subjects are presented in a most original way, expressing the sheer creativity of the author. Quite a difference from the more known textbooks that are so standardised. The book is also very well written, in a very light style showing that one can learn science and keep the spirits up.It is also important to remark that this special edition is particularly nice. Go for it!"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The first part of each lecture is usually fairly descriptive. Feynman will set up some kind of problem or scenario, and talk you through it. He'll often latch onto something you take for granted - for example the phrase '60 miles per hour', then proceed to dissect it right down to its fundamentals, often humorously as in his discussion between a cop and a lady pulled over for speeding.As each chapter proceeds, the level of math required to follow the discussion ramps up. Only four pages from the light-hearted discussion between the cop and the motorist, we suddenly launch in to 'A short table of derivatives' and start to consider distance as an integral. Both this, and the numerical solution of planetary motion that follows later on in he chapter, would be incomprehensible to someone who hadn't already done the math - or who wasn't working through a calculus course alongside the book.For relative beginners, the text descriptions at the start of each chapter are interesting and thought-provoking, but you're bound to get lost part-way through every chapter. I'd recommend some of Feynman's other books for a more 'popular' audience over the lectures. For readers with strong enough math, it's time to tear into a set that approaches physics from a different direction to conventional textbooks."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The Feynman lectures on physics are the three volume distillation of the famous lectures Feynman gave to students to Caltech students in the 1960's.While Feynman sadly regarded these lectures as a failure, in my view they are a great success. Feynman takes great care and time in explaining difficult physical concepts to students, and unlike many scientists, does not make the lectures simply a show of his immense mathematical prowess (Feynman though was a first rank applied mathematician, who like Pascal re-invented Euclidian geometry while a teenager). While some of the science is dated because of advances in experiments and observations (the field of astronomy is telling) Feynman still manages to convey the incredible beauty and wonder of the universe which comes to the scientist, and the subtlety of nature herself which led to Einstein's reverential awe.The mathematics can put off the non-physicist, but in my view the non-physicist should try to read this set of works, especially the first volume. Feynman's lectures say some very insightful things about the scientific view of the universe and how science works, even if Feynman's version of truth is a very pragmatic one. While Feynman does attack philosophers and poets at some points (mostly for misunderstanding or misrepresenting physics or underestimating the depth of the physical universe) his approach is generally humble rather than polemical.His other works which briefly touch on religious and philosophical themes are also of interest to the general reader or philosopher, and should be read in conjunction with these lectures."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Feynman lectures on physics are the best books on elementary physics available today.

His expositions are thoroughly well thought out, and extremely logical. Does that make these books great tools for learning to be a practising physicist? The answer to that question has two parts. First, to become a competent physicist one must have a clear conceptual picture of the necessary material. Second, this applies in particular to (although is not limited to) research, one must be able to use the concepts and the machinery to solve problems. These books concentrate on the first problem, having a firm grasp of the concepts fundamental to physics. It must be borne in mind that these books constitute a lecture series. Thus, they contain only the explanations offered by Feyman in his oratory, i.e. no problems sets are included with the texts. Therefore, they are at a significant disadvantage with respect to other, more complete treatments of the material, which is exacerbated by the price of the three volume set. However, when supplemented by another text(s) which provides worked examples and solved problem sets, the volumes really come into their own. Reading and digesting the contents of these three volumes will not develop all of the necessary skills required to practice physics competently, however the sheer clarity of the exposition of the concepts treated provides the student with a thorough grasp of the material from which to formulate approaches to problem solving. Ulimately though, one needs to decide whether the price of these volumes together with that of another complementary text is worth it. If you are serious about developing a deep understanding of the material, the answer is probably yes.

In it, he states his own views on the success of his lecture series (mixed in his view) and what the strengths and weaknesses of the material are. He talks about how and why he organized the material as he did and some changes he would make were he to do it again.This is a great 3-volume series, but perhaps not for everyone.

That is next to nothing in a work of this magnitude, but they stick out like an eyesore once you know the work.As I don't believe in paying extra for three extra pages of not-so-enlightened introduction to the preface to the forward (or vice versa) of a very book---if I had to buy it again I'd go back to the previous edition/issue/whatever.Having murdered this point, the Feynman Lectures in Physics remain one of *the* reference books in introductory physics for physicists. The style is awesome, the examples go right down to the point you had been thinking you knew, prove you wrong, then bring you back in a stretcher; the man feels as comfortable physics in a way that is entirely not unlike the way a 4-year-old kid doesn't.The first time I read this book I was preparing for an exam. I cried.

His lectures\` are the best an undergraduate can read to understand. The nobel laurate from 1965 was able to explain everything in his own very intuitive way of thinking. He is writing precise and shows a combination of experimental and theoretical physics which is searching still for competition. Sometimes, I thought, even Albert Einstein was not able to to describe thing smore simple. Very inventive are his ideas on the General Theory of Relativity in Volume two. It should be emphasized, that his physical intuition was leading him to the very important description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in chapter fifteen of volume two. He shwos, that the vector potential must be a real field. All in all, Feynman\`s work should be read more than once by every physicist.

The book was written after the recorded lectures of physics in Catlech given by this extraordinary physicist. Although the maths are, of course, taken into account, you will find that this is an easy book, clear and sincere. Sincerity is not common in high standing books because authors are more worried about the impact that the book will have on his/her peers than in teaching the subject to laymen or students. This is not the case with Feynman's book. Although it has been stated that the lectures were more popular among colleagues than among students I can assure you that even if you don't know a word of physics you will grasp the concepts, if not at first try at least after two or three readings. It also conveys the thought -so popular nowadays- that human knowledge can't be contemplated in absolute terms. We think we understand nature but if we analyze what we really know we get to the conclusion that this knowledge is useful but not radical. We may have good theories -useful for remembering, already mentioned by Giordano Bruno- but they don't add any deep or special knowledge about what we describe and the rules that look so powerful and exact and allow predictions are not so exact but only approximate and they don't give us any special insight of Nature.

The first two volumes are a bit too introductory despite being too voluminous. Probably, I liked third volume because I was a new comer for Quantum Physics at that time. And definately I would like to strongly recommend third vol as the standard text book for a beginner. It is one of very few books which I feel proud to possess .....and obviously to have studied !! This book will make you feel that Quantum Physics is as BELIEVABLE as Newton's Classical physics.I would like to humbly comment, in general, about the Feynman's books. I feel there are two faces of science which attracts and fascinates bergeoning minds. First is that its ability to pridict ...... even after senselessly lenghthy looking mathematics one finds that still nature behaves the way science predicts. Second is the ELEGANCE that science, as distinct from other subjects, has. How beautifully science maintains the consistency ...... how beautifully it has been formulated ..... how severe are small assumptions ...... and how carefully each small assumption is mentioned in the formulations ...!!! This second phase is where Feynman lacks. Feynman's books failed to impress the new minds with the BRILIANT mathematical ELEGANCE of science !!! He fails to bring out the GRACE of CONSISTENCY !! The lengthy circular line integrals and surface integrals of electrodynamics, the elegant linear algebra quantum theory, the variations in Hamiltonian formultaions .......all these have an intrinsic beauty which Feynman fails to bring forth to new entrants into the field of science.There is a satge in one's educational growth till which one likes to understand how the nature behaves ....how science enables one to predict nature .....I mean things of general curiosity. But finally a stage comes when you want to study science with all its ELEGANCE. There is a stage when you want to admire the beautifull science ..... elegantly decorated and precisely dressed with mind boggling mathematics.Hence, all new comers should definately read vol3 of Feynman's Lecture .....but togather with that they should also read some formal treatment of science like those by Landau or Dirac to admire the science with its true colors.Best of Luck, Mukul Agrawal"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"great text-books for anybody who wants to understand a bit more how things work :P"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"These lectures are a boon to anyone interested in having a go at understanding both the micro and macro of our universe and what part we have in the scheme of it all.

I believe it's mainly these characteristics, more than the depth of physical insight, which make these books popular. Physics is an intensely intellectual subject of sterling beauty. It is also impersonal. It is no wonder that in the process of climbing this intellectual mountain, many of us long for the relief of the &quot;human touch&quot;, to alleviate psychologically the rigor of thought that is demanded of us. This, I believe, is the fundamental reason for the popularity of these books, whose unorthodox style serves as the relief. Besides, who wouldn't want to feel as if Feynman were talking to you personally? Of course, Feynman's celebrity status among groupie physicists also helps.Much has been made of the clarity of the explanations. While the explanations are good, they are not outstanding. While at times original, they are not necessarily pedagogically superior. For textbooks, there's really no sense for the author to strive to be original just to be different. On any given subject, there are many competent authors out there who convey physics better than Feynman, although few of them have been granted the over-used title of a &quot;genius&quot;.Overall, while I think these books are reasonably good, they certainly don't live up to the hype that seems to surround everything Feynman touched."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"If you have a couple of undergraduate physics courses under your belt and happen to come across this book, you'd probably go, \\"Hey this book is nice\\", but I think it is fiction that one can learn from this book. No examples or problems, lack of mathematical proofs etc make this a refresher level book and nothing more. The problem is that it has not been conceived as one, and fails at what it tries to be: a teaching book.I think Feynman does not know what level to direct this book at. While most chapters begin with longwinded paragraphs of often stunning triteness that do not belong in a refresher book, we quickly graduate to, well, graduate level stuff.For example, Probability starts with the words, '\\"Chance\\" is a word which is in common use in everyday living.' And two paragraphs later we are still on 'There are good guesses and there are bad guesses'. But two pages later we are into binomials, and two more pages have us doing probability densities and Gaussian distributions.

Eventually, looking for anything that could help me with a difficult course, I went into the library to see what Mr. Feynman (of whom I had never heard) had to say.I was spellbound. It was unimaginable to me that a subject so full of technical detail, formulas and equations, could be brought to life so brilliantly and vividly.I soon changed my major to math, and I never heard or thought of Richard Feynman again until the Challenger disaster about 20 years later. When President Reagan appointed Feynman to the investigating panel, I said, &quot;Hey! That's the guy who wrote those wonderful Physics books!&quot;Since then I have learned a lot more about Richard Feynman, and I guess I could say that if I have a hero, he's it. I have also gone back to look at these incomparable physics books again, and they are at least as magnificent as I thought they were in 1966. After decades of reading math and science books, I still believe this set of three books is head and shoulders above ANY textbook that I have seen in ANY subject. (Although, as others have said, it isn't really a textbook. On the other hand, after reading these books, you are likely to ask, &quot;Who the hell needs a texbook?&quot;)Feynman manages to cover the technical and mechanical details of his subject while at the same time conveying a deep and philosophical understanding of the way the physical world works. He shines a dazzling and penetrating floodlight on a subject which is murky to all but the most talented among us.No praise is too high or too exaggerated for this work. It is one of the great achievements in the history of scientific writing."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"First, on the question of whether the original lectures were a failure. In the April 2005 issue of Physics Today, Matthew Sands writes about the project that resulted in the Feynman Lectures. He disputes the claim that the undergraduates drifted away from Feynman's lectures in large numbers, and explains how Feynman's preface came about, and why he (Sands) finds it unduly negative.It has always been widely agreed that the Lectures are insufficient as a standalone textbook, and best used as supplemental reading. As can be seen from the reviews here, Feynman's approach appeals to many readers, but falls flat with others. This is not surprising, as different people respond to different ways of explaining physics. As an historical aside, Feynman and Schwinger took such different approaches to developing quantum electrodynamics theory that it wasn't immediately clear that their formulations were even equivalent. Most physicists find Feynman's approach easier to learn, but others find it unsatisfying. People are different. Physicists are different. Even physics students are different. There is not, and will never be, one book that is the best for every reader. The Feynman Lectures are great because they have been so enlightening to so many people, not because they meet the impossible standard of being clear to every reader."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"I hold the opinion that Richard Feynman was the best physics teacher of all times. I keep his three red volumes always at the main position of my bookshelves, aside Dirac's &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; and the Landau-Lifshitz collection. What is it that puts them in a class apart from every other introductory text? A Nobel-prize winner, Giaever, I think, said that he seldom had to reach for other book of physics than Feynman's. On the other hand, the very respected mathematician Gian Carlo Rota gave it a bad review, orienting students to go instead to Halliday-Resnick for help. Perhaps these opposite opinions give us a clue: Feynman's &quot;Lectures&quot; are the sole book to present basic physics as a living subject, as real physics, that thing that researchers slowly build in their day-to-day toil.For the author, as always, strived to rebuild everything almost from scratch, sometimes with great originality. This explains why we never grow tired of it. It explains too why it &quot;lacks&quot; the organization of a text designed solely by pedagogical purposes. It's an asset, rather than a liability. If you are a beginner, use both (Feynman and Halliday-Resnick). In Feynman you'll see the magic and understand the beauty of a career in physics, as in nowhere else."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Most of the reviewers are right, even the ones that contradict; something Feynman would appreciate.The books bespeak the Beauty of Physics. Feynman's enthusiasm andcreativity comes through. The wonder and joy of physics is there.For this alone the books are rightly appreciated. I have the set on my bookshelf and do go back to read it from time to time.The dark side can be shown by Feynman himself in Volume 3. Regarding the lectures, he says \\"...I think the system is a failure.\\" It seemed to only reach the brightest students and the ones with the best physics backgrounds. He quotes Gibbons: \\"Thepower of instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.\\" In short,the lectures do NOT make a great text.I was an undergraduate at Caltech starting in 1970, and the first two years of physics used these books as text. There was a book of problems accompanying the lectures, but the connection was slight. The majority of us had a hard time. Beauty is one thing, but solving problems is another. It took years of grinding through Schaum's and other books to gain an understanding of physics sufficient for a Ph.D., which I now actually have.So that's how I view these books. They are must-have books, but it is difficult to use them as a text. (Volume 3, the QuantumMechanics one comes the closest, I must confess.)"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"I love these books. I read them when I was a graduate student in mathematics as part of my transition from pure to applied mathematics. I had no background in physics at all, and these books were a very good way to get introduced to the subject. Feynman is one of those people that sees things in a way that is almost magical to everyone else, and he was a masterful teacher.That said, these are real physics books, so don't bother if you are looking for a superficial understanding. If you already know physics you can probably breeze through the books pretty easily getting a lot of nice insights, but otherwise you need to be prepared to work hard. Also, as a self-teaching tool, these books are incomplete, since they contain no problems, and actually don't prepare you very well to do problems (unless, perhaps, you are as smart as Feynman). For that you probably need a more conventional physics text. I used \\"Theoretical Physics\\" by Georg Joos, which is available from Dover (and can be ordered here) because it has lots of problems with complete solutions in the back of the book, but there are many other good, more pedestrian, physics texts to supplement FLP.If what you want is something lighter, I highly recommend \\"The Character of Physical Law\\". You'll learn something and it won't hurt so much. (I also recommend that you see the movies if you possibly can.

I still refer to them even in my graduate study of physics.This series of books explains a lot of basic physics and some not so basic physics very clearly and in an entertaining way.By far the best aspect, however, and an amazing accomplishment for any physics book, is the explanation of the mathematics it contains. In previous physics classes and books I have managed to learn the mechanics of the mathematics, sometimes with difficulty. After I read these books I understood the math! I mean I knew what the equations meant and the implications of the theorems... I REALLY understood and it was easy to also understand why physics and mathematics are beautiful!

Feynman takes a different approach from the typical introductory physics textbook. His point of departure perhaps assumes a higher level of mathematical sophistication than most introductory or survey texts. Also, his choice of topics is not as broad and comprehensive as many modern surveys of introductory physics. What makes Feynman's work remarkable is the his manner of explaining physical principles underlying a topic, instead of simply presenting the traditional expression of a rule and its formal mathematical expression. When one completes reading a section of Feynman's lecture, if one has the mathematical sophistication one will obtain a &quot;feel&quot; for how the topic fits in the broad context of physics as a whole. As a note of caution: most introductory physics surveys do not present material with use of matrix mathematics. Feynman assumes familiarity with the basics of matrix algebra, and this fact makes his presentation challenging to many students. In various sources I have read that his lectures were well attended by students in the upper division portion of their education and many graduate students and faculty, while the freshman audience intended may have been poor. That reflects the series as being a high-level conceptual overview reflecting the unified structure of physics. Perhaps not suitable for introductory physics instruction to any but the most advanced students."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"This famous 3 volume set is best used in one of the following ways:1.

You are taking university physics and want to use these books for additional readings to understand important concepts and the big pictureIf you are planning to use these books as your primary textbook source to learn the basics of physics, I agree with the comments that Feynman made in the preface that these lectures were a failure. Better textbooks such Alonso and Finn already exist that cover the standard freshman physics faire. However, the Feynman lectures are great to flip through, scan, skip around, read a page here and there. There are amazing deep insights sprinkled throughout.As an aside, the very serious student of physics should try and dig up the 5 volume Berkeley Physics Course to seek a deep and mathematically rigorous introduction tophysics.

I am now reading through the feynman lectures (about a third of a way through volume 1). I think they are great if you already have some knowledge of essential mechanics problem solving. Certainly his section on probability and introduction to the heisenberg uncertainty principle is absolutely original and fascinating. Also the book is fun to read.Importantly, Feynman is unpretentious in stating physical principles. He states Newton's 2nd law in its original form as it should be by deriving it from momentum considerations. Many introductory texts will simply state the second law and then prove it later or not at all the way Newton intended.Another thing about these books: They set the goal as the truth. Most textbooks will simply define things like gravitation in a sort of standard way so that it can be learned as simply as possible. Most textbooks make the error of considering the absolute truth as a hindrance to learning. Feynman is great because when he shows diagrams of a box with some atoms in it he mentions the fact that the world is 3-d and most of the time you wouldn't see atoms of that particular type in the classroom in a diagram of that size.THese books are great because even though they stray from the real world as all abstract texts do, Feynman revisits the real world and applies his abstractions to it in a common sense way. THe humor of the paradox of not knowing the essential truths of life yet knowing all these complex formulas is always wandering about this book. Feynman tries to connect these beautiful and true abstract concepts to the beautiful and yet totally non-abstract concepts of human life: Like a walk in the park.!"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"You have to disregard it all, Feynman used to say, to come to the subject with a fresh mind. Therefore, explaining the physics in a very personal fashion, Feynman does in his lectures the straight converse of what he thought was good to understand the physics: to never let somebody else tell you what it's all about, to create it by yourself. The best books for studying physics following Feynman's principles are really those with little material, full of equations without phenomenological explanations.What is the real value of these books is not the physics you can learn from them. They are not textbooks, but edited lectures. That's quite of a difference. The real value is a certain conception of how-to-do-the-physics, a daring impudence towards mathematics, put away as a tool, a try-and-see spirit, an exhortation to never mind what's the regular way, a philosophy to imagine and feel before to compute and understand, a humility to put nature first, man after.

The way he repeatedly reminds us that there are lots of things about the world we don't know or understand highlights the mystery of the universe; and yet we can understand those that we can, and he guides you to do so - this highlights another mystery: our intellect!

These books do not contain enough problems to fortify the physics calculations, but they do excellently illustrate the essential concepts needed to solve such problems; my advice is to get some conventional texts like \\" Halliday/Resnick--Fundamentals of physics\\" and doing their problems to reinforce the ideas after reading the corresponding material in these lectures. The amount you read of these conventional text' explanations depends on you; some, like myself, feel that reading the explanations of most conventional texts is a big waste of time------they shower you with seemingly disconnected formulas and say \\"ha,ha: this is it\\".3. These books were designed for lectures at Caltech during the 1960's; suffice it to say, this is not the watered-down modern university physics book---sometimes pretty heavy math is used, but that's not the main difficulty; most university physics books nowadays give formula-like sequences of steps that allow one to do well on calculations without knowing much of what came before it, but in these lectures understanding many chapters requires knowing details from many other previous chapters------the bright side is that you know what you are doing, and you realize how things are actually connected to the physical world. (I got A's in my 3 calculus based college physics courses, but I could not recall what was physically happening in these problems I so \\"expertly\\" solved for my exams:)4. Feynman doesn't mind doing hard problems, so long as it's the best way to illustrate what he's trying to explain; in no other book I've read is there such thought provoking and satisfying examples of physics-------I learned to calculate the motion of the planets to any degree of accuracy, to calculate the general amount of radiation density in a super-hot star, and to see, dare I say, the very breadth of the universe with these lectures.Good luck..."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"I loved the Feynmann Lecture series when I was an undergraduate student, but I sold them after three years of using them. Years later, I have seen the Commemorative Issue on the shelve of bookstores again and I could not resist the urge to buy it again. It vividly brings back wonderful memories of a time long gone, and the commemorative issue is better (hardcover) than the original (paperback). I strongly recommend this issue to anyone who wishes to learn physics from a master narrator."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Listen - these books are not a good introduction to physics. These should not be your first physics books. But they are a terrific complement to an introductory physics series. You cannot claim to be a theoretical physicist without having read these books. And frankly, if you want to be a theoretical physicist, you should love reading these (and Dirac's lectures on Quantum Mechanics, also on amazon). If you don't, maybe you should consider doing something else with your time."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"This is a book for the physics hobbyist. Read the set in high school after I took physics. Absolutely enchanting. Made physics a lifelong interest even though I didn't go into it. Read the three volumes in a more scattered way a couple more times over the years. The magic is still there. I would not say the material is difficult--this is undergraduate physics after all. However, Feynman's view is often different in a fundamental way. Reading the Notes is like reading special relativity for the first time--it is the splendid physical arguments that draws you. The mathematics used is basically simple algebra."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Physics is often considered by many as obstruce blend of mathematics and observable facts leaving very less if not nothing to IMAGINATION which in fact is the very basis all great discoveries and inventions.Einstein says &quot;Imagination is more important than Information because in imagination we encompass everything&quot;.Physics studies the observable universe acknowledging the fact that Nature is an immense treasure house of the unknown. The &quot;Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; has all the spontanity of expression that evokes awe and wonder at the marvel of creation not just because of the fact that they were the lectures delivered at CALTECH ,it is more so primarily because of the fact that Prof.Feynman was a passionate Teacher and a devout seeker who looked at Nature with wonder and reverence.His explanations of even the most difficult concepts are lucid and clear because he gives lot of examples,analogies,smilies drawn from day to day life.This is the greatness of a true master: To see the subtle manifest in the gross and the gross visibly expressed in the subtle.These lectures are sprinkled with enough humour which is quite characterstic of Dr.Feynman.This makes the reading all the more enjoyable.the most striking feature of his lectures is the finishing touche he gives to every main area in Physics ;most of the lectures have a tail ender titled &quot;Philosophical Implications&quot; and this is how Prof.Feynman communicates more of his Insight than mere Information. I'm just reminded of these remarkable words from Prof.Feynman's biography: &quot; I,an atom in the universe,..an universe of atoms&quot;.These words reflect the Philosopher in him.He demonstrates through his lectures the ART of teaching SCIENCE."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Like Public Enemy said:DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!Get ready for some blasphemy to set your head straight:These books just aren't that great!Everyone and their uncle and their uncle's uncle have been telling me over and over again how great the Feynman Lectures are. Professors, friends, colleagues-- even the Amazon.com community, as you can see by the other reviews. Long ago, I bought into the hype, and bought myself a set.Now, years later, after struggling again and again through these volumes (espeically volume 3)--- and thinking over and over again \\"well, it must just be me,\\" I finally have to conclude that, \\"NO, it is NOT just me.\\"The fact is, these books just aren't that good.How can I say such a thing? Let me give you some reasons.First of all, the math is kind of lacking. \\"Yeah yeah,\\" I can already hear you saying \\"but this is an INTRODUCTORY book, so there SHOULD be very little math.\\" Well, yes and no. While he does talk about physical situations to try and get his points across, he often sort of leave stuff out that a few little equations would make much clearer-- and this is most tremendously frustrating. He tries to do something that may simply be impossible--- to write an introductory physics book for a physics audience-- not a POPULAR audience like, for example, James Gleick-- without many equations. Because of that, for people who are trying to really learn something, it is almost impossible, because just when you think you might be getting it, it's on to another topic. This makes the whole thing rather disjointed and frustrating. I really could not get a deep grasp of things from these books.Second, there are no problems-- not with calculations and numbers. Again, I know you're gonna argue. But for me, I need at least one or two examples with CALCULATIONS.Finally--- and I know I'm gonna get skewered for this one--- he is just NOT THAT GREAT AT EXPLAINING things! Blasphemy of blasphemies!! Saint Feynman the Great Expositor not that great at explaining things? Sorry, yes, that is what I think. This is a matter of personal preference, I guess, since a lot of people (ie. the rest of humanity!) think he is absolutely wonderful. I guess we will just have to agree to disagree!If you REALLY want to see what it is like to explain something PROPERLY, try reading \\"Quantum Theory,\\" by David Bohm.THAT book will knock your socks off.(And PS: Before you vote, remember the criteria is if this review was HELPFUL to you, not if you AGREE with it or not!!!)"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"Hype is absolutely right; If you want to really learn physics you have to be solving problems and as Gregory mentioned there are NO exercises. Of course if we were stranded on a deserted island we would be satisified with constructing our own problems I guess.

He also admits that many students had trouble with the content judging from their performance on the examinations and said that his system of lectures is \\"a failure\\". I agree with Feynman. These lectures are very hard to understand. Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated. Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension.

Chapter are beautifully organized, they are not too long, too wordy or too short. You are sure when you start it, even if it takes some extra effort you'll be able to finish it. Here and there in between the lines Feynman reveals many of the astonishing secrets of nature; You can't just sit there and remain speechless, you'll say: &quot;Hey, that's right!&quot; My major is physics, and I claim I've seen more physics text books than average physicists, but this is different, this is a hilarious masterpice."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The Feynman 'brand' has been over-extended a bit since his death. All that bongo nonsense! So, was the guy any good? It's a bit too early to judge his research; give it, say, 400 years. We can judge his teaching though, and, as these books show, it was exceptionally good.These books present a long meandering through the highlights of classical, 19th and early-20th century physics with enough intelligence and content to keep the sharp ones awake and the dim ones from getting lost. So, this is no use as a physics text in the usual sense of the word; if it's 3am and you need to know how to derive the Lorentz transform from the basic relativity axioms, this book won't help.

It is of course excellent, but I found that for every single topic there were better more specialized books out there. Thermo? Fermi's book is better. Special Relativity? L C Epstein is better, as is French, or the old old Taylor book. Electrodynamics? Lots of good books in Dover.

Having found classroom teaching unmotivated, I ventured out to teach myself.This is the best I've found. Feynman was a very smart man and I can only wish that I could have had him as a teacher. The concepts are clear (for the most part) and he makes it interesting.Some things are not explained as well as they could, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I think that's a shortcoming of the medium and not the author or the text. Some things just have to be learned hands-on, or with a teacher next to you. Reading a book brings you close but it's not the actual thing.Overall, excellent learning experience. Makes me look forward to the bizarre world of physics."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics are one of the best book I have ever read, in all fields. No, to be true this is the book I value the most, not just 'one of' an elite. And yet I would not suggest that it be used as the _only_ introductory text for a physics course. On the contrary, I think that one should rely on other books to get aquainted with the subject and only later venture to read THE Book to let Feynman really explain what was _thought_ to be understood.The commemorative edition has been cast in three nice hardback volumes: the first one is mainly about the basics of physics, mechanics, thermodynamicas and optics. The second one is devoted to a classical treatment of electromagnetism, elasticity and hydrodynamics. With 'classical' I mean that the treatment is somewhat more conventional than that adopted in the other two volumes, where you can feel Feynman's different approach. Finally, the third volume is devoted to quantum mechanics from a perspective different from most other introductory texts on the subject. All in all this collection is a must have for anyone who has an interest, albeit indirect, in Physics.Caution: these books can be enlightening. Always wear shades to protect your eyes from the light that seeps through."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","review":"The set of lectures was gived by the one of greatest physicist in the earth, Richard Feynman.

I never feel any inconsistency in feynman's lectures. He told me the really physics: why we believe this and that theory? how we develop thisand that theory? what have we understanded completely,and what We havn't understanded?

He can't help but portray it idiosyncratically, at his level. Historians will review it to see what we were thinking. Take it as you will. It's remarkable how much of this 40 year old book holds up. The chapter deriving Euler's formula numerically alone is worth the price of admission.

Most authors of physics books are too smart to explain it to other people. Feynman is one of the few who realized that not every student is brilliant and that some of us never paid attention during calculus classes - my observation is that people who really like physics don't like mathematics. He takes his time explaining calculus and he pays attention to the smaller steps that in other books are neglected since the author seems to think that readers can do these steps by themselves.

This book comes from the perspective of someone who really had a passion for this world and the strange things that exist in it, changing our directions, mocking us as we are blind and literally grasping mysteries all the time.Probably not great for directly learning all the little tactics of &quot;doing&quot; physics. Then again, it is those who are truly interested in what they do, who will learn these tactics themselves. Sometimes all a teacher must do is impart passion and give a person enough knowledge to know what she or he needs to learn. In some sense, Feynman said this in his preface.

Great merits of the trilogy are: -intriguing approach, more &quot;physically&quot; than &quot;mathematically&quot; oriented -accessibility to the persevering layman (one can learn chunks of physics in spare time) -all the general physics, from mechanics and thermodynamics to electromagnetism and quantum theory, set in a step-by-step manner, amply illustrated by analogies &amp; avoiding mathematical rigor.

I share many of the author's interests, but I disagree with most of his opinions. In spite of these differences I find his writing to be engrossing.In \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\", author Chuck Klosterman sets about tipping many of the sacred cows of his A-D-D generation with a collection of essays on topics like the Simms, Saved by the Bell, Guns and Roses tribute bands, Billy Joel's coolness (or the lack thereof), The Empire Strikes Back, the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, porn, and little league baseball.My personal favorite of the lot is titled \\"What Happens when People Stop Being Polite.\\" It's about MTV's reality show \\"The Real World\\" that began in the summer of'92. Unless you were too young, didn't have cable, or lived in a cave, there was no escaping this show twenty years ago. I would tune in to try to catch a little \\"Enter Sandman\\" or Soundgarden's latest offering and TRW would inevitable be on. Klosterman contends that \\"The Real World\\" caused a whole generation of young Americans to try to morph themselves into the role of one of the seven strangers picked to live together on the show. Face it, we all know at least one Puck.I'm a pretty jaded dude, but \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" made me laugh out loud a few times. If you came of age during the late 80's-early 90's, this book is a must read for you.

Not very memorable though. I read through it pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's take on life through the eyes of a jaded gen-xer is not as depressingly solemn as you might think. It's funny, witty, and in some spots even charming. You could go the rest of your life and never read this book, and some will want to avoid it. (Too many f-bombs for my taste.) These always seem to cheapen anything. However, the rest of his word choice, analogies, and sentence structure are superb.His essays on The Sims game franchise, Pamela Anderson, and MTV's Real World are more than just his opinion about what's in the cesspool of pop-cutlure. Rather, they are the foundation for his discussions on topics that actually matter. He ponders questions like, \\"Is Gen-X lost? How obsessed are we with race? Does what we watch on television actually influence how we act?\\" His answers will cause you to think about your relationship with society at large as it pertains to all things pop. No great answers to life issues, just somewhat thought provoking.This pseudo-psychological/sociological analysis will make you think and laugh about \\"The Coolest Generation.\\" We are not the greatest but we are great at being cool, he says. This is indicative in the movies we watch and the music we listen to. Which he also takes jabs at Billy Joel, stating, he was not a cool rocker but he was great and that's why we liked him. On the other hand, he continues, David Lee Roth was cool and we wanted to be like him.Overall, what he discusses isn't really important but that's the point. Why is Star Wars overrated, what does basketball have to do with cereal, and his hatred for soccer are all just some of the entertaining topics. Plus, they will make you think about yourself and even society. I did find it to be a very narrow-minded take on pop-culture as many of his statements are blanket. I do think he is right to a degree in his conclusions but given that these are one man's opinion, they are obviously not definitive."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book was highly recommended to me and I love it... It's modern philosophy at its finest. Great price and sent in a timely manner. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In the footsteps of Klosterman's Midwestern memoir/history of hair metal (Fargo Rock City) comes this collection of eighteen essays bearing the asterixed subtitle &quot;A Low Culture Manifesto&quot;. The subtitle itself speaks volumes about the author's general style:a hyper-ironically witty phrase that displays a certain level of erudition along with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge. Klosterman is almost exactly my age, which means that our broad exposure pop culture exposure has been nearly identical, and while I greatly enjoyed the majority of the essays, there's a tension in his writing between wanting to make fun of low culture, and wanting to treat it seriously. It's the same tension (and flaw) of Fargo Rock City-he's writing about his guilty pleasures, but can't quite commit to the guilt or the pleasure. All that aside, I've probably recommended this book to more friends of mine than any other in recent months.If you browse it in the store be aware that the first essay (about how John Cusak, and emo songsmiths like Coldplay have made the concept of love very tricky for Gen Xers-or at least middle-class white ones), is far and away the best in the book. Which is not to say there isn't a lot of other great stuff. The second essay, about the computer game The Sims, is hugely funny (if only slightly insightful) and the fifth (which first ran in The New York Times Magazine) is an engaging account of a weekend spent on the road with a Guns N' Roses cover band. The sixth is also quite strong, being a comparison of Pamela Anderson with Marilyn Monroe that seeks to explain how the role of celebrity has changed over the half-century between them. His essay on internet porn is brief, funny, and moderately thoughtful. Essay ten, on children's breakfast cereals is almost entirely tongue in cheek, and is hilarious. His thirteenth essay wins the prize for best title (&quot;The Awe-Inspired Beauty of Tom Cruise's Shattered, Troll-like Face&quot;), and is a mostly enjoyable muddle of thoughts about contemporary film. After this is a rather wandering (but good) piece on the popularity of country music. Essays sixteen and seventeen are all about the media. The first is a sort of general purpose &quot;here's the truth about the media from an insider&quot; piece, and the second is a very keen report on music critic's conference. Closing things out is a critique of the wildly popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. I would recommend all of these to various of my friends.However, a third of the book isn't so good.. The third essay is about MTV's The Real World series, and fails to make any original points about the reality genre. The fourth is a tortured attempt to explain why Billy Joel is cool, and fails on all levels. The seventh entry is a really weak anti-soccer piece that is a total failure except for a portion where he details his job as a youth baseball coach and subsequent firing. The next essay, about the Lakers/Celtics rivalry of the '80s is equally muddled, and incoherent (probably way more so to those who weren't paying attention to the NBA in the '80s). Essay eleven is about the seminal TV show Saved By the Bell, which I've never watched, so that one went right over my head. This is followed by a rather weak essay attempting to tie Gen X malaise to The Empire Strikes Back.Klosterman's writing style is kind of love it or hate it (I love it). He's too clever and sarcastic by half, and doesn't mind showing it off, which can be kind of refreshing. He's also one of the best writers I've encountered when it comes to profanity-he uses it a lot and quite naturally, which helps to draw you into his bizarre little world. He's also a hilarious footnoter, for example, his essay on Internet porn starts: &quot;When exactly did every housewife in America become a whore?&quot; with the footnote reading &quot;Except of course, my mom.&quot; He's also a very prolific digressor, which may infuriate those who want writers to adhere to their one main point, but I rather enjoy the little side trips. I found the 2/3 of the essays that I liked so engaging that I'm willing to let the other 1/3 slide-this time."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman's \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is the most culturally precise (and hilarious) piece of literature I've ever read and I suspect it's that way for many other people who read \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs.\\" I imagine that there are two camps of Klosterman readers; the ones who own up to being caught in the sticky web of cultural relevance and acceptance, and the ones who don't. For the latter, this book will annoy the hell out of you. For the former, you'll be-as I was-relieved to know that one's vast and seemingly infinite knowledge of pop-culture is not denotive of some sort of intellectual deficiency. As Mr. Klosterman, with great hubris, socially dissects some of the guiltiest cultural pleasures to arise in the last 20-30 years while maintaining a pretense that almost guarantees you'll have to refer to a dictionary at least once or twice during a reading.Covering an expanse of topics that range from Billy Joel's inability to be cool, to housewife pornography, to the Timothy LaHaye's apocalyptic \\"Left Behind\\" volumes, Klosterman provides a very personal and perhaps ethnographic view of social trends within the last couple of decades. The book is riddled with a mix of intimate social encounters, cultural inclinations, and philosophical musings, all tied together through the eyes of a really weird guy. He details topics like MTV's hit reality series \\"The Real World\\" and interlaces anecdotes about a former roommate with a proclivity for consuming an inordinate number of hotdogs and how they, like the 1992 cast of \\"The Real World,\\" were consumed by the art of argument. Ostensibly, the material discussed in this book seems rather trite and moreover lowbrow. But it becomes succinctly obvious throughout each essay that while many of us have mindlessly given into the mass appeal of reality programming and Bay Watch babes, there is always room in Chuck Klosterman's brain to tease apart the psychology from the trend. And after he's beaten the proverbial horse of analysis into glue, he makes you laugh with his ridiculously etymological footnotes.Perhaps the crowning glory of \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is that it captures the irony of a generation - caught in a malaise of confusion, educated, but still caught up in mass consumerism and pop-culture servitude. We have an enormous amount of potential, but we're cramped by emotional insecurity and require a renewable prescription for Zoloft. We do stupid things and adhere to stupid ideas, but we can use big words to qualify ourselves. We're adults, but we still eat flavored cereal. We're complicated and contradictory. This seems to be Chuck Klosterman's message, and it's a message that's delivered with an unparalleled savvy and humor.An aside: I met Chuck Klosterman at a bookstore reading the other day in Los Angeles. After the reading I asked him to sign my book, and I was incredibly nervous. I wound up saying something about being relieved that I hadn't accidentally spit on him or thrown up. I couldn't help but think about the absurdity of my comments, but I was also thinking about how someone like me had come to revere an author who is renown for his sprawling commentary on stuff on television, the radio, in books, and on the Internet. I am more concerned with pop-culture than I have readily acknowledged in the past. However, Klosterman's insights have made him the savoir-faire for those of us who have been in pop-cultural hiding. I no longer feel like I have to hang my head in shame in discussions where people brag about their neo-ludditism or how their parents never allowed them to watch television as children. I've come to believe that all of those things aren't necessarily bad. In fact, they can be quite thought-provoking conversation pieces with the right set of neural wiring.-Kristen M. Powers"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I was excited to read this book, because I was hoping that it would be a critical look at modern society. This book is critical, and it does dissect some modern societal issues, but unfortunately the bad points of the book rule over the good points. I found the author rather labourious, and I really struggled to see the connections between some of the points that he raised. For example, I found the entire chapter on Bill Joel being great, and not cool, extremely painful to read. I must agree with a previous reviewer in that this book reads as though the author had sat down in front of his computer and typed it out to himself, got carried away, didn't have it proofread (a \\"pigeon\\" language ?? It's pidgin...), and has never had his opinions debated.Also, I stay in South Africa and a lot of the stuff I couldn't relate to, because of the cultural references. I've never watched MTV's Real World, and I'm just younger than the Billy Joel generation, so I don't quite grasp the weight of these issues. But also, I think the book would be better if he approached topics in a broader manner. For example, blaming John Cusack and the films he's been in for society's romantic expections, is a bit narrow minded and silly. Shouldn't this be an attack on the entertainment industry, rather than poor John Cusack who is also trying make a buck ?All in all, I hated this book. I would never recommend it to anyone. It's reminiscent of a tongue-in-cheek, pseudophilosophical/pseudological blogger's ravings that have never been opposed. It's extremely difficult to read, because it's tough to make the connections and remain on the same thought path as the author. The author's extremely arrogant attitude takes a long time to get over. I think you'll find better books out there."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"this is exactly the kind of book so-called hipsters cling to, namedrop, and reference when discussing 'popculturally-relevant-events-common-people-don't-understand-but-i-do-because-i'm-cool-and-hip-and-use-words-like-uber.' in the age of 'best week ever,' a bazillion blogs devoted to 'pop cultural,' and beating the term 'gen-x'er' to death, a book 'analyzing' said phenomenon is wholly unnecessary.to his credit, klosterman does have a nice comedic eye when it comes to observing pop culture phenomenons. what initially drove me to read this book was his opening 'essay' in which he reference coldplay as a facsimile of travis who was a facsimile of some other band i don't remember. that made me laugh. i was hoping for more of the same.instead we get pretty vapid 'analyses' of 'saved by the bell,' pornography, and well, i really don't remember what else (that's how impactful this book was on me). the subject matter is certainly ripe for analysis, but klosterman just tries way too hard to extrapolate meaning and signficance out of most of his material. sorry, chuck, but 'saved by the bell' was just a geeky tv show for kids. don't read too much into it. it reminds of so-called 'academics' who overanalyze every single word of a short story or novel and forget the fact that literature should sometimes just be enjoyed for the sake of it.most of the time klosterman, unfortunately, comes off sounding like a poor man's douglas coupland, who wrote the two definitive 'gen-x' novels, 'generation-x,' and 'microserfs.' i say unfortunate because klosterman does often exhibit a keen eye. however, one page of either of couplands shames any of klosterman's 'essays.' also, i don't know who served as his editor, but most of the essay, while occassionally interesting, where shambolic, rambling, poorly organized, and frustratingly unrealized. klosterman would be well-served to get himself an editor capable of keeping him on track and focused. too often klosterman tries to display his supposed cleverness (just like david eggars), but more often than not (just like david eggars), it's just empty calories.i don't mean to sound overly cynical and critical, but in the end this book a sometimes pleasant diversion, but little else. just like it's titular reference point, 'sex, crugs, and cocoapuffs,' is ultimately a sugar-coated cereal with little substance or nutritional value."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought this book was a little bit comedic in some areas while completely over analytical in others. I don't want to read six pages of analyzing Saved by the Bell. It's a kid show, it's not meant to be taken seriously. Sometimes, things should just be looked at in the big picture, enjoyed for what it was.Some parts were funny, interesting, but I found myself sort of drifting away... It became too rhetoric, too much like a lecture in which someone is telling you what's \\"uberly\\" important and what sucks. It became really bland, really fast."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is a collection of essays on popular culture and its connections to psychology, sociology, and other inner workings of society. This book is mainly geared toward Generation X'ers, and I believe that older people may appreciate it, but significantly younger people (born after, say, 1990) may not, since the references may be too obscure.The book covers a variety of topics, from serial killers to the Lakers/Celtics rivalry to breakfast cereal to Billy Joel to \\"The Real World,\\" and makes an attempt at finding deeper meaning in all of these things. The collection starts out strong with a rant on why John Cusack has ruined the love lives of everyone (men and women) born between 1965 and 1978. This is funny and promising to anyone who feels similarly.The biggest downside of this collection is that Klosterman's writing and his skill at making a coherent point are highly variable. Some essays were very strong and cohesive (\\"What Happens When People Stop Being Polite,\\" on The Real World series; \\"All I Know Is What I Read in the Papers,\\" on the media and why it works; \\"This is Zodiac Speaking,\\" on serial killers; \\"How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found, on born-again Christianity), and I definitely laughed out loud several times. Other essays (\\"Every Dog Must Have His Every Day...\\" on the genius of Billy Joel; \\"Ten Seconds to Love,\\" comparing Pam Anderson to Marilyn Monroe; \\"33\\" on the Lakers/Celtics rivalry) were incoherent and rambling. Klosterman insists that everything is connected and really does set out to connect, well, everything. He sometimes succeeds and sometimes I was left thinking that this is a man who likes the sound of his own voice (or pen, as it were) and tries to make a lot of pseudo-intellectual (or maybe even true intellectual references) to make the reader believe that what he's saying actually makes sense. The collection improves significantly at the last three or four essays, and I felt that Klosterman dropped any pretension or self-satisfaction and just wrote, which worked a lot better.I definitely feel that someone born in 1980 or earlier would enjoy this collection as a whole, but I would definitely recommend skimming or skipping the ones on topics in which the reader is less than interested."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is only mildly funny and outdated. It seems like a bad rendition of the books he references, like \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.\\" The section on mixtapes is uninspired- \\"Love is a Mixtape,\\" by Rob Sheffield is much more successful. This book produced no mindblowing or even relatively interesting ideas- a waste of time if you ask me."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's book reads like a pop culture Bill Hicks, with a sense of humor that makes one laugh first, but then you realize he's being completely serious with the essays he's discussing, making the reader think more about subjects never considered before.Luke Skywalker was the first GenXer. Pamela Anderson is the equal to Marilyn Monroe in sex stars. John Cusack is a large reason why relationships don't last. Average women have taken over mainstream porn. Saved by the Bell re-establishes our American value system.If these sound like conversations you've had with your friends you'll like this book. If not, then maybe you'll start the talks after reading it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is terrible. Klosterman starts out with a few pages eluding to the fact that he is so superficially witty that he has been able to fool several attractive women into sleeping with him despite the fact that he apparently isn't attractive. Congrats, buddy. I suppose his goal here was to assure the reader that he is absolutely shallow enough to cash in on this book despite its weak material. I guess, at the very least, that's a trait I can identify with.Anyway, each chapter in this book contains a fairly self contained essay that is meant to examine a particular aspect of American culture as compared to, affected by, and/or resulting from a particular piece of pop culture. Unfortunately, Klosterman's understanding of most topics (both the deeper social topics he tries to explore and the actual pop culture references) is as superficial as his wit.Basically, you could break the entire content of this book down into one sentence; stupid people emulate what they see on TV because they are often also shallow and because their lives suck. Add in about two hundred pages of topical references you won't understand unless you're between the ages of 30 - 35 and sentences along the lines of 'I'm not cool but here is what a cool, ironic person would say about this topic, which just happens to be the same opinion I hold, or maybe I don't' and you'll be readily prepared for the content of this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck K is undoubtedly is a very clever dude and some of the insights here will make you laught at loud. Ultimately however I would advise cherry picking through these essays, as Chuck is so enamored of his beloved'low culture' that it will get both stultifying and extremely banal. Make sure to skip the analyses of bad tv shows (esp The Real World and Saved by the Bell). Chuck tries so hard to show why disposable pap has an influence on society that he torpeoes hiw own argument - his assertion that Gen Y behavior pettern can be correlated to a character on Real World says much more about Klosterman than anything else. Similarly, his essay on the Lakers and Celtics rivalry sets perhaps a new low in 'serious' sports journalism, as the argument that the Lakers reperesent Democratic party values while the Celtics carry the torch for Republicans (CK seems to be a fairly staunch right-winger after his addiction to pop culture is peeled away) is beyond absurd, and his assertion at the end that \\"if you dont' care about the Lakers-Celtics you don't care about anything\\" (this is said unironically) is downright embarassing.Chuck will also be very strident in his declarations of what is 'cool' and 'uncool'. The repeated appearance of these exact words in almost evry essay (sometimes sevral times) becomes very annoying and pointless. Klosterman (by his own admission) of course is 'uncool', but his endless obsession with coolness (and defining it)renders it meaningless.So enjoy, but be careful."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"\\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocao Puffs\\" is the first truly interesting, relevant observations of pop-culture to come out in years.

Sadly, any pop-culture content becomes slightly less impressive as it ages.It would be a welcome effort to see Klosterman tackle new trends in pop-culture such as Tweeting, the blog-o-sphere, Facebook, Farmville, etc."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I'm not much of a book junkie, so when I came across this book I figured I'd give it a try.

A friend of mine left it in my car over the weekend and I decided to take it with me and read on my bus ride to work. Long story short - this book is bad and so is the author.Where do I even start? Chuck starts off with putting the blame for his unsuccessful relationship on Coldplay's live performance in Portland, which \\"his\\" girl chooses to attend rather then spending a weekend with him in New York. (hint: its not Coldplay, Chuck - it's you). The rest of the book is filled with poorly argued points that he keeps making without even a slightest attempt to back them up logically: all Billy Joel's songs sound like an successful suicide attempt (er... No. Have you listened to them?). Pamela Anderson would destroy Michael Jordan had they hooked up (wrong again. All Pam's ex's are living a kickass life). Fans in America hate soccer because they like watching sports where none of the athletes look like them (have you even been outside lately, Chuck? You really think that an average american sports fan looks like a soccer player?!).The absence of logic in this book is so disturbing that by the time you read a chapter about the evolution of internet, you wish you'd never open up its pages.

The way he writes matches the way you think, and it's because of this that this book reads very well. You may not agree with everything he says, but that's why you read - to get different viewpoints, to learn.

So true, and the hardest i've ever laughed. I can't recommend Klosterman more than the fact that his point of view, his conflicting personal drama and complete unabashed nature makes for the most entertaining read on pop culture i've ever had the pleasure of reading.

Classsssssic."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought this insightful and hilarious commentary on modern sociocultural life was so great! From the beginning where he (rightfully) blames Coldplay for ruining the average person's concept of love to the end where he notices how the Left Behind series just reminds us that most of us will never reach heaven by their strict regulations and everything in the middle (The Empire Strikes back sets the tone for a life of disappointment, a Guns and Roses cover band, the Real World sectioning the population into 7 distinct personality types, and my personal favorite, an obsession with serial killers) is literarily stimulating, thought provoking, and hilarious. I wish this guy was my best friend. The book starts off stronger than it ends, but this I think is more a mistake in layout than in the essays in the book. Every chapter makes me smile and want to call my friends and read it to them. I've had several friends ask to borrow it, and after learning how long the list is, went ahead and bought their own copy, and are damn glad they did so."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck certainly has some thought provoking comments and is often entertaining; however, I would argue that he did not accomplish his goal.

His observations on pop culture are insightful and remarkably indepth with a twist. It's the twist in his logic that kept me amused. He's an original and strong voice in the chronicle of our times. That said, some ideas ran too long. I never watched the Real World so the 14 pages dedicated to that were lost. Later, he gives Saved By The Bell the same treatment. Having been a fringe audience to that particular show, I appreciated it more but still. Are we, as a generation, what we watch? Is that the great common denominator? How sad.

Mr. Klosterman is a very angry man; he would say he's honest, I would say he's angry. In his defense, he's a very good writer, who's analytical, has an interesting take on things, and has a creative way of expressing himself.

However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman, unlike most people *celebrates* his lack of insight. There is nothing ironic about the subtitle, \\"A Low Culture Manifesto\\".What he tries to do / does:* He tries to examine pop-culture phenomena (any piece of trash that trickled its way to him) in a 'postmodern' light or in a 'philosophy for shallow people' way - except if submitted for a college assignment, he would fail (because of plagiarism). There are no new ideas: It is a rehash of a particularly bad reading of ideas put fort by Baudrillard (about 30 years before Chuck wrote this book) and other culture theorists (post modern or not). It is quite formulaic: Throw in references to 'authentic' crap of later half american pop culture, mix it with punch-line pseudo-pseudo-intellectual 'philosophy', swear around, make sex/drug jokes, finish essay (not nec. in that order)* ...or he simply lauds certain trash, for no good reason apart from \\"I like it, it is not cool, it is not even uncool, hence it is great, so I like it\\". He is pride of being an edgy, authentic hick, of being uncool, and shallow. Admitting, or being pride of mediocrity is used as an excuse, and justification, for his utter lack of insight.*He also comments on women (girls, chicks, and more - he has a particularly well-developed vocabulary of 'bad' terms for women) and is somewhat proud of his unjustified, ignorant sexism. He announced that no woman will ever satisy him (as if that is what women are for, satisfying men, thanks for letting us know, Chuck). He is somewhat obsessed with little girls, little boys, and little children in general, bordering on the pathological, which is very disturbing.ConclusionIt is not even funny. It is a complete waste of your time and money. If you enjoy watching thousands of hours of reality TV, this book is just for you. It is not a manifesto of low culture, it is not even low culture, the book is just parasitic, insincere. The author is not only conceited, but is one of the most profoundly dumb writers I've ever read.

It was a laugh out loud kind of read that just kept on comming with witty sarcastic humor. This is a great book for anyone who's intelligent enough to laugh at themself as well as at others."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman makes an interesting arguement in the introduction to his book \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\". He states that pop culture in many ways is connected, and proceeds to attempt several essays which each relate an appreciation of what most people would kindly refer to as \\"crap\\". Sometimes this reliance on pop culture references can be too cute for its own good, and there will be some moments when you wonder why Mr. Klosterman is not currently residing in a mental ward.Things get off to a promising start, with an examination of why real relationships cannot live up to the fictional representation of such films as \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Say Anything\\". The essay sets up Klosterman's usual set-up for each piece: a long paragraph or two about something slightly related to the main topic, then a sudden and revealing link to the main topic. In other words, the type of essay you're supposed to write for creative writing class. The fact is, sometimes Klosterman's tangents are intriguing. But after a while, you might find yourself wondering why the hell he went through all that to get to the main point of discussion.As other reviewers have pointed out, some essays feel like perfectly-constructed examples of pitch-perfect expositions on such topics as \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Saved By The Bell\\", and serial killers (as well as a drop-dead hilarious piece on the existential dread of cartoon ceral pitchmen). Other times, though, they seem to be magazine articles culled to fill out the required length of the book (the Guns and Roses cover band essay would not be out of place in \\"Spin\\", where Klosterman is employed, but it seems to not quite fit despite being about something less than reality). All in all, it's a typical case of good essays sometimes being hidden between odd or just plain \\"bad\\" pieces. It's the same with any essay collections for the most part.Klosterman's most interesting piece is the \\"Empire\\" one, which posits it as the inspiration for much of Gen X culture's outlook. To think about it, he has a point: the bad guy wins, the main hero doesn't win because he rejects his parent's way of life, and everything that could go bad does. The last piece, about the rise of \\"Left Behind\\" and Kirk Cameron in contemporary Christian circles, avoids the typically lazy bashing that most other writers use when approaching this subject. He points out that, up to a point, they are to be admired (he points the the moment when that admiration should end, however).Klosterman also offers insight into the media that argues bias on either side of the political spectrum is trumped by the desire to sell papers, sports journalists slowly grow to hate their professions because of atheletes and fans, and newspapers are programmed for illiterates. He makes some good points that should be considered in any journalism classes.Chuck Klosterman puts himself and his tastes out there, and you have to respect that whether you agree or not (Ken Tucker is particularly and oddly viscious about Klosterman in his own book about TV). His writing is bold, incisive, and best taken as the ravings of a slightly mad person who nonetheless sees a lot of meaning in things that most other people take for granted. \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is sometimes too cute in its assumptions, but it makes up for that by being unfailingly fun to read. And that's really all you could ask of a book that discusses the ethical dilemmas of Zack Morris or whether John Cusack should apologize for raising the collective expectations of the world's women. There's plenty to enjoy in Chuck Klosterman's work, and you might find yourself looking differently at culture once you finish it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"The first chapter of this book is by far the best essay I've read concerning love in the twenty first century. Klosterman put down in words what I had been trying to put a finger on for years: while we all love Lloyd Dobler, he, along with asanine coldplay, are doing everything they can to make it so that true love is forever beyond the ordinary man's reach. The rest of the book flows well, but is not quite so my generation as five years before mine."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"There were only three essays I found interesting in this waste of paper (or e-ink, I should say).Other than the saved by the bell, marilyn monroe/pam anderson, and cover band essays, I found this book unreadable.I got so bored reading it I started skipping chapters, hoping to find something that I could stand to read, until I found myself at the end.How so many people rated this book 4 and 5 stars I'll never understand.Don't waste your money and time."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is great for those who like to ponder the meaning of life to those who don't even like to read that much. It is funny, witty, the concepts are easy for anyone to grasp, and teaches us that never should we take life so seriously when it is influenced by such silly media. I laughed out loud and read parts aloud to anyone in the room at the time. A great book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I think Chuck makes some interesting points & talks about a nice variance of subjects. I would recommend this for anyone into pop culture. I will say however that he comes off as rather pretentious. Anyone who knows that much about Saved By The Bell at his age kinda freaks me out. But over all an entertaining read. If he layed off some of the ridiculous, showy words I probably would have given him 4 stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While this book offers much insight into human nature, it offers very little pop culture analysis. The stories Klosterman uses are laced with his nostalgia and contain very little relateable knowledge; it is much like a personal diary. Finally, Klosterman uses many of the techniques he comments on in the book and thusly tries to avoid, making the book very hypocritical. Nevertheless, he employs some very interesting views points, which ultimately led me to read the book with a highlighter to remember them."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman is brilliant. He not only says the things I think and wish I could say. He also thinks the things I wish I could think."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Does this book live up to it's hype. In a word no, but it was still an enjoyable read. Some chapters were right on, others didn't work for me. It's an interesting view, one I'd dare say I could see myself writing after a few shots of tequilla. The references are hip and often amusing. Hey, it's short...what do you have to lose."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I recommend borrowing this book from your hip literary friend, who already owns it. It has some very funny chapters, and some of the interludes between chapters are truly great. However, it's really unsatisfying in large doses; after finishing a lot of the chapters, I just felt that I had wasted my time. Klosterman has a nice dry wit, and he's good at BSing about quirky topics. But that's really not enough for me to buy a book. Skim it at the bookstore or get it from the library; this is not a book that you'll ever want to reread."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I liked this book so much that immediately upon finising it I ordered another book by this author. Klosterman has an unique, very funny view of the world around us."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Great book. Some interesting points were brought up by Chuck. A must read for anyone who's a fan of the 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is the first Klosterman book I've read, and I mostly enjoyed it. I absolutely could not put it down through the first half to three-quarters, but I felt it lost steam towards the end. Even so, I would recommend it. Klosterman often made me laugh out loud, and the essays about The Sims and the GNR tribute band alone make it worth the purchase price. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book started off wonderful and had me laughing out loud. And I continued laughing heartily into the first three chapters. Then, things went downhill for me, and while I still had a few laughs here and there it wasn't consistent.The central idea of this book is a great one. Take pop culture, something that interests nearly everyone, and write a critique of it and make comparisons with your own life. Really great idea. Where the problem lies here is that the subjects are so varied. I'd be reading a chapter about Saved by the Bell that was thoroughly enjoyable, and then you jump to sports. This is fine if you know all about everything he talks about, but if you don't...it's a really tough read. Klosterman makes the assumption that his reader knows everything about every subject he writes about down to the inside jokes. Herein lies a problem. It's hard for me to keep my interest in a subject if I have no idea what you're talking about.But hey, that's just my opinion. Other's may thoroughly enjoy this book, but for me, some parts were just lacking."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I couldn't help picking up Chuck Klosterman's Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto (Now With A Middle). I first became acquainted with the writing of Klosterman in his columns for Esquire magazine-he is always funny and interesting in his digressions of pop culture. He tackles everything from cereal, porn, video games (Simms City), sports (the Boston Celtics/LA Lakers rivalry as a means of self determination-why soccer is lame), music (the non-ironic virtues of Billy Joel, the travails of a Guns& Roses Tribute band, why country music will outlast other types of music), TV (extensive analysis of Saved By The Bell and The Real World), celebrities (why Pamela Anderson tells us who we are), generational analysis (Gen X and its relation to Star Wars, the unrealistic model of maleness in Lloyd Dobler-a character from the movie Say Anything), pop fascination with serial killers, the misconception of a biased media, the unusual world of rock critics, and religion (on the popularity of the Left Behind series of Christian novels. Most of this is quite entertaining, especially if you were born in between 1965-1975. I found myself laughing out loud a lot, but sometimes I was wondered if he really believes all of his cockamamie theories-because it sounds funny or ridiculous. However, several of the essays contain a certain logic. So in some ways the essays can be quite thought provoking. Here's a tidbit about how mass media affects relationships:\\" Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The Main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no \\"normal,\\" because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. You can't compare your relationship with the playful couple who lives next, because they're probably modeling themselves after Chandler Bing and Monica Geller. Real People are actively trying to live like fake people, so real people are no les fake. Every comparison becomes impractical. This is why impractical has become totally acceptable; impracticality almost seems cool. The best relationship I ever had was with a journalist who was as crazy as me, and some of our coworkers like to compare us to Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungeon. At the time, I used to think, \\"Yeah, that's completely valid: We fight all the time, our love is self-destructive, and-if she was mysteriously killed-I'm sure I'd be wrongly arrested for second-degree murder before dying from an overdose in her parents' basement.\\" We even watched Sid & Nancy in her parents' basement and giggled the whole time. \\"That's us,\\" we said gleefully. And that was the best relationship I ever had. And I suspect it was the best one she ever had, too.\\"At any rate, a fun, easy and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It is an honor to the be first to review this book on Amazon. This book is not exactly genius, but then again maybe it is. I can't tell what genius is anymore, but this is a kind of genius. Forget the review of the book that appears above from Publisher's Weekly (ok, not completely--they are right that Chuck shines when he is telling personal stories, but they say it is only half a good book). I throughly enjoyed Fargo Rock City and I loved this book of \\"low culture\\" essays. Of course, I probably loved it a great deal because I share some of Chuck's love for the minute cultural details of Gen X and the 1980s. His essay on Billy Joel is actually extraordinary. I love Billy Joel and constantly have to deal with people who tell me what a hack he is. Part of the joy of Chuck is that he revels in things people don't \\"respect\\" (he would say this with air quotes) and respects them because they are meaningful to him. His Saved by the Bell broders on the brillant. Perhaps the best essay in the entire book is the first one, \\"This is Emo\\" about how he will never fall in love because of all the \\"fake love\\" that movies have taught us to expect. He has some wild thoughts, but truly believes in what he says. He is not mean spirited either. He is honest and that rings true. The pop references are awesome of course. Are all the essays perfect? No, but even the weaker ones (the extended riff on alt-country music left me clueless) are often saved by strong passages that hit home. I put Chuck on par with my favorite essayists--Joe Queenan (this book is sort of the anti-Red Lobster, Blue Lagoon) and Sarah Vowell. However, Chuck is a voice all his own. He is the only rock critic I have ever respected. Trust me, that says a ton. Moreover, read the book. It is worth the price to hear an extraordinary voice of a generation."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"(or think they are)This may be a non-sequitur but Chuck's book jacket picture looks like Corey Feldman with blond highlights. (sorry, I just had to get that off my chest) An observation that's less off the wall than Chuck's fresh and crisp writing. He is also clever, funny, twisted, and articulate. His witty essays are full of non-sequiturs but skillfully manages to segue them all in a way that only this sharp Author can.Chuck's vocabulary is to die for. He drops tongue-twisters such as \\"iconoclast\\" like I would use the word \\"like\\". I had my dictionary handy for his use of the words \\"byzantine\\" and \\"zeitgeist\\".Unless you have been living isolated in a cave for these last 30 years, your feelings and passions will be affected by some if not all of his chapters. Each of these droll chapters are stand alone essay topics that are as various as the different channels on cable TV. I also enjoyed it when he shed light on some secrets of the famous and infamous that were either very juicy or just plain weird. Either way, very interesting.His wickedly keen observations range from The Sims phenomena (the most detailed and passionate essay I've ever read about a computer game) to why \\"Sports reporters hate sports\\". He not only takes you behind the scenes but into the minds of various professionals and personas in an uncannily honest and original voice. Before I read this book, I knew nothing about The Sims. I had no idea why my nephew wanted me to buy him this game for his birthday. Now I think I know too much. I finished the chapter with thoughts of God, existence and materialism swimming in my head. (The chapter began with a topic on a game for kids!)You begin each essay thinking Chuck will lead you to one general area, next thing you know this rascal has you questioning the odds on the roll of a dice. The funny thing is, you actually understand his odds predictions. He leaves you doubting everything you learned in that dreaded statistics course you took in College.Within each chapter, Chuck will touch upon something that you can't wait to share with someone you know because you know they will agree with Chuck's discourse on the movie Vanilla Sky or even his slight mention of the band sigur r&oacute;s. (Co-incidently, he does not mention the movie and the band in any related way or even in the same chapter but my favorite sigur r&oacute;s song is on the Vanilla Sky soundtrack. That's a killer soundtrack by the way.)But most of all, I just got the sense that he did not want you to blindly accept the printed word whether those words were on a napkin, a newpaper or the Bible. He doesn't care what you believe or don't believe, as long as that belief is informed and can survive under his under-the-microscope-examinations.He delivers all this in an easy to enjoy and digest, non heavy-handed, tongue-in-cheek way with a wink. But most of all, I just know that if he gets laid because of this book, he'll think this a success."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book did not let me down. Chuck is a talented, entertaining writer. I have bought this book for several friends to read also."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Were you aware that some people are so insecure and/or vacant that they adopt one-dimensional personalities and behavioral paradigms from popular works of fiction? Did you know that some relationships don't work out because the participants have an unrealistic notion of love due to watching too many movies? If so, you probably don't need to read this book. Even if you didn't know these things, you probably still shouldn't, because you might be naive enough to believe Klosterman's implication that these are somehow distinctly late-twentieth-century, television-era phenomena. Did you know that your musical tastes don't necessarily have to be governed by how \\"cool\\" the artist is, by how the genre and style would tend to affect your \\"image?\\" I would hope so, at least if you're over the age of 22. I read the blurbs about this book and thought to myself, \\"Maybe this is some undiscovered genius of a cultural critic who will really shed light on the modern experience.\\" Nope. Klosterman talks about behaviors that people have been exhibiting for millenia and pretends he's making new observations because he illustrates his points using semi-new pop culture products. This is hack work. If you're the kind of person who would be interested in reading a book on culture, you can probably skip this because you're probably already at least as observant as Klosterman. This truly is \\"low-culture,\\" but not in the way the author thinks."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This was my first experience with Chuck Klosterman and, man, this guy has a lot to say. His writing style is conversational, introspective and manic. He seems to pick two non-similar contemporary items (cereal, sex, for example) and just gets into a frenzy. Fortunately, he is a great writer. He is not some blogger hack that likes to rant. He can really write! He has had work published in was a staff writer for various publications including Spin, Esquire, GQ, The New York Times Magazine, The Believer, and The Washington Post.One of my favorite essays is entitled \\"George Will vs. Nick Hornby.\\" He answers the often repeated question, \\"why is soccer not as popular in America as other countries.\\" Great question. It seem like every ten years or so a columnist cites some statistics that indicate youth partition in soccer is never higher and this is the harbinger of a new wave of soccer fanaticism in USA. However, as always, TV. viewership of soccer matches is abysmal. What happened to all those little kids that played soccer? Klsoterman nails it. Basically, they were MADE to play soccer by mommies that want them to participate in sports. By the time they are old enough to choose their own hobbies, they hate soccer and never care to see a match again in their lives. In America, soccer has always been the sport that kids play that aren't good enough to play the other sports. As Klosteman more eloquently puts it: \\"To say you love soccer is to say you believe in enforced equality more than you believe in the value of competition and the capacity of the human spirit.\\" Kids that play soccer are the outcasts of others sports, therefore, \\"Mr. Pele's hopeless dystopia\\" will never be popular in America. Great stuff. Some of other questions that Klosterman poses and answers are:How is bland breakfast cereal related to our puritanical repressed sexuality?Why do sports writers hate athletes?Why are celebrities hard to interview?Why have reality shows turned real people into clich&eacute;s?How can a tribute band function in real society?He is the king of the divergent thinking as he seems to make connections among everything. Even the design of the book is a metaphor. The content is a mishmash of articles he wrote for various publications; kind of greatest hits, or more accurately, a mixed tape. At his best, Klosterman's writings encompass his love-hate relationship with reality. His stories often describe a coming to awareness by himself (for example his story about creating an avatar on SIMS and trying to make him happy) or of others (life as a member in a Guns n' Roses tribute band). He approaches contemporary cultural topics with humor (spiced with hilarity) and intelligence (with spurts of genius)."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"For his second book Sex, Drugs and Cocoa puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto, Klosterman put together what is basically a collection of pop-culture based short essays in which he investigates American culture for the most part, and himself. In his first effort, Fargo Rock City the book was more or less linear and felt more united whereas this is a collection of essays that still shows unity to each other because they're all about the same thing essentially, pop culture. I always thought that the way he got through was by demonstrating a point relating it to his personal life, whether he uses the band KISS or MTV's The Real World TV show it works, make us think or laugh to ourselves and comes across as effective. Most of Klosterman's books are at the core of it all, an examination of society through social and cultural events that may or may not be of some relevance to you, yet the author manages to constantly make good points and references. There's just a real honesty about Chuck that makes him sympathetic as an author and that also makes you want to like him as a person which is ultimately his strong point (and his willingness to give readers details about his personal life also helps).Some of the content may seem a little outdated by now because of changing times but some of the topics he covers are interesting and for the most part, reflective of pop culture or society at that point and that makes it relevant in itself. Personally, I can still relate or remember most of what is the book. Not everyone has played Sims or seen The Real World, but through Chuck's prose we understand them and the way he uses those pop culture references to examine either society, himself, or whoever it is he's talking about is always from an intelligent, well thought angle. He certainly provides enough to prove his points. The Pamela Anderson/Marilyn Monroe piece was somewhat striking and the angle he has on them and their impact on culture if you will, was dead onI don't think he will make every reader gain an appreciation for Billy Joel or that I agree entirely with his essay on the man but it doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and that he doesn't have strong points, kinda like most of the book come to think of it. Like how he compares the 1987 Lakers and Celtics to the Democrat and Republican parties respectively, it's just a fun angle he has and it's entertaining.It's not my favorite out of Klosterman's work but it's still a readable, fun, clever effort. I think the biggest problem is that although those essays are in their own ways all funny and good reads that make you evaluate society and how people think, Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs isn't as effective as it could or should have been. Instead of linking the essays together or making them cohesive with each other so that we get the bigger picture, we have for the most part a collection of well-written essays but unrelated to each other. Unfortunately it reads as such because they're all clearly separated from each other and. But with that said, it's still an entertaining read and Chuck remains as witty and clever as ever . This time around the topics are not just music related and the author's pop-culture scope is expended which adds another dimension to Chuck's writing.Klosterman himself in one his presentations on reading in North Dakota said that this was from an objective possibly his worst, because it was rushed and contradicted itself at times (like when he says that Pamela Anderson was the 1990's Marilyn Monroe and then proceeds to explain why but tells us that he hates when people compare the two, if that makes sense) etc. Yet it's also his best-selling work and many people enjoy it, and so do I. It's flawed but brilliant and if you're into Chuck's prose and his other books you'll love this one as well. If you're new to Chuck's work or something about pop-culture, it's still a good book but perhaps not the one I would start with. As a concept of a collection of cultural essays, Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs works rather well and some of the points explained through pop-culture are undeniably brilliant or at least engage the reader. As I said it's probably not as effective as some of his other work (at least to me) because although the content is good and interesting, the content is similar but not connected so it really feels as if you're reading a collection of essays. Pop culture junkies will find a lot to like here; I like it very much myself and it's a good read. Much of the ideas Klosterman proposes are still engraved in my head and have made for interesting conversation topics and debates. Not his finest, although some would disagree with me but I'd say it's worth it. 3 stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is a jaded individual and you can read that in this work especially, but regardless everything he wrote has a bitter taste of reality connected to it. This book has an interesting spin on the affect of social media and is worth giving a shot. The title might through some off, or interest others, but when you open it gets intense. I will definitely read other works by this author."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I read this book in one sitting and still go back and reread individual essays from time to time. The interesting thing about this collection is that it's so rare to see pop culture dissected in even a semi serious fashion. Usually people just talk about this kind of thing around the water cooler. But what makes Klosterman so successful is he takes the trivial and makes it entertaining. Some essays are better than others. The first one about Coldplay and fake love is a favorite of mine. But overall, there's more hits than misses, which isn't bad for a book with Cocoa Puffs in the title."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I love Chuck Klosterman's work, and this is my most favorite book of his, it helped me get through so much and i never get tired of reading it.

After all, now I have all his books. From the opening essay about Coldplay producing more fake love than the motor companies to a more in depth analysis of Saved By The Bell than you thought was possible, Klosterman is like a pop culture philosopher.

However, I don't love the redundancies and the critical analysis of things like the absence of Kelly Kapowski at the end of the \\"Saved by the Bell\\" run. He devoted way too much time to less than interesting topics which made the book drag on. There were some chapters that I absolutely loved, (Especially the one about knowing serial killers)and others that I really couldn't stand.

I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities. The author says that there's only one probability in life: 50/50, everything is either going to happen or not. So the odds of winning the lottery: 50/50. I assume that if you are capable of reading this review that you understand this is blatantly false.Maybe I should start writing books. Here's my first essay: we don't need weathermen. The weather tomorrow is either going to be hotter or colder than it was today. Three days from now it will either rain or not. I'm sure if I stretched that theory out, added some flowery language, and gave it a catchy title the new yorker would tell all their readers that they need to like my book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I was entertained by this book, I will give it that...and Chuck Klosterman is aware of that, which is part of the problem with his writing. He's much too pleased with himself and it comes across. I bought this book because it was popular and some revere the author as a god, and, as I said, Chuck Klosterman knows that. When you can read how smug someone is through the pages it's not exactly flattering. I do like his references to pop culture and I think he has a funny writing style, and, like I said, I was entertained, but I couldn't finish the book. I have that problem with Christopher Moore books, but at least Christopher Moore dials it back a bit, and though he can be a bit indulgent in his books, he never comes across as smug. Also, his part near the front of the book where he talks about pulling in hot girls with a few one-liners then how they eventually figure out he's a schlub who sleeps on a mattress on the floor, annoyed me. He's basically admitting he's a douche...but that doesn't even seem to quite register with him. At least with Tucker Max he is upfront that he's a douche, he's also good looking and a lawyer, so, this guy isn't trying to \\"trick\\" anyone. Where, I've met too many pathetic guys like Chuck K. who are really full of themselves, haven't seen a gym since the 5th grade, little to no maintenance or style, yet they only go after really hot women and expect them to fall for their feeble one-liners and really have nothing to offer after that. Trust me, any woman would rather hook up with a funny, good looking jerk, than a funny, schlub who is secretly a jerk, which is how Ben Affleck managed to land Jennifer Garner. So, I've never been compelled to read another of his books. I would much rather read McSweeny, check out a Kate Beaton cartoon, or attempt to read another Christoper Moore book. At least that way I'm entertained and not annoyed."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is a comedic, yet serious, gathering of essays by Chuck Klosterman. He covers very serious topics often from a new point of view with a very \\"Tell it how it is\\" kind of attitude. He really speaks his mind and isn't afraid to say something strange. My only complaint is that a few of the essays confused me as he does tend to ramble on and some I really had no idea what he was talking about."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Most attempts at addressing popular culture tend to follow the Aldous Huxley snobbery and the standard bearer ofAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Businessin which everything is looked upon with suspicion as part of a low culture that is rapidly turning everyone stupid. This makes sense as many of the academics discussing popular culture make their money from an elitism that allows their readers to think that they are smarter than the vulgar herds and the dirty underclass. Click your tongue in disgust at Jerry Springer and you're halfway to tenure. Place Jerry Springer and shows likeThe Wire: The Complete Seriesunder the same rubric and you are serious. Forget the fact that Shakespeare, Dickens, The Bronte Sisters and Charlie Parker were all once considered vulgar pop culture (the last by Aldous Huxley who hated jazz even as he wrote tedious books).In this scene, it's still a novelty to find a critic that takes pop culture seriously.Everything Bad is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smartercomes under sharp attack (by English teachers who can't write and rely way too heavily on \\"social science\\"-inspired studies of dubious merit) for stating television, video games, etc. are actually beneficial. Smart Web sites like The AV Club are shuffled aside. And pop culture critics like Nathan Rabin and Chuck Klosterman are more often dismissed as hipsters than taken seriously.This would be a shame as Klosterman is a hilarious and insightful writer. Some of his targets are pretty soft (like blaming his love life and the love life of every guy who has ever held on to a hopeless crush because friends do end up together onWhen Harry Met Sally) and some of them have the air of \\"are you kidding me?\\" (such as his chapter on The Real World where he happily supports the use of incidental music to announce the emotions that you are supposed to be feeling in every segment) but for every easy joke or strange observation, there are dozens of instances of insights so profound that they completely change the way you look at the artwork. Some of my personal favorites include the one about how Woody Allen gave nerdy guys a chance with hot women and how the fact that Billy Joel divorced the woman that he's singing about in \\"Just the Way You Are\\" is awesome because it means that no matter how much you think you might never love another, you are wrong.This is an excellent and intelligent book about pop culture that will survive long after several of the subjects are forgotten."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you enjoy pop culture, thoughtful commentary on social behavior, and the a witty author that can uniquely link the two, then you'll enjoy this book. Fun quick read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"A very enjoyable series of essays about pop-culture from a smart, clever, angry, and extremely talented writer who is a self-confessed junkie of all things Gen-X, Gen-Y, hipster, geekdom, nerdsville and otherwise.\\"Billy Sim\\" dissects the computer gaming phenom of The Sims; \\"Appetite for Repetition\\" takes an up-close-and-personal view of a Guns-n-Roses tribute band; \\"Being Zack Morris\\" explores the odd cultural obsession with \\"Saved By The Bell\\"; and 15 variously-themed essays delve into not only the psyche of Klosterman but, by extension, the psyche of America.In the trade paperback version, there are extra nuggets of Chuck-mania -- after each chapter, a quick shot of dialogue, banter, or, in the case of \\"23 Questions I Ask To Decide if I Can Really Love Them\\" (following Chapter 10) a hilarious, freaked-out rorshach test for the morally ambiguous. Not all the essays hit the mark, but the majority do, so a definite recommend. Cintra Wilson's book \\"A Massive Swelling: Celebrity Re-examined As A Grotesque Crippling Disease and Other Cultural Revelations\\" is funnier and wittier by far, but Klosterman works in a slightly separate universe that is equally satisfying."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I loved this book about pop culture and all it entails. Chuck Klosterman is clever and ridiculously knowledgeable, and he makes you feel like a part of the book. I could relate to so much of the stuff he said, so I guess we have all had a lot of the same experiences with pop culture. Even when I didn't really know what he was talking about (like, say, in the sports chapters), the way he wrote this book made me feel like I did. I only gave it four stars because it is a bit pretentious and obscure in parts, but it is definitely worth reading.Favorite chapter: Being Zack Morris. My only problem with that essay is that he underestimated the far-reaching influence of Saved by the Bell. I'm not kidding; I found that to be a serious flaw. He says, \\"Saved by the Bell is like this little generational secret that's hyperfamiliar to people born between 1970 and 1977, yet generationally unremarkable to anyone born after (and completely alien to all those born before.\\" I was born in 1986, and I have seen every episode of Saved by the Bell about a dozen times. I was very young when it first came on, but they re-ran it like crazy all through the '90s, and everyone my age watched it and still makes references to it (especially the caffeine pills episode). Even the parents of my generation got a good taste of it vicariously through us. I don't think Saved by the Bell can really be called a \\"secret\\" by any stretch of the imagination. If you were alive and in the U.S. in the '90s, you know about it. (I also wish timing had allowed him to know about the Screech sex tape before writing that essay, but I can't really blame Chuck for that...)So, try to focus on how insightful and enjoyable it is, and overlook the flaws if you can. I would definitely tell a friend!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman has obviously read plenty of Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. He seems to be trying to write the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY. I think he tries too hard, though. He's not writing his voice, he's writing an attempt to emulate the voice of other writers. He does a good job and the stories are interesting, but there is the soul of the writer missing from the book that you get when it's a writer's authentic voice and not an imitation. Even the best Elvis Impersonator is still and impersonator. If you want to read the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY, buy MY FRACTURED LIFE because it has that authentic voice. I'm not saying don't buy SEX, DRUGS, AND COCO PUFFS, just know you're going to see a tribute show."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is the clich&eacute;d, set-off-on-its-own, introductory statement of an essay.Here's the real start of the essay, in which dwells somewhat of a thesis. Mostly, though, this paragraph just starts the namedropping of and references to esoteric music or movies or sports figures. Expect this trend to continue through the whole piece. It's just like David Bowie stealing Scott Walker's shtick and scarf collection and running with it. Let's all just assume that makes sense, even though it only tangentially relates.Well, here we are at a paragraph in the middle 80% of the essay. Would you like some more nerdy humor that resides about a step in either direction away from your favorite obscure BBC show (and you thought I couldn't get a sideways reference to Absolutely Fabulous into this review! Silly you) that means so much to your life? And nothing here would be complete without a footnote that serves the same purpose as a parenthetical aside, only it disguises what's being said in some sort of intellectual cloak. Pretend there's a little \\"1\\" next to some word in this paragraph, just like we'll all pretend that Dangerous Toys didn't make any albums past their 1990 debut. Did I just randomly mention some forgotten 80's sleeze-metal band in hopes of being recognized for my unabashed love for that particular style of music? I guess I did. How postmodern. In fact, it's so postmodern that the word \\"postmodern\\" will show up throughout the whole book in what looks to be a unifying theme, but really just ends up being some buzzword to fall back on when discussing the concept of \\"reality.\\" For all the bashing of renowned hippie-school Evergreen, there sure is a lot of the same pointless, quasi-existential wandering going on here.That, of course, leads nicely into the \\"philosophy for shallow people\\" (Klosterman's phrase, not mine). Whereas it's actually pretty amusing and much more telling of an actual point to write about the personal anecdotes that relate to the topic at hand (The Real World, cereal, the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, etc), this paragraph will try to speak for an entire group of people in an attempt to decipher the hidden depth of things that supposedly have no depth. This will go on for pages, peppered with faux-modest shoulder-shrugs, profanity-placement more akin to that of a 13-year-old, and the unrelenting pop-culture references that never stop just like Sylvester Stallone never stops chewing on a wooden match in Cobra (not bad, eh?). While not being hypocritical, the writing here will have to be opinionated, yet noncommittal. Or maybe that's unfair and the information just isn't proven correctly. The oddly-preferred method of trying to measure up the effect of Billy Joel on a generation--as opposed to one person (the self)--is going backwards, but let's stick with it anyways. This middle part will continue as a retarded ideology maelstrom that consists of equal parts irony, authenticity, rock \`n' roll, and all of their opposites.Oh, the end. Before the last words, we'll need to slip some middle-finger comments in about how all the other experts and academics and iconoclasts that diverge from you and I are all missing-the-point, full of (quite possibly their own) s***, and leading a life that is based on the wrong kind of stuff, respectively. Finally, we'll tie this all together, but only after realizing that there really isn't that much to say about the chosen theme. At least not anymore than can be found in the blog of a snarky, jaded dude with an English degree who wants to feel as if the hours he's spent reading about serial killers wasn't all for naught. End with a quirky little last line that simultaneously asks for a disregarding of the entire essay as well as a faithful embrace of it.*************That's exactly what all of the essays in this collection read like, of course, and while the formula isn't criminal, the execution is. There's no problem with the idea of pop-culture having an effect on someone's life, and there's certainly nothing wrong with dissecting it on a personal level. I just feel that it can be done better. As a snarky, jaded dude with an English degree who wants to feel as if the hours he's spent absorbing the same sort of stuff as Klosterman, I wanted to relate to him by hearing about him, not by hearing about us (Chuck Klosterman, Ryan Werner, and anyone else that's between the ages of 23 and 38). Effective writing almost always works to achieve the universal through the personal, not the universal through the universal. If you want to talk about God, you don't just talk about God. You start at the car wash and work your way to God. I'm only sort of saying that Klosterman is a lazy writer, and it's not even the prose that really bothers me. To write about pop culture's place in regard to the question of \\"what does it all mean?\\" (or, as the book prefers, \\"What is reality?\\") means a direct pathway through the person explaining it, with the conclusions left to be drawn by the reader.I liked this collection a bit more than I'm letting on, but it certainly doesn't sit well after turning the last page. Klosterman tried to tell me what I know, and he was usually wrong. However, if he had just told me what he knows, I couldn't have been convinced otherwise, regardless of whether or not I agreed with it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is the second book of Klosterman's I've read. The first, and my introduction to Klosterman, was \\"IV.\\" I like both these books equally and for similar reasons. In here, Klosterman observes seemingly mindless and inconsiquential tidbits and expands upon them in a way that inflates their importance to unprecedented levels; i.e. how \\"Saved by the Bell\\" is familiar to anyone in the X or Y generation, but totally alien to anyone outside those specific demographics.Chuck might have you question the real importance of his subjects, but he is always a fun read (except maybe \\"Fargo...\\") and he is, more often than not, and more often than most, insightful and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Face it... you'll love this book or hate it... unless you can enjoy it for what it is and then disgard of it immediately after... then you'll be as ambivalent as I am about this title.Readers who enjoy it: you are vapid and so deeply immersed in pop culture and self un-aware that you are to be parodied for your complete identification w/ this work (the author himself would... and does--thus, the true meaning underlying the subtitle).Readers who deplore it: you are justified in your distaste of it... but only if you are so serious about yourself that you lose sight of what it is you are reading in the first place.

This book cleverly dissects pop culture with a razor eye and slices up everything that's hip, serving it back to us in a slightly recognizable form. From the first page on, I was hooked, hooked to the 26 questions that actually sent me reeling in deep contemplation, to the segue on the similarities between apples and oranges, to the existential dilemmas of The Sims characters, to the Real World, to Pamela Anderson. I could recognize these cultural landmarks, but in the author's skillful hands, they were transformed into brilliance. From on, I know I'll know never to look at pop culture in the same way.

On the other hand if you are a Generation X person it is probably very funny."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I read this book on a plane flight home from Philadelphia. It is perhaps the \\"best book ever written\\". I put this in quotes because for the most part that is a vast overstatement and cliche platitude which a person could easily use to describe this book. The only difference is, I mean it!!!There were moments where I cried laughing and I think the woman next to me (who was watching Shrek II on her portable DVD player) may have thought I was a lunatic.I can't wait to read the new book which, by the way, you can buy here at Amazon.com.P.S. Chuck, if you are reading this... come to LA and I will buy you a beer."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This guy is hilarious, when he doesn't go behind the year 1996. I am only 17, so I didn't really get some of the stuff he was talking about simply because it was before my time. I didn't get the Lakers/Celtics rivarly or the stuff about Billy Joel or some of the music fads of the late 80's and early 90's, but I do watch reruns of Saved by the Bell and have The Sims and eat cereal, so I understood that much and a few other subjects, and I generally enjoyed reading his view of things. I was really suprised when I was not offended by his view of \\"born-again Christians\\", as he likes to call us. He manages to poke fun at us without really being completly against what we're standing for. He made me laugh out loud with his last chapter about the Left Behind series (which I loved) and about what I believe. I knew people thought like he does about us anyway, and he presented them in an amusing way. I suggest this book if your over the age of 24 strongly, but any younger and you might be bored by it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's collection of essays never failed to be anything less than humorous, insightful, and thought-provoking.

It is a great book, but because the topic seems very silly (the cultural significance of the real world) it could easily be written off. The biggest shock is, it is true. We want to quickly brush off that there is significance in pop culture.. but it is our culture, as much as we want to hate it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As a big fan of Chuck's first book \\"Fargo Rock City\\", I was a little let down by his newest essay book. Some of the reviewers seem to be amazed by Chuck's memory of obscure trivia but if you think about it everyone can remember a certain song and who sang it, an obscure sports player and his or her claim to fame, or what type of engine came stock in a 1972 Corvette. All Chuck did was think of something obscure, contemplate it for a few minutes, went on the internet to get the rest of the information and to make sure he was correct and then wrote a short essay. I'm not downing Chuck for this or his book but I'm not going to give him high praise either. There were some interesting essays and then there were a few \\"soggy\\" ones. More importantly, was some of the essays that I liked or found interesting were ones I actually disagreed with. But as with music or art, if something makes you think and have a discussion with your friends or family than it should be given its' kudos. Thus, I give 3.5 stars. There were also some topics in this book that were brought up in his first book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It is kind of unfortunate when journalists take themselves too seriously. In Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs, Chuck Klosterman basically tries to show everyone how many useless pieces of pop trivia he can cram into one sentence and make it sound relevant. While this can make for some interesting and funny comparisons, on the whole, the book was self-aggrandizing and really not worth the effort. Contrary to the subtitle, this is not a book about culture, but about how the author believes that because he thinks something is cool, it is culturally significant.He whines about the fact that all of the best artist and musicians in the country seem to come from middle-America, but his home turf gets none of the recognition. He attempts to claim that the only movies that will really \\"matter\\" are those that he liked. He takes on celebrity in the least meaningful ways imaginable. Yet still, the book is well written and at times hilarious. Why? I don't know.If you like reading funny writing with a faux-philosophical bent, this book is for you. If you actually care about anything, I'd suggest passing on the Cocoa Puffs."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This Book is boring not funny and defenitely no worth to read. Don't waste your time"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I thought Chuck was right on the money with so many of the essays in this book. I am fascinated by his thought process and find his work to be highly enjoyable. He seems to be able to articulate the meaning of life's most random thoughts. If you like to think about why people play a life simulation game called, \\"the Sims\\", or ask yourself who listens to Billy Joel than I think you would enjoy this book. Then you need to really look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you had a VCR that could tape your dreams but the only way to view the footage would be to sit down and watch it all of your friends and family would you do it? I think you know the answer."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Although I have a penchant for fiction, this book is very high on my list of works to recommend to other avid readers. Nobody can make a point quite like Chuck Klosterman. Granted, he sometimes supports his opinion by saying (in essence), \\"I believe this, therefore it must be so\\" -- but even then, he's so damn believable. (More often than not, though, he provides more than enough evidence to support his claims and opinions.) Chuck's essays in this compilation are easy to read, thought-provoking, humorous, insightful, and just plain fun. I'm a sucker for pop culture, and this book helps me feel better about that, in a way. It gives me proof that my intellectual side can somehow coincide with my lighter, more bubble-gum (read: guilty-pleasure) side. Thanks for that, Chuck -- and also for making me laugh and think at the same time. In my experience, that's rare."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sometimes I read or purchase a book simply because of the title. That's how I discovered the writings of Don Miller (PRAYER AND THE ART OF VOLKSWAGON MAINTENANCE) and that's how I discovered the writings of Chuck Klosterman. I was browsing through a bookstore at the airport in Portland, Oregon waiting for my departure time to draw near. I had already read the book I had brought with me on the trip here and now I needed something to read on the way home. What to do, what to do. And then I saw this quirky little title, SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS. \\"Cool title,\\" I thought and I bought the book.SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS isn't quite like any other book I've ever read. I've read essays on pop culture (heck, I've even written a few myself) and I've read books that contained several essays about pop culture. However, this is an entire book of essays about pop culture. Not only that, but each aspect of the culture that is examined isn't something that is normally even discussed. When one understands that and then also realizes that each essay either evokes some deeper understanding of reality or has an important point to make, then one begins to see how great a book SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS is.Klosterman examines such ideas in this book as why even though Billy Joel is great he will never be cool, why Pamela Anderson is the post-modern Marilyn Monroe, how WHEN HARRY MET SALLY has screwed up more men and women and their relationships than any other romantic movie in cinema history, the differences between Laker people and Celtic people and why its important to know the difference, how THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a representation of what it means to be a Gen-Xer, and why even though SAVED BY THE BELL was one of the most un-realistic tv shows ever made it portrayed a very realistic concept about modern life. In pontificating and deconstructing these various aspects of our culture, Klosterman uses plenty of very personal stories that help tie things together. Of course, along the way he also throws in allusions from everything to ALLY McBEAL to THE DARK CRYSTAL to Guns N' Roses to MOMENTO and Radiohead and uses some really big words such as \\"iconoclast\\", \\"byzantine\\", \\"rapscallion\\", \\"solipsism\\", and \\"voracity\\". I found this vocabulary invigorating, but some might be turned off by it and think that Klosterman is purposely trying to be ironic--writing about things that people never normally write about but using big words in those writings to come up with some pretty amazing conclusions. To be honest, I find very little in this book to be ironic. Instead, I find it to be a very fascinating and extremely interesting read. Highly recommended for self-proclaimed \\"geeks\\" everywhere."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"There are two reasons to read this book and two reasons to not read this book. Firstly, the style of writing. The writing is wonderful. I enjoy the style. You really get the feeling that a highly intelligent Gen X journalist is sitting there in your living room in his jeans ant T-shirt and telling you his observations. If that style drives you crazy (in a bad way), you will know it from the sample and can save your money. If that styles drives you crazy (in a good way), you will know it from the sample and safely give B&N your money. Secondly, the wise observations of our modern world. His observations of the absurdity and ridiculousness of current culture is astute. Yes, he over-analyzes, but he does so in an entertaining way. If you think modern mainstream media and culture is awesome, then avoid this like a zombie plague. If you think modern mainstream media and culture are absurd, then this will be a very entertaining and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This was the first Chuck Klosterman book that I have read and i can promise you that it will not be my last, and if you read this also then it will not be your last either. As you read this you discover that Chuck Klosterman has an amazing way of putting things that we would never think of ourselves. From Pamela Anderson to The Sims Chcuk Klosterman talks about it all in this very up-beat and self-fulfilling book. I will not explain much about this one because i do not want to ruin any of it for anyone, and with that being said i do promise you it is an amazing book that you must read.

Just an all a round good read!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you've never read Chuck Klosterman, this is a great introduction; if you are familiar with - and enjoy - his work, then this is a must-read. Klosterman's unique, oftentimes hilarious social commentary is on prominent display in this collection of essays ranging from music to Pamela Anderson to soccer to serial killers. My personal favorite was the essay \\"Billy Sim (reality interlude),\\" an essay about the human relationship with the much-heralded computer game, The Sims.Klosterman is at his best when discussing inane topics such as Pamela Anderson or soccer, where he makes observations or comments on popular beliefs that have little or no relevance or consequence in our lives. At times, he can be self-righteous, as if he is the only one smart or creative enough to come up with some of these things, but it really boils down to a formula in most of these essays:1. Chuck identifies a common social belief/acceptance2. Chuck at first states that he disagrees with this premise based on why everyone thinks it.3. Chuck then tells you the real reasons why the prevailing social belief is true.While this comes off as self-righteous as I said before, not all his essays follow this formula. Additionally, his true genius shines through in his random running commentary that he makes in trying to prove his point. He is quite hilarious, and despite his occasional pretentiousness, very funny.In the end, Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs* is an easy-to-read collection of essays that, if not highly informative at times, is at least highly entertaining and will make you think about the world in which you live. A great book to read if you only have a few moments here and there or if you have all the time in the world."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you're into pop culture then this is something you really want to put on your must read list. Klosterman writes on everything from the effect of Woody Allen and John Cusack movies on his relationship troubles to whether or not your stance on the Lakers-Celtics rivalry is a sign that you might be a racist. One caveat, be prepared to have Klosterman's fantastic wit probably skewer something you hold near and dear. But if you're ready to roll with the occasional jab to the things you like you realize that Klosterman is punching away with kid gloves--I mean the man admits his love for the TV classic \\"Saved by the Bell\\" (and rightly so!)--so how mean can he really be?Short chapters interspersed with even shorter interludes help make this a light and easy read, and most likely a great conversation starter."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"OK. I am not a drug user...not that being a drug user is a necessary, or even desirable trait to possess while reading and enjoying this book. I was put off by the title originally when I was recommended this book. As a result, I waited way to long to read it. I actually didn't become a Chuck Klosterman fan until I read his monthly articles in Esquire magazine. Finding myself completely engrossed with his writing style and flare for randomness (is that a word?), I was hooked. I picked up Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs and immediately loved it.It is not a cohesive story, but rather a collection of essays ranging from such topics as his hatred of soccer to the wisdom in the popular sitcom Saved By the Bell. I believe anybody between the ages of 21-35 will instantly relate with this self proclaimed Gen Xer. If you read this book, you will laugh, think and pretty much have a ready made comment for any party or social event that you attend. If you love pop culture at all, do yourself a favor and pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In the book \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" Chuck Klosterman has written a series of essays that compare miscellaneous pop culture happenings to social interactions and events. The book is entirely enjoyable with no section of the book ever getting boring. The first \\"chapter\\" starts off with a bang with Klosterman relating to how he has problem with relationships because of John Cusack and Coldplay and thier spread of \\"fake love\\". From there we get chapters on the ties and connections between Pam Anderson and Marilyn Monroe along with the Dixie Chicks and Van Halen. He also gives us a first hand account of his dabbling with \\"The Sims\\". The book is a fairly easy read - you don't have to worry about having a out-of-this-world ig to understand and like the book. It would help to have some basic knowledge of pop culture though.I would reccomend this book to college students and up. If you grew up during the eighties you will make a lot of personal connections to the book and be able to relate to it more. Chuck Klosterman does a good job of mizing old and new pop culture references so that most people can relate and have a connection to the book.As for any other miscellaneous info on the book and Klosterman? Well, I read this book in my senior year of high school and since then I find myself picking up and reading excerpts out of it from time to time - its a great plane read.After reading this I picked up Klosterman's first book \\"Fargo Rock City\\" and I suggest reading this book before that one. \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" is overall a better written book and I found that this book was easier to make a connection to since he has more recent pop culture references. I don't know that much about hair bands and so it was harder to read \\"Fargo Rock City \\" and understand all of the subtle nuances. So if you want to read one of his books pick up this one first and then try \\"Fargo Rock City\\"."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's book was well worth the price on the cover. His essays are very witty; any book that makes you laugh out loud several times is definitely a keeper. The stories are insightful looks at the things that seem to mean so little but always seem to mean so much- television shows, video games, music, and others. Also of interest are the brief \\"asides\\" between each essay, which give even smaller portions of Klosterman's wit.The reason I hesitate to give this book the full five stars is that it seemed a bit uneven to me- that is to say, not all the essays were of the same caliber. However, the best ones are good enough to make you forgive some of the ones that never quite click."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I expected a weak treatise on modern media, and was surprised by an honest, sometimes dark and always entertaining view of pop culture.Traversing from Saved by the Bell, to the Sims to the evil of When Harry Met Sally, Klosterman observes our mass culture, and makes sense of what it means to us. What succeeds in the mass media environment does tell a lot about us, and this book brings some solid points of view to it. View it as a lower brow version of Bobos in Paradise.The book reads quickly and well, as you're drawn into finding his jaded and barbed opinions on all these cultural icons. It'll go quick, and give you a new lens to view what's popular around us."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I can't say I have ever read anyone who comes close to speaking to the generation that I am part of, like Klosterman does. Let's face it, it's a generation that has fond memories of Screech and can count GI Joe as a childhood friend. As such, it's different than any other time, and deserves different treatment, and even different language.This collection of essays touches on points that seemingly come up all the time, but not to the level that Klosterman examines them. His look into why and digressions on it, makes this one brilliant book. I am telling everyone I know about this book, I believe so strongly in it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"\\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is an essay collection that draws comparisons between popular culture and important social and interpersonal issues. It also happens to be extremely witty at times. Chuck Klosterman is a writer for Spin magazine, so he clearly knows pop culture and can write quality essays. The best of his work here truly encapsulates life. Who cannot relate to this quote? - \\"Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less.\\" That profundity, by the way, is from an essay that discusses the merits of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"; another section proffers the genius of Billy Joel. Yes, Klosterman is a bit of a hipster geek.Pop culture references are sprinkled throughout the book, but sometimes it stretches a bit too much for the sake of a clever analogy. In the forward, Klosterman assserts that, at times, he feels as though \\"everything is completely connected.\\" Unfortunately, he is not adept enough to make all of his essays into a cohesive whole (as other reviewers have noted). Ultimately, the book feels like a loose collection of unrelated but very funny skits. Although that debit doesn't sink the book, it does lessen its impact. In addition, Klosterman is sometimes too self-aware for his own good; several times, he makes reference to liking something \\"unironically\\" - such as \\"Saved by the Bell.\\" His definitive goal seems to be achieving irony. While this credo certainly makes \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" a funny read, it can become rather tedious as well. Overall, I'd recommend this book, but with reservations."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Yeah, that title pretty must covers it.Klosterman's essays are chock full (and I hate to use this term) of Gen-X references to everything we've grown up loving.Now, these aren't essays ON Saved by the Bell and Pamela Anderson, but rather, he uses cultural icons as a jumping off point for rambling, funny and (uh-oh) thought provoking discussions. Klosterman is the kind of guy that you would want to hang out with at a party. Look. You're either going to love this book or you're not. You're either to find the tangential, rambling essays endearing and interesting, or simply tangential and rambling.So what kinds of subjects are you in for? How about the Tori Paradox in which Klosterman deconstructs the idea of Tori on Saved by the Bell? One season, after Tiffany Amber Thiessen and Elizabeth Berkley had left for more naked pastures, Tori shows up. And then, just before a graduation special that was to air on NBC, Tori was gone. And Kelly and Jessie were back. Klosterman argues that Saved by the Bell is a lot like life. First people are there, and then they're not - gone. Only to be forgotten and at the most, vaguely remember. Of course, Klosterman explains much better than me.Just the pure assault of pop-cultural references was enough for me. It's not uncommon for Klosterman to reference such diverse items as the music of Radiohead, Who's the Boss and Trix cereal all in one essay. And I wouldn't be exalting his references if he was just throwing them out. They actually mean something to the people that grew up in the post-Boomer era..."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Glad this was a collection of essays, rather than a novel. I don't think I would have been able to make it through a novel of this type of writing. Also made it easy to read while on the pot.The essays start out with brilliance (especially the first two, about romance and The Sims, respectively), but my interest in them fizzled out. There are a few bright points here and there in the remaining essays (the essay about serial killers and our fascination with them is dead on). There is no doubt Klosterman is an adept writer, can pinpoint emotions, and locate intermittently with a witty finger the pulse of certain social issues (like what the hell tribute bands are all about and WHY). But the tone in which he does so is sometimes reminiscent of...how shall I put it? A smart-ass thirty-year-old who thinks he is very clever with his observations, and justifies it by saying he is a Gen X'er and entitled to his lofty superiority. In other words, if you read Klosterman, you're just the type of person he'd look down on.In trying to deconstruct pop culture, Klosterman sometimes comes across as believing himself an expert about everything American. He also has no qualms about insulting outright the very audience reading his book. Even though he jokes in the beginning that he writes these things late at night in a state of near-delirium, you still get the impression he thinks he is, as he might put it, the &quot;uber-mensch&quot;.Some of the essays are so specialized that I had absolutely no interest in reading them, and skipped right over them as I realized the entire essay was absorbed in deconstructing, say, basketball heroes. So I can't really say I enjoyed the entire book - some of it was unintelligible to me; hence, 3 stars (IMHO).True, Klosterman has been saturated with pop culture through his research and work with major magazines, but most of his off-the-cuff opinions are just that -- opinions and rantings rather than hard facts supported by any type of references, so keep in mind that you're reading personal essays, rather than research articles.Perhaps I was tainted, since I had just finished reading half of Michael Moore's &quot;Stupid White Men,&quot; and the entire of Jon Krakauer's &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven,&quot; so one more book illustrating the hopeless stupidity of the human race may have caused me unfair irritation.Strong essays for the most part, well written, but I lost interest and read them very patchily throughout the last half of the book because the tone grated on my nerves."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As far as I can tell, there are only two explanations for this book. Either Klosterman was trying to write a satire of what a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole, would write in a series of essays or Klosterman is a self-important, but not very intelligent a**hole. I'm going w/ the later.Just a few examples:- In one of the essays Klosterman argues that soccer will never make it big in America. On this point we agree. His argument based on his failure as a little league baseball coach. Apparently, Klosterman tried to be one of those hyper-intense coaches who tried to work out his own personal daddy issues by trying to turn a team of 9 year olds into a finely tuned baseball machine. Because this didn't work out, and Klosterman might have a problem with women, soccer will never make it big in America. Um, okay.- Klosterman's discussion of math and probability would embarass a stoned 16 year old with it's facile reasoning.- Like other writers of his generation, of which I am part, Klosterman has somehow confused an obsession with, and Rainman like recall of, certain pop culture elements (cereal, Saved by the Bell, The Real World)with actual knowledge and understanding. Perhaps one day he will read a book or see a movie created before the 1960s."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is constantly making references to conversations he's had at parties, which is appropriate since there seems to be a \\"Klosterman\\" at every hipster party I've ever been to... The guy who is funny for the first five minutes you meet him, interesting for the next ten, and then offensively pedantic and self absorbed for the next three hours before you realize you're really either too old or too well adjusted to keep going to these damn hipster parties in the first place.I only finished this book out of a sense of duty to the 9 dollars and 99 cents I spent to download this adolescent diatribe to my Nook. Klosterman's an intellectual lightweight with a Mohammad Ali sized personality, which is why the ideas in the book are forgettable , but the voice of the author sticks with you like gum on the bottom of your shoe. I felt like I was stuck in a room with Rush Limbaugh, if Rush Limbaugh was a tad funnier and a tad smarter but just as obnoxious, sexist, solipsistic, and frivolous.Do not buy this book. Go to the book store, skim the essay about The Sims (which, like so many of these essays, already feels dated but, unlike the rest, is actually though-provoking), and move on with your life and your wallet."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I decided to read this book after considering the many positive reviews along with the accolades of several independent book sellers. I shouldn't have. I'm not going to say this book is bad, but its certainly not anywhere near being good either.This book is a self-described manifesto, which it is not. It is the inane ramblings of someone who does not suffer from lycantrophy. It is dysfunctional, poorly written, and is essentially about nothing at all. I liken it to a Seinfeld episode, in print form, but without the distraction that comes from actual humor or entertainment value. In hind site, I'm starting to wish Klosterman did suffer from lycantrophy.If you don't believe me, I will let a Chuck Klosterman quote from the book serve as a one line synopsis:\\"Do you not see what I am no longer not saying to you? If so-congratulations!\\""},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"It was impossible to read these essays and not imagine that they were typed as spouted, realtime, by a smart, overcaffeinated english major sitting on a couch in a dormitory. You can almost see the (cheap, industrial) carpeting and hear the 'k-cchunk' of the vending machine in the background.This can be fun, but what we all learned in college is that it's important not to take couch-speaker-guy's opinions as seriously as he takes them. That's the case here, too. Klosterman guesses at things when ninety seconds of googling would have given him the facts; he makes assertions and then, rather than backing them up, goes on to further assertions, possibly in hopes that you'll be too busy trying to keep up to start poking holes in his argument; and every now and then, despite his open contempt for people who use words without understanding their meanings, he does this himself (e.g. describing this collection as a 'manifesto')."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I have a 30 yo barely single professional son. He says this book is his Bible - so I read it. What better way to find out who or what this boy worships?Klosterman is an entertaining writer, serving up a unique critique of post-modern popular culture. Although each essay contains a major theme, over 400 individual entries are in the index - songs, movies, personalities from all entertainment venues, sitcoms, concepts, rock bands, periodicals, organizations, events - even a little religion thrown in for the \\"Left Behind\\" crowd.*Billy Joel is popular because he's so good, he doesn't have to be cool - whereas the usual rock band doesn't have to be exceptional if they are consistently cool.*Our author got fired from being a Little League baseball coach one high school summer for trying too hard to win. I'm just impressed when a high school kid takes on that kind of responsibility - but you may have to consider an \\"enhancement factor\\" for this story.*excerpts about self-delusion, evolutionary psychology, and philosophy - without the formal terminology, especially in his bit about Woody Allen. He wouldn't be interested in a girl uncool enough to be interested in him.*tribute to Guns 'N Roses as he travels with a band trying to duplicate their songs and general funk.*instructions on how to be a conversationalist (he has enough material for three dates only): \\"First, make an intellectual concession (makes listener comfortable). Next, make a completely incomprehensible but remarkably specific 'cultural accusation' (makes you insightful). Finally, end the dialogue by interjecting slang lexicon that does not necessarily exist (makes you contemporary). Example: When talking about sports: I mean, come on - you just know that Rodney Rogers is sitting in the locker room before every game reading Nietzsche, and he's totally thinking to himself, \\"If Ron Artest tries to step to me one more time, I'm gonna slap jack his brisket, Philly style.\\"A pervasive nihilistic attitude runs through this book - the angst of single yuppy-hood, deliciously judgemental, documenting the rites of final passage toward marriage, responsibility, and adulthood. I liked it."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"And that \\"certain generation\\" includes me. I think Klosterman is maybe one year younger than me, so I understood virtually all his pop-culture references. The Sims, Saved by the Bell, The Real World, Lloyd Dobler. If you don't know what any of these are, you probably should skip this book. If you do, you should probably read it.I've never read anything by Klosterman before, but I don't know why. I laughed through the whole book. I see some people didn't like the ending chapters, but one of my favorite sections was actually near the end, on what you should really be afraid of in terms of the media (hint: it's not the \\"liberal media\\" bias everyone talks about). I wanted to copy that section and send it to at least 5 of my friends.Also great, though not particularly unique, is his view on why people today have unsatisfying relationships. I've long held similar theories (that we're constantly bombarded by unrealistic ideals of love through movies/music/television), but he presents it better and funnier than I ever could.Do I think, say, my mom would enjoy this book? No. Do I want to give a copy of it to all my friends? Yes."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book of various essays on pop culture is nearly priceless. Klosterman finds so much relevance in so many throw away items in items in pop culture at times its astonishing. And hilarious. I never thought Saved By the Bell or MTV's Real World could inspire even an interesting paragraph, but Klosterman finds a way to show the significance of these items at the same time conceding their banality in two excellent essays. It's very impressive.The essay on breakfast cereal was completely mindless, and completely laugh out loud funny, especially the descriptions of the socialogy and psychology of various cartoon characters in breakfast cereal ads.Klosterman will take positions you'd never think he'd defend, like describing the brilliance of Billy Joel. I can barely tolerate this artist, but Klosterman has made me reconsider him, and frankly, he was about the last person I'd expect to do this. Nor does he take himself too seriously, as he describes his attendance at a Pop Music Conference for academics and music critics, which he totally skewers, even though he readily admits the conference is made for people like him.And sprinkled through the book are some very insightful comments and insights about the human experience. And Klosterman clearly exposes his personal weaknesses throughout.Is it perfect? No. There are moments where Klosterman comes across like somebody drunk or stoned at a party who thinks he knows it all, and clearly doesn't. Not all of the essays are great. A comparison between Marilyn Monroe and Pamela Anderson as the representative sexpots of their generation isn't anywhere near as profound as Klosterman thinks it is, and is about twice as long as it should be. And the chapter slamming soccer is a pointless, claiming that his experience as a youth baseball coach made him realize how soccer has failed in America. Uh-huh.Let me digress that in the United States, many go to endless lengths to say why soccer in un-American, or fails to capture are collective interest, or will fail as a sport, when the fact of the matter is, the just don't get it. In other countries, people will freely admite they \\"don't get\\" baseball or American football, but Americans feel we need to go to endless lengths to avoid saying \\"I don't get soccer\\". You might say Klosterman inspired me to write this commentary on his commentary.But ANYWAY, read this book, laugh a lot, look at the world a different way, and enjoy a few nuggets of wisdom."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Since cracking open the spine of David Sedaris' Naked, I have had a newfound love for the art of the essay. A friend loaned me this copy, with the advice, \\"Just wait till you get to the Zack Morris part!\\" Despite my temptation, I did read the essays in consecutive order. And overall, this is a funny collection - yes, the Zack Morris essay was definitely my favorite, but I also enjoyed the large section of hypothetical questions. The book is definitely heavy on MTV's Real World references, which didn't interest me as much as Saved By The Bell. I found the collection to be a bit uneven, with some essays definitely stealing the limelight more than others - like the one on the \\"serial killer connections\\"! It will be interesting to see what other topics Klostermann will tackle."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"If you are at the very least familiar with pop culture humor, you are probably know about Chuck Klosterman. I'm not insinuating that you've read all of is works or anything like that, but perhaps you've heard his name before.In \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs,\\" he touches on just about every facet of American society you can think of, from the media to politics to \\"Saved by the Bell\\" to Lakers v. Celtics to a Guns and Roses tribute band. And I left out the other 65,251 pop culture references, many of them music-related in some way.There's no doubt that Klosterman is an excellent writer. His sentences seem to always be the right length, his information and tone is engaging and he gives the reader the opportunity to think along during the travel of any particular column.The only complaint I have is that he overuses irony; and in some places, I don't even think irony applies. I lost count, but it appeared that every column in this book tried to portray irony, which, as a writer, is definitely a good thing to utilize. However, most readers are intelligent enough to decipher some irony, and not need to be reminded of it on every fifth page.I would recommend \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs\\" to anyone who is at least vaguely familiar to American culture, with emphasis from the late '70s to the early '90s. If not, you'll probably miss a lot of the jokes. Oh the irony ... er wait, that's not ironic at all."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While the language used is simple, giving an appropriate amount of time to the concepts presented required me to set it down and think for a few hours in between chapters. I am torn by this novel. Klosterman is the pied piper of popular culture. I found myself easily drifting towards his school of thought without any protest or hesitation. However, when I finally scrutinized the ideas he was presenting, I realized that I didn't agree with about half of what he was saying. I don't think that the power of the internet and technology is exemplified in amateur porn, but rather a grandfather texting, or youtube.As an artist I am jealous of pop stars and icons. Beyonce will have an opportunity to reach millions more than my art will. For this reason I wanted to read this book. I wanted a serious dissection of popular culture. For the most part, I got it. I loved the sections on The Sims and cover bands. I found those to be the most interesting and have the most implications to my life.I would recommend this book to those who think that pop culture has nothing valid to offer, or those who are obsessed with pop culture. I don't know if I would give it to anyone in between."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I love the style of writing in this book.

Great and fast shipping."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman's evident opinions prevail over sound logic most of the time in this analysis of 90s pop culture. i found it hard to take anything he said seriously after his rant about soccer, which was nothing more than an ignorant diatribe surely founded out of some insecure fallacy. However, this is not to say that some of the sociological implications discussed in his essays did not make for thought-provoking literary fare..."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I listened to this book on CD; it is read by the author, and there were moments in which I felt that he spoke directly to me... moments in which I laughed out loud at the aptness of his words, or even at the ridiculous truths of our generation... at other moments I thought he was profoundly self-absorbed and sarcastic. But that's Gen X for you. I kinda want to get the book in print just so I can quote it to people; I especially enjoyed his description of how the movie \\"Say Anything\\" ruined women for real relationships."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"A fond reflection and provocative portrait of the culture in which you were raised. Right on and an extremely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I really enjoyed this book for one reason: looking at things that would otherwise be mundane and extrapolating philosophy from them until they become relevant. It's something me and my friends do quite often such as suggesting how different Pok&eacute;mon reflect people we know in real life. Who knew that talks about MTV's Real World, Billy Joel, Saved by the Bell, or the Sims could help us figure out ourselves. I admit that this book is probably geared towards the college-aged crows, as many of the references are things that we either grew up with or know about.Though this book comes across as a cynical, comedic work (and trust me, it does), it has an odd way of being very profound with its assessments on life. I really liked the social commentary that talks about the world that will live in today, with people being shown on the mass media as flat and static characters to be more easily understood.The best parts of the book were actually when he wasn't talking about the topic on hand. Sometimes Klosterman would get off topic and start talking about esoteric revelations of how people come to label themselves; hilarity usually ensued.The essays might not flow from one chapter to the next, but every one will have you thinking and laughing."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Readers who take Chuck Klosterman at his word will have a hard time with this one.
