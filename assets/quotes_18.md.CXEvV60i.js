I was written in the early part of the 1900s but it does not seem dated at all. This book describes the 'way out' of your troubles. It does so from a spiritual foundation. It is one of a few books which helped me find a more productive attitude towards life and it is consistent with more current works like &quot;Emmanuel's Book&quot;, and &quot;Conversations With God.&quot;This book is a collection of several shorter works: - The Way Out - The Way Beyond - Wealth - The TeacherI have been seeking truth for a long time and I had collected a few really great books when a new friend told me about this series. The same anonymous author wrote over 4 books, all of which are fabulous. They were before their time and might have been lost if not for DeVorss &amp; Company Publications. Now the internet makes it possible for many more people to discover these gems. I love this group of books. I am deeply indebted to the author for sharing such essential wisdom and truth.The same anonymous author also wrote these other books: - The Impersonal Life - Brotherhood - The Way to the Kingdom"},{"Title":"The Way Out: The Way Beyond - Wealth - The Teacher","review":"The message of this book is very profound.The author speaks about many topics .I want to mention one of the concepts .I was really impressed by the words &quot; Whatever you hold in consciousness , will manifest into your body and affairs&quot; . This reminds me of Paramahansa Yogananda( His Autobiography of a Yogi is a classic ) 's words &quot; If you hold onto an idea with dynamic will power ; it finally assumes a tangible outward form&quot; .Most people have stacked up negative beliefs about life and themselves which take an outward form due to holding onto those beliefs. Many smokers hold onto the idea that they cannot quit and they prove themselves right over and over. Or people who are poor hold onto the idea that they can never get over their conditions and prove themselves correct . Or men losing hair hold onto the idea of baldness with such fear that they help in manifesting the very condition they dont want.Now I want to mention one specific way to hold an idea in your consciousness. Many people have read about Scott Adams ( creator of Dilbert ) and his experiences with affirmations. He says that one can achieve a lot in life by using affirmations.An example affirmations is &quot; I John Doe will get rich by investing in stocks &quot; to get rich via stocks. One has to write it fifteen times in a row daily till the goal is fulfilled. You will experience coincidences of such nature that your desire manifests itself.He picked two stocks that were the best stocks of that year.Who told him what stocks to pick ? The answer lies in a small book that has been in print over 75 years. It is IT WORKS by R.H.Jarrett. In this book ( It works - RHJ ) the author says that a mighty power in man which he calls God in man can guide you to accomplish any goal that you wish to be fulfilled.But you must be really earnest about it.Try these concepts for yourself and prove whether these concepts are true or not.Good Luck."},{"Title":"The Way Out: The Way Beyond - Wealth - The Teacher","review":"This book will open up new avenues in life for you that you never thought would be possible.If you have any fears in life like getting laid off , bankrupcy ,motor vehicle accident or any kind of personal harm by reading this book you will be able to avoid all things that could cause you harm.PLEASE TRUST MY ABOVE STATEMENT.Please follow the simple message of this book you will receive far more benefit than going to any church ,synagogue , mosque or temple .

A Course In Miracles, Conversations With God, and many others I have read and have helped me on this journey. They all teach the same truth in the end, for the truth is the same. This little book does it in such a direct way that it has made an enormous impact on me.

The editor has done his best to provide a survey of the social science literature on the subject. Unfortunately it falls a little short of the mark.This isn't entirely his fault. There just isn't that much in the scholarly literature on the subject. He had to go pretty far afield in subject matter and in time to fill a volume. And it shows.Some of the articles are interesting from a social science perspective but have absolutely nothing to do with combatives, hoplology or the like. The piece on Tanzanian dance competition, for instance, is fascinating. But the author demonstrates in the first couple pages that the practice has no martial past.Others, such as the first article in the book and the two articles by Donohue suffer, I fear from two common sins of anthropology. The authors ignore that which does not agree with their theses, retain a tad too much scholarly detachment when investigating exceptionally personal and transformative practices, make universal statements based on a very limited cultural milieu, and seem to have trouble taking believing that practitioners of cultural practices have insight into their own lives and experience.Other articles such as the ones on the Ayarrs and somatic nationalism in Indian wrestling hit the sweet spot of hoplology and social science scholarship.The book could have been better. But given the material the editor had to work with it is a decent effort."},{"Title":"Living the Liturgy: A Practical Guide for Participating in the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church","review":"LIVING THE LITURGY is a guide by Greek Orthodox priest Stanley Harakas written to help Orthodox Christians in America have a deeper appreciation of the Sunday liturgical experience. As a catechumen in the Orthodox Church, I found it somewhat interesting and useful.The Divine Liturgy is, quite literally, the \\"work of the people\\", and yet very often the faithful attending services are passive, detached, and intimidated. Harakas organises his work around three three \\"keys\\" which make the liturgy understandable and even captivating for believers. The first is a basic understanding of sacramental worship, that the Church's natural moment is its gathering to celebrate the Eucharist. The second is an understanding of the structure of the liturgy as it is conducted today. While some books on the liturgy track its long history and development, Fr Harakas says that the average Orthodox Christian can focus on the modern form. Finally, the third key is a pratical definition of what kind of participation is necessary in the liturgy. As an appendix, he gives the entire text of the Divine Liturgy.The book was written in 1974, and it targets an audience somewhat different than many Orthodox materials today. In 1974, Orthodoxy was still mostly a church limited to ethnic enclaves, whose churchgoers were often present on Sundays just for fellowship with people of the same national origin. This ethnic Orthodox are the sort of people to whom Fr Harakas addresses his work. These types remain even to this day, and so the book can still be useful. However, in the following decades, many have converted to the Orthodox Church from Protestant denominations or the Roman Catholic Church, and they have an outlook different than what Fr Harakas expects for his audience. The last half of the book, which covers the liturgy in depth part by part, will be most interesting for converts."},{"Title":"New Archaelogical Finds in China","review":"The only drawback of this book is its brief length. The authors describe numerous archaeological finds made in China during the 1960s. Included in the text are some colour photos of a few finds. Like a pretty set of pottery figurines from the Western Han Dynasty of 206 BC - 24 AD. The colours are still vivid after 2000 years. And the set appears quite complete. Though perhaps this reflects some restoration done by the authors.Other photos show jade clothes that have been sewn with gold thread. As well as gold and silver bowls, heavily embossed. Some finds are indeed fragile, like silk shoes from the Tang Dynasty or a silk damask."},{"Title":"It's Such a Beautiful Day (Classic Short Stories)","review":"...why buy this when you can get it in other Asimov books along with many other excellent stories?

For example, you can read it in Asimov's monumental collection The Complete Stories, Volume 1. That said, if you want to own this particular story by itself - a good idea if you're planning on handing it to children, as it is small and lavishly illustrated -, or if you are an Asimov completist, then you will want this nifty and hard-to-find item."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"The Corean Chronicles, &quot;Legacies&quot; and now &quot;Darknesses,&quot; are set in a maturely conceived world. These stories are set on the continent of Corus, about 1,000 years after the Cataclysm. Corus has forgotten most of its technology, and even a millennium later the pre-Cataclysm empire of the Duarchy is remembered as an idyllic time.In Corus, a few rare individuals, including Alucius, the hero, have Talent, the ability to do magic. In &quot;Legacies&quot; Alucius started to come to terms with his Talent. In &quot;Darknesses&quot; he must save both his family and his world. In &quot;Legacies,&quot; Alucius, literally &quot;from light,&quot; is a Soarer's child, and there is more than a hint here that some or all of his Talent may have been bred into him. The uses and abuses of power and technology are one of Modesitt's recurring themes, and those themes are developed more thoroughly and more subtlely here than in any of his earlier works.Modesitt's writing continues to improve. His plotting is more intricate and complex, his characterization is three dimensional, and his pacing, always his best skill, is now impeccable. Unlike many of his recent works, you will not be able to predict the good guys, the bad guys or even the flow of the story. The surprises keep coming.&quot;Legacies&quot; mostly raised questions. Some are answered by &quot;Darknesses,&quot; and while Modesitt reportedly said this closes the Corean Chronicles, there are many, many loose plot thread and mysteries. This is a richer, deeper world than the setting for the Recluce stories. I look forward to the next installment.This is a good yarn, well told."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I just had to purchase Darkness after having read Legacies. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed in the second of this series. The book moved seamlessly into the second story and again there was no letdown which means I couldn't put it down. I did lose sleep trying to finish it. I am anxiously awaiting for the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"On Corus, sheepherder Alucius possesses a powerful, untapped Talent that he tries to hide while serving his mandatory military time. Alucius just wants to go home to his wife Wendra so though he is a captain in the 21st Company he avoids trouble as much as possible in order to avoid becoming noticed.Warlord Aellyan Edyss finds and opens an ancient vault containing magical weapons and legendary beasts from a time long before the Cataclysm. Aellyan plans to use his weaponry to conquer and then rule Corus. Alucius realizes his dilemma once he understands the threat posed by Aellyan. If he displays his prowess and succeeds in defeating the warlord and his magical army and arsenal Alucius will become visible to his superiors and a pawn of individuals like the Lord-Protector of Lanachrona. If he hides his Talent by doing nothing, he will probably die.DARKNESSES, the second book of the Corean Chronicles (see LEGACIES), is a superb fantasy due to the abilities of L.E. Modesitt, Jr. to make a world of magic and mystical beasts seem real. The story line combines plenty of action with strong characters and even a sense of history. Alucius is a delightful reluctant hero and his opponent is more than just a vile villain as he is a complete character too. The support cast such as Wendra and the magically created beasts add depth to a strong epic fantasy that will have the audience wondering where the author will take them next.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Reviewed Format: .azwThis is not a review of the book itself, but a review of the Kindle version. The book is one I read several years ago, remembered fondly, and wanted to re-read on the Kindle.This Kindle version is a disaster. While some books clearly suffer layout defects from being Kindlized, such as the occasional run-together words or improperly-spaced paragraph, this version suffers from an almost complete lack of copy-editing, coupled with an excessive number of typographical and structural artifacts that make it seem like the publisher scanned in a printed version without having access to the original source material.Unlike the previous book in the series (Legacies), which was generally well-rendered with some minor layout exceptions that didn't detract from the semantics, this version is almost unreadable because of the semantic defects.In many places, periods are substituted for commas, which changes the structure and meaning of sentences. Being required to re-read sentences to parse out the original meaning is not something I expect to have to do when reading for enjoyment. In conjunction with this, capitalization can be hit or miss, with capitals appearing randomly in some sentences where no periods exist--and which don't seem to indicate the start of a new sentence--and with lowercase letters after periods often indicating that the sentence fragment should have been preceded by a comma instead.In other places, the numeral one is substituted for the lowercase letter \\"l,\\" and the letter \\"c\\" is substituted for the letter \\"e.\\" These types of artifacts are rather common in text which has been subject to optical character recognition, but even a basic spell-checker would have let someone know that \\"bluc\\" is not a color.Most e-books have a few artifacts, as do printed books. Generally, though, if the volume of defects rises to the point where it interferes with the semantic meaning of sentences then it shows a disregard for both the reader and the author. This is one of those books.To be clear, this isn't a problem with layout or rendering, as far as I can tell. It's a failure of basic copy-editing, and a clear quality-control issue. You don't have to be a grammarian to find this consistently-high error rate distracting, so steer clear of this edition unless you are extremely tolerant of such things."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"After losing some of my faith in Modesitt following the Spellsong cycle and some of the later books in the Recluse series, it was a relief to begin reading the Corean Chronicles. Darknesses continues the solid work begun in Legacies. The character of Alucius deepens his understanding of his Talent and capabilities. The reader gains more knowledge of Corus and the different powers within Corus.The interesting thing about Modesitt is that he always seems to like the ideas that he is working out more than he likes the reader. His books are not really that different from one another; they always seem like parts of the same larger project. When he gets it wrong (Spellsong cycle), then the novels become repetitive and tedious. When he gets it right, then there is a real reassuring quality that makes his work a pleasure to read.In the world of Modesitt, hard work and solid values are always rewarded. As a reader, it is often nice to have a little literary corner where this is true."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Darkness is a good tribute to the world Modesitt has developed. A military tale, Modesitt delves into the everyday boredom and gut clenching combat of a company of mounted militia who are pawns in the game of nations.He also develops the powers Captain Alucius has and introduces the alien danger threatening the Corean world.Modesitt heroes are ordinary people with extraordinary powers achieving amazing tasks. Luck, tenacity and skill allows Alucius to not only preserve his life but the life of his men. But in combat, it is not enough and his men and friends die.This world is an interesting blend of mechanical technology with magical powers. Gritty realism where the characters bleed and hurt.A very fast and enjoyable read and it leaves enough questions to eagerly await the third book."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"This is the best series written by this author and he has really written some very good series. I'm hoping he will pick up the story line again at some future date."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"L. E. Modesitt, Jr has created a world, or at least a continent, called Corus which bears striking similarities to that of his most famous series The Saga of Recluse. The first two books in The Corean Chronicles features a storyline which should be familiar to those who have read several Recluse novels in that a young man who is highly competent but does not know as much as he should is put into situations where he must succeed and excel or he will likely die. The young man becomes more than he thought he was while claiming he is nothing but a simple herder. The magic system here is not explained well, but it has to do with feel, intuition, seeing lines of power, shades of color and darkness being the color of decent humanity. A reader could make a case that this series picks up thousands of years after The Death of Chaos even though I suspect that Modesitt would not claim any connection between Recluse and Corus. Darknesses is the second volume of The Corean Chronicles and Alucius is now a Captain in the Iron Valley Militia. He is serving out his time so he can go home to his wife and family and live a quiet life as a herder, but he knows there is some evil out there because he has already confronted so much and is already legendary among those who have heard his exploits. Alucius himself remains humble and quiet, though he is death to any who stand in his way. Alucius, like many of Modesitt's heroes, will do whatever is necessary so that he and his men stay alive. It is called brutal efficiency and his skill at \\"Talent\\", the magic system of Corus is what makes him doubly so successful.Darknesses moves Alucius up the ranks while others plot against him because of a level of Talent skill which he possesses but does not know about. Alucius has no ambition other than staying alive and returning home, but others view him as a threat. After the first fifty to perhaps a hundred pages Darknesses picks up as the reader becomes immersed in this world and story. Modesitt gives a wealth of detail about the mundane life, but it is all about building a sense of place and character that we know as much as Alucius does (though many thoughts and revelations are left unexplained, like saying \\"aha!\\" without explaining why) and that we can understand the character of Alucius. There is a very limited narrator in that much of the novel follows Alucius and we get many of his thoughts, but we also are put into the heads of various other important characters for very short chapters so that we have a hint of the other plots that are ongoing against Alucius.Darknesses reads much like a Recluse novel, just without the Order versus Chaos magic dynamic, and this is a compliment. It is perhaps a backhanded compliment because there is not a very large distinction between Corus and Recluse and it feels like this story could just have easily have been told in Recluse as it was in Corus. There is a smooth and easy flow to Modesitt's writing and Darknesses was an enjoyable read.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"An enjoyable book.As with the first book in the Corean Chronicles, this novel is about our reluctant, humble hero, Alucius: a good guy, whose easy to like, making the book pleasant to read. There is, however, enough action to keep the story interesting and moving along.(with the exception of one, somewhat repetitious part, about 4/5 the way through).If you liked the first book, \\"Legacies\\", then you will like this one as well. It's not deep, but it is entertaining and will keep you coming back to it until it's finished."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Alucius, once a prisoner of the Matrites, is now back among friends--but some of his \\"friends\\" seem worse than the enemy!

He survives, but this is just the first of many situations where he is put in harm's way. He becomes convinced that he has a powerful enemy among the Iron Valley Council, but he doesn't know who it is or why he is hated.When the Iron Valley is taken over by the Lonachronans, Captain Alucius is assigned an impossible seeming mission far from Iron Valleys and his family. There he is betrayed when his \\"allies\\" flee leaving him to hold against overwhelming numbers of nomads.This book is well worth your time.

Spine had no creases and although it had a library marking, one must assume the retailer is helping them market excess copies of donated paperbacks."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"First off, though this does stand as in independent story in what is called the Corean Chronicles, it will make a lot more sense to you and you'll be a lot more invested in the characters if you read the first book ahead of time. Darknesses returns to the same main character, Alucius, who remains as in the first a reluctant soldier caught up in battles and politics he'd rather not wage, preferring to set down his sword and his strange Talent and return home to be a herder with his new wife. This book roams further afield than the first book as Alucius is sent to various locales (helps to periodically check the map to keep all his travels and the stratagems behind them straight) and involves more characters, which helps prevent it from feeling stale. As in the first, the world and especially the military world is prevented in a gritty realism and while there is a lot of detail regarding troop movement etc., Modesitt is careful not to let it overwhelm the story or bog it down. It's a smoothly paced book throughout, helped by the many quick shifts of character and setting. Some of the side characters are given short shrift, but Modesitt does a nice job with the one ruler he focuses most on, giving us a seemingly full sense of character but in a nice deft touch, without revealing to us whether he will turn out friend or foe to Alucius. Problems with the book are minor though distracting: The major villains of the story (as opposed to the many smaller ones) are introduced a bit too abruptly and through too much exposition as opposed through the natural flow of action and dialogue. There is a bit too much deus ex machina intertwined with that story line as well. The jumps back to his herder homestead are somewhat perfunctory. And some of Alucius' actions and dialogue started to feel a bit repetitive, such as his many protests (clearly unbelieved by most he protested to) that he is just a normal guy doing his job. Overall though, it's an enjoyable read which expands on the first book and leaves some clear openings as well for future material. It won't wow you, but you'll have a good time."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Darknesses, the second Corean Chronicles takes up a year later in th military career of our hero. It is jam packed with action, sometimes almost too much with not enough pause between action scenes. Again our hero has to combat evil while trying to keep himself and his troopers alive, not to mention his secret talent. We learn more about the Soarers and the early history of Corus. Our hero's talent and his wife's talent grow in this novel. I had to keep reading to find out what happens to our hero next. I feel some of the battle scenes and wars end a little too quick. The fighting and battles are almost over before you can really get into them. I feel the author could have drawn things out a little more.

In fact this one is better. Alucius must put himself to the test by performing as one of the militia that are in an instant forced to serve the protector of Lanachrona as his Northern Guard. As always with Modesitt Alucius struggles with when and where to use his Talent. There must be consequences for your actions he tells us, especially if you act rashly. Alucius navigates his way through many battles and finds himself growing in his power. This is a don't miss book for Modesitt fans.

Give yourself a treat. Read this author."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Lets get the good stuff out of the way first. This is the Saga of a world where there are three types of Sentients. All of whom to some degree rely on the Lifeforce to sustain them. Once the force is used up all life ceases on the planet. Mr. Modessitt as usual delves deeply into the characters and brings them to life, and slowly intertwines their lives in a powerful series.Now the bad news, sort of. Paperback publishers have an irritating habit of printing maps and charts from copies of the original hard cover maps, and in the process they lose clarity, and you end up with something unreadable. Now we know that there are ten days to a week, but you have to look hard through all six volumes to find the nursery rhyme that explains it. But you should read them in sequence, starting with Legacy. It is worth it."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"First off: if you haven't read \\"Legacies,\\" read that first. This book will be far less satisfying, and far more mystifying, if you haven't.Like \\"Legacies,\\" \\"Darknesses\\" falls into roughly two equal halves: the first is basically a military story, more \\"good guys versus bad guys\\" than \\"Good versus Evil.\\" Modesitt deftly makes points about the fallacy of suborning defense to greed, and of the double-edged nature of Alucius' Talent: without it, he may not have a life; but if others learn of it, his entire way of life is threatened.Of course, like many fantasies, Alucius has far more Talent than most, and seems predestined--regardless of *his* desires--for Great Things. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that many characters seem aware of Alucius' destiny, though he does not.In the second part, by turns more magical, Alucius must use his Talents to stop Evil Forces that threaten Corus. He learns some surprising secrets about the Cataclysm--why it happened, and who caused it.There are a few \\"Meanwhile, back on the farm....\\" sections that don't really contribute to the current plot--but other sections of the book show that these sections are probably foreshadowing events in later books in the series. And while the ending is a happy one, there are some highly unsettling questions left unanswered--and Modesitt is capable of some compelling surprises (e.g., the true nature of the Duarches).This series has some intriguing ideas: similar to the \\"Recluce\\" series, darkness can be a good thing; the past is seen, convincingly, through various lenses (though this is more evident in \\"Legacies\\" than \\"Darknesses\\"); and the aforementioned mixed blessing of Talent (in some parts of Corus, those exhibiting Talent are killed outright). If you enjoy Modesitt's work--this is a definite must-read. Modesitt has promised future books set in this world, and I await them eagerly."},{"Title":"Darknesses (Corean Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Darknesses (2003) is the second novel in the Corean Chronicles series, following Legacies. In the previous volume, Alucius has destroyed the purple gem that is the source of the Matrial's longevity and power, thus disrupting the control collars. He escapes with a company of new recruits back to the Iron Valleys. While his feat is unprecedented, the ruling council refuses to release him from the militia, but does recognize him as the Captain of the Twenty-first Company formed from the other escaping troops.In this novel, Alucius is enjoying leave-time with his family, especially with Wendra, his new wife. However, he soon has to depart and return to duty. On his way back to Emal, two men try to ambush him, but he disposes of both and continues on his way. When he reaches Emal, he is brought up to date by Captain Feran, commander of the Third Foot. They have received warnings of Deforyan raiders along the border, although Feran and Alucius believe this to be highly unlikely. Both agree that Colonel Clyon is probably bypassing the council's biases and subtly warning them of possible Lanachronan raids under false colors.Alucius sets up an aggressive patrolling schedule and discovers signs of small groups of riders near the river. He starts leading out patrols before dawn and soon finds tracks indicating that a larger group has preceded them down the river road. He sets up an ambush and wipes out all the intruders. However, these men have no possessions or insignia that clearly identifies their affiliation.The Traders' Council soon cuts back on ammunition and supplies. Despite continuing excursions of raiders, Alucius and Feran have to scrounge for money to pay and equip their troops. Eventually, the council bows to monetary and political pressure and effectively become the Lanachronan northern territories and the militia becomes the Northern Guard. Military posts and fortifications along the border are abandoned, Alucius is promoted to Over-captain, and both the Twenty-first and the Third are ordered to join a Lanachronan expedition to Deforya.Alucius leads his company far from home against powerful and numerous opponents. Moreover, he has to fight his way out of other ambushes directed against him personally. However, he does learn more about his talents and the interest shown in him by the Soarers.This novel leaves many interesting puzzles and loose ends. While it ends the story arc begun in Legacies, other stories are promised in this series.

I bought two, because I recognized a bargain. And I was not disappointed.The careful design and implementation were flawless. Using my handy mini-flashlight with red lens, I had no difficulty reading the map in the dark. I added a lanyard to the planisphere so I could hang it around my neck, dangling with a pair of binoculars, my mini \\"army\\" style angle head flashlight (old fashioned bulb), and anything else I didn't want to drop in the dark.An excellent gift for any stargazer!NOTE: make sure you buy the model that matches your viewing latitude, for best results.Useful accessories:http://www.amazon.com/Olive-Drab-Mini-Style-Flashlight/dp/B001F3FY7U"},{"Title":"The Night Sky 40-50 (Large) Star Finder","review":"when taking a course through the great courses about the night sky, i was supplied with a night sky star finder planisphere that was good for 30' to 40' latitude north. unfortunetly i live at 44' north latitude and the course was no longer being offored so no chance for an exchange. first thing i did was to check with amazon and sure enough they had the exact one i needed for 40' to 50' north latitude. happy to say i have already recieved it and while it's been cloudy the last couple days looks like there will be clear skies tonight. so, i'll be off on a real life adventure tonight, right in my own backyard thanks to amazon's great service!"},{"Title":"The Night Sky 40-50 (Large) Star Finder","review":"Large, easy to read and use.

(I don't like bringing my expensive atlases out into the unfriendly atmosphere.) It turned out that durability is virtually the only advantage this planisphere provides.Cons:1) Tiny;2) Constellations are presented in a rather confusing way;3) Barely a handful of deep sky objects are included!Pros:1) Sturdy plastic.I conclude that this planesphere may come handy if you're an absolute beginner, and are still learning the very basics of what's where in the starry skies.The worst offence (and I quote accurately): 'Only a few of the \\"deep sky\\" objects are shown on the chart.

I bought this as part of a gift for an outdoors person. I bought the chart, a foldable hammock, and a stargazing flashlight. (all on amazon for under $70). I thought the chart was neat, so I tested it out myself. I know nothing about stars or star charts and I figured out how to work this chart in under 5 minutes. I identified 4 constellations within 15 minutes in my front yard (pretty well lit area). I also think this would be a great, inexpensive gift for a curious or scientifically minded teenager (maybe paired with a book about constellations or horosopes) or a camper.The chart comes packaged flat, but it does curl very slightly when removed, it is laminated and seems sturdy, also the chart turns around easily, but doesn't fall out of place, ie once you set it to the correct date and time is doesn't move around from normal jostling.

Her daughter met an architect working on a Harvey project who was willing to share his interest in architecture with the little girl. Natalie encouraged this friendship. About the same time Ashley's grandfather was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.Throughout the story another struggle was raging - Grandfather and Natalie felt a firm faith in God but Ashley had questions which kept her from faith and church. How could God take her husband as he did? How could God let her grandfather have cancer? The mystery of the bearded architect was solved in an interesting and surprising way.

In spite of the faith of both her daugher and her grandfather, she will not attend church or believe. Her family has turned their backs on her, never even knowing that she has a child, so she determines to be single, sad and alone. Her daughter is determined to change all that.Lies, deception, danger and tremendous intrigue are played out it this second book of Peterson's \\"Desert Roses\\" series.Including lots of other people and circumstances, Tracie builds a tremendous plot that will hold a reader spellbound and unable to lay the book down."},{"Title":"Across the Years (Desert Roses #2)","review":"This book for me started a little slow but the more I read, the more it captivated me.

This is how I learnt French and German in school, and it works for me. It did not, though, work for about 60% of my classmates, who at the end of four years were able to recite tables of German verbs, but not to put a sentence together. Which is no doubt the reason for the modern revision in methodology.If you learn best by systematic explanation and analysis/synthesis (as I do), then, this (the Speight version) may suit you. If you learn better by imitation and immersion, you may do best with the themodern editionby Lydia Vellacio and Maurice Easton. The latter, however, has corresponding CDs, which the 1943 edition (unsurprisingly) does not; so if you have no live source to talk Italian with, this may be the major consideration.Indeed, no book, however thorough, can teach you to understand foreigners when they babble at you, and so none can be adequate on it own. But I would still advocate this book as a first step, to get the grammar and a basic vocabulary in your head, before proceeding further.If money is no object, there isPrego, but it is a textbook for university courses, and makes numerous references to \\"your instructor\\". It has a plethora of materials with colour illustrations and audio CDs and so on (at a total cost of $many); but I find it rather sloppy, particularly in distinguishing aspects of pronunciation such as open and closed e (as in English pet/pate) and o (cot/coat). Ms Speight is much more careful.Should you decide to go with the Speight version, there are a couple of fairly obvious caveats:&bull; Lire are now euros.&bull; Italians are pretty slapdash about diacritics, much more so than the French or the Germans, and there are dialectical differences. Ms. Speight uses the acute accent over i and u (e.g. luned&iacute;, pi&uacute;), whereas most dictionaries seem to use the grave (luned&igrave;, pi&ugrave;). She also mentions the use of the circumflex to indicate an omitted letter (e.g. stud, from studii, plural of studio): this is now considered fussy and/or old-fashioned, much as writing rle rather than role would be in English. These are, however, trivial matters."},{"Title":"The Pesher Nahum Scroll from Qumran: An Exegetical Study of 4Q169 (Studies of the Texts of Thedesert of Judah, Vol. 53)","review":"If you are interested in studying the Pesharim, I highly recommend this book.

There is a strong focus on the use of recycled materials. She recommends keeping a box of such materials as paper tubes and plastic tabs just for such projects (and at last I've found a use for all the junk I've been saving!) and lists a slew of materials found in everyday life. These materials are great for use in the classroom since they are so easy to accumulate. The teacher can save such materials and send out a \\"wish list\\" to parents to encourage children to recycle and to use their imaginations to solve 3-dimensional building and visual problems.She starts off with basic construction. Well-drawn, colorful diagrams illustrate how to braid, make chains, create 3-dimensional noses, crowns and cone hats. She instructs the reader to make faces in a mirror and practice drawing different expressions to show feeling and exaggerated feeling. She'll use spoons for a head and body, a glove for a family of people or ducks or a bee with flowers, a folded carton with inside straps as a hinged mouth, upside-down cans as heads, basic hand puppets with variations such as a kangaroo's pouch, wrestlers, jitterbugs and ballerinas with brass-fastener arms and legs, paper plate suns and Humpty-Dumpties with finger legs, tube-sock puppets, papier-mache puppets, and on and on. She even shows how a little salt sprinkled on wet paint can add great texture. There are even instruction of how to make different stages. Carrots and bananas make fun, if temporary, puppets with tooth pick attachments and pretzel eye-glasses.Some of her most ingenious use of materials are the creation of movable parts. Linked ring paper chains easily move as marionette arms and legs (and trunks!) and even a caterpillar's body. A folded plastic lid makes a very durable \\"hinged\\" mouth. Accordion-folded paper makes for great caterpillars and jack-in-the-boxes. She even creates a dragon as variation, adding wings and an appropriate head. The puppet is moved by popsicle sticks affixed at opposite ends. Popsicle Stick puppets can move by hand movements alone, or be pushed upward through a paper cup to create to illusion of, say, a growing flower. She has a variation of a jumping-jack puppet using a spool, a straw and string. With a slightly larger tube over a smaller one, heads can turn, change expression or character, or if moved up and down, have eyes or mouths that open and close. She's very interested in exploring a full range of possibilities and encourages the reader to also do so.Her projects encourage the use of imagination. The examples she uses are colorful and she'll even present multiple variations on one idea. There is a full range of characters presented, from people, to animals, to insects, to robots, and more. But she presents these only as guidelines, calling for the students' use of their own ideas. To her, puppets should be the vehicle of story-telling, and they are all the better when they are made by the performers."},{"Title":"Simple Puppets From Everyday Materials","review":"I bought this book when I started my Day Care business, and needed ideas for simple puppets. This book turned out to be the best out of a series of books I purchased in terms of offering ideas for me and the children. I really like that the ideas for the puppets are based on simple materials that you can find anywhere - including leftover supplies in your own home, like toilet paper rolls or orange juice cans. This teaches children to be resourceful and productive, and to use their imaginations.Also, the ideas really work well. The puppets are simple, but there are enough ideas to build on that you could make really complex mechanical puppets, or moveable puppets if you like. This is a book that you and your children could grow on. I don't think, however, that if you are going to do art-puppets, this book would be for you, but it would be a good start for someone who has never made puppets before and wanted to get a good start.The author, Barbara MacDonald Buetter, goes over at least a dozen different types of puppets and many different ways to decorate them. My children never tired of making the puppets. Finally, MacDonald Buetter gives ideas to build different types of theaters, from simple to more complex, and so we had a little puppet show! Wow!"},{"Title":"Prophets & Professors: Essays on the Lives and Works of Modern Poets","review":"Anyone who loves poetry should read this book. Bawer is a worshipper of poetry in the best possible sense: he absolutely revels in the poems he loves. His reader is equally lucky. In Bawer's hands, poets and poetry are animated and vital.Covering a range of modern poets from Auden to Stevens to Plath to Jarrell to Justice, he discusses their poetry and their lives. His pieces are less directly focused on the lives of the artists than, say, James Fenton's latest book, in the sense of perspective, but they are always erudite and engaging. True, I may be partial to someone who clearly takes my own view, openly confessing to disdainful thoughts on poetry as self-expression and therapy (which, I, too, have encountered far too often), but when the future of poetry is at stake, honesty is our only hope. And Bawer has honesty in spades, not even shying away from criticism of the always esteemed Helen Vendler.Bawer's insights made me reread and reconsider poems, and gave me a greater understanding of all. He is invaluable. For anyone who is dissatisfied with the general degeneration of today's poetry and the humid (fetid?) atmosphere hanging over it all, this book is a blessing. At the very least, you'll know you're not alone and learn something (guaranteed) in the process."},{"Title":"Whitney Biennial 2006: Day for Night","review":"Of course reviewing a book by its cover is ridiculous, but this catalog's cover keeps slipping off, which is annoying enough to merit a mention. And then there are those stupid fold out pages, so I spend half the time like a tourist trying to manage an unruly map, and inevitably they rip. As for the content, well, the text descriptions of some of the artists use interesting terms like \\"conceptual trigger,\\" but the photos of the art itself are small and dull on thin, uncoated paper. And as the descriptions of the artists read more like frommers than lonely planet (I.e. positive only), it's hard to value the text too much. Buy the \\"PS1 Greater New York 2005\\" instead. You can get more out of the Whitney book by googling the artists' names.I should say that the introduction by Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne is superb, but you can read that online:[...]"},{"Title":"Whitney Biennial 2006: Day for Night","review":"I was given this at the birth of my son so he could know what the art world was like when he was born.

The contributors examine why, in a time of prosperity, we have abrogated a vital social contract. Many agree that the crisis stems from a facile ideology of &quot;selective excellence,&quot; championed by the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, that adopts the corporate management triumvirate of downsizing, reengineering, and endless strategic planning. In the face of this bureaucratic onslaught, higher education in America may have lost its soul.The guilty heroes of this tale-guilty because some have promoted these changes and most have acquiesced to them-are the embattled professoriate, who confront a decline in real salaries, demographically- and legislatively-mandated increases in workload, and a savage labor market where many toil in a permanent underclass of part-time adjunct labor. But are things really this bleak, and are the politicians and administrators so villainous? Sadly, the twelve essays in this volume document a strong case that the &quot;politics of work&quot; in contemporary higher education are deplorable indeed.The critique is covincing, but the book is marred by the absence of detailed case studies and by the lack of a clear or compelling vision of how the defeats higher education has faced might be reversed."},{"Title":"Chalk Lines: The Politics of Work in the Managed University","review":"This book is so interesting for me because it has a variety of essays that investigate the changes in Academic Labor -- the deprofessionalization, the adjunctification, the proletarianization -- and it explores the social, political, and economic implications of these transformations. It has essays on Academic Capitalism, Labor Organizing, and on what these changes in work relations mean for those of us in the Academy and for labor organizing, in general. Several of the authors are well known to many (David Montgomery, Stanley Aronowitz, Sheila Slaughter, more.). It describes both the big picture of the academy and the society (i.e., research funding, social stratification) and it also describes some specifics on the organizing that is going on among part-timers and graduate teaching employees. It is a useful book for labor organizers, teachers, and people thinking of going into university teaching. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a moving story of one woman's sad marriage to a man who doesn't deserve such a wonderful wife as Helen Huntingdon (nee Graham.) Strong and beautiful Helen is a role model for all women, for she holds herself aloof from the debaucheries of her husband, while remaining faithful to her duties. Her reward at the end of the book is what she deserves for such a miserable, downtrodden marriage. A beautiful, passionate book."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is the second of the two novels Anne wrote and was published in the year before she died of tuberculosis, aged just 29. She died at Scarborough, on England's northeast coast, a beautiful but at certain times of year wild and forbidding area, and it is here also that her two novels are set, although the locale is not specifically named.Despite the Brontes being ordinary to the point of obscurity, three of the six children went on to become famous novelists, making them one of history's most extraordinary literary families. Like many people, I decided to read the most noted work of each of the three; Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and finally Anne's Tenant of Wildfell Hall. They are all complex, imaginative, atmospheric romantic sagas with dark, obsessive undertones. Charlotte is the most accomplished writer of the three and Jane Eyre remains the perfect romance. Wuthering Heights, despite its imaginative force, is an overheated, masochistic fantasy with a male protagonist too unremittingly cruel to pass muster as a romantic hero. Somewhere in the middle comes Tenant which, while not quite matching Charlotte's depth of feeling or stylistic prowess, provides a compelling narrative, employs sympathetic characters and tackles socially important issues in a convincing manner.The central characters have that anal-retentiveness that was characteristic of Victorian British gentlefolk. Bound by convention and duty to God and country, they can seem frustratingly inert to modern readers. You feel you want to shake them and say, \\"For Heaven's sake, just tell her how you feel!\\" or, \\"If he's so bad, leave him!\\" But this conflict between personal fulfillment and societal expectation is a large part of what the story is about. It no doubt accurately reflects contemporary attitudes and gives us a valuable insight into those times.I will not summarize the plot, being averse to spoilers, and would recommend you avoid other reviews, including editorial ones, if you share that aversion, although that warning is probably too late. I will say it is blessedly free of the coincidences that bedevil nineteenth-century novels - including Jane Eyre - and is a classic example of a character-driven plot. The only aspect I could not quite fathom was the startlingly hostile and resentful attitude of the hero toward another of the male characters, at one time spilling over into physical violence. I understood his complaints against this man but his actions seemed inordinately belligerent and out of character.The ending is interesting in terms of technique. The author draws it out, taking time off here and there to describe how the minor characters ended up. This may all seem a little too neat for some readers but will satisfy those of us who abhor loose ends."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is definitely my favorite book by Anne Bronte (not that I don't like Agnes Grey, just that I like this one even more). The language of this second and last book of Anne Bronte's is just very easy to read (as compared to her sisters' novels), and that the pace of the whole novel is very appropriate (not too fast nor slow). Besides, Anne just knows exactly how and where to draw her readers' attention, she just knows exactly where to add some suspense or twists in this book that it will surely keep the reader turning the pages. Plus, just like Agnes Grey, this book definitely has a sweet ending and some of its dialogues are just so romantic and sweet to read! In addition, I really like the character Helen Huntingdon. Despite the fact that she may look a bit fragile, she however is a very strong and religious woman who is always very determined in making deicsions and taking on responsibilities. Another thing about this novel that I want to praise is its form. I like the fact that most of the novel was presented in diary form. And this can really draw a reader's attention, for reading the novel was just like peeping through one's secret diary and once you get started on the reading of it, you just get hooked and can't stop!!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"In the true Bronte tradition, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is passionately romantic. None of that polite Austenian affection here. Each character whole-heartedly throws him/herself into everything; even if it's only drinking tea.Anne Bronte has woven a story within a story by creating love-smitten Gilbert Markham as the narrator. He has totally fallen for the mysterious new girl in town. But what is the secret she is hiding from the neighborhood? Ah, that is your story that's within the story.This book resounds with dark tones, though a candle of hope always flickers for the reader. Anne brings us to the precipice of human darkness , but does not allow us to fall. The strength of love is the great balancer. It ultimately secures hope and happiness for the characters who deserve it.You won't be able to put this book down. It's truly gripping."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' is written by the least remembered Bronte sister. Many people at the time, including her sister - Charlotte, thought that this book tackled inappropriate subject matter, but I disagree.

In order to clear the gossip surrounding her dwelling in Wildfell Hall, she offers him her diary to read, which takes up the main part of the narrative. This book is extremely readable and deserves much more attention than it actually receives. The female protagonist is a likeable woman, whose plight obtains sympathy with the reader.

A nice one-time read if you're craving a book from that bygone era."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"A good read for the \\"English\\" book lover, but not as good a story as her sister's books are. Too wordy although the antiquated verbiage was comforting to read again in a Bronte book."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall - Anne Bronte4starsAudio version performed by Alex Jennings and Jenny AgutterPublished in 1848, Anne Bronte's second and final novel continues to provide powerful food for thought. I knew this book had been called an early feminist novel, so I was fascinated to find that she began telling the story in a male voice. It begins as a letter from Mr. Gilbert Markham to his brother-in-law and later shifts to diary entries written in the voice of Helen Graham Huntington. It is set between Regency and Victorian times and tells the grim story of Helen's marriage to the abusive, alcoholic Arthur Huntington.This book was very interesting to me from an historical perspective. Anne Bronte defied the conventions of her time when she created Helen. She spoke openly of alcoholism and abuse. She gave her character the means to leave her husband while depicting just how precarious Helen's life becomes as a married woman living apart.As a novel, I felt the book was uneven. The heavy religious overtones slowed the narrative. It was never completely clear to me why Helen had such limited options. It was hard to believe that she had sufficient backbone to leave her husband, but would not ever speak to her Aunt and Uncle about her situation. Most of all, there never seemed to be sufficient reason for the development of the romance between Gilbert and Helen. In a way, I felt that Anne Bronte gave Helen an acceptable husband in her book, but in reality she preferred to do without one herself.This audio production was very well done. The structure of the book reminded me of The Woman in White. It was perfect for two readers. Jennings and Agutter gave believable, interesting, voices to Gilbert and Helen."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bronte's novel \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" exposes the extreme double standard that existed between men and women in England during the mid nineteenth century. The evil male in the story and a few of his associates are easy to dislike whether the reader be male or female, but what is refreshing about the novel is that several men are reported as decent, loving and hard working individuals who help restore our faith in the male gender before the book ends. Helen, the heroin in the story, is portrayed as almost a saint like figure who few of us, male or female, could readily identify because of the abuse for which she allows herself to be subjected by her husband and the continued attempts by her to love and forgive him in spite of himself. But, for someone who wishes to see the ultimate examples of Christ-like behavior, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This book was so good it suprised me! I was very happy with the price and the order shipped really fast. Much less expensive than a book store and convienent."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I only read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall because i was a fan of her two sisters. i didn't expect it to be a great work of art and i was surpirsed to find an exceptional tale. It does contain faults. For one the narrative is told a little clumbsily through letters and diaries and there are also perhaps mistakes in characterisation, but at the core is a heartfelt tale of a woman who falls in love with a man whom she marries, but we slowly watch his decline into a drunken, selfish slob, who not only breaks Helen's heart but the reader's too. Readers who dislike the character of Mr Huntington from the start will probably not much like the rest of the book, because they can see what a mistake she is making, but i, like Helen, made the foolish and naive error of believing that she can change him for the better. It's certainly worth reading if you are a Bronte fan and is perhaps a slightly forgotten masterpiece of Victorian literacy, shadowed by family connections."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Bronte defied all of the accepted norms of her time to write this story. It was unheard of then for a women to leave her husband under any circumstance. This book is powerful, honest, and (unfortunately) timeless. Although, it hurts deeply to read about this topic, Bronte presents the subject delicately. Any woman who is suffering with spousal abuse or an addicted loved one will be in awe of the main character's ability to be strong without betraying her own sense of morality. I particularly enjoyed the fullness of each character presented. The husband was not completely evil; he was weak at times, mean at times, and sometimes pathetic. While reading, there was always hope that he would do something redeaming - his character was complete enough to allow this."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I have read this book over and over.

Taken in an historical perspective, the feminist view of this book is impressive. Helen Huntingdon defies the conventions of her, and Bronte's time, by leaving her dissolute husband and living independently. This gives Bronte the opportunity to criticize village life with its nosy neighbours and petty gossip, and aspect neither of her sisters achieved in either Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, where the characters exist in vacuums. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it highly. I also recommend the PBS movie version starring Tara Fitzgerald and Rupert Graves."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Charlotte Bronte was the productive sister. Emily Bronte graced us with one powerful, brillient masterpiece. What about Anne, the forgotton Bronte sister? The Tenant of Wildfell Hall proves Anne Bronte has no trouble matching her sisters in talent. Brilliently executed, this novel engrosses your mind, leaving it immune to distractions.This novel begins through the eyes of an English countryman, Mr. Markham, and continues switching to the viewpoint of Helen, a mysterious newcomer to Mr. Markham's small gossip-ridden community, and then back to Mr. Markham. The entire book is in first-person narrative- an excellent oppertunity for Bronte to flex her descriptive muscles. I found the characters to be well-developed and symbolic, especially Arthur Huntingdon. At first we are led to despise him, even wish for his death, yet as the story unfolds we pity him, even understand why Helen once loved him.Bronte's message is clear- society torments women. This book is bold in it's suggestions, considering it was created in 19th century England. I suggest you buy it; it is a book to read more than once"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I really enjoyed the Masterpiece Theater version of this book several years ago, and had never read the book until recently.

This is a cautionary tale against naivet&eacute;, abuses and addictions, but it is also a very intriguing love story. Told by the main fellow beginning and ending, and through the journal of the main lady in the middle, it is an excellent read. In this audio-book reading, Alex Jennings is brilliant through and through and has become one of our favorites."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"A very well written novel of 19th century feminine issues, showing a young woman married to a drunkard with arrested development. Helen is bright, strong, and talented. Arthur is attractive, which is not sufficient to hide his multitude of deficiencies. Helen must battle both him and society."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I won't bother giving a full fledged synopsis of the book but suffice it to say it was a pleasure to read most times. I did feel Bronte was wont to ramble and get a little too wrapped up in the description of various inanities but that was more than amply made up for with -- surprisingly enough -- humor.I must say I was a bit disappointed and I felt like Helen was more of a caricature of the devout feminine model than a real person. At times, many times, in fact, she teetered perilously close to the edge of unrealistic sainthood. She bore all manner of insults and despair with her eyes cast serenely upward toward God and preached to others to do likewise. Never once, except for in her private moments did she even so much as express displeasure or distress and even then it was more in the vein of \\"But I must bear it somehow\\". I found this to be ridiculous as even the most devout despair and it isn't blasphemy to take stock of ones lot and be dissatisfied every now and again whereas Helen didn't even shed a solitary woeful tear.As a huge fan of the romantic classics, the one thing that I felt was a bit of a letdown was the utter lack of passionate romance. Everything was very turgid and restrained. I would like to excuse this as merely being due to the restrictions of the times, but Austen, having come several decades prior to Ms. Bronte proved to be able to demonstrate this with ease, poise and tact. Much of the passion various characters felt for one another was more or less merely told to us and not shown. A little too much exposition for my tastes and as a fan of \\"show, not tell\\" this was again, disappointing.All in all however, it was a pleasant read, not quite the short Harlequin one can speed through (or would want to) over a rainy weekend or on a vacation but it was satisfying enough in the end."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"THIS WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK. I PURCHASED IT FOR MY KINDLE. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD READ ALL THE BOOKS BY THE BRONTE SISTERS BUT THIS WAS ONE THAT I MISSED.

Not as well known as her other two sisters, Emily (who wrote Wuthering Heights), and Charlotte (who wrote Jane Eyre), Anne's novel is nevertheless an important work, and well worth a read.This 1996 BBC adaptation stars Tara Fitzgerald as Helen Graham, an attractive woman who appears to be very secretive, keeping quietly to herself when she arrives in the guise of a widow at Wildfell Hall, in 19th century Yorkshire. Together with her young son, Helen attempts to maintain a low profile, a futile effort as her very presence arouses the locals' suspicions, resulting in malicious gossip. It is only at the insistence of a local gentleman farmer, Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), that Helen reveals the agonizing secrets of her past and the life of corruption that she fled for her sake, as well as her young son's.The production qualities are quite well done, with beautiful shots of the picturesque English countryside, and though the soundtrack isn't exactly inspiring, the talented cast more than makes up for any deficiencies in the production. This is well worth a watch for those who are fans of well-made period dramas, and a must-watch for fans of the Bronte sisters' works."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Helen chooses to marry for \\"true love\\" but does she REALLY know her husband.

Read it and see as it is a good read."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is the second book of Anne Bronte who sadly died at the very young age of twenty nine. A pity, because she was beginning to come into her own as a talented writer much like Jane Austen. In fact the writing is similar only Jane Austen's novels deal much more with the manners and niceties of society rather than the cruel consequences of say, having a bad marriage. Neither Jane Austen or Anne Bronte, were ever married and as we read the books are we really surprised? Mrs. Graham(not her real name) arrives at Wildfell Hall with her young son. The neighbors, most notably, Gilbert Markham and his mother and sister, make an effort to get to know her. Gilbert, especially is taken by this young widow who shows a talent for painting but really doesn't want anyone to get too close. She is also criticized for wanting to take her son, young Arthur on all her visits to the neighbors. What's up with that? The child is overprotected and he'll turn out a sissy, according to Mrs. Markham. Then there is this gentleman who keeps paying a visit to Mrs. Graham and the child remarkably looks like him. This Mr. Lawrence is a neighbor of Gilbert and is taken to task for his unseemly behavior. As the plot unfolds, we are made aware slowly of who Mrs. Graham is and why she has come to Wildfell Hall. The story is not a happy one and it leaves one feeling a lot of empathy for this young woman who is trapped in a union from which there really is no escape. There's no family nearby and even if there was, Helen Huntington, as she really is known has a lot of pride, self respect, principles, and survival skills that she would not ask family members to rescue her. In the end, though when her means to survive are taken away by her irresponsible, philandering, and alcoholic husband she is forced to leave. The character of Helen manifests itself into someone who you would love to have as a friend. She is loyal as towards the end she is compelled to go back to her ailing husband and care for him. She loves her son and is alarmed when he starts to show the same disrespect and slovenliness that her husband displays. She treats her maid Rachel as a friend and confidante and as it turns out her only ally. I found that I had to put this book down a few times because I found myself becoming angry and frustrated at Helen's situation. I also found it interesting reading about how logistics played a big part in these stories. The modes of travel and the distances people would go to visit London or even each other. Arthur Huntington would spend months in the city and leave Helen alone and then when his friends would come to visit they would stay for months on end. I can only imagine how tiring that would be to have company for that length of time and be alarmed at the expense of feeding all of them much less being around the bad behavior and people you don't really like or respect. It was heartrendering to witness Gilbert's love for Helen and again his frustration in not being able to see her again because of all the social mores and observances of the time. Like the Austen books there are the relaying of messages that aren't true and misconceptions that finally lead Gilbert to Helen and eventually everything comes together. Gilbert and Helen are finally able to communicate their thoughts and feelings and are truthful with each other which is what a good relationship is all about!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I am going to review this book from the point of view of somebody reading it for pleasure, rather than studying it. I want to say first that this book starts out a little slow, but stay with it because it gets much, much better. What I really liked about it is that the plot twists and turns so that I really wasn't sure how the book would end.At the beginning the narrator is Gilbert, a gentlemen farmer. He becomes intrigued by the new female tenant at run-down Wildfell Hall. This part of the book is not a page turner, but when the narration is picked up by Helen, the aforementioned tenant, the pace picks up. At that point I didn't want to put my Kindle down.Without giving away too much of the plot, it's the story of marriage gone wrong. The reader knows Helen should listen to her aunt, and not marry shallow, weak Arthur--but she does. Things go terribly wrong, and we see how making a bad marriage choice--or having one's family make that choice for you--often doomed women to lives of misery. However, there are many surprises ahead for Helen and the reader.I don't know why this book by Anne Bronte isn't as well known as those by her sisters. I think this book is much better than Wuthering Heights, and as good as Jane Eyre. The only negative thing I saw in this book is a bit too much moralizing. Anne Bronte was obviously a \\"rules & regulations\\" Christian. She was very inflexible about what had to be done to earn your way into salvation. Therefore, Helen can be rather uptight at times. One can almost sympathize with Arthur. However, it is very easy to skim over the scenes where Helen gets preachy.The plot line of this book is so unusual for the time. I was put in mind a bit of Thomas Hardy, except the tone is not as dark and moody as his books are.Definitely worth reading, and can't beat that price."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I love all the Bronte sisters' books and wish there were more!

However, it was a very entertaining, well-written book. It may not have been quite on the same level as Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, but it was ever-so-superior to a lot of the drivel that is currently written that I had to give it five stars for that alone. As my title implies, anything written by a Bronte can't be very bad; they were such talented writers!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This was an excellent book.

This is the first book that I have read by Anne Bronte and it may be my new favorite.I love how this novel makes you feel so many emotions as the novel progresses. At first, I thought that Gilbert was rather boorish and Helen was far too opinionated for her own good. (Far more opinionated then Austen protagonists ever hoped to be). I originally thought that Eliza was a very interesting, sweet character who was worthy of Gilbert's affections no matter what his mother's opinions might be. Misjudged that one.I love that the romance in this novel is a slow burn. I makes the novel more interesting and it was very hard for me to put down; despite the tiny tiny print. There are a lot of misunderstandings in the book and at times it's a bit frustrating that things aren't fixed as easily as they could be because someone has to be stubborn. Parts of the novel are so heartbreaking.I really loved Gilbert more and more as the book went on. He was so honorable and quite a badass, I must say But my favorite character by far was Helen's young son, Arthur. He was the most adorable character ever. I loved well behaved children in novels."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"\\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" struck me as a grounded romance novel. Like \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wurthering Heights\\" the plot is highly contrived, but the characters read as a bit more real, and there is a little more sense of the real concerns of people of the time period. Don't get me wrong, it's far from a true life documentary, but these issues have a little more presence. At the same time, if you liked the florid language and beautiful descriptions of places from the novels of the other Bronte sisters, you'll find that a little lacking in this book. The real reason to read the book is its uniquely interesting heroine. Her bold independence and self-possession sets her a cut above the average romantic leading lady. She clearly feels strong emotions, but endeavors to control them, allowing her to far exceed the expectations for a female character of her time period. Her deeply religious character within the novel will probably strike some readers as inspiring, and other readers as vexing, though it generally takes a back seat to the action of the story."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Anne Bronte's second and final novel, is the more well-known of the two, but still not as popular as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. That shouldn't surprise you, given what I said in my Agnes Grey review.Wildfell Hall is told in three parts- the first part is a letter from the hero, Gilbert Markham, to his brother-in-law, many years after the events of the story have taken place. Gilbert is a yeoman farmer in a small village who falls in love with the new, titular tenant of Wildfell Hall, Helen Graham. The supposedly widowed Helen lives alone with her small son, Arthur, and only one servant. She works as a painter to support them and is a bit on the reclusive side. Many of the villagers begin to spread gossip about her really being the mistress of her landlord, Mr. Lawrence. Gilbert attacks Mr. Lawrence in a fit of rage and so Helen gives him her diary so he can find out the truth.The second third of the novel is said diary, beginning six years earlier when Helen was just 18. In it Gilbert learns of her infatuation with a handsome rake, Arthur Huntingdon. Against her aunt's advice, and ignoring all the warning signs, Helen marries Huntington. He is soon revealed to be cruel and emotionally abusive, quickly going back to his libertine ways. For years the deeply religious Helen struggles to put up with his treatment but once he brings his mistress into the house under the guise of their son's governess, Helen can take no more and escapes to Wildfell Hall.The last third continues Gilbert's letter and tells what happens afterwards. I won't spoil it but you can probably guess how it will end.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, while it has largely positive reviews from what I've read, does have its criticisms as well. I'd like to get into those. Many complain that the characters of Helen and Gilbert are unlikable- Helen is too pious and \\"sanctimonious\\" and Gilbert is a spoiled brat who is little better than Arthur Huntingdon. I disagree. Helen, like Anne Bronte, is a devoted Christian but I did not find her sanctimonious. I admired her strength and ability to keep her faith while in such a destructive marriage. I do not feel that she was boring in any way- she had a sense of humor which was clear through her diary, more so in the beginning before she is worn down by Huntingdon. I also feel that while Gilbert is flawed, he does not even come close to approaching the cruelty and debauchery of Arthur Huntingdon! Gilbert is a mama's boy but he grows through his friendship with Helen, and he did what Huntingdon and the other \\"bad\\" man in the story never did- he left Helen alone when she asked him to! If Gilbert had been perfect I feel it would have just cheapened the story and made it too fairy-tale like.Wildfell Hall is my favorite Bronte book. It's largely regarded as the first feminist novel and I have to agree. It's definitely feminist and I'm too ignorant to know if there was anything before it! It received harsh reviews of \\"coarseness\\" at the time of its publication due to its realistic portrayals of vice among the upper-class. Charlotte even disparaged her subject choice and suppressed its republication after Anne's death (the first publication quickly sold out). During the Victorian era, a wife was considered her husband's property, so Helen's behavior would have been considered scandalous- locking her door against her husband (!) and running away. Like Agnes Grey, Anne Bronte drew from real life experiences to depict her characters (Arthur Huntingdon is likely based at least in part on her brother Branwell) and she pulls no punches. Both men and women in this book lead sinful lives, in turn both men and women are victims of some sort.I would recommend The Tenant of Wildfell Hall to anyone- you don't have to be feminist and you don't have to like the Brontes. I think it could appeal to fans of both. It's just a really good, powerful book."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall suggests that, had she lived, Anne Bronte would have been the greatest artist in her literary family. Not only does this realistic novel tell a story that might have been ripped from the headlines of 2012, but Bronte structures her novel in a highly unconventional way. Rather than a straightforward narrative, Tenant wraps an epistolary tale of letters from farmer Gilbert Markham to a friend around the diary of mysterious Helen Graham, the tenant who intrigues Markham. Each of these characters narrates his own story -- Markham describing how his life and love was upended by the arrival of the beautiful but standoffish painter and her young son at a broken-down manor house with only a few rooms fit for habitation and Graham explaining the circumstances that led woman of wealth and breeding to a life as an impoverished hermit in nosy and small-minded rural environs. Through the eyes of Markham and Graham, Bronte depicts the maliciousness of small-town gossips and the debauchery of the wealthy elite, showing her readers a 19th century England that is very far from the village cosiness and court splendor of more well-known novels. She peoples her story with an array of vivid characters, high born and low, who provide a evocative panorama of 19th century English life. Yet this is the story of Gilbert and Helen, an unlikely pair of lovers but ones who readers root for through all the twists and turns of this most modern of tales"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The romantic ending was much too brief after the long story leading up to it, but it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I think this is my favorite Bronte novel. I have read the primary pieces by Anne's elder sisters, Charlotte and Emily. I left this book for last, expecting a somehow weaker work. I WAS WRONG! This is one of the most impressive feminist novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. One critique I read of this novel called it \\"the first sustained feminist novel.\\"Anne's sister, Charlotte, tried to suppress her sister's work. Charlotte wasn't much of a fan of Anne's work. And yet Charlotte ended up as literary executor of her sister's estate following Anne's death at age 28 (what have I been doing with my time?!?). In spite of the great initial success of the novel after its publication, Charlotte refused to allow it to go to a further printing. Even worse, she cut out the first 100 or so pages of background material, judging it as unimportant. Around 1950, the novel reappeared in its original form, with the original 100 beginning pages finally reinserted. Thank heaven! I don't think I care for Charlotte Bronte that much anymore. Don't get me wrong: \\"Jane Eyre\\" is brilliant. But the woman was somewhat arrogant and full of herself... The story focuses on Helen Huntingdon, a young woman forced to flee with her young son from her brutal and drunken husband. This was a time when running away from one's husband was a crime; taking the child without his permission was kidnapping. The heart of the novel consists of Helen's diary during her turbulent marriage, outlining her reasons for her dangerous step. She is an admirable woman; indeed, I think the merits of Helen Huntingdon as a great English literary heroine are right up there with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"'s Elizabeth Bennett and \\"Middlemarch\\"'s Dorothea Brooke.Read the novel Anne's sister Charlotte tried to make everyone forget. You'll love it and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bronte was certainly the most mysterious member of the Bronte family. Often refered to as sweet, shy and pious, it is almost unbelievable that she could have written a book as fiercly rebelious as The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. She went against all the Victorian ideals of the ladylike woman novelist and brought to light the cruelty of domestic violence in a time when women were taught to 'shut up and take it.'Perhaps the biggest mystery is why she is so under-rated. She is perhaps more daring and unconventional than Charlotte or Emily, tackling themes that people did not dare to talk about, let alone publish. I would love to have been able to read the mind of 'quiet, sweet Anne' to see what was REALLY going on in there."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Whenever I read any book from the Bronte Sisters, be it Charlotte, Emily or Anne, it's never a waste of my time for I know I will be reading a book written by one of best writers of the 19th Century. This book is written with great style and heart as well as understanding of what was to be a women with little or no choices. I know you'll enjoy it, I always do."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Whenever I read any book from the Bronte Sisters, be it Charlotte, Emily or Anne, it's never a waste of my time for I know I will be reading a book written by one of best writers of the 19th Century.

She is befriended by Gilbert Markham, who at first is received very coldly by Helen, but he is persistent and wins her trust. It becomes clear that Gilbert has developed intimate feelings for Helen, and although we can guess that she feels the same for him, she is determined to convince him that this is not a proper match. So she gives Gilbert her diary, which vividly details her abusive marriage to Arthur Huntington, an alcoholic and debaucher. Although this may sound like a depressing topic (which it is), Bronte's talent is what makes the book so absorbing and satisfying. She incorporates all the necessary ingredients to sufficiently whet your appetite, (romance, suspense, and a plethora of plot twists and turns) and provides a very satisfying, albeit, surprise ending.This is a book I will read again and again. It is a real treasure.By the way, I was told that the Oxfords Classics edition is the best one to buy. It contains a preface by Ann Bronte and the letter to J. Halford Esq. in the beginning, instead of just starting with Chapter One (&quot;You must go back with me&quot;). These were in Anne's original text, and in my opinion, add quite a bit to the entire work.Highly recommended, especially for book clubs.Cris"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bronte, the most underappreciated of the Bronte sisters, is a brilliantly talented author and storyteller. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a masterpiece of romance, suspense and simply a darned good read! Helen Huntingdon and Gilbert Markham are multi-dimensional characters. Bronte descriptions of the setting are moving as well. I can't say enough about this book, yet mere words don't do it justice. If you loved Jane Eyre (which I did), than the Tenant will be a novel you hold in high esteem. Read it, and then read it again. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The book is about the concept of pro choice for women(not limited to reproductive right, but in general quality of life issues, to choose one's own path), and about the willingess to pay and endure the price (no matter how unjust it may be). Choosing the responsible freedom over the neurotic necessity! I was blown away by the author's courage to break out of the coerced expectations and phony propriety, and to boldly address the taboos, the elephant in the middle of the room--as my friend says, \\"like telling them about the existence of fake orgasm\\"--about the irreconcilable differences and the notion of merit even in marriages of her time. The author does not mince words, very appropriately acerbic about the delusions of romance and marriage. An incredibly refreshing book of her era."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This book took me quite some time to read. There were times when I needed to take a break from it, but somehow it always called me back.There's a fairly complex narrative structure. The enveloping narrative is in the form of letters from a man to his friend, recounting events that happened years before. Several chapters in, the narrator tells of a journal that came into his hands, and the bulk of the book consists of entries from this journal. Within these narrative strands we at times get quotes from *other* correspondence. That Anne maintains this structure without ever confusing the reader as to which level of narrative we're in, and without thoroughly distancing her audience, says much for her skill.The narrator, Gilbert Markham, comes across as a bluff, cheerful character, giving something of a leavening to the account. This leavening is most welcome, because oh! the central narrative is dark, dark, dark in its portrayal of the collapse of a marriage. And Helen, the \\"tenant\\" of the title, is not a comfortable character. She made one disastrous mistake, and has been doing penance for it ever since. She's strong and unyielding, clinging to self-respect by a rigid moral rectitude, and not afraid to tell others when she considers them to be in error. At times I found the unremitting darkness too oppressive, but always the book called me back, because I simply had to know what happened in the end.Some of the subject matter was found shocking at the time. By making Helen's life more and more unbearable, the author makes us confront the question of when (if ever) it might be morally acceptable for a woman to leave her husband. And how is a woman to do so, in a time when she has no right to property of her own, and would almost certainly lose all access to her children?There were places when I found my credibility strained, such as the narrator's being privy to the thoughts of a character he had never met. And some of the minor characters gave the impression of being \\"types\\": the rough diamond who only needed a stern talking-to to change from being a drunken wife-beater to a fine and upright husband; the man who exuded evil; the villain plotting a woman's downfall. But the central characters, and indeed most of the minor ones, are beautifully drawn, and the plot goes through its many twists and turns to reach an ending I found most satisfying."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I am a huge Bronte fan and I enjoy Anne Bronte's work just as much as that of her sisters'. This book is just as hauntingly good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" or \\"Wuthering Heights\\". It's hard to believe that a writer who has lived so sheltered a life could draw such intriguing characters, and that someone so timid would tackle such bold subjects, but she does it masterfully.The narrative is perfect, giving us an inquisitive, suspenseful view from the outside, then the horrifying inside of this story of alcoholism, abuse and a mother's empowering love for her child. Most novels of this period don't touch on that maternal power much, but this one does, and by an author who never had children. Read this if you haven't, and by the way, \\"Agnes Grey\\" is also excellent."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I had to read this book for school and was not very happy, however, once I began this book, I could not put it down. Bronte mixes social commentary into a novel about a woman, Helen Huntington, who is struggling to do what is right while obeying the traditions and laws of her society. We witness the struggle of this woman as she endures and abusive, alcoholic husband who engages in extramarital affairs while she tries to raise her son proper with temperance. She struggles with a new life, and the life she left behind in this often ignored novel. Anne is a literary genius whose works are only now beginning to be viewed as works of a gifted writer, and the Tenant is a great example of her supreme talent."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"As some people would say, once you read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; then you'll definite end up with Anne Bronte &quot;Tenant of Wildfell Hall.&quot; The heroine is Helen. She could've turn out to be another Jane Eyre if she didn't have a son or an alcoholic husband. Like Jane, she stands by her moral convictions, and takes drastic action if necessary to achieve or maintain them. All in all, the book is terrific which all the characters got what they just deserve where every books should be."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"What were these three sisters doing to produce such great books in such short lives? This book is ahead of its time, and a page turner. Yes, a Victorian page turner. Everytime I thought the problem was about as bad as it could get and Anne Bronte would start wrapping it up, it got worse. For those who have read it, I've got to say Frederick Lawrence is far too forgiving...As for the writing, I had to admire how Anne Bronte let the reader in on things that went right over the heads of her narrators. This book is still fresh and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I am happy to see so many favorable reviews for the woman I view as the UNSUNG Bronte. This book was the hands down SURPRISE favorite of my Bronte classmates - we also read Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Villette.&quot;Imagine what Anne would have written if her life had not been taken at such a tender young age...&quot; was the topic of a lengthy discussion when we were done.DON'T MISS THIS WONDERFUL BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Exactly 150 years ago to this very day, Anne Bronte died in a small vacation house overlooking the sea at Scarboro.She was 29 years old...Hardly enough time for anyone to accomplish much,but this woman had done unbelievable things with her short life.Anne Bronte had left the world with 2 novels that will forever be engrained into the publics' minds and (more importantly) their deep rooted conscious.It is true to say that Anne has been overlooked as the least signifigant of the Bronte clan,(one critic even went so far as to say that her 2 novels were insignificant.)With a direct quote by the same critic while writing an introduction to Charlotte's Villette,saying. &quot;She was not gifted.&quot; This is an astoundingly bad remark to make torwards a writer like Anne,whom defyied all the norms of Victorian writing, much less the writing of women in general. All the Brontes broke this suffocating mold that which they had been placed into,however,in my opinion,Anne did the most relevant and jarringly realistic work of them all.Perhaps Anne's modivation for writing such harsh and realistic work was due to the fact that she had been labeled by her sister Charlotte as &quot;Quiet and Self Denying,with a nun-like veil,covering her countanence.&quot; Obviously Charlotte never really understood her sister, Emily I believe,had a greater understanding of Anne as their work parallels in their coarseness and brutal realism.To hold back is to compromise one's true feelings for the sake of others.I think one can say that it is due time that Anne get her day to shine in the literary world. Her novels,first Agnes Grey and then The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,both strong and filled with meaning,have been cast aside for far too long.Anne's talents for written word are extrordinary,considering she had never had much formal teaching,like her older sisters.These luxuries were too difficult for their father too afford, so Anne had to go out into the world and work as a governess.Something she desired to do. To make a name for herself.Thus spending a great deal of her young womanhood teaching rowdy and spoiled children and facing the onslaught of overbearing and cruel parents and various other adults,all who were rich in wealth, but poor in tact and morals.This kind of life Anne endured for a little over 5 years,writing blatently in her Prayer Book,&quot;I am sick of mankind and their disgusting ways.&quot; Surely Anne had seen more of the real world outside and for what it was than her sisters had thought or expierenced themselves.Yet one must not look torwards Anne with pity for enduring such a confined and lonely life at that time.For she herself dwelled mainly on the richness that her tiny exsistance brought her.There was always her writing and poetry. Thus brings me to the signifigance of her work.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is nothing short of brilliance.Although lacking in the wild imagination of her sister Emily or the romantic overtones of Charlotte,Anne's novels are their equal in strength and trueness of being.If not the best character study of them all.Helen Graham, &quot;the Tenant&quot; has just escaped a disasterous marriage to a man whom she describes as a husband that she not only despises,but that she hates.Quite a way with words for a nun I should say!Helen begins a new life,taking up residence in Wildfell Hall,much to the delight of her nosey new neighbors and becomes the talk of the town,thus slowly making way for her many disturbing secrets to come into the light.The details that follow as Helen decides to give her new friend Gilbert Markham,her diary,brings all the hauting past abuse from her marriage to life.The details of domestic abuse are written with such disturbing truth that the reader can only sit back and read in awe over Anne Bronte's acute awareness of the minds of those who have lost their morality.It is an all encompassing story,that keeps you spellbound throughout.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is never preachy,though it is filled with many Bibical phrases that ring so very true.It's this trueness and directness of character which makes it one of the best(if not the best,)domestic dramas ever written...To think,that Anne Bronte never married and never bore a child and thus wrote this novel only adds to my admiration of this woman,who deserves as much credit as her talented sisters. If not,perhaps abit more.....It may be 150 years ago to this day.. But Anne Bronte's work lives on...Thank You for your eyes... Daniel... P.S. A fantastic film version is available on 20th Century Fox film from 1996 starring Tara Fitzgerald and Rupert Graves."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' is written by the least remembered Bronte sister.

I can't say that I blame the talented, attractive young woman. I was not particularly turned-on by either of the men, myself. Middle-aged, stodgy and tiresome, they were not the answer to an eighteen year-old's dreams - even a practical eighteen year-old. A third suitor, Arthur Huntington, handsome, charismatic, and known by some to be \\"destitute of principle and prone to vice,\\" was obviously smitten by Helen, and she was drawn to him also. Her aunt emphasized that the young woman should, above all, look for character in a potential mate. She advised her niece to seek a man of principle, good sense, respectability and moderate wealth. She warned Helen away from Huntington, calling him a reprobate. Helen agreed that she should marry such a one whose character her aunt would approve of, but also argued that love should play a part in her selection. Meanwhile, Huntington, on his best behavior, continued to woo Helen until she finally accepted his proposal, on the condition of her relatives' approval. Helen knew that Arthur was somewhat deficient in sense, scruples and conduct. However, she also truly believed that with her own strong religious convictions and love, she could and would change him for the good. In spite of numerous examples of her beloved's past lechery and excesses, Helen insisted on the match. And so they married.Within a few months Helen became much more familiar with her husband's character. He had no hobbies nor interests, as she did. She is a gifted painter, loves to read, enjoys the outdoors, and is not easily bored. Arthur demanded all Helen's time and attention, to entertain and pamper him. When he could no longer bear the country solitude, he left for London, to reacquaint himself with his old haunts and bachelor friends. He insisted his wife remain behind, at their estate, Grassdale Manor. Huntington's behavior worsened with time, even after Helen bore him a beautiful son. He brought his debauched friends into his home for months on end, hosting wild drinking orgies and participating in a variety of low behavior extremely insulting to his wife, indeed, even encouraging his friends to mock his spouse. Helen eventually discovered that one of the houseguests, the wife of a friend, was Arthur's longtime mistress. Thus a double adultery was being conducted at Grassdale Manor, while she and her son were in residence, along with excesses of every kind.It was at this point that Helen, contrary to the customs of her times, locked her bedroom door against her husband. This seems like logical behavior in the 21st century. And many might ask why she did not leave Huntington long before. In the Victorian Age, the law and society defined a married woman as a husband's property. Women were totally dependant upon their mates, and husbands could actually have their wives locked away in asylums at their whim and convenience. There is a scene in the novel where Arthur has all Helen's paints and canvasses destroyed, and takes possession of her jewelry and money, so she cannot leave him. When the profligate begins to manipulate his young son, encouraging the child to drink and curse his mother, Helen does run away with her child.As the novel opens, we find her living in a few rooms at the remote Wildfell Hall, under the assumed identity of Helen Graham, a widow. Here she earns her living by painting. The neighbors are curious and seek her out, one in particular, Gilbert Markham. However when Helen is not forthcoming about her past, she becomes the object of ugly gossip and jealousy. Much of this compelling story is narrated through a series of letters Markham writes to a friend, and through Helen's own diary entries.The novel is divided into three sections: Helen's life at Wildfell Hall and her friendship with Gilbert Markham; Helen's diary describing the Huntington marriage; and the events following Markham's reading the diary. Anne Bronte's novel is powerful, haunting and quite disturbing. Miss Bronte, and her brother Branwell, served as governess and tutor to the children of wealthy aristocrats. Some of the behavior described here is apparently taken from events which Anne witnessed, and which marked Branwell severely. Ms. Bronte openly stated that in \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" she, \\"wished to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.\\" This well written, extraordinary tale can most definitely hold its own against the works of Anne's more famous sisters, Emily and Charlotte Bronte, and those of other noted authors of the period.JANA"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne is the Bronte we never read in school and most of us don't read afterwards, which is a big loss for those who don't, because she's at least as talented as her two older sisters. &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; can hold its own against &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; or &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; any day in the week, but it was panned in its own time, in large part because of its &quot;unladylike&quot; topic of alcoholism. Anne Bronte knew alcoholism first hand through her brother Bramwell who drank himself to death, and her revulsion of the alcoholic personality is central to this book. The heroine of &quot;Tenant&quot;, Helen Graham, is a headstrong and independent young woman, who marries Arthur Huntington against the advice of her family. She is one of those who loves not wisely but too well, because Arthur, a selfish and irresponsible womanizer, cares about nothing but satisfying his own wishes and desires. Helen wants to help Arthur turn his life around, which Arthur couldn't care less about, and his drinking and adultery right under her nose eventually repels her to the point where she despises him as much as she once loved him. It is only when she sees him attempting to influence her young son to become a chip off the old block, that she realizes her responsibility as a mother to save her son from his father trumps her duty as a wife to stand by her husband. With the help of her brother, she runs away with her son to the anonymity of life in a small village. Here she meets Gilbert Markham, who falls in love with her, but realizes that their relationship has no future as long as her husband is alive. Arthur's ultimate death from alcoholism not only frees Helen from an abusive and degrading marriage, it also leaves her free to find happiness with Gilbert. Anne Bronte pulled no punches in writing this book and that is probably what so perturbed readers of her own era; too bad for them, because they were unable to appreciate this book for what it is, one of the unrecognized classics of English literature."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"**** slight spoilers. nothing drastic *******This story is about a young lady of a good family in England 1827. Her name is Helen and her buyer's remorse after marrying for love. She ends up marrying a swine in Arthur Huntington. You can see Arthur H's in any bar or pub. The scenes of his abuse are well done. There are times when his wife, the main protagonist, is being abused by one of his friends and he sits back in drunken reverie, laughing foolishly.The novel itself is told in the epistolatory style, meaning it is told in a series of letters. The effect comes off well and it comes off as if you're reading the private lives of someone, getting their most intimate thoughts. If you like that style, I recommend the very different but very well done dangerous liasons.In the story, Helen's suffering is well portrayed. The reader gets a good sense of how and why she does what she does. Time and time again, I'm amazed at how resourceful and knowing she is for a woman of her age (early 20's I believe). But as she said to her illicit would be lover later on, young in years but old in tears. I can feel the cruelty of the world around her. It is as if everyone is perfectly conscious of her sufferings but no one dare acts (although this changes later, as you'll find out).The other protagonist, Gilbert Markham, is sort of a pompous fool. At one point he nearly kills Helen's brother. He's spellbound by love, yes, but I got the feeling that he just wasn't the kind and gentle type that you want Helen to end up marrying. Luckily most of the book revolves around Helen who is far more interesting because of how she handles her problems and her sheer resourcefulness.The reason why I closed the book and felt that I profited from it is because the imagery of the scenery and Helen's steadfastness in the face of such hardship impressed me. There's a point in the book where her hopes are literally shattered and burned up and yet she still carries on. An ordinary woman, with few friends and little to look forward to carrying on with life despite such serious setbacks. Now that to me is heroism. I'll take that over Batman or any other comic book hero any day."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Although Anne Bronte seems to be the least-known of the Bronte trio and only published two novels, this book has a more fascinating history to me than its more famous 'cousins', Wuthering Heights (Emily) and Jane Eyre (Charlotte). Not only was Wildfell the one to blow the lid on the male \\"Bell\\" pseudonyms the sisters had been writing under, but it's considered to be one of the world's first feminist novels, before that term existed. It was so controversial at the time of publication it was banned in many areas of Europe.Written as one long letter - and a diary within a letter, like Kostova's The Historian - from protagonist Gilbert Markham to his brother-in-law on how he met his wife, Helen, most of the actual story is presented in diary form by Helen herself. Initially presented to the reader as a mysterious widow who arrives in a small English village (where she first meets Gilbert), she becomes, very much against her will, a source first of endless curiosity, and then a target of malicious gossip.It then lays bare all of the shameful undercurrents of marriage in the Victorian age, particularly for a woman who was unwise or just unlucky enough to seriously misjudge the man she married. If you think it's a tough mistake to make now, only imagine its consequences in an age where divorce was rarely an option and you were almost always stuck with what you got, no matter how repugnant, immoral or tyrannical. Everything is here: adultery, alcoholism, abuse, alienation and humiliation.At the time, Bronte was apparently skewered by hypocritical moralistic critics who felt she shouldn't have exposed this underbelly of Victorian society's mores - or more precisely, its lack of compassion or even recognition of what women were expected to endure. Helen's character, a religiously devout woman but also a fighter who refused to accept the worst of the abuses or allow her son to be corrupted, was lambasted as an evil influence on women and girls. It's gratifying to know that as history's hindsight and passage tells us now, this novel ended up going a long way towards shaking up 19th century morals and and bringing about the first stirrings of women's rights.Like most Victorian novels it runs long and the modern reader might feel that it drags when compared to the quicker pacing of contemporary fiction, but I really enjoyed it and felt transported to another time."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bront (1820-1849) has published two books: 'Agnes Grey' (1847) and 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' (1848). In this book a young woman, Helen Graham, and her young son arrive in a small village and rent Wildfell Hall. She works as a artist to support herself and her child. The villagers try to find out who she is and what her background is. Helen does not tell a lot about herself and the villagers start gossiping about her. It turns out that Helen has fled from her alcoholic and abusive husband.At the time this book was written, it was not only considered morally wrong for a wife to leave her husband, but it was even against the law. According to some this book was (one of) the first feminist novel(s). Themes in this book are: alcoholism, gender relations, Victorian moral and the (lack of) rights of women. The alcoholic husband is believed to be based on Anne Bront's brother Branwell.This Kindle edition has 6421 'locations', which is compareable to over 350 pages in print in paperback."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bronte is often the forgotten sister among the Brontes. But she may be the most courageous in her writing. She weaves a tale of a woman who leaves her abusive husband, taking her child, and traveling to an unknown location to make her living by painting. This is unheard of in 19th century England. The wife, her children, and all her material goods belong to the husband who can do with them as he wishes. Anne Bronte is ahead of her time in saying that this is wrong and makes her heroine both courageous and compassionate. It is my favorite of the Bronte sisters' stories. If you haven't read it, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"'Sick of mankind and its disgusting ways' Anne Bronte once scribbled on the back of her prayer book. Her evident harsh view of life, coupled with her moral strength as a woman, are beautifully interwoven to produce this novel; her masterpiece. Although never enjoying the popularity and success of 'Jane Eyre' and 'Wuthering Heights' - her sisters' books - 'Wildfell Hall' is quite fit to join any bookshelf of classic English literature. The themes include utter despair and the tragic consequences of a young woman's naivety; Helen felt that, although she could see Arthur's faults, she would be able to somehow change him once they were married. In reality, her marital experience was a disaster.Anne Bronte creates a world in which the drunken, immoral behaviour of men becomes the norm and this may have been startling to contemporary readers - perhaps a reason for the book's panning at the critics. The narrative is built up delicately; first Gilbert; and then the racier, more gripping diary of Helen as she guides us through her married life; before returning again to Gilbert, whose tale by this time has become far more exciting as we know of Helen's past. Helen's realisation of the awful truth and her desperate attempts to escape her husband, are forever imprinted in the mind of the reader as passages of perfect prose.One of the earliest feminist novels, the underrated Anne Bronte writes in this a classic, and - defying the views of her early (male) critics - a claim to the position of one of England's finest ever female writers."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Apparently, the main reason Anne Bront's masterpiece is not as well known as her sisters' is that Charlotte suppressed any new editions after her death, as the novel was deemed extremely shocking for its time. This is very unfortunate, as The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is much better than Anne's previous book, Agnes Grey, better even than Emily's Wuthering Heights, and nearly as good as Charlotte's Jane Eyre. Like Jane Eyre, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall examines the roles of reason and passion in life and concludes that both are necessary to achieve happiness. More specifically, Wildfell Hall is about how to judge other people's characters, particularly in matters of love. These themes are brilliantly dramatized through a story about a woman who makes a youthful, but profound, error in whom she chooses to marry, and as her husband's vicious nature becomes increasingly clear, struggles to leave him---and how she herself is unfairly judged by her new neighbors when she manages to do so. (While I'm sure Anne didn't intend it this way, given her Christian piety, the novel could be read as a good argument for liberal divorce laws and the wisdom of cohabitation before marriage.)Many people sharply contrast the romanticism of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre with the realism of Wildfell Hall, but this is a mistake---and, despite its more frank depictions of some of the social problems of its time (including alcoholism and domestic abuse), Anne rejected this dichotomy in the novel itself:\\"'But romantic notions will not do: I want her to have true notions.'\\"'Very right: but in my judgment, what the world stigmatises as romantic, is often more nearly allied to the truth than is commonly supposed; for, if the generous ideas of youth are too often over-clouded by the sordid views of after-life, that scarcely proves them to be false.'\\"This is related to the broader theme about the dichotomy of reason and passion, which she also rejects, so that analysis more or less misses the whole point of the novel.Like Jane Eyre (and to a lesser extent Wuthering Heights), The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is an intellectual and emotional tour de force, and one of the greatest classics in all of world literature. It's a real tragedy that Anne died even younger than her sisters before she could write anything else. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is not my first time reading a Bronte novel. The Tenant of Wildfell was a gripping novel, rich in religion, duty, and morality. When I think of Helen, I think of her as the reflection of the moon in a lake at night. She, a beautiful glowing object of virtue (yet human in motives), amidst black evil; watery shallow souls. Her husband is her personal devil who constantly tries her and tempts her, which leads to Helen's separation from him (thus introducing us to Gilbert and his townsfolk). Bronte elegantly works the story backwards through Helen's journal; she gives it to Gilbert to read (doubtlessly because it is painful to speak about). As a teen, I feel sorry that my generation has Facebook, cell phones and texting, unable appreciate the deep, enrapturing literature that is so available to them. By the way, this is NOT a feminist novel (as Amazon puts on the tags for people writing a review for this). Beauty is abundant, but the fruit remains untouched. Please read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This must be the most romantic literary classic I've read so far. Neither Charlotte Bronte nor Jane Austen could match Anne Bronte's skills in depicting so well the beauty and heartache that goes with loving another person.The hero of the story is Gilbert Markham. Gilbert's a gem, a true darling of a guy. He's a farmer - young, handsome, kind, compassionate, passionate and honest. The heroine, Helen marries a brute (the alchoholic and adulterous Arthur Huntingdon) but later manages to escape and free herself from Arthur by fleeing with her young son to her refuge at Wildfell Hall. It is while there that she meets Gilbert and there is an almost instant attraction between these 2 very good individuals. However, as long as Huntingdon is still alive, Gilbert cannot be seen to be courting Helen although he loves her desperately. I'm happy when Anne Bronte decided to get rid of the despicable Huntingdon's character for good... This enables Gilbert and Helen to later reconcile and lead a happy matrimony life together.This is a very pleasurable read. It is very beautifully written and the people and emotions are very well fleshed out. We don't find many literary classics such as this that explores a man's (eg. Gilbert's) inner feelings and sentiments towards love and relationship, including sharing his anxiety and love-lorn feelings.I understand that the PBS video is good. But I hope one of the movie studios in Hollywood will consider making a movie adaptation of this classic. I'm sure it'll be a hit like &quot;Emma&quot; was (the one with Gwyneth Paltrow). IMHO, a fresh-faced actress like Liv Tyler would fit the role of Helen perfectly.Why this book is not as highly acclaimed as Jane Austen's or Charlotte Bronte's classics is truly beyond me.I highly RECOMMEND it!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This book is clearly labelled Spanish edition and yet by the accompanying picture is in fact in English.

She neither exaggerates or plays down evil or virtue but weaves a complicated dance between the two which paints a much more true to life picture. We are not all good or all bad, after all. Even the villainous husband is a sad character, one engendering both the reader's pity and disdain.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a must read for anyone with a fondness for the classics. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This book is really like modern day soap operas. There are a bunch of characters that participate in a lot of gossip about a subject that they really know little about. It gets bogged down in that at points, but it's still a great story. For a modern reader, it's easy to dismiss the subject matter as much ado about nothing.

Page 428. Actually, I agreed with the book on all counts. Alcoholism, money, patriarchal powered legal system, powerless women and children, and false morality can lead to officially sanctioned slavery and depravity and suffering under the name of Family Privacy and Christian Values. The problem with the book was every character and situation for 500 pages follow similar victims and victimizers. The outrage is legitimate, however the single note scream of agony is wearing on the nerves. I was happy to see there were nice guys and guys who became reformed, as well as depraved rich women among the depraved men. While Dickens provided some psychological pinnings for his characters, there was little background provided here other than that of Free Will or Choice once grown, though a strong case was made through little Arthur that teaching a child of three to swear, drink alcohol and partake of sexual games was the main reason for wild mean young men. Still, an interesting novel."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I was interested in this book only because of the author's famous sisters, Emily and Charlotte Bronte.

Some of the details about life at that time are informative."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is a wonderful and riveting story that is strangely missing in Classic English Literature. The three Bronte sisters were indeed a talented lot. But I always hate it when a person never lives to see their deserved acclaim. It's always a mark of a good storyteller when you can actually feel that you are truely a part of the story. I actually like this story a little more than Jane Erye, but that might just be me. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"In The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Anne Bronte proves herself to be just as capable a writer as her more famous sisters. This novel is about the suffering of one woman living in an unhappy marriage, and Bronte uses that story to display the desperation of women of that time trapped in inequal relationships. She also manages to show the strength and cleverness with which women managed to make use of what little power they had. The characters are well-developed and come alive in every scene, and the dialogue of the novel is very powerful.At the end, however, the story peters out; though the framing of the novel through a series of letters works well for most of the book, the last few chapters are weak, as Bronte tries too hard to create a firm end for every minor character she introduced throughout the book, and it doesn't quite fit with the narrative. But besides those few pages, this book is solidly written and clearly conceived. I strongly recommend it for anyone desiring a somewhat more realistic view of the period than presented by either of her sister's novels, but with just as great of writing."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"We got exactly what we expected.

There is also a little bit of romance which makes the book quite interesting !"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Initially I was somewhat dissatisfied reading this, and I felt it was due in part with how the characters were portrayed.I enjoyed the setting very much and the descriptions of the times and practices. But I found that the book's characters were very extreme. They were either overly good or very bad, with few if any redeeming characteristics. They were not presented with any degree of greyness.I nearly gave the book up before I started because I initially found the characters to be either pompous and patronising or very naive. I really didn't care initially for either Gilbert, Helen or Arthur. I thought that the secondary characters were only capable of malicious gossip.But as I read on, particularly of the struggle that Helen had in her marriage I found myself riveted and compelled to keep reading. She was a worthy and generous heroine, Helen. She matured into a compassionate woman who protected her child at all costs. This is a time where women were without resources and very few were willing to go against custom and aide them.But by the end I was glad that I perservered, times have certainly changed. I found the beginning and ending somewhat disjointed and it took a while for the meat of the story to start flowing. The ending was a bit disconcerting in places as Gilbert was revealing what happened to characters years into the future and then returning to the present.Overall I'm very glad that I read this ....it was an interesting social commentary of that time."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Modern writing has become a series of hits.

Despite the tedious Victorian language (sometimes an entire paragraph is one sentence!), you get hooked from beginning to end: the story is so well written, and the emotions described so clearly that you can feel what the characters feel. The strong female protagonist, the constant mental tug-of-war between doing right and wrong, beng strong enough to do what is right, questioning society's customs, and the dogmas of religion--all typical Bronte themes--appear in this book too."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The elaborate Victorian prose style of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall does not obscure a story that is recognizably modern--that of an idealistic young woman who wants to save her brutish, alcoholic husband from himself.Reviled for its \\"morbid love for the coarse, not to say the brutal,\\" The Tenant of Wildfell Hall continues the theme Bront began in Agnes Gray--that nurture's role in shaping in a person's character and future is more important than parents and other authority figures realize or take responsibility for. As Helen says of Arthur, she wants \\"to do my utmost to . . . make him what he would have been if he had not, from the beginning, had a bad, selfish, miserly father . . . and a foolish mother who indulged him to the top of his bent . . . doing her utmost to encourage those germs of folly and vice it was her duty to suppress.\\"Helen's background is also revealing. Raised by her uncle and aunt, she exemplifies the modern concept of the adult child of an alcoholic--self-righteous and controlling. Knowing that Arthur is flawed, she marries him with the objective of changing him and saving him for God. It can be speculated that Arthur, intrigued by Helen's youth, beauty, passion, and apparent demureness, envisions making her a more worldly woman. Neither knows the other beyond the surface, and each seems to want to transform the other into his or her own image. This is not the basis for a happy or durable union, as Helen learns.Failing to control the father, Helen turns her attentions to her son. Quite rightly, she is horrified when Arthur makes his son a pawn in their marital battle, teaching him the manly Victorian arts of sport and predation, love of drinking and carousing, camaraderie without friendship, and disrespect for and the subjugation of women. Even Bront seemed to be aware that Helen's approach is also disturbing in its own way, for the child-rearing debate between Helen and her new neighbors is the basis for an entire chapter before we learn her history. While many of Bront's contemporaries would have agreed with the vicar's argument that experience builds character, Helen slowly reveals how experience of the wrong kind without a moderating influence can destroy character.The structure of the novel is undoubtedly awkward; it is unlikely that anyone would share such intimate details and thoughts as well as another person's entire personal journal with even the dearest friend without a compelling reason. Gilbert, who is introduced, perhaps symbolically, as a hunter of predators (hawks), disappears from the story as he reads Helen's tale. This diminishes him, relegating him to Helen's redemption and reward. On occasion, for example, in \\"Domestic Scenes,\\" Bront's tense changes and irregularities make Helen's journal lose its currency and distract the reader with lapses into a novel-like tone.The structure does, however, allow the reader (and Gilbert) to meet the reclusive, protective, guarded, almost-grim Helen before we find out about the life that has shaped her and her inflexible opinions. The revelation of her character, and the strength she has to flout convention when her conscience and sense of duty require it, helps to complete Gilbert's growth from sarcastic village wit to the kind of mature man more worthy of her.Bront's stated purpose was \\"to tell the truth, for the truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it . . . Let it not be imagined, however, that I consider myself competent to reform the errors and abuses of society, but only that I would fain contribute my humble quota towards so good an aim . . . .\\" Helen's story, like that of Agnes, reveals the uglier aspects of Victorian family life, usually idealized, that resulted when women had few rights, men abused theirs, parents did not take responsibility for instilling healthy values (such as respect for life) in their children, and divorce was out of the reach of most. Beyond the impressive gates and parks, within the stately estates, behind the closed doors, lurked family and social problems that could not be hidden or denied away. Helen's story was disturbing not because of her depiction of Arthur's demeaning, childish, and amoral behavior, but because she exposes the falseness of the idyllic family life her society held dear and because she is willing to abandon what society considers her duty to her marriage to perform her real duty to herself and her son.Anne Bront's work has been compared unfavorably to that of her sisters, Charlotte and Emily. Yet its psychological insights, including the very coarseness and brutality of which contemporary critics complained, make up for Bront's lack of literary finesse. Her portrayal of Arthur, the fun-loving, amoral, pettish, selfish hedonist, and his boorish social circle resonates today. Despite his country gentleman status and his debt-supported wealth, Arthur is recognizable in all times and classes. Helen, too, is familiar as the long-suffering wife who finally takes action when her child is threatened.Although much has changed since Bront's time, her characterizations and insights on family life hold true today, making The Tenant of Wildfell Hall a classic in its own right."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Every ounce the creative literary genius that her sisters were, Anne Bronte is too often the unsung Bronte sister. \`Agnes Grey' is certainly a solidly written work of Anne's, full of many interesting details to enjoy; but since I first found and read \`The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' a number of years ago (in my search for all writings Bronte), I couldn't understand why that story of the mystery tenant wasn't every ounce the classic hit that \`Jane Eyre' and \`Wuthering Heights' had become. I don't mean to diminish the stellar writing styles and heights of either Charlotte or Emily Bronte, it's just that I simply cannot understand why Anne's equally marvelous writing has been so very overlooked, over time.I realize that some of the \`other' (what some might call lesser) Bronte works don't quite have the romantic punch of \`Jane Eyre' and \`Wuthering Heights', but \`The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' surely does. (And a little tweaking by a good movie maker could make most Bronte works, work as romance dramas anyway.) Anne's \`Tenant' tale is along the same lines as \`Eyre' and \`Wuthering', though perhaps not quite as melodramatic as those two classic stars by Charlotte and Emily. One thing that I find so compelling about \`Tenant' is the realistic look at a substance-addicted selfish cheating abuser, and Anne writes that scenario as if she lived it closely and personally. (yes, her brother lived something like that kind of self-indulgent life and surely she drew from his sad example, and she did work around other people whom she might have drawn bad or good examples from, but she was a spinster who died young) Beyond the \`gritty for those times' part of the story, there is enough of the romantic in \`Tenant' to make any romantically inclined woman swoon. The \`Tenant' has the romantic goods: the lady, her hero, and their true love story. \`Tenant' has quickly become one of my top favorite novels, alongside \`Eyre' (which has been a cherished favorite of mine for more than forty years) and several Jane Austen novels that are favorites to many women.There is such amazing writing in most (if not all, as far as I can recall) the Bronte Novels: many sentences that I must stop to read at least twice because they are so perfectly done. Even though I'm much more wired to be focused on the character-driven details rather than anything that remotely approaches purple prose or flowery fiction; the Bronte sisters' descriptives that paint scenes with skillful choices of words, make me stop and repeat for at least the second read through. But then again, I reread many of the Bronte sisters sentences. I am often thoroughly amazed at their skill with the English language. And then there is French and German in some of their prose as well (perhaps only Charlotte and Emily's). Yes, beyond their innate creative genius, they were definitely well educated (primed for the higher class governess trade, or to teach in better schools). I can confidently say that all three of the Bronte sisters win my utmost admiration for their highest levels of literature, and Anne Bronte stands as a true equal to her sisters in her winning effort of \`The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'.\`The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' audio book is a wonderful way to read the novel (in particular by Alex Jennings, who reads the first and last parts of the \`Tenant' story: the narration of the main man - the hero in the story, as in letters of his \`love story' to his friend and brother-in-law). The large mid-section of the story is not my favorite to read over and over again, likely for obvious reasons once you read it for yourself (it can become a bit depressing, you could say), but Jenny Agutter does fine with it. My own personal favorite parts of the audio book are the first and last sections when Alex Jennings is reading. I think that it takes at least a good actor to read fiction well, but from my relatively limited experience, I have found very few actor readers that read well enough that I want to listen over and over again. I have become a recent fan of well-done audio books, because it is an easy way to read favorite books in-between actually reading them yourself. When you can't read (the old fashioned way - or even an ebook on a tablet) for a variety of reasons (driving, working, exercising, resting your eyes, or, like me all too often: laying awake at night with crazy-making insomnia - too tired to do anything, including focusing for reading), it is great to be read to by a masterful reader. I have gradually chosen a number of favorite audio book readers (amazing actors whom I wish would read more of my favorite books so that I can just kick back and listen all my favorite books), and Alex Jennings is among the very top. His is a soothing voice that is pleasant to listen to anytime (even when on the edge of sleep but not quite crossing the sandman bridge to sleeping). Beyond his pleasing tonality, he possesses a genius for playing the different characters. As far as I have heard thus far, not many men can pull off numerous women convincingly and without distraction or irritation of any kind (and vice versa - it is perhaps even tougher for a woman to read the men characters without coming off sounding weirdly feminine or fake deep voiced). I seldom am able to suspend my disbelief when men read women and women read men, but there are a very few extremely talented readers who have been able to pull that off convincingly, and Alex Jennings is one of them. When Mr. Jennings is speaking for a woman, I tend to forget that a man is narrating, and he does numerous women equally well, while they are each still well differentiated - from the pleasant to the shrill. He also voices many men equally well, from youthful fellows to the love-interest hero, to cranky or daft old men as well. I can imagine that reading a novel with many characters is no small task, even for some of the best actors, and I dare say that it takes a certain genius to pull it off as well as he does.Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The novel is about Helen Huntingdon, who runs away with her young child, in order to take him away from the bad influence of her husband. While she is hiding out at Wildfell Hall, her mother's old home (?), Helen meets the kind neighbour Gilbert Markham, and they take a liking to one another. Of course, nothing can come of it - her husband is still very much alive. Unfortunately.Most of the back story is told through diary entries. Markham wants to know Helen, and she gives him plenty of things to read, so that he will know just what has been going on with her, and why she can't commit to him, even though she cares for him and can see that he is a wonderful man.The story she tells begins with a naive teenager who falls head over heels in love with a society rake in London and marries him thinking she'll live happily ever after. It doesn't take her too long to realise that her life isn't going to be all that rosy, after all. There is no grand romance going on at all, and Helen tries to keep to herself.When she gets pregnant, and finally brings her husband an heir, Lord Huntingdon doesn't waste time trying to get the child to learn how to be cruel to animals and even gives him alcohol. Frightened her darling boy would grow up to be the image of his father, she eventually escapes to the Yorkshire moors, and tries to support herself as a painter. And then meets Mr. Markham, and so on.For just being a parson's daughter in a small town in the mid-1800s, you wonder how on earth Anne Bront could come up with a story like this. It's so realistic, you'd think she had a bitter marriage to some drunkard herself, but that's not the case. She never married.If there is something I thoroughly enjoy about Anne's novels (sadly, there's only two of them) is her characterisation. We learn so much about all the major characters that you can't help but be drawn in. While I generally shy away from novels full of misery and gloom and end up seriously disliking them, this was perhaps the exception to confirm the rule.The biggest problem I have with misery novels is that often, people tend to wallow in their own self pity and complain, but not do anything at all to at least try to improve their situations. Helen actually decides enough is enough and leaves. It's a brave thing to do. And perhaps it's because she decides to leave her abusive a**ehole of a man behind that I didn't grow bored or frustrated reading this.\\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" is a stark reminder that love stories where you fall in love with handsome rakes don't always have a happy ending, and it's a 4 out of 5 paintings from me."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The story of Helen Graham, her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon and her life outside the conventional role of a woman, wife and mother in the 19th century deserves a much broader contemporary readership. The subject matter is confronting, and many of Anne's beliefs and sense of moral duty may not sit neatly with contemporary readers.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall explores a number of different themes, a number of which are drawn from Anne's own experience as a governess, as a member of a family impacted by the addictions of a family member and by observations of society outside the parsonage at Haworth. This novel is frequently dissected from the perspective of dealing with sexist double standards and dissolute behaviours. While this is one way of categorizing the issues dealt with, the danger in doing so is that the voice of hope for a better future can be lost.Anne Bronte died at the tragically early age of 29. And for a young woman whose mother died when she was still an infant, who outlived all but one of her siblings, hope for the future is all the more remarkable. Anne's characters are not always well developed and her prose sometimes shows more promise than polish. But underneath all of this is an underlying sense of duty, a deep vein of passion and of belief. Those of us who can see her inherent talent in the two published novels that are her legacy can only speculate about what might have been had she lived longer and written more.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall sometimes kept me quite engaged and at other times seemed a bit dull. I thought it was at its best when Helen was communicating through her letters. Her character was well developed and I could understand her feelings and why she made many of her decisions. The parts where Gilbert was the main character were more difficult for me to get through. Perhaps it was simply that I had a hard time empathizing with him. He seemed very self-centered, stuffy and unable or unwilling to empathize with others. He often misinterpreted others' comments or actions and I sometimes felt like giving him a piece of my mind to put it mildly.The book gives a good look at the culture at the time. For example, I could see how women in those days were treated as little more than possessions by their husbands and parents. It was interesting to see how a few of the girls and women struggled to be able to marry whom they wished or to obtain rights that we take for granted today."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Let me just preface my review by saying, \\"Thank GOD, I didn't live back then!\\" The story is told by Gilbert Markham through a series of letters to his friend Halford and by journal entries of the mysterious and devout Mrs. Helen Graham. A recent widow, Mrs. Graham and her young son are the new tenants of Wildfell Hall, a dilapidated estate owned by Frederick Laurence. The air of mystery that surrounds Mrs. Graham is certainly fodder for the townsfolk. She is quiet, reserved and not very inviting to most of her neighbors. Wildfell Hall only has a few rooms that are in livable condition. And she has a strange attachment to her son, Arthur. She is never separated from him.As the days go by, Gilbert finds that he is undeniably attracted to Mrs. Graham. But he is very disheartened to find that rumors are now being circulated around town about Mrs. Graham and Frederick, a man that Gilbert has always considered a friend. It is also very clear to him that Helen is shutting him down at ever effort to get to know her, especially regarding her past.Eventually, Helen is unable to deny her feelings for Gilbert and gives him her diary. This action is her one chance for him to understand who she really is and dispel the rumors that the townsfolk have come to believe. The diary is Helen's account of her life before she moved into the rooms at Wildfell Hall, but most specifically, it is about her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon, a very charming man that had few, if any, scruples.At first I had a hard time getting into this book. I found the characters all rather unlikable and rather annoying. The townsfolk were always in everyone's business. Gilbert was rather insensitive and kind of bully, when you come right down to it. And Helen spent most of the book playing a martyr by saying it was \\"God's Will\\". I do realize that it was different times, and a woman's rights were very few. This is the main reason I overlooked my annoyance and continued reading. In the end, I found that I really enjoyed the story. Bronte wrote this book at a time when women were less than citizens and brought forth a whole host of probably very controversial topics for that time: alcoholism, infidelity, and women's rights to name just a few. I think Anne Bronte was very much ahead of her time."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a riveting novel by the \\"least famous\\" Bronte sister Anne. The main character is Helen Huntingdon, who also uses the assumed name Helen Graham for part of the book.Narrated in part by Mr. Markham, the gentleman farmer who falls in love with her, and partly by herself in diary form, the Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a sad portrayal of the miseries Helen Huntingdon endures at the hands of an immature self-centered husband.The story starts out with Helen, an intriguing beautiful \\"widow\\" who comes to live in a deserted moorland mansion called Wildfell Hall with no one but her maid and young son as companions. She excites the gossip of the local townspeople by her refusal to mingle in the town's social life, her strong opinions on the upbringing of her 5 year old son, and by working to support herself as a landscape painter. Mr. Markham, the gentleman farmer, rather than being repelled by her fiercely guarded independence is intrigued by her and determines to learn more about her, falling in love with her in the process. Helen becomes the butt of sinister gossip when it is discovered that she and Mr. Lawrence, her landlord, are not the strangers to each other that they pretend to be in public, and it is rumored that something is going on between them romantically.It is in response to this falsehood that she turns over her diary to Mr. Markham, who at last learns within its contents her true identity, why she is at Wildfell, and why she can not marry him. He also learns the astonishing identity of Mr. Lawrence. Helen's diary traces her life from a naive girl of 18 to a courageous woman of 26, and the sorrow and trials she endures in her marriage to a wretch of a husband, the womanizing, alcoholic Arthur Huntingdon."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I read &quot;The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall&quot; by Anne Bronte for my review of personal reading in English last year and I thought it was really gripping. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.It tells the story of a young woman's struggle for independence, against law and a society which defined a married woman as her husband's property. The novel, which uses extracts from her diary and narration from her neighbour, is very interesting and quite realistic.It seems to me that the most interesting thing about the novel, is the build up of tension Bronte uses to sustain the reader's attention. It is stimulating and creates a little excitement in the book.Helen Graham moves into Wildfell Hall with her son. She is a single mother and earns her living as a painter. Her neighbour, Gilbert Markham, takes a sudden interest in her and wants to find out everything about her. Although she is quite content being friends with him, she wants nothing more. As soon as he becomes too personal, she reminds him that friendship is the principal of their relationship. As they spend more time together, though, she learns to trust him and reveals the truth about her past. She is living at Wildfell Hall under a false surname, hiding from her husband who is an adulterer. The only other person who knows of this is her landlord, who Gilbert learns late in the novel, is in fact, her brother.One thing which I found gripping about this story, was the build up of tension Bronte used. She took her time, revealing one thing, building up the tension again, then revealing another. She continued to do this throughout the story, and this is what kept me interested. It is a story, in which two people who love one another, are prevented from being together by society and their own natural reticence. We know romance often has this, but Bronte creates a strong desire in the reader for them to be together. She puts real obstacles in the way of their love for each other, such as the fact that Helen is already married and has a child to her husband. This therefore, causes the reader to understand the story more."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is a breathtakingly wonderful novel. Although I'd read it years ago I bought it again, tempted by the scholarly material I knew I'd get with a Broadview edition. I found a second reading of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall deeply rewarding.Anne Bront's novel still has shock value today, but in 1848 it was a bombshell. It dealt with a subject that was hush-hush in polite society: upper-class alcoholism. Drunkenness was supposed to be a failing of the lower orders.Bront's depictions of \\"coarse language,\\" \\"revolting scenes\\" and outright debauchery among gentlemen horrified the critics, who sternly warned \\"lady readers\\" against The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. Amazingly, even Anne's sister Charlotte disapproved of the novel and called its subject matter \\"an entire mistake.\\"Britain's patriarchal legal system offered no protection to women in abusive marriages. A woman, her assets and her children were the property of her husband. Bront's heroine, Helen Huntingdon, defies the law by fleeing an alcoholic husband and going into hiding incognito with her small son.The story of Helen's horrific marriage is central to the plot, but the multi-layered narrative also offers us a thrilling love story replete with charm, anguish, suspense and humor.I loved the introduction, but as it analyzes the plot, I'd suggest reading it after the book. The editor's discussion of Bront's controversial themes is quite fascinating.I loved the footnotes too! Without them you might not notice that Bront's prose is subtly laced with biblical allusions. Whether joking, flirting or fighting, the characters are constantly quoting Matthew, Mark, Luke, Genesis, Galatians, Ephesians, Isiah and the Psalms.But even Bront's heartfelt theology came under attack by her contemporaries. Her belief in universal salvation (sinners would eventually get into heaven) was considered \\"false and bad.\\"The Broadview edition of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is an absolute gem. I recommend it over all others."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"How explain literary genius? How pinpoint the DNA which made three Yorkshire girls living in a rundown parsonage world famous authors? \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" author is Anne the youngest of the Bronte sisters. This novel is little known but is still an excellent example of Victorian fiction at its best. The novel is set in the Regency period and deals with a mysterious widow who becomes the tenant of the rundown estate called Wildfell Hall. She is the subject of gossip in the small town close to the old estate. Gilbert Markham falls in love with her.The book begins with a glance backward to 1827 by the first person narrator Gilbert Markham who is a farmer. We meet Gilbert, his siblings Rose and Fergus as well as their grumpy mother. This first 115 pages show us social comedy as Gilbert is the romantic beau ideal of a fatuous preacher's daughter. He sees Markham becoming friendly with Helen and her young son Arthur. Gilbert sees Helen with a man thinking she is proving untrue to their burgeoning romance. Later we will learn that the enigmatic stranger is none other than her brother! Helen gives Gilbert a diary which consists of about 300 pages in the novel. In this diary she tells her sad tale. After his all night perusal of the diary the fiery Gilbert is convinced Helen is worthy of his love and protection.Helen was wed to a rakish, drunk named Arthur Hunington who takes her to his home at Grassdale. Arthur lives a dissolute life. He is lazy, unkind to animals and socializes with sleazy aristocrats. He carries on an affair with the stupid Annabella leading to Helen's leaving him.The novel is a love story, an indictment against alcoholism and a story well told with well sketched characters to hold your attention.I thought it interesting that \\"Wildfell Hall\\" has the same \\"WH\\" as does Emily Bronte's more famous \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I also noted that the heroine of Anne's novel is \\"Helen\\". Did this remind the youngest Bronte of elder sister Charlotte's memorable tragic child \\"Helen Burns\\" a student at Lowood School in Jane Eyre? The novel is also influenced by the 1700 page eighteenth century letter novel \\"Clarissa\\" by Samuel Richardson.Anne Bronte died at the young age of 29 with her potential unrealized. She did produce this fine book and her other classic \\"Agnes Grey.\\" She is worth a read! A good book to curl up with on a dark and stormy night!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I raced through this thing in 3 days - any moment that wasn't spent reading it was spent thinking about it. But at the end, I was disappointed. I guess the romantic in me was rooting for Huntington. I know he was a cruel (...), but I couldn't help liking him despite it all. I think he did truly love Helen - there was certainly no other person in the book who had a stronger influence on him, for good or for evil. I never really felt anything for Gilbert, on the other hand. He was too good or something. I wish Bronte had killed him off instead of Huntington. Even Helen would get rather obnoxious at times with her incessant moralizing. Also, the end was so lame and contrived. Anne manipulated the plot so that every \\"good\\" person lived happily ever after and every \\"bad\\" person lived a life of misery (or died). An overly simplistic view of things. But up until the last 50 pages or so, it was pretty good stuff. I've read Jane Eyre, Villette, and Wuthering Heights, and while I would say all of those are superior to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, the Tenant is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I really loved how this story started out....I was engrossed and it was a page turner. It got stuck somewhere in the middle towards the end. Stuck, boring and quite annoying. Too much...\\"All for the Just Cause\\" etc etc. It just didn't enjoy the last half or so...it died."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"After reading a flat and unintresting Jane Eyre I found myself shunning the work of the Bronte family, until I read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. This is no Jane Eyre and should never be compared, even though frequently I have heard the outlandish comparision. In the novel Anne Bronte introduces the reader to real women, no Jane Eyre type who's only accomplishment was living one her own. No Anne Bronte's main character leaves her husband ( something which was unheard of at that time) and lives alone with her son. Bronte also changes the form of the classic novel by speaking as from both a man and woman's perspective. The strengh of the novel is the fact that Bronte's starting narrator is a man then a woman and once again a man. She takes a risk which last over 100 pages when the tenant (woman) becomes the narrator as the man narrator reads her journal. This novel tell a tale of a woman who breaks free from society to save herself. Anne Bronte has become the forgotton sister, though her works were never as sucessful as her to sisters, I feel that her risk taking ability, along with her ability to tell a great story makes her the best out of the three. I would also tell everyone to read her other novel Agnes Grey for it to is a great story. I only wish that Anne Bronte had left more works for her loyal fans as myself to read."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne cannot write up to her famous sisters. What a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Too long, too wordy, too predictable and the heroine is insipid."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Never having read Anne Bronte before, and being a huge fan of Charlotte Bronte, I went into this book with high expectations. Perhaps that is my fault. Gilbert Markham's share of the story is interesting and flowing, but Helen's part begins to drag, and the reader is drawn into what feels like Anne Bronte's rather annoying God-talk. Helen is more interesting when seen from Markham's perspective. However, when we are introduced to the Helen who marries Huntingdon, one can't help but feel that perhaps he is the victim, driven to drink by her overly &quot;good&quot; nature. In fact, she was so good she is just downright annoying. Always quick to sermonize and put herself in the place of good, the novel doesn't start to pick up again until Gilbert takes over the narrative again. Also, the Helen we see after the death of her husband is flirtatous, nothing like the woman we see before, and even though Gilbert loves her more after he learns her real story, I can't help but feel that he should have gone running in the opposite direction. It's obvious that the reason Anne Bronte is not as widely read as her sister is that she did not have the same skill for making a truly good AND sympathetic character the way Charlotte did with Jane Eyre. Jane was good and pure, but passionate, while Helen was downright preachy, even for her time. Even the rantings of Heathcliff and Catherine were better than this. I give two stars simply because I liked Markham's passion."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"It was a good book, but I thought it was a woman for a long time because of the depth of thought. Men just don't think like that, and the author put too much thought process into everything."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' is written by the least remembered Bronte sister. Many people at the time, including her sister - Charlotte, thought that this book tackled inappropriate subject matter, but I disagree. It is a passionate book about a woman's struggle to free herself and her son from her dissolute husband. She flees to a broken down mansion where she attracts the attention of a young farmer. In order to clear the gossip surrounding her dwelling in Wildfell Hall, she offers him her diary to read, which takes up the main part of the narrative. This book is extremely readable and deserves much more attention than it actually receives. The female protagonist is a likeable woman, whose plight obtains sympathy with the reader. It has been described as a feminist book, before its time and when Helen Huntingdon shut the door on her husband it 'resounded throughout the whole of England'."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"In some ways, it's surprising that both this Bronte novel and sister are not as well known as the Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Charlote and Emily Bronte respectively. Social issues, including martial breakdown, alcoholism, adultery, divorce, women's rights, child custody,and comparison of Protestant sects such as Calvinism versus Universalism, are boldly confronted. Excellent character and setting development throughout the story provide another strong part to the story. This Oxford edition's note section also enhances understanding of the 1820-1840 era, with fascinating tidbits such as the new German dance, the waltz, was then viewed as amoral, while homemade ale was considered virtuous. One wonders how much is based on various actions of several Bronte family members. These components make The Tenant of Wildfell Hall a very worthwhile read. The only shortcoming is the long drawn portion near the end--very repetitous and tedious for about a 100 pages; otherwise this would be a 5 star novel."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Helen Graham is no ordinary Bronte heroine. She does not have a pathetic childhood and does not live her life like a victim. Her source of attractiveness lies in her personal beauty, intelligence and moral character, and not in madness, meanness, or carrying the sceptre of victimhood. The charm of the story is in how it unfolds so I will not give anything away. As for why it hasn't been more successful, all I can say is, I do not believe the novel was less popular in its time because of any technical flaw on the part of the writing. More likely, it was because this character would not settle for the acceptable place of a woman in Britain during that time. While reading her story, one cannot help but believe she deserves everything she thinks she does. The circumstances in the novel may have created sympathy for her righteous indignation and kept it from open criticism but the readers at that time might have been uncomfortable with the clear implication that it was time for women to claim their equal rights alongside their husbands -- a point made with palpable spiritual authority."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I love this book so much! It is as much of a masterpiece as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.This is actually the most feminist Bronte novel and the most corageous in dealing with social issues. It deals with the evils of drink and with domestic violece in a realistic way. Yet it is a beautiful lyrical book at the same time.It explodes the Victorian myth of \\"the Angel in the House\\", and savagely attacts the 19th century assumption that women must be kept innocent and ignorant for their own good. It is the Bronte novel which was panned upon its publication because it so strongly attacked the status quo of the time and this maybe why she is to this day wrongly regarded the inferior writer of the three."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Now this was a surprising gem of a novel! Back in high school we read a couple staples by Anne Bronte's more famous sisters Charlotte and Emily. But you never hear much about Anne so you may expect \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" to be decidedly inferior to her sisters' work. You would be, umm, wrong. :-)This novel never approached the popularity of Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, but believe me that wasn't on account of quality. Rather, Tenant explores themes that went quite against the grain of accepted English cultural norms of the time (early 1800s). Helen Graham (her assumed name in the beginning of the story) not only dares to think herself wiser than her fool of a husband Arthur, she acts upon it and takes drastic steps to protect her child from his influence. The heroine's actions were considered radical at the time and that's probably why the novel didn't do as well as those of her sisters, whose novels were relatively a sight more conventional.The story is told through two devices: (1) a flashback from the viewpoint of the hero Gilbert Markham and (2) a large section of Helen's very detailed diary embedded within Markham's story. The arrangement works well and allows Markham to withhold certain crucial details until later, making the novel quite a page turner. Despite Bronte's many grammatical errors (the editor of the Penguin edition readily points them out in excellent endnotes), her writing is superb. Characterization is phenomenal; you have met some of these people before and you may even find that Bronte describes many elements of your own personality in her creations! During Markham's flashback you'll be just as horrified as he was at discovering \\"evidence\\" of Helen's duplicity. During the diary portion you'll empathize with Helen for her poor choice of a spouse. You'll see Helen's opinion of Arthur spiral downhill as she gets to know him better during married life, showing how falling in love made her blind to the glaring faults in his character early in their relationship.The novel will likely make you examine yourself. If you're single it'll help you understand the criticality of choosing a spouse that won't doom you to a dull (or even worse, unhappy) life. If you're married it'll (hopefully!) make you grateful that you're not stuck with an Arthur or Annabella type. If most men and women were as selfish and shallow as nearly all of the characters in Tenant, the world wouldn't be a pretty place to live in. These people DO exist (I have relatives and their friends who proudly strut the behavior that Arthur and his cronies do), but thankfully not in near the proportions that Bronte paints.Highly recommended for all adult readers!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"It has been a couple of months since I read this, and it has taken this long to formulate a review in my head. What to say about such a dense and draining story? Our protagonist is a long-suffering and hapless victim of a charming, handsome and initially romantic man turned brute once marriage vows are exchanged.Helen Graham starts as an innocent, albeit strong-willed girl of good breeding who has no trouble fending off undesirable (read boring) suitors much to the chagrin of her upright and unyielding religious aunt. She favors instead the roguish charms of Arthur Huntingdon, who rescues her from one such undesirable suitor at a social gathering. She is smitten, and abides boorish behavior from him (he snatches from her a painting she has made of him, thus embarrassing her) and ends up marrying him, assuring her disapproving aunt that she knows what she is doing. Alas, she does not. As the marriage progresses, she endures increased boorish behavior from him and his frequent rowdy guests, infidelities that take place in their own house, drunkenness and extended absences with false promises of speedy returns. Helen's consolation is their little son, and a sympathetic housekeeper; she escapes into artwork to while away the dreary days of her existence. When her husband becomes violent she plots escape.I found most of the story riveting and was outraged at the situation of women in a society where very few resources were available to them when trapped in an abusive marriage. She suffers the derision and criticism of ignorant vilagers as she is bound to silence regarding her true situation. This makes Helen's courageous stand doubly courageous. There are numerous biblical references, so many that it bogged the story down a bit for me though given my background (I was sent to a private Christian Academy for most of elementary and half of high school years) I didn't really need to read all of the explanatory footnotes. I did, however, need to read other footnotes. It was distracting but I feel I have received quite an education with this Broadview edition. This must be what is used for college students when assigned this book to read.For those looking for more of a taste of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" (as I was), you won't find a similar story here! Anne's book is an entirely different yet equally intense story of an strong-minded woman. Depending on your view of Christianity, you may or may not become exasperated with Helen's eternal goodness and forgiving nature, always trying to save her husband's rotten soul from the fires of Hell. But it is well worth the read if you are prepared for it. This is quality literature."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I had already read Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Shirley, and Emily's Wuthering Heights many years ago, but I had never read anything by Anne Bronte until recently.I enjoyed The Tenant immensely and found it most absorbing. Of course, I am a sitting duck for this kind of thing. I agree with the tradition that Shakespeare is #1 and Jane Austen #2, and most modern novels don't even rate (except perhaps Lord of the Rings and The Brothers Karamazov). So, you see, my recommendation should probably not be taken seriously by most readers. Many of the books I have read recently are out of print. Really an old fogie."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bront's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" is much, much more than mere gothic romance or the puffery that a modern reader might categorize as Victorian chick lit. A powerful feminist novel that excoriates repressive British laws surrounding marriage and the property rights of females with respect to their husbands, \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" tells the story of Helen Huntingdon, a female, who like so many others of her sex both then and now, fell prey to the fantasy that the questionable values and dubious behaviour of the man with whom she had fallen in love could be changed by her example, by her loving care and tutelage.There are few vices that do not appeal to Arthur Huntingdon. A philanderer, a hard-drinker, a cool and inattentive husband, a devil-may-care sportsman, a man whose attitudes toward church and religion are irreverent, flip and impious, and a profligate, if moderately successful, gambler, a man who cannot even search his heart to find love for his own son, Huntingdon has made his wife's life an unending lonely and miserable existence in which she has to suffer in silence, to hide her poor choices and incorrect decisions from the family who argued so eloquently against the marriage at the outset.When Huntingdon hijacks his own son and seeks to teach him his evil ways, even to the point of cursing his own mother, Helen Huntingdon realizes that she must find a way for her and her innocent son to escape the relationship. But the unconscionable repression of Victorian property laws in marriage, which effectively make a wife her husband's property, force her to abandon everything and to escape into hiding with her son under the assumed name, Mary Graham.Now earning a meagre living as a talented artist in a few rooms at the exquisitely isolated and all but abandoned Wildfell Hall, Mary Graham and her son are forced to endure the abusive, malicious gossip and imaginings of the local townsfolk ... well, that is, all of the local townsfolk except for Gilbert Markham who, much to his own surprise, works past his initial disdain for Mary and falls so deeply into love with her that an existence without her becomes a prospect that he cannot bear to dwell upon.Powerful, haunting, violent, disturbing, and moving, \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" is an eloquent critique of the legally codified sexual double standards that exemplified Victorian behaviour. From the standpoint of a modern reader, the only criticism I could possibly make is that, for my tastes at least, Markham and Huntingdon are just a little too saintly and long-suffering. I prefer my protagonists to be moderately more human.That said, \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" was certainly a gripping story that, while not a modern thriller, is undeniably a page turner. As a newcomer to the writing of the entire Bront family, I'll be looking for more in the very near future.

People who do not enjoy Victorian literature might find this book dull, but, barring that possibility, it is a well-written, ambitious work with plenty to engage the modern mind. It is so incredibly different from her earlier piece, Agnes Grey; much darker, more complex, and more accomplished --- the progresison of Anne's skill between the two is staggering.In terms of narrative structure, it almost rivals Wuthering Heights in complexity. Wildfell Hall has a tripartite narrative structure. Anne Bronte introduces us to the enigmatic, reclusive Helen (the tenant of the title) through the eyes of Gilbert Markham (a foolish, immature, but somewhat charismatic gentleman farmer), who is repulsed by her eccentric, obstinate manner, but who cannot deny the bond forming between them. Helen, new to the neighbourhood, raises first the suspicion, then the ire, of the insular local community (which is drawn in a dry, humourous style not unlike Jane Austen). When events come to a head, Helen finds the only way to exonerate herself is to offer up her diary for examination.The core of the novel is Helen's diary, which covers the years of her life before coming to Wildfell Hall. This is a remarkable tale of deception, domestic abuse, and the dangers of keeping women naive and ignorant. Helen has suffered through ignorance and naivity, and is now a wise women in control of her own life. Anne Bronte seems to channel Mary Wollstonecraft in her calls for more and better education for women in the 19th century.I will make no comment on the third part of the novel, only to say that the narrative voice returns to Gilbert for the denouement contained therein. The end is problematic for some, but I think Anne leaves it open enough for multiple theories and ideas regarding it, many of which have recently been published in scholarly articles.This is the most feminist Bronte novel (yes, more than anything Charlotte penned). It absolutely explodes the Victorian myth of the Angel in the House, and savagely attacts the 19th century assumption that women must be kept innocent and ignorant for their own good. Indeed, Anne anticipated so many modern developments in this text that I would go so far as to say that it is the Bronte novel which has remained most relevant in today's society. It is also the Bronte novel which created the most critical censure upon its publication (likely because it so strongly attacked the status quo of the time).The aforementioned Helen is one of the most captivating characters I have ever encountered. She is strong-willed and independent-minded, but in no way perfect. Indeed, she is deeply naive when we see her at a younger age, but Bronte does not condemn her for her faults. Instead, she shows how, through conflict and experience, Helen has grown into the \\"tigress\\" she is later described as being.Anne is often criticized for simply retelling the story of her brother Branwell's decline in this novel. Those who have studied Bronte biography and who have read the book, though, would see that such charges are, in a word, ludicrous. Anne is also often criticized for moralizing and writing long religious tracts, instead of proper novels. Again, I feel this charge is patently false, for although she undoubtedly had a moral purpose in mind while penning Wildfell Hall, within the text itself there is very little moralizing. The characters are incredibly well drawn. They are three dimensional beings who evolve throughout the text, and in many instances Bronte uses parallel characters and situations to show that different people react differently to similar things. As for the plot --- while the set-up is a bit slow, once things get going it is an absolute page-turner.This is a book that any fan of the Bronte sisters should read. Indeed, even if you aren't a fan, give it a try --- several friends of mine, who generally do not read 19th century literature, and who do not formally study literature at all, picked up this, Jane Eyre, and Wuthering Heights, recently. Which was the unanimous favourite among them? The Tenant of Wildfell Hall."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is a much more interesting book than I expected it to be. I came to it as almost every reader will come to it: after having read almost everything of her more famous sisters'. I don't know what I was expecting - perhaps something paler or more insipid.Pale and insipid it is not. Anne Bronte's prose is fully as energetic as the others', and she has a world-view that equally as rich, nuanced and fully realized (how /could/ they have thought so much, and about so much?).The plot here, as any casual observer knows, revolves around the woman yoked to a loutish husband. Some have perceived this as more original or daring than her sisters' plots, and certainly in her own time, it received a special kind of disapprobation (even Charlotte appears to have thought it cut a bit close to the bone - apparently perceiving that the lout was patterned on their own dear brother). Maybe so, but in another sense, you could say that it is just the mirror image of the Jane Eyre plot. Mr. Rochester has a guilty or scandalous secret about his wife; Mrs. Huntington has the same about her husband - not the same secret, but equally eligible for secrecy. Each has an innocent lover; in each case the point is to disentangle from the guilty and join with the innocent.The device of the loutish husband is not necessarily all that promising. In the hands of an amateur it is no more than a setup for a tedious account of outraged virtue. Indeed if this were all, we would do well to leave it for the Jerry Springer show. The reason this book works is that it is not just a tale of outraged virtue: Mrs. Huntington makes it clear just how much she was attracted by Mr. Huntington: how she walked into this bog on her own, and against all the entreaties of her nearest and dearest. As if to cap it all, we are treated to the spectacle of an older, more chastened Mrs. Huntington trying to warn a younger companion off from making the same kind of mistake. We readers can make up our own mind as to what the young companion is likely to do.Unfortunately, after a bit of this, the modality of outraged virtue takes over. Huntington wallows in vice; Mrs. Huntington remains a saint. Even here, the author does not lose us: she is a remarkable dialectician, and I am not sure the case of the woman wronged has ever been put better. What is missing is an important human truth: vice (to use the Victorian term) is catching, and suffering does not purify. Indeed, that is one of the things so dreadful about suffering. You cannot put up with someone like Huntington indefinitely before some of it wears off on you. It beggars all expectation to suppose that Mrs. Huntington could have come through all this without meanness, without spite, without the slightest hint of schadenfreude. Indeed on this point (dare one say it), Jerry Springer just might be a better guide. But life is too short for that. Instead, thank heavens for the Brontes, and what a pleasure to learn that Anne is just as absorbing as the rest."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I actually prefer this novel of Anne Bronte to her sister's \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" However, having just read the Penguin Classics edition of \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" I have to say that the \\"explanatory\\" notes were much more than just explanatory. Now, I know that Stevie Davies is a professor herself, but I wish she would leave the interpretation for the reader rather than giving her own in the notes. I've noticed this trend to interpret and analyze rather than just \\"explain\\" in recent editions of Penguin and Oxford, but this example struck me particularly. I can see how some might find this helpful, but there were places in the text when I was actually wondering to what the reference might be but found no note explaining it. Rather Davies focuses on Bronte's feminism, which, though potentially helpful, forces a certain interpretation and analysis on the reader that should be left in the introduction and necessarily leaves out other aspects of the text that Davies may or may not find interesting.I don't disagree with her interpretation; it just took a lot of the fun out of reading the novel when I would turn to the back pages and find the thinking done for me."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"\\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" is wonderful. I had a real sympathy for the characters, all of which were well-drawn; I felt that they could all be real people. I even liked \\"The Tenant\\" better than \\"Jane Eyre\\", which I realize is probably more popular. I don't want to give anything away, but trust me on this and read \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\"."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne Bronte wrote a book, the main purpose was to instruct. Firstly, she wanted to warn young women AGAINST attempting to \\"change\\" a dissolute, charming rogue (read: A real-life Heathcliff or Rochester) through their love and moral example. Secondly, she wanted to present an alternative to the different and not equal education for girls and boys. The toughest, and most needed, change in the late Regency - to - early Victorian England was the raising of the legal and financial status of women. Through it all, Anne's hope of a better, brighter future for men and women shines.That said, this was the book which \\"tipped the hand\\" of the sisters' asexual psuedonyms. The women jump out of the pages in many dimensions; the men are largely two-dimensional foils (the exception being the wicked antihero, Arthur Huntingdon, Sr.). The author had to be a woman! Tsk, tsk tsk, the conventionally-moral reviewers said. Anne would be happy that many women who married a wastrel like Huntingdon found solace and understanding in her book.This was despite that fact that Charlotte killed an authentic second edition from *her* larger, more influential publisher. Instead, an American edition, cut and rearranged to fit in a pocket size book, was the standard edition. TToWH suffered from the fact that there was no international copyright law in effect until the 1890s.And then, in 1994 or -5, a hand-corrected \\"galley proof\\" (printer's rough draft) was located and authenticated. Finally, a version of the book very similar to what Anne intended, was printed -- and, in turn, birthed a good TV adaptation. Anne's book had sweet vindication."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Of all classic novels, this one is an all time favorite. Anne Bronte was a visionary of her time. This book was not originally published under Anne's name. Actually, readers did not know if the author was male or female. This is a book that can be read over and over again and different passages will connect with you. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"This is a very different novel from the other of Anne Bronte's that I've read, Agnes Grey. The story is told mostly from the first person viewpoint of Gilbert Markham as he and his fellow villagers meet the mysterious new tenant of Wildfell Hall, the widowed Mrs. Graham, who has a bit of a mystery about her and her young son.As feelings grow between the two main characters, the story is shifted to the viewpoint of Mrs. Graham as retold through a diary she wrote, and about her life married to an abusive, unfaithful alcoholic, and her efforts finally to extricate herself from the marriage.An interesting tale, and I give the author marks for tackling what in her time would have been a most controversial topic (women just did not leave their husbands, no matter what the reason). Some of the melodrama is more than a tad bit over the top, Helen was just too pure and good natured, and having a woman writer write in the first person viewpoint of a man was a bit of a stretch for me. Gilbert was at times too emotional in a womanly sort of way -- I mean throwing himself down on the wet ground and having a good cry over a broken heart was way over the top for me. He was also a bit too brutish and rough at times for my taste, and not always very likeable, but that is the author's choice as to how she wrote her characters.Other than those quibbles it was a very entertaining read and some very thought provoking topics to take with you when finished with the book."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"Anne is not the most well-known of the Brontes, but perhaps she's the most forthright of the three. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the story of an independant woman of infinite strength. A woman who, after making the seemingly fatal mistake of a bad marriage (a mistake that might doom other women of her age to depression and ) manages to set herself free. It is not a haunting story, nor a frightening one but it is one filled with alcolism, abuse and great misery in a marriage, all issues that were (and are in the novel) swept under the carpet, politely ignored. A woman was to be pitied, but not helped. Helen helps herself.The novel's single confusing and disruptive aspect is the fact that it is in two sections, the beginning and ending the letter Gilbert Markham writes to his friend, and the middle Helen's own diary. Both stories are part of the same narrative; Gilbert's beginning just before Helen's ends, and are inseperable, but this forces the reader to 'begin' again.The story itself, and the boldness with which Helen's life and Gilbert's careful uncertainty are addressed, is near perfect. A masterpiece, and by no means any less great than Anne's sisters' works."},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"I picked this book up thirteen years ago and finally read it last summer. To think I was depriving myself all that time of such a wonderful read! Helen is one of the best heroines I have ever read. I could not help but be moved by her strength of character and resourcefulness in the face of the growing disaster that became her marriage. I also found the sequence where she planned her &quot;great escape&quot; exciting and suspenseful, even though I knew it would be a success.It is slightly flawed in that the end ties up a bit too nicely, and the tension between the narrator and Helen withers a bit by the time the book ends. However, the same criticism could probably be made of the other more well-known Bronte books.Overall, definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall Set","review":"At the outset, I feel bound to point out that the Oxford Classics edition of this work is one of the few editions to actually be complete. By complete, I mean it includes the first chapter of Anne's original work (Dear Halford...etc.) and does not instead launch into the meaningless 'You must go back with me... . Readers should take care to buy copies of The Tenant that include the opening chapter as well as Anne's famous preface to the second edition. What I like about the Oxford Classics edition is that it includes both along with some excellent notes about Anne Bronte and the possible source for the characters.For me, the Tenant is an incredible novel. I have read it six times in the past six years and it still retains its awesome power. One cannot fail to be impressed by its acute and realistic characterization as well as its subtle understanding of the male psyche and the many psychological layers that all her protagonists feel both within themselves and for each other. I once wrote a whole article on Hargrave alone, but all the characters are so well realized that there are hardly any weak ones here. Far from being the prude that she is often characterized as, the heroine, Helen Huntingdon is warm and passionate. The fact she is also a forerunner of Ibsen's Nora in the Doll's House should likewise arouse our interest and sympathy for the character. .Anne is very like Jane Austen in her sensitive and acute characterization.Anne is too often a forgotten heroine of English literature and as next year (1999) is the 150th anniversary of her death, it is a good time to re-evaluate her position as both the 'Cinderella' of English literature and the forgotten Bronte Sister. Many such re-appraisals have taken place in recent years as critics come to see Anne as more than the pale shadow of her allegedly more talented sisters. In the final analysis, just reading her work rather than learning about it from others will prove the truth of what those who love Anne Bronte and her work will readily bear witness too.Many of the scenes in The Tenant are astonishingly vivid and realistic in their passion and intensity, and without spoiling the reader's prospective enjoyment, I will cast further comment aside at this point beyond a brief remark that Anne's handling of such aspects do show that she was more than a match for both Emily and Charlotte.I am sure that most readers will enjoy and want to read this work again and again. I suggest taking reading it by a nice fire on a rainy day but occasionally looking out the window at the brooding, intense, misty and maybe snow-capped mountains (if you are lucky enough to be near any). Notice and think about what you see and as you return to the book, realize that this wonderfully talented Bronte sister has done exactly the same."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts","review":"I've read many books about Burma and travel to the country frequently.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseyis simply one of the best. Unlike a lot of memoirs, it is both poetic and passionate at the same time. Pascal Khoo Thwe, who struggled with English when he fled the country, has produced an English-langauge masterpiece. From his retelling of his role as a student activist in the prodemocracy protests of 1988 to the helping hand of a Cambridge professor, the book is filled with the mix of sadness and serendipity usually found only in fairy tales. After his escape from Burma, Pascal Khoo Thwe beautifully explains his dilemma as he is caught between the world of his village and trauma in Burma versus life in England. Pascal Khoo Thwe never recites a history of his country's problems, but rather blends them in seamlessly with his own life, providing a much more textured picture of the struggles people did (and still) face under the military dictatorship.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseywould make an excellent movie and I hope one day somebody makes one. In the meantime, definitely read the book if you have any interest in Burma, or just good literature."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"I stumbled across Isaac Babel because of a single line quoted in Paul Johnson's &quot;History of the Jews&quot;. And then I was forever hooked.First, a caveat. Be sure you understand when reading Babel's short stories that you are not reading his autobiography or journal. He did in fact listen to our creative writing teachers; he wrote what he knew. He knew the Russian revolution. He knew the Cossacks. He knew war. He knew living inside and outside the pale. His world jumps off the page because he lived it first.The stories contain autobiographical material, actively mixed with the yeast of fiction. Use this aspect of his writing to chase rabbits. Follow up this book with his biography or find out more about the Russian revolution. Both of those topics will make more sense after reading his collected stories.As a writer, I stand in awe of Babel's stingy use of words. Some scenes are so hugely horrible that I would have been tempted to throw in appropriate adverbs and adjectives in an attempt to convince you, my reader, just how hugely horrible it really was. Babel simply tells the story, and you gasp when you are done, horrified when you peak through the keyhole (and I would have blasted a hole in the wall).When you read Babel, you must be willing to go at the stories with an open mind, not expecting him to flatten the Commies, defend the Jews, or paint the picture the way you want him to. He will not do that, no matter how many times you try to make it so. You will hear no overtones of right or wrong, get no definitive answers about the people on either side of the Russian revolution.For that, I am most grateful to Isaac Babel. Nothing about our world can be easily distilled into sharp black and white. His stories give us the real world in astounding color."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"The Red Cavalry story sequence is one of the great works of 20th century literature. It is reportedly based on Babel's experience as a Commissar in the Red Army during the post-revolutionary invasion of Poland. Babel's autobiographical narrator reflects profound ambivalence. An urban Jew and intellectual serving with peasant Cossack soldiers whose conduct would have been normative during the 30 Years War, Babel's narrator exemplifies and documents the profound contradictions of the Russian Civil War and revolutionary effort. The stories contain multiple scenes of great power, horror, and punishing irony. Other reviewers, see below, have commented on the unpleasant nature of these stories. These reactions are a tribute to Babel's capacity as a writer. Why should we expect anything pleasant from this subject? This work is intended to be profoundly disturbing. Babel aimed to show clearly some of the horror of his time and did so in a way that no factual chronicler can equal."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Reading Babel is no picnic in the park. His words are often hard to understand, let alone relish. In Red Cavalry, as he evokes heartrending scenes of torture, deprivation, and corruption, it is often hard to read without almost begging the author for a point of view, a call to arms. Yet in his sharp, vivid--yet terse, accounts (somewhat naturalistic as characters succumb to the hideous corollaries of civil stife--hunger, unbridled violence, senseless cruelty, inhumanity) his compact, frugal stories are never sentetious or tendetious.The Odessa Tales, the second part of his ouevre, is nearer and dearer to my heart. Immediately, I fell in love with a rabbi's narration of mythical gangster hero Benya Krik. Benya, a Jewish thug with a code of values, who no doubt has the power to empower the young minds of Jewish boys, commands respect as a charismatic desperado, so alien to the preconceptions of Jews as victims and middle-class pushovers, always dependent on the mercy of the ruling elite. Benya wends his way around authorities--whether monarchist or Bolshevik, not only marching to the beat of a different drum, but subjugating others to the beat. Scenes of Odessa, my hometown, are sumptuous though sparing in descriptions of wealthy and lowly merchants, sailors, criminals, and lackeys.Having read these and other stories in Russian, I look forward to reading the translation in hopes of better understanding them in my adopted tongue. Babel is not the most facile read, but an important and long ignored voice in the Soviet literary canon. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"A superbly written insider's look at the Russian revolution. Babel can convey the horrors of war with very few words. I enjoyed the best his sarcastic treatement of the bombastic communist rhetoric in such stories as &quot;Salt&quot; and &quot;Treason&quot; (maybe because I was exposed to it myself at one time)."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"The frightfully ugly picture on the cover of this edition (what in the world were the publishers thinking?) might keep a lot of people away, but the few brave souls that look inside will find one of the great 20th century craftsmen of prose. I can't think of another writer than chooses his words more carefully, that can pack more into a single sentence. &quot;Pierced by the flashes of the bombardment, night arches over the dying man.&quot; Single words can take your breath away - the choice of &quot;arches&quot; is the one that does it for me - but you'll probably have others. The brutality of the world he describes may seem foreign, but it never becomes oppressive, mainly because the writing is so good. The stories themselves are rather difficult to love - there is very little hope to latch on to, there are very few characters one can feel close to; there are very few real characters at all, except the narrator. Even under these horrific circumstances, though, Babel creates emotions than one can identify with - pride, love, lust, anger. He has a thorough understanding of human character. It is apparent that the circumstances of war don't create new emotions, they just amplify things we feel anyway.This book is a necessary read for anyone that wants to learn how to write poetically without being florid, compress pages of description into a few words. This compression is one of the reasons that the stories stay in mind long after they've been read. Buy the book - or get the other edition in a used book store, so you don't have to look at that awful picture."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"How late I learned the essential things in life! In my childhood, nailed to the Gemara, I led the life of a sage, and it was only later, when I was older, that I began to climb trees\\"So we have the image of Babel the pale scholarly youth with 'spectacles on his nose and autumn in his heart\\" He after Chekhov is the great Russian short story writer.Babel's greatness as a short-story is related to his realistic precision, and observational power. He sees often it seems into the heart of his characters with an objective and penetrating eye. He portrays soul- wrenching scenes of great violence, deprivation with a kind of detached objectivity. His stories like those of Chekhov perhaps like those of Russian writers especially often involve incidents of great cruelty.It is interesting that the opening story tells of an eighty-six year old old-time Jew who living with his son and daughter- in law.The son is about to adopt the new faith of the Revolution.The old man realizing that he will have no place in the new order hangs himself- an act which Babel portrays as an act of courage and faith in God. And this while it seems to me showing a certain regrettable contempt for the Torah world to which the old man is bound.Babel's early stories , the childhood tales of which the most famous is 'On a Dovecote'already have his characteristic realistic precision. The stories which make him most known , \\"The Red Cavalry \\" stories in which he tells of the Cossacks he rode with are another important part of the oeuvre.Here there is felt especially the great division in Babel between the world of power and physical force, and a kind sensitive inner life.Then there are the Odessa stories of Benya Krik, the world of Jewish gangsters, and of a colorful and yet cruel life once again precisely observed.The tale of Babel's later years when under the shadow and threat of Stalin he spoke of himself writing 'in the genre of silence', and of his being murdered is the tale of a great writer cut down too soon.We don't have all the stories we might have from this great master. But what we do have are the axe which breaks through the icy soul within."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Some of the most brilliant and influential stories of the twentieth century. &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; is the most successful example of the linked-short-story form, a war illuminated in lightning flashes of gruesome brilliance. &quot;Guy de Maupassant&quot; also contains some of the best advice on writing ever put to paper. I read Babel every couple of years to keep me honest. Essential stories for any serious reader, and certainly for anyone who aspires to write."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"There is little more I can say about this astonishing piece of work that has not already been said, but I will add my piece in the hope that it will encourage more people to read what is a genuinely important piece of writing.Buy this book to appreciate Babel's portrayal of real and raw emotion, his comprehensive understanding of human character, his sparse, tight writing style that is both painfully lucid and beautifully poetic.The one new thing I think has to be said is a defence of the picture on the front. What has to be understood is why this picture is there and why it looks the way it does; The cheek and mouth are sticking out that way for a very good reason! My only advice is to say if you do not know the full story don't comment on it. In any case, this is a wonderful, life-changing book that needs to be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"I am sorry, but I don't think Babel ever questions the revolution or war in general. Traumatized to a nervous shock by a pogrom in Nikolaev (\\"The Story of my Dovecot\\"), he carried this trauma to the end of his life. I know him well, I myself was there (and to some degree still am): this fear of the brutes and envy of them, envy of their devil-may-care freedom to kill and to spare life, of the epic quality of their horrible deeds and attitudes (straight out of the Illiad, the Nibelungenlied, the epics of Shevchenko and just about any other epic). This fear of a miserable little cultured Jew of the primal forces all around him, in all their brutality and ugliness. And the envy. When given a half-chance (and a false half-chance) to become one of them, he throws away his culture, his principles and his morals and grabs it with both hands. He knows that our most basic civilization, our civility, our peacefulness, our culture, mercy, compassion don't stand a chance when confronted by an idiot with a gun. He knows that violence is what really rules.But he has trouble remaking himself. Though he wants to brutalize, at first he cannot. His upbringing is too deep within him. Others feel it too, and stay away from him. He is very dedicated to ideas of revolution, he is as friendly and supportive of the \\"revolutionaries\\" (i.e. bandits) around him, but they now he is not one of them. He begins to realize that not being \\"one of them\\" has become enough to get a bullet. Finally he takes a peasant woman's goose, kills it for no reason, then tells the peasant woman to kook it (\\"My First Goose\\"). This wins him a bit of respect from the others. But not much. To win real respect, a person must be killed or raped for no reason. Even then, Babel for a short while celebrates this victory over his humane side. Only his heart hurts, bun no one cares about that, not even he.Who knows what else there was? Did Babel manage to kill someone for no reason? If he did, he does not write about that. Perhaps through some encounters with better people (\\"Gedali\\"), Babel begins to realize that his new friends are not exactly the best of humanity. But it is too late. He is now too mired to have a clean look at the work of his hands. So he tells Gedali that the International (the Communist anthem) is eaten with gunpowder and spiced with blood, and invents himself a new lie: \\"These people are trash, but The Party [the Communist Party] will set them straight\\".And so on goes the story of this brilliant and pathetic man, who allowed a pogrom to define his life and who wasted it in service of the revolution that killed him. Brilliantly written, both extremely poetic and extremely documentary, the book is an ultimate testament both to the obscenity and the savagery of the epic and to the epicity of the obscene and the savage. It is a great irony that Babel was murdered by the same revolution he fought for, that his International became spiced with his own blood. But the greatest irony is that now his sincere pro-revolutionary book has become the greatest testament against revolutions and wars. This is a legacy, but not the one he was trying to achieve.What does all this have to do with our contented life in America? A great deal. Imperial Russia too was considered a civilized country, until revolution and civil war changed its face. When 500,000 Jews were killed just in Ukraine by just one army (Petlyura's), the world remade its image into that of an eternal savage. We here are also capable to become the same brutes as Babel's co-fighters. Here too there are places where one wins respect by killing and not by mercy. Here too people waste their lives in service to false gods. Here too some get into false freedom of devil-may-care attitude and into epic savagery and obscenity. And underneath it all, violence rules us all."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Through his depictions of the Polish-Soviet war, Isaac Babel questions the &quot;rightness&quot; of the Bolshevik Revolution and war in general. His attitude to the atrocities committed is uncompromising and i feel that this is ,as a comment on War and its effects, unparalleled. It takes no prisoners and leaves the reader asking for more."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Isaac Babel (1894-1940) was one of the foremost Russian writers of the twentieth century. And since he wrote in the realistic style of so many of the best Russian writers, it's not surprising that he met an early death at the hands of a Soviet government intolerant of art that reflected its brutality in such stark terms. Babel wrote of his life, and a large part of his life was lived during a historic time, a time of wars and revolutions that, like most revolutions do, ate their own children. This is lucky for us because we have an important historical document in the form of his fiction.Babel's most famous stories are the Odessa Stories, which describe the lives of Jewish gangsters in Babel's childhood home, and the Red Calvary Stories, in which he recounts the atrocities he saw while assigned to the Red Calvary in the Poland-Soviet War of 1920. Perhaps because Babel's stories tend to relate fictionalized accounts of what he actually saw, they are written in description-rich prose. In fact, Babel's writing is a veritable writer's workshop of description. It is filled with colorful visions and sounds and smells that leap from the page. To give just a taste: \\"Fields flowered around us, crimson with poppies; a noon-tide breeze played in the yellowy rye; on the horizon virginal buckwheat rose like the wall of a distant monastery...The orange sun rolled down the sky like a lopped-off head, and mild light glowed from the cloud gorges. The standards of the sunset flew above our heads. Into the cool of evening dripped the smell of yesterday's blood, of slaughtered horses.\\"This last sentence hints at another characteristic of Babel's writing. Like the times he was writing in, it can be brutal. And thus, for us here in the twenty-first century, not for everyone. These stories are for those of us interested in luxuriating over beautiful descriptions and rich, though stark at the same time, prose. And it's also for those of us interested in Russia's history, and more specifically the after-effects of the Revolution. I couldn't recommend it to anyone else. It's not enjoyable reading. Its subject matter is tough. There aren't standard plots. A lot of characters are unsympathetic bad-guys. Unfortunately, this probably explains Babel's relative obscurity in America.But this is a courageous book. He wrote a lot of these stories, especially the Red Calvary Cycle, knowing he would anger important people in the government. In fact, a few tried to stop its publication. It was through the help of Maxim Gorky that these stories were published at all. But it was only a matter of time before Babel's luck would run out. As the pressure built over the years, Babel could have fled Russia; he was in Western Europe in the mid-30's and chose to go back to his home. He was a complex man. He knew he was in danger, but he went home anyway. And finally, in 1939, he was arrested.If you can stomach it, if you are a tough reader who will wade through great writing no matter how difficult, please pick up this important book."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"I stumbled across Isaac Babel because of a single line quoted in Paul Johnson's &quot;History of the Jews&quot;.

He takes an uncompromising political attitude, sympathizing with and at the same time describing the horrors of Bolshevism. This same &quot;duality&quot; is reflected in his love and admiration for his Jewish upbringing and at the same time shows a critical approach to a retrograde, out-of-date Jewish society. It would not be far from the truth to say that Babel's creative power emanates from this same ambivalence. To read this collection of his short stories is certainly not a very pleasant experience (especially the &quot;Red Cavalry&quot;); there is enough pessimism, horror, and a constant manifestation of human nature's negative side. It is worth questioning: is there another side to Babel's personality and literary production? Not much is known about the author, and when he was arrested some of his writings were confiscated and to this date never made public. On this missing link might rest a better understanding of his work and personality."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"The Master of the Short Story.

And this is the perfect, if not penultimate collection to begin with.I admit, I was troubled by Babel's approach. I never felt prepared when I began the next story in this collection. His writing is very spare, details are few, nearly hidden and the glimpses we get are so deep and wondrous the reader has to be careful not to speed ahead. Many times it would seem the reader is given no bearings when entering a story, especially in Red Cavalry. It's like being thrown into a dark, unknown room with dim lighting. But this, I realized is his charm. We are already in his world the moment we read one of his stories and from the first line, the reader has to either chose: do you give up and close the book or do you explore the incredible dark room Babel has created.I prefer the latter. Over time the reader gradually adjusts and accustoms his/herself to where Babel is leading them. The stories are often cruel, sometimes brutal but moreover, I would describe them as blunt and honest. He doesn't try to romanticize his world or lend nobility to ignoble characters, whether foe or supposed hero. In fact, the laws that exist in Babel's world of gangster Odessa and Red Cavalry Poland are far too chaotic and change on a whim.What endeared me most to Babel and eventually changed my opinion on him (too often I found him enigmatic and difficult to penetrate at first)were his similes. \\"Blue roads flowed past me like rivulets of milk trickling from many breasts\\" Italian Sun; \\"The earth lay like a cat's back, covered with a thick, gleaming coat of grain\\" The Road To Brody; \\"...both of us looked upon the world as a meadow in May over which women and horses wander.\\" The Story of a Horse. One of my favourites describes the death of a horse but I would rather curious, eager readers further explore these similes than have me spoil more of Babel's beauty.Though many readers will find Babel's world dark, I would simply state this is a world that simply is. Babel's world is farther away than we imagine, especially in a culture of neon signs and sterilized corporate restaurant chains and stores. But underneath, there is that wildness and Babel depicts his unkempt men and women by showing them rags and all. His is a world where the last traces of men on horseback could instill fear in others."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Isaac Babel does not fit neatly into any box. Some may say his writing reminds them of this or that author, but without reading him in his native Russian, I don't know. What I can say is that his stories do not conform to any assumptions I have about pre- and post-revolutionary Russia, or the experience of its Jewish population at the same time.There are four sections here: Early Stories, The Odessa Stories, The Red Calvary Cycle, and Later Stories. Of these, the Early Stories are the weakest - but maybe only in comparison. Once Babel gets started on Odessa, the tempo quickens and the section hangs together like a novella written out of short stories. The challenging part is that his characters might as well have been from the moon for all the sense of kinship I had with them. At times these stories - filled with gangsters and charlatans and schemers and fighters - read almost like folklore. Earthy, passionate and brutal legends of a mixed community, which, perhaps due to its location and population, operated differently from my conception of mainstream Russian life of the time. When Babel hints at the destruction of this way of life in the wake of the revolution, I felt a genuine sense of something unique passing away.But it is in the Red Calvary Cycle where Babel shines. Here his plain style fits the subject matter to a T - both unapologetic and un-glorified, he presents warfare in all its barbaric possibilities. Embedded within the (mostly) Cossack cavalry, Babel and his companions are pitted against Polish troops as the Soviets seek to spread the revolution. Despite their fierce anti-Semitism, the Cossack troops eventually accept Babel, though it was never clear to me (but I assumed it) that they knew of his heritage. Many of the stories took place in and around Jewish villages, and Babel doesn't claim any relationship with the peasantry as the Cavalry boards in their homes. Perhaps he felt that the revolution had stripped away all of the old labels and conventions, and that he was a cavalryman first and Jewish second. I don't know - he certainly doesn't reserve any pity for the peasants, but then again, he doesn't reserve pity for anyone in this cycle of stories. No one comes out unblemished. This is warfare much like the world would see 20 years later during World War II. Those who wonder why our own country attempts to abide by the Geneva Convention and by Rules of Engagement might do well to read Babel's dispatches from the front. It may not change anyone's mind, but at least they might understand the full implications of the alternative they are advocating.Even though the Polish campaign ended in failure, this cycle of stories cemented Babel's fame, and when I compare the popularity of his gritty realism with the patriotic, almost naive \\"Sergeant York\\" style of war stories in America at the time, I am bewildered by the difference in attitude between cultures. The last section of stories turn autobiographical, and when describing the pogrom he experienced as a child and events soon after the revolution, Babel catalogs all of the inhuman cruelty he witnessed. Taken with the Red Cavalry Cycle, Babel can be at times plainly vicious - readers who prefer their stories sanitized would do well to look elsewhere.Nathalie Babel, his daughter, provides footnotes, and Cynthia Ozick writes a glowing introduction, but there are many references in Babel's stories that undoubtedly went over my head. Those unfamiliar with Russian history and customs may have difficulty understanding Babel's finer points, but that in no way dulls the effectiveness of his stories. What's clear to me is that no matter what label someone places on him - whether folklorist, or partisan, or Jewish writer - and whether his deceptive simple style is comparable to Kafka or not - as Ms. Ozick maintains in her introduction - as a chronicler of a time and place that is gone forever, he is certainly of the first rank."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Babel's greatness as a short-story is related to his realistic precision, and observational power. He sees often it seems into the heart of his characters with an objective and penetrating eye. He portrays in a soul- wrenching way scenes of great violence and human deprivation. His stories like those of Chekhov perhaps like those of Russian writers especially often involve incidents of great cruelty.Babel's early stories , the childhood tales of which the most famous is 'On a Dovecote'already have his characteristic realistic precision. The stories which make him most known , \\"The Red Cavalry \\" stories in which he tells of the Cossacks he rode with are another important part of the oeuvre.Then there are the Odessa stories of Benya Krik, the world of Jewish gangsters, and of a colorful and yet cruel life once again precisely observed.The tale of Babel's later years when under the shadow and threat of Stalin he spoke of himself writing 'in the genre of silence', and of his being murdered is the tale of a great writer cut down too soon."},{"Title":"Collected stories","review":"Reviewers on Amazon tend to self-select; I've noticed that people (including myself) seem more willing to write reviews of books they loved than of books they disliked. This makes sense; I usually don't even finish reading a book I strongly dislike.But I had to read this book for a class. It was possibly my least favorite work of literature that I have ever read. Babel's writing is sparse, dry, and frequently cryptic; often I struggled to figure out what was actually going on in the stories. I also found his characters opaque and mysterious, and not in a good way. And all his stories are gloomy, and apt to induce misery in an unsuspecting reader. Babel's writing is rich with layers of meaning, but its about as enjoyable to crack as a caluculus textbook. The difficulty I encountered in reading this book just made Russia seem insurmountably foreign to me. Instead of serving as a bridge to another culture, this book aroused a feeling of alienation in me.I will not be so presumptuous as to say that Babel is a bad writer. But I must attest that Babel is not for everyone. On my scale--1 star."},{"Title":"American Musicians II: Seventy-one Portraits in Jazz","review":"If Whitnet Balliett were a musician, he'd probably be someone like Teddy Wilson, whose sometimes spare but dancing lines were always distinct, no matter the context. Balliett's musings on the more important jazz musicians, published originally in The New Yorker, are models of criticism that never betray his love and admiration for the music. It is unlikely that anyone will ever write as well as he has about America's most important contribution to the arts."},{"Title":"Adventures In Odyssey Cassettes #5: Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes","review":"This set of six tapes (12 episodes) contains the original Dr. Blackgaard story line. Not all are related to that story arch, however.It starts with the first IMAGINATION STATION adventure, in which Digger Digger Digwillow goes back in time to experience the death and resurrection of Christ. I'm now 26, have heard the program multiple times, and this simple two parter still moves me to tears.Other non-Blackgaard episodes include the classic Barclay family vacation in Odyssey (OUR BEST VACATION EVER) and the introduction of Wonderworld in the hilarious HEATWAVE.The other episodes all revolve around the initial Blackgaard arch. They include A BITE OF APPLESAUCE, EUGENE'S DILEMMA, CONNIE GOES TO CAMP, THE NEMESIS, and THE BATTLE. These last three are two parters. As a whole, these make a great story, but are even more interesting when listened to in relation to later Blackgaard episodes. The summer they first aired, they kept my brother and I glued to the radio wondering what would happen next.I highly recommend this great collection. It's radio drama at its best: good story telling and great characters."},{"Title":"Adventures In Odyssey Cassettes #5: Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes","review":"&quot;Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes&quot; contains a mini-series in itself, which build a foundation for the ultimeate album, &quot;Darkness Before Dawn&quot; (#25) There are also several other stories that lead up to the awesome episode, &quot;Waylaid in the Windy City&quot; This album is definitly worth buying!"},{"Title":"Adventures In Odyssey Cassettes #5: Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes","review":"Where do they get the names for these albums?

But if you want to know Chinese literature, you should read it."},{"Title":"The Best Pressure Cooker Recipes","review":"When I bought a pressure cooker, I wasn't sure which book to buy out of the myriad books in the store. The reason I bought this was because it was the cheapest! It just goes to show you that something cheap can be a rare and wonderful find. The recipes are just delicious and very easy to make, even for a novice cook. I've had great fun experimenting on my husband and son and nothing beats a hearty stew in the middle of a Calgary winter. What used to take me all day in a slow cooker, now takes just 30 minutes, even with the cheapest, toughest cuts of meat. Buying this book has certainly made my meat purchasing easier, because I'm saving money buying cheaper cuts but not sacrificing quality in the end result.The desserts in here are delicious and melt in your mouth. Don't listen to people who baulk at making cheesecake in a pressure cooker. Cinda's Layered White and Dark Chocolate Cheesecake is heaven on a fork. It took me 10 minutes to prepare and and exactly 20 minutes to cook, just like the recipe says. I had compliments galore from my husband and he doesn't usually like sweet desserts! I will never go back to eating store bought cheesecake again.Some of the recipes I would never make - like the fish recipes. Fish doesn't take that long to cook and you're not saving yourself much time that way, but the ribs and campfire beans recipes are fantastic and if you like risotto, this book is for you. Vegetarians don't miss out either. Beans and lentils are provided for and the results are outstanding. Cinda gives you lots of information about the history of the pressure cooker and safety and cleaning tips. She also gives a breakdown of cooking times for various foods in the front of the book. I use this index a lot when I'm making things like beans and lentils.I usually follow the recipes fairly closely, but I cut corners where I can. Instead of using chicken breasts which can be expensive, sometimes I just substitute a whole chicken and the end result in the same. And the great thing about a pressure cooker is, I don't even defrost my whole chicken. I just prepare the recipe as stated and cook the chicken for 30 minutes. And you would never know it had previously been frozen solid. It's soft and moist and just delicious. Try the Coq Au Vin. C'est magnifique!I just love this book, so much so that my copy is well worn and slightly ragged and I've only had it less than a year. This book is clearly written and well laid out and has a wealth of information. But I took one star off, because there are only a few high gloss colour photographs of the finished recipes. More photos would have been nice but that's the only bad thing I can say about it. It's the best [money] I ever spent!"},{"Title":"The Best Pressure Cooker Recipes","review":"I wrote this review when I had just finished eating my second recipe from this book.

Carpe...... Diem... Seize The Day....Say these words and 99% of people will know what movie you are talking about. A classic film called \\"Dead Poets Society\\" with Robin Williams from 1989. It is hard to believe this movie is over 20 years old now. Growing up watching this film I remember the lines, \\"Seize the day,\\" and, \\"O Captain my captain,\\" as the two that really stick out. I saw it from the students' perspective of finding your own voice and learning to think for yourself. But this time I saw something else, I probably saw it before, but it didn't resonate with me; the reason Neil killed himself. That reason being he could not stand up to his father and explain what he wanted to do with his life.Part of the reason why it struck me so hard was because I had just been reading \\"King Me What every son wants and needs from his father\\" by Steve Farrar. In the movie, Neil wants to become an actor and his Dad has decided for him that he will be a Doctor. Professor Keating (Williams) comes to the school as the new English teacher and inspires the students, including Neil, to try new things. And in the end Neil kills himself, Keating is run out of the school, and the father blames Keating for killing his son.Here is the point I believe is most poignant - a father trying to live out his life through his son. We are not called by God to map out our son's lives or to correct every wrong that they do. We are called by God to train our son's to know God, to teach them how to be Godly men and manly men.It is too easy at times to leave the training wheels on the bike - so they never fall or scrape their knees. But sooner or later they have to learn and do it on their own - 2 wheels and some balance. The same goes with life. At a certain point we have to let go and let them fly solo... give them advice... help them out in trouble at times. But we cannot be like Neil's Dad and tell them exactly what they are going to do every step of the way.Steve Farrar's book \\"King Me\\" is a great guide on how to traverse the difficult road of raising Godly sons (and daughters). He gives 7 ways in which we can mentor the younger men in our lives (those of who don't have any of our own... this is a great book if you serve in the youth department or even the younger ages).1. Mentoring Through Mistakes2. Mentoring Through Discipline3. Mentoring Through Masculinity4. Mentoring Through Guidance5. Mentoring Through Sexual Purity6. Mentoring Through Manly Communication7. Mentoring Through FriendshipEach builds on the next, and over all, Steve Farrar gives some great advice on how to mentor sons. The reason he wrote the book is because, even as a well known Christian Men's writer and speaker, he found out even he wasn't perfect in raising his kids.I would highly recommend that every father watch this movie with their son once a year, and talk about how their life is going and see how they are doing mentoring their son. I would also suggest reading this book or another book like it once a year, as we seek after God to try to raise Godly children. Now, none of us are going to be perfect fathers or raise perfect sons or daughters, but the key is to help your son or daughter be ready when their time comes to...From Third Option Men"},{"Title":"King Me: What Every Son Wants and Needs from His Father","review":"Very strong and right on for the boys and fathers.

The author gives you a good Biblical perspective of how fathers should deal with different issues that will crop up in the lives of both you and your son(s). I've read Pointman and Finishing Strong by Steve Farrar also, and I have always respected him as a great Christian author. It was great to see him be somewhat vulnerable in this book and be honest about struggles that he has faced in his own family. The author pulls no punches and this book will make you take a hard look at how you are living your life and how you may need to change your lifestyle and you parenting style to better raise your own son in the way he should go. My mom bought this book for me because they give it to new fathers at her church.

They need their fathers to encourage them, the dream with them, to listen, and so on.

Butler details the philosophic history in Germany that produced various offshoots including Romanticism, Marxism, Existentialism, and pan-Germanism. All of them may be found in Mein Kampf, though Hitler was probably unaware of their origins. He also notes the gradual incorporation of anti-semitism into the mainstream of German philosophy.An important theme taken up here is the fact that early 19th century German attempts to obtain Republican government became enmeshed and conflated with a desire to create a unified Germany. They looked to Prussia to lead the way in the former, with the result of exalting Prussian militarism and (!) monarchy. This influenced both the pan-German movement and Hitler's Fuhrerprinzip (leader principal), the idea that strong leadership and hierarchy is required to unify a group or nation. It has been a while since I read it, so I don't have the exact details straight anymore, but I do recall that this was a surprising and highly explanatory theme."},{"Title":"Beyond the melting pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City (Joint Center for Urban Studies.

My great teacher of American Studies at Cornell University, Cushing Strout used to however point out that America was more like a ' salad bowl'than a melting pot. You put different elements in and some new dish emerged while the old elements nonetheless preserved their original identity. Moynihan and Glazer portray with sympathy and insight the worlds of New York Negroes( today 'blacks')Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish. They make understand that the way to a richer and more harmonious America is not through the destruction of communal pasts and identities but rather through the transformation of them to help create a better America."},{"Title":"Beyond the melting pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City (Joint Center for Urban Studies.

Of the five ethnic groups profiled - blacks, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Irish, and Italians - the last two are not so ethnic anymore, nor numerous. Also, Arabs, Asians, and South Americans are missing. (though I suppose much of what is written about Jews would sound familiar to someone with knowledge of East (and South) Asian-Americans)However, as a history of the five ethnic groups it sets out to profile, Beyond the Melting Pot is excellent. It outlines the differing values each group had, plus the niches each group filled. Beyond the Melting pot also avoids misrepresentation by not reducing everything to economics, and admitting that certain groups/cultures really can value (and excel at)different things, something probably offensive to pc'ers."},{"Title":"Beyond the melting pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City (Joint Center for Urban Studies.

Perhaps these two groups do not compare, with respect to recent entry, with other ethnic groups, but they are highly significant. Take for example New York City's borough of Staten Island, which claims 44.5% of it's population as having Italian ancestry.

Come home to the House of the Seven Gables."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"The House of Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne is considered one of his greatest novels, (According to Henry James) is based on a true story within Hawthorne's own family line. While the book may sound appealing, it is actually quite boorish with a poor climax, and a tiresome storyline.The story starts out with a 30 page introduction about a Colonel who wants to expand his house, but his neighbor's property seems to be in the way. So he frames a plot against the man and calls him a witch, he gets hanged and the Colonel gets the poor framed man's land. However on the scaffold he places a curse on the Colonel and his future generations. The Colonel then gets the son of the man who cursed him to build his house. On the day that the house is finished the Colonel dies. Thus, we are taken to an old maid who has never worked in her life is now forced to set up a shop within the house. The drudgery continues from there.Some interesting points within the book are how Hawthorne has a much different writing style in this book. He often makes comments to the reader criticizing his characters; most of these comments are quite comical. I did enjoy how he developed his characters even though it seemed he lost interest in some toward the end of the book.Overall, the book had some up points and some down points, but overall it had many more down points than anything else. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're a huge fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and even then, I enjoyed The Scarlet Letter much better."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This book had a pretty good plot. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it seemed so incredibly negative and depressing. I tend to not like depressing books. Although, my view might be slightly warped since I was about 12 when I first read it. Hawthorne certainly had some interesting ideas.I can understand, though, the view that he came from. I mean, if my great-great grandfather condemed innocent women to death in the tragic Salem Witch Trials, I would be slightly negative, too. No wonder he changed his name.This book was very readable. I liked the description. I enjoyed the book a great deal."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I found this to be much slower and generally more boring than the Scarlet Letter and many of the stories in Twice Told Tales.

In other words, anything short of the nightly sit-com swill, video games, and MTV that passes as &quot;culture&quot; in an increasingly uncivilized society is deemed boring and out of touch. What a sad commentary on our educational system, parents and teachers who fail to inspire children to learn, and the overall abilities of this school-age generation to comprehend. How tragic. How pathetic. How very typical."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I'm not sure what makes this book a classic, other than the fact that it is old. It is a long difficult slog through florid prose, to find a story that has little, if any, plot. Nothing really happens throughout the entire book.This book could have been written in one sentence: \\"Once upon a time, there were some people that I didn't really like, that lived around here, in a house that may or may not have been haunted, and after nothing much happened to them, they moved away.The rest of the book is nothing but long-winded, overblown descriptions that make you feel like YOU are mouldering and decaying, rather than the house.

It is the legend of the House of the Seven Gables that makes the novel interesting - the curse the House bears and those troubled characters living within neglected walls and shrouding darkness make for an intruiging read. I have to admit, though, that this book is a very heavy read for me. It seems unnecessarily poetic and lacking in action. At times my mind wanders from the words my eyes are habitually tracing across the pages, but there are other times when I am absolutely absorbed.

Hawthorne could describe a character picking his/her nose and transform it into something beautiful and illuminating of the whole human condition. I especially like this: \\"Life is made up of marble and mud. And, without all the deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us, we might hence be led to suspect the insult of a sneer, as well as an immitigable frown, on the iron countenance of fate. What is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning, in this sphere of strangely mingled elements, the beauty and the majesty which are compelled to assume a garb so sordid.\\" It might be good for today's students to cut away from their tweeting and texting to contemplate, and attempt to translate, that sentence into a modern statement."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"They just don't come like this any more. The House of the Seven Gables is a book that will take time to read, but is well worth it for the historical events, language, and thought. Relationships between characters are interesting and the history of the house itself brings you far deeper into the story than you could imagine. There is no one plot here, but several moving around and shifting all at once; each character having their own story told to its conclusion. If ever you wanted to pick up a book for the single purpose of diving in to complex language and thought, into deep feelings and actions related to such, this is one of those books. There are scenes and images that will remain with you as beautiful, heart warming, or sad, all the way throughout. Inspiration for writers and thinkers can come from these pages, don't be modern and rush through each page.

I know I was forced to read it like pretty much everyone else, but it was still really good. This book actually turned me on to Hawthorne's short stories, which are even better."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This is a book that is much-criticized for its laborious descriptions, plodding narrative, and the odd, self-aware style in which it is written (in which the \\"fourth wall\\" is sometimes removed, and the reader is directly-addressed by the omniscient narrator). It is also reviled for staring a cast of characters who are all unlikable. I sympathize with these critiques; the book can be a bit of a slog, and I found one of the characters - Clifford - really irritating. When I listened to the audiobook for the first time, my mind wandered for much of the first half.But then, \`long-about chapter 13, there came a turning point. The narrative got a bit more interesting, and - more importantly - I began to pay closer attention to the clever writing. Much of the book is actually laced with humor - of the sort that pokes fun at the ridiculousness of the human condition. For instance, my favorite chapter consists of a narration of a single day's plans that one of the characters has made for himself. As the narrator explains, this man fails to carry out any of his plans, because he is - rather inconveniently - dead. The chapter is in many ways unnecessary; from its very beginning we know that the man in question is dead, and we know that he will not pursue any of the tasks he had set for himself. But through it, Hawthorne in a humorous way, exposes a few tidbits of plot, while at the same time reveling in the absurdity of making plans for ourselves in our capricious world. Then too, there is just the tiniest bit of suspense in the chapter (or at least there was for me). There is, after all, an element of the supernatural that pervades the book, and one can't help but wonder, as the chapter lingers over the corpse, whether the dead man will suddenly rise up, and go about his business after all.I ended up liking the book, and after I had finished, I went back and re-read the first few chapters...with more patience. Much of it made me smile - sometimes wryly. I found myself impressed with Hawthorne's ability to impart depth to what might otherwise be considered rather mundane scenes. For instance, in Chapters 2 and 3, Hawthorne introduces us to a 60-year-old woman, Hephzibah, who has lived her entire life as a lady - never having had to work for a living. We meet her just as poverty is forcing her to step down from this lofty position to open a cent shop in the House of Seven Gables. This is, (as Hawthorne takes great pains to state), a trivial event in the scheme of life. Epic poems are not written about such mundane matters! Nonetheless, in these two chapters, Hawthorne puts us inside Hephzibah's skin, and imagines what a tumultuous confluence of emotions she must be feeling. Though I am not usually one to scrutinize writing, in this case, I sat down and made a list:* Doubt (when Hephzibah wakes up, and wonders if she should really open her shop)* Nervous energy / anticipatory fear (before the first ring of the shop bell)* Shame (recurring throughout the scene)* Overwhelmed (as her giddy laugh turns into sobs)* Sorrow (at the passing of her status as a lady)* Pride (when she refuses the first two payments)* Resignation &, (at the same time), the thrill of newness (when she makes her first cent).* Despair, when she overhears two laborers discussing her prospects* Hurt when she feels these same laborers have dismissed her* Envy & bitterness when a lady passes by her store-front.* Pride (again) when a neighbor comes to gawk at her* Angry defiance when her cousin, Judge Pyncheon sees herIt is fascinating to me that each and every one of these myriad emotions are conveyed to us within a single chapter - primarily through the vehicle of observing Hephzibah's interactions with her customers. For a writer to attempt to convey such a complex set of feelings is an ambitious endeavor, and demonstrates to me that Hawthorne was an extraordinary observer of human behavior. Say what you like about the laggardly pace of the plot; there is much more to this book than one sees at first blush."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I became interested in this novel when my wife learned that she is a direct relative of the man who owned the house which inspired Hawthorne to write this book.I was not disappointed with the novel and I quite enjoyed the dark and mysterious tone to it. Perhaps the modern reader won't have the patience to wade through Hawthorne's meandering prose. I admit that this book takes patience but look beyond and you'll recogize the beautiful elements that make it a classic in American literature. In a historical context, his writing is crisp and evocative as he hangs on to the romantic elements in literature. I realized while reading the book that the enjoyment is not to race to the end and see what happens but rather to enjoy the flowery prose and sensorial descriptions. The story is quite simple but involves multiple generations of a family doomed by a suspicious curse flung at them by the disguntled landowner of the plot on which the famous house with the seven gables was built. The \\"Deus ex machina\\" ending seems hokey to modern readers but in 19th century literature was virtually expected and highly appreciated. If you're willing to take the time to appreciate this novel, then I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"What a great read. Enjoyed the flowery language. It was like a vocabulary lesson mixed into a neat story. Definitely recommend"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne is set in the early times of this country and Hawthorne uses his vivid word choice to describe every little piece of what is going on. This can get quite boring at times because of the dry reading that is made from it. One example of this is where he goes on for over ten pages of describing every detail of the Pyncheon garden. After awhile of this descriptive word choice and very little dialogue, the book starts to become very dry. At certain points of the novel it becomes very hard to read and understand what is going on. What saves this book is the very intense story line that is going on in this book. The main story line is revenge and greed. The difference in the characters in this book of being nice and kind and then other characters that are evil are greedy provide foils for this book. This helps the readers define that people are either good or evil and the differences between the two are quite large. This makes readers interested because it makes the characters relatable and the readers woot for good to triumph over evil.The reason i gave this book 3 stars is that my opinion is split on if I liked the book or not. I loved the story line and how the plot unfolded. The characters were well written and the plot was very well thought out and executed perfectly. The thing that I did not like is that some points were just described too much. At points it was hard to understand the plot and the characters with all the verbage that Hawthorne uses. He intertwined describing and the plot line together and at some parts it was hard to keep everything in check. Overall this was a good book except for the wordage that Hawthorne uses but that is typical for his work. I would recommend this book to other readers."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"In Hawthorne's times, wealth and power were vested in landownership.In this book, a conflict about landownership is solved in favour of a member of the powerful by incriminating of witchcraft and executing the poor owner of a hut. \`Clergymen, judges, statesmen stood in the inner circle round about the gallows loudest to applaud the work of blood.'But the innocent victim utters a prophecy on the scaffold: \`God would give them blood to drink.'The wrongdoing becomes a curse for all generations to come. They will be \`slaves of bygone times.'The House of the Seven Gables, the expression of that odious Past, stands for \`what we call real estate - the solid ground to build a house on it - is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of the world rests.'One of the main characters, the Judge, represents the respectability of Puritanism. But he is in fact a selfish, iron-hearted hypocrite, greedy of wealth. He is a member of the schemers: \`practiced politicians skilled to adjust those measures which steal the people the power of choosing its own rulers.'As in \`The Scarlet Letter', Nathaniel Hawthorne exposes in this book forcefully the Phariseism of the Puritans and the powerful. It culminates in a very surprising and highly dramatic end.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"The Never-Ending NightmareThe mood of Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables is dark, and painstakingly creepy and slow. The story centers around the murders of two men, centuries ago, the curse that was placed upon the house as a result of that conflict, and the repercussions to the current generation. The overall story is like that of a nightmare of total and complete oppressive darkness. Not so much the fright that results from images of goblins and monsters, but that feeling of being scared of the dark; not because of what is there, but because of what you don't know is there. Hawthorne sets this mood by describing the events that triggered the curse placed upon the Pyncheon mansion in the very first chapter, but never reveals more than a piece of the motivations and consequences at a time, throughout the remainder of the story. The descriptions of the house deteriorating throughout the years covered in the book establishes the sensation of the endless nightmare -- that despite mortal man, the house remains as it was from the day it was erected and only the outward appearance changes. . In fact, as the story centralizes around the curse placed upon the house, it is almost the main attraction of the story, the other characters only playing supporting roles to show the potency of the dark power that the house holds on members of the Pyncheon dynasty. Because Hawthorne gives the house human characteristics, \`So much of mankind's varied experience had passed there -- so much had been suffered, and something too enjoyed -- that the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart. It was itself like a great human heat, with a life of it's own, and full of rich and somber reminiscences,' you feel as if the house holds deep resentment for its residents and that it is contemplating its next attempt at haunting for the entertainment of seeing them hide underneath their bed covers. And that, with each creak and groan of the old estate, the wizards death is warranted by the enjoyment that is gained from each chill and shiver of the residents, and the curse that \`God will give them blood to drink' was premeditated merely for the old houses enjoyment. The very construction of the house itself portrays the feeling that, even though you don't know what exactly you have done wrong, or pretend to not know, the house can see through your transparent shell, right to the core of your sin. \`The deep projection of the second story gave the house such a meditative look that you could not pass it without the idea that it had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon.' All in all, the house is the centralizing character that creates the mood of darkness, suspense and revenge. This mood helps to portray the underlying moral of the story of how our actions have consequences. Colonel Pyncheon, because of his incredible covetousness in desiring Matthew Maule's acreage and his participation in putting all assumed wizards to death, placed a curse upon all future Pyncheons. The permanence of the house and the creepiness that it is, shoes that what we do will affect our posterity, and that even though we ourselves may no longer be haunted by our actions in this earthly realm, their our repercussions to those who proceed us. And just as God did give Maule's Blood for them to drink throughout the generations and his death was rectified by their suffering by the house, so we too are responsible for our sins and they will continue to haunt us and our families, just as the Pyncheon mansion, for generations to come."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Hawthorne's 2nd novel stands as sturdily as a milestone of 19th century American literature today, as when the title mansion was first constructed--a finely crafted blend of Gothic horror, mystery, and a good old-fashioned ghost story. Deliberately alternating the pacing (long paragraphs with virtually no action with sudden shocking revelations or developments), the author weaves a literary tapestry of chiaroscuro and sound effects, all of which heighten the readers' senses and subtly stimulate the imagination. How much can we figure out on our own by reading between the lines; will we surpass the author's intentions with our overzealous conclusions as we are inevitably drawn in and down a spiral of suspense?New England superstition and small town suspicions prove a fertile backdrop for the turbulent events played out in the moldering mansion built by puritanical Colonel Pyncheon many generations previously. Built on a foundation of blood and witchcraft and constructed on land which was fraudulently and criminally obtained despite the refusal of the real owner, \\"wizard\\" Maule, the impressive edifice was stained by Pyncheon blood on the very day of its housewarming festivities--which precipitated rumors of a family curse. Three irascible Pyncheon men were destined to meet inexplicable deaths under the famed gables. But was it clearly murder? Therein lies the mystery, but if not foul play, then does one assume it was Nature herself which chose to make retribution and serve Justice in her own mysterious way?Spinster Hepzibah-near sighted, beturbaned and known for her scowl-shamefully opens a cent shop on the premises, for she is faced by penury to sully the family's once genteel reputation. The arrival of two newcomers-relatives-changes her dismal routine, though the old maid is easily agitated and naturally depressed by the grim past. When Phoebe, a young, blooming country cousin comes for an extended visit, she brings the first true sunshine into the gloomy interior; she offers invaluable help both in the kitchen and in the shop. Then Clifford, a childlike old man--frail in both body and mind-- seeks shelter under his sister's maternal wing. This pitiful creature, a shadow of his former self, has been broken by years of confinement and false conviction of a heinous family crime. After thirty years of institutionalized care, this man is more ghost than substance.The Pyncheon siblings tremble before the stern and commanding presence of their cousin, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, whose public face and public reputation belie a selfish, sinister interior. How can the three simple residents of Seven Gables withstand his terrible will as he seeks to dominate their lives? Holgrave proves an extraneous factor among these four--who views events in the mansion as if enjoying some lugubrious theatre. The young daguerrotypist argues the pretensions of a social reformer, but which side of family strife will win the support of this odd boarder who rents one of the gables?Hawthorne's townsfolk comment on events in the great house and provide tidbits of information, much as Hardy' country locals contrast with the passions and tragedies of the main characters. What will be required to end the family curse of drinking its own blood-or is there simply no hope for the decaying family line? Will the Colonel's impoverished descendents be restored to their former grandeur and gentility? Do they deserve their long-denied financial fortune? A true classic admired on both sides of the Atlantic, House of Seven Gables is steeped in New England tradition, and still captivates modern readers, with its dark shadows of shame and crime whichmelt into scarlet memories in the elusive sunlight."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This review contains spoilers.I have a vague memory of reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" sometime in middle school, and coming away feeling like you would expect after you'd read a novel about Puritan repression (that's all I thought it was about at the time). \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" was like finding a Hawthorne I'd never known before - one of ghosts, the eternal return of historical memory, and high Gothic romance. This time, it reminded me more of Horace Walpole and Matthew Lewis than it did the cold Puritanism that I once associated with Hester Prynne. In this sense, it stood up to what Hawthorne identified most of his longer fiction as, that is, \\"romance.\\"In the late seventeenth century, the eponymous house (actually inspired by an historical 1688 colonial mansion in Salem) served as the residence of Colonel Pyncheon, who once accused a man named Matthew Maule of sorcery in order to have him hanged, and then stole the land upon which he would eventually build his house. One day, the Colonel keels over at his desk under mysterious circumstances, but his presence and his nefariousness seem to haunt the Pyncheon house in various ways.Several generations later, Hepzibah and her intellectually challenged brother Clifford come to occupy the house. They are both descendants of the Colonel, but now the family fortune and good reputation have withered away so much that Hepzibah has to open a store in her house to make some extra money, and thinks herself an abject failure because of it. Holgrave, a daguerrotypist, rents a room from Hepzibah upstairs. One day, a distant relation to both Clifford and Hepzibah named Phoebe Pyncheon visits and manages to quickly change the whole tenor of the house: she is able to bring vim and vigor to the Hepzibah's failing penny shop, and she gives Clifford the companionship and attention that he needs. Just as soon as she appears, however, she leaves again and the house falls into its former dilapidated state.Judge Pyncheon, another member of the family and a wealthy man about town with an eminent reputation, appears at Hepzibah's house and announces that he wants to institutionalize Clifford. The Judge claims that Clifford knows the whereabouts of certain documents that will allow him access to vast tracts of land in Maine. While waiting to talk to Clifford, the Judge dies in much the same way that the Colonel did so many generations before. Hepzibah and Clifford head to a train station to leave their outre circumstances. Later, Phoebe returns to the house with only the artist Holgrave in residence, and he admits how he has (admittedly, somewhat predictably) always loved her. Hepzibah and Clifford soon return to live there, with Phoebe having inherited all of the Judge's ill-gotten land. Holgrave proclaims that he is himself a distant relative of Matthew Maule, so long ago accused of conjury. The House of Seven Gables, so long riven by tumult and strife, is finally exorcised by that ultimate mage, love.I read this mostly as a meditation on the transgressions of history and our inevitable tendency to bear them witness no matter how far removed in time we are from them, two of Hawthorne's pet concerns. Indeed, it's interesting how the sins of Colonel Pyncheon seem almost to take place in a prelapsarian past while at the same time having such a profound effect on the characters presently at hand. Hawthorne wonderfully blends the oppressiveness of the past with the stark newness of the present throughout the novel: the figures of the Salem witch trials (one of whom was Judge John Hathorne, Nathaniel's great-great-grandfather, who found many of the \\"witches\\" guilty) haunt the novel in spirit, but so do all kinds of (then) modern technologies, from Holgrave's daguerreotype, to the train that Hepzibah and Clifford use to escape the ghosts of their pasts. Published in 1851 and with the possibility of freedom from the past being central to the novel, Hawthorne might have meant for this to be, at least in some respects, a commentary on the coming Civil War. As Faulkner, another American equally concerned with the onus of history said, \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"I enjoyed it so much I immediately picked up \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" a review of which will be posted soon."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Hawthorne wrote The House of the Seven Gables during a time of social unrest in Europe and a time of questioning in the US. This was the same decade that Marx wrote \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" and that Thoreau went into the woods in order to live \\"deliberately\\" and not be a slave to material things. Everywhere in the western hemisphere, there were those questioning the material conditions of humankind: why were some people wealthy to excess, others starving? Why were some people good, others evil?Marx called for political action. Thoreau called for individual action. In The House of the Seven Gables, Hawthorne sought to show how old, accepted institutions and old accepted ways were crushing the life out of the present: were standing in the way of change. The character Holgrave, himself a harbinger of the future because he makes his living taking what are today called photographs, speaks for social change. The Pyncheon mansion, the house of the title, was built on murder and ill-gotten gains. In 200 years, no Pyncheon would step forth and confess the wrongs of the past and return the property to whom it belonged. And so, in what looks like a supernatural curse but might be only hereditary, each Pyncheon dies a horrible death which makes it seem as if he were \\"choking in blood.\\" In this novel, the wrongs of the past are brought to light and made right.It's true that Hawthorne describes things to excess -- at least it seems like excess to our modern tastes. But this is a relatively short read, and the plot marches forward toward doom for some, liberation for others. And some serious thinking about right, wrong, and social justice for anybody who reads this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"\\"'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'What profit has a man from all his laborIn which he toils under the sun?One generation passes away, and another generation comes;But the earth abides forever.\\" -- Ecclesiastes 1:2-4 (NKJV)Before commenting on the book, let me mention that I've always found it hard to get into. This time I listened to a reading by Donalda Peters and it made all the difference. Give it a try!The Old Testament tells us that crimes can carry curses into future generations. Hawthorne examines that theme by having Colonel Pyncheon acquire the property of one Mathew Maule through Maule being found guilty of witchcraft in colonial Salem, Massachusetts. On the land was built the House of Seven Gables, and the consequences of the original action certainly seem to singe and tinge the current generation in a variety of ways. Rather than make this just a Biblical tale, Hawthorne beautifully investigates the questions of nature versus nurture in determining character and what choices are made.Much of the story is told through the use of extended irony of the sort that's found in the book of Ecclesiastes. It's very well written and compelling.Those who don't like dark stories should realize that there's a special beauty in certain kinds of darkness. And, too, weeping may endure for a night, but joy can come in the morning. Love can conquer quite a lot."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Reading this novel, it is somewhat funny to call to one's mind how the roots of Puritanism turned into the other extreme during the last centuries, how US-American culture became a symbolism for innovation, eternal change, destruction of everything only slightly old or conservative, endlessly impatient, dissatisfied, always convinced that the next step must necessarily be better than the last one. Traditions overturned, buildings torn down one after the other, entire cities redesigned, customs overthrown, technical innovations overlapping one another in an endless chase for perfection, that's what it stands for now - the country where once the Puritans emigrated to searching for a pure spot of untouched nature where their children were supposed to grow up unspoilt.The house of the seven gables is a mansion built by an archetype of a Puritan and inhabited by his descendants ever since, and nothing but sadness and depression seem to inhabit it and to affect whoever lives there. The daguerreotypist, last descendant of the original owner of the land the house stands on, whose family was forced into poverty after having been tricked away from its ownership, some time in the novel has a long and enthusiastic speech declaring how useless it is to keep a building up for more than twenty years; the son of the house, now in his sixties, is even more enthusiastic about change, calling every kind of building not a home and refuge but a place where life is suffocated, and loving how travelling by railroad - a method of transport which was very modern about the middle of the 19th century, when the novel takes place - makes a human being speed from one place to another, never resting. Likewise, how much does the author enjoy to emphasize again and again the age, ugliness, futility, incapacity of doing anything good in this world, of this man's elderly sister, and repeating again and again the loveliness and freshness of the - of course seventeen-year-old - country niece.Despise for every kind of tradition, for age and dignity, for experience, for the past, that is what this novel is all about. The small concession at the end, where in a few sentences it is said that perhaps the best solution is to keep a house as it was on the outside, and to refurnish it again with every generation so it will suit to it, is drowned by the countless words which have incessantly crucified throughout the novel anything that has to do with age and tradition. The reader's impression is that not the dishonesty by which the builder of the house got hold on its territory is the reason for the \\"curse\\" haunting the family, but the very fact that it is old, decaying, and thus not worth anything in the first place.It is likewise interesting to see how this selfsame novel, while so intent on saying how desirable solely youth and novelty are, is dull and somewhat dusty to the today's reader. Very little happens, and the descriptions between the few things that happen are, though well-written, extremely long and make it all the clearer that not the plot, but the \\"moral\\" of the novel is what the author is after; it is called a \\"gothic novel\\" without having any suspense or mystic trait in it despite the ever-reoccurring hints about (perfectly harmless) ghosts hanging around the house and \\"mysterious things\\" going about. I can hardly recommend this novel, unless a) You want to learn a little about the style of life of a small US city in the 19th century (very little, since almost everything takes place in and about the house and we learn quite little about the city itself), or b) You are interested in philosophy respectively politics and want to analyze where today's US-American mentality came from, with its constant, almost frantic need for destruction of old things and love for new ones that will, this time, certainly be better; blind in the search for treasures, neither willing nor capable to separate the things that indeed must be changed from the ones that, though old, are good and immortally valuable, convinced that as soon as something is new - that is, newly discovered - it must, invariably, be \\"it\\".Other than a few sarcastic smiles, this novel has wrought nothing from me and I would never recommend it to the average reader who wants not only to be lectured, but also to be, at least a little, entertained and involved into an interesting story with credible, live characters. This book's setting, characters and plot are so grey and vacuous and have so little of a real classic in them, which would be a book that one can read and love years, decades or centuries after it was written, that it has deservedly fallen, for today's reader, almost completely into oblivion."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I've had a copy of the House of Seven Gables sitting on my bookshelf for a number of years. The poor little book is slightly out of place between a plethora of fantasy and science fiction novels. Every once in a while I try to venture into a different realm of subject. That's the reason I finally picked up this book to read. I would have read it sooner but I was forced to read \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" in high school and never had the heart to read another Nathaniel Hawthorne novel.Not expecting much, I have to say I was very impressed with this book. The details got to be a bit much at times. I have to admit there were parts of the book that I scanned quit quickly because I just didn't need to know that much description about a certain thing.That being said, Hawthorne was very good at clearly painting a picture in my head. I could smell the mustiness of the house, feel the joy when Phoebe entered a room, and feel Clifford's sadness and confusion. What took me by surprise was the sharp wit throughout the book and intellectualness of this wit. Quit often I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dry humor in this book. Also of course there was the mystery of the book which kept you hanging on until the end.I don't know that I will read any additional Hawthorne novels but I would recommend this as a good example of his work. It is much more interesting and engaging than the Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is probably much more well-known for his classic book \\"The Scarlet Letter\\". As good as that book is, this book is as good in it's own right. It is probably one of the best ghost stories I have ever read! It is also a story about love and loss, curses that live through the years, The most profound truth that Hawthorne focuses on in this book is that the sins of the father are felt by children through many generations. The setting for the book is a brooding, old New England house. This house used to be the home of a proud family, but it had been haunted for generations by an ancient blood curse. At the beginning of the book, Judge Pyncheon dies in his family home in his great oak chair. The strange thing is that though alone, his shirtfront is stained scarlet. And to make matters worse, his body is not discovered for some time. This strange death is somehow traced back to the old family curse, and the reader is treated to what the Judge saw in his last hours. But the story is also a love story. It is in fact the love of two young people that appears to break the curse of the house. The book is a gothic romance, but it is much more than that. I can't really say enough about this book. I read it sometime ago, and it has stuck with me for a long time.

Perhaps Hawthorne, when he wrote it, had come to some degree of peace with the curse that was rumored to have been placed upon his own family. The novel is interesting, and it contains some profound insights. It boasts one of Hawthorne's \\"reformer\\" characters, Holgrave. Hawthorne did not seem to have much faith in reform and reformers, but Holgrave is a more sympathetic character than Hawthorne's other reformers, because he is portrayed as an optimistic youth who will eventually outgrow the excesses of his reformative tendencies."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"\\"Nathaniel Hawthorne continues to prove his amazingly gifted talent as he writes \\"The House of Seven Gables\\". This literary masterpiece is now one of my favorite of his works along with The Scarlet Letter. The most obvious common thing both novels share is the use of symbolism. It is undeniable how his novel is delectable and truly a work of art. Combined with the horror tale of ghosts, the curse following generations, a hint of humor, the history and setting of the nineteenth century, romanticism, and the drama that follows, Hawthorne proves how ingenious he really is.\\"(Andrea Chapman- amazon.com) He accomplishes this by examining the Pyncheon family, a clan founded on America's shores by the stern Puritan Colonel Pyncheon, who used his considerable influence to inveigle prime real estate from one Matthew Maule in the 17th century. Pyncheon carried out this task by using the Salem witchcraft scare to secure Maule's execution. In his last moments, Maule laid a curse on the good Colonel and all of his descendents, telling him that God would give them blood to drink as a punishment for this evil injustice. Shortly after the Colonel builds his house with seven gables on Maule's property, he dies in a way that makes Maule's curse seem to be a reality. Rather than trace this terrible evil down through the ages in minute detail, Hawthorne only touches on a few important points before beginning his story in the middle of the 19th century.The Pyncheon family is slowly moldering into extinction when Hawthorne introduces us to poor old Hepzibah Pyncheon. She lives alone in the ancient estate, reduced to near starvation because her brother Clifford is in prison and Jaffrey Pyncheon, a rich judge who lives in his own manor in the country, refuses to offer her assistance. The only way to survive for Hepzibah is to open a penny store in an old part of the decaying house. Just when things reach a nadir, another Pyncheon turns up to save the day. This is Phoebe, a vivacious young lady who lives in the country. This fetching lass is a blessing for Hepzibah; she runs the penny store, helps to lift the gloomy atmosphere in the house, and when Clifford returns from his long imprisonment, Phoebe entertains the doddering man with her multitude of charms. She even strikes up an acquaintance with Holgrave, a young boarder in the house. Things start to look up when yet another tragedy strikes the Pyncheon family, leading to the momentary evacuation of the ancestral estate by Hepzibah and Clifford before Hawthorne settles all accounts in an ending that is both quick and highly implausible.The reputation this book has with many people is not good. They disparage the lengthy digressions, the massive amount of time Hawthorne takes to explore Hepzibah's dilemma over opening the penny store, the sentences that go on and on without seeming to make any point whatsoever, and the organization of the book as a whole. There is some foundation in these charges. The chapters describing the penny store do seem interminable, especially when viewed in the context of the story as a whole. As for the descriptions of Hepzibah's scowling countenance and Clifford's puny mental state, we get the idea well before Hawthorne quits harping on them. Yes, there are flaws in \\"The House of the Seven Gables.\\"However, I personally enjoyed the deeply rich 19th century prose. Hawthorne's command of the English language is impressive and, at times, as precise as a cruise missile. One need only read the chapter about Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon's unfortunate incident in the house to grasp the beauty of this author's style. As for the digressions, if people have a problem with chapters such as \\"Alice Pyncheon\\" and the introductory material setting down the history of the doomed family, it is really their loss. It is when Hawthorne writes about supernatural elements that he really managed to grab me. If this counts as a lengthy digression from the story, I will take more, please!If I had to assign a Hawthorne novel to a group of slack jawed high school students, I would give them this one in place of \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" At least with \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" someone might enjoy the eerie curse that united the Maules with the Pyncheons for two centuries. A letter sewn on clothing cannot stack up against ghosts, a disembodied hand, and mysterious deaths.

There's certainly an atmospheric richness to the haunted house, and the way owning family is trapped in its moldy ruins is catchy. In this sense, it would make an awesome Tim Burton film. But ultimately, I grew impatient with the work and found it slight. In the end, the characters, no matter how richly painted, are painted cardboard, they're maddeningly passive and the finale comes across as cheesy and contrived. (But there is one really cool chapter toward the end that I can't describe without giving away what little plot there is. It describes how everyone in the neighborhood reacts to something that happens in the house.)In academia, there's a common insult for books: it would have made a nice article. That is, someone had a good idea for a short piece and then played it beyond its proper length. Hawthorne's piece is the same way: it would have made a nice novella. But it's not a novella. It's a novel that's made up mostly of description in ornate prose that isn't particularly charming (like, say, Jane Austen's or Dickens's). So every possible baroque curl is added to the story, to the point that you wish that the characters would, for the love of God, just do something. (They finally kinda sorta maybe do, after hundreds of pages.)If it were written today, Hawthorne's writers' group would have ripped it to shreds. If it were up to me, I'd recommend cutting back on the description. Starting with the two pages devoted to the chickens.Also, if you're going to read this -- and it's main interest is historical, as a classic early American Gothic novel or as a forerunner to Scooby Doo -- examine the edition before you buy or check out of the library. Perhaps they were trying to be cheap or trying to hide how many page-long paragraphs there are, but the Signet, at least, jams so many words onto the page that it's a chore to read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"House of Seven Gables was mandatory reading in high school.

I really must say that the readers complaining about the lush prose should try broadening their horizons just a bit beyond the bare-bones. minimalist airport paperbacks to which they have so obviously grown accustomed. Read George Eliot (real name Mary Ann Evans), Charlotte or Emily Bronte, Thomas Hardy etc etc etc. Don't let your minds be bound and enslaved to the here and now.

It only remains for me to add what I found of personal significance in the novel. My favourite character in the novel is the highly-strung, greatly-wronged, poetically-attuned character of Clifford Pyncheon as described in the chapter \\"The Pyncheon Garden\\" which ends thus:\\"Alas, poor Clifford! You are old, and worn with troubles that ought never to have befallen you. You are partly crazy, and partly imbecile; a ruin, a failure, as almost everybody is - though some in less degree, or less perceptibly, than their fellows. Fate has no happiness in store for you; unless your quiet home in the old family residence, with the faithful Hepzibah, and your long summer-afternoons with Phoebe, and those Sabbath festivals with Uncle Venner and the Daguerreotypist, deserve to be called happiness! WHY NOT? If not the thing itself, it is marvellously like it, and the more so for that ethereal and intangible quality, which causes it all to vanish, at too close an introspection. Take it, therefore, while you may. Murmur not - question not-but make the most of it.\\"Whilst \\"The Pyncheon Garden\\" represents well the idyllic light in the play of light and shadow that constitutes the tale, the chapter entitled \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" is more powerful and more fully represents the darkness that hangs even in the background of the Pyncheon Garden chapter until it is dispelled at the end. I'll only quote one harrowing line from this thanatopsis on what happens when the soul departs the body so as to leave the intrigued reader to discover the rest:\\"Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in quest of what was once a world!\\"The book does have a rather contrived ending that detracts from it as a work of art, but which does serve as relief after all the funereal ponderings.

Before he dies, though, Matthew screams, &quot;God will give him blood to drink!&quot; After the death of Maule, his property is acquired by the same Pyncheon who saw him to the gallows. This Pyncheon dies mysteriously at his house-warming party, and the curse of Maule sticks with the Pyncheons. The previously mentioned Pyncheon had a house(incidentally, with seven gables), which was eventually possessed by the main character, Hepzibah Pyncheon. Hepzibah must set up a cent shop to buy her bread, and her main customer is a hungry, gingerbread-purchasing little boy. Her load lightens with the arrival of her young cousin, Phoebe, but the plot thickens when Hepzibah's brother Clifford comes to stay. Her other cousin, the vile Judge Pyncheon, acts very oddly toward Clifford from the moment Clifford arrives. I won't tell you how the book ends, but I sure liked it, and I feel it proves that the evils of a family can be thwarted by a few members."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"If you are not familiar with Nathaniel Hawthorne, it may help you to read chapter 13 first. The events in chapter 13 take place before anything else in the story. That said, this book is phenomenal. It would almost appear that Nathaniel Hawthorne was taking lessons from Charles Dickens at this time. Amongst other things, Hawthorne explores the theme that greed leads to one's downfall. (One of Dickens's favorite themes.) After setting the mood, Hawthorne introduces us to Hepzibah. (A down on her luck lady who realizes she needs to survive somehow and opens a cent shop. Yet another Dickens's element.) In her desperation, she carries dignity, but also places demands on our sympathy. The young Phoebe later comes to help Hepzibah, and she adds some hope to the picture. We also learn that Hepzibah's cousin Jaffrey is after Hepzibah's brother Clifford. Hepzibah is frightened of Jaffrey, and Hawthorne will later tell us why. Showing another Dickens's element, we meet the sympathetic and eccentric Clifford. (His room is actually concealed. He has habits that appear strange to many, and Hepzibah is frightened of him ending up in an asylum.) Phoebe remains in bliss in her ignorance, but this is not to last. Though her kindness has a nice effect on Clifford. Interestingly, when Holgrave tells Phoebe about Hepzibah and Clifford, Phoebe gets cold feet and needs to get away for awhile. Well, in comes Jaffrey. He is after a will over land, Clifford may know something about it, and Hepzibah is frightened. In a surprise burst of strength, Clifford confronts Jaffrey and leaves with Hepzibah. (Dickens enjoyed giving his eccentrics sudden bursts of strength or a sudden show of virtue.) In yet another Dickens's technique, Hawthorne himself taunts Jaffrey with a fierece and driving narration. And using a Dickens's technique of irony, the document Jaffrey was searching for was worthless. (Greed and irony. 2 of Dickens's famous trademarks.) Moving on, the good Holgrave, Pheobe, Hepzibah, and Clifford are happily reunited. And not only that, but Hepzibah and Clifford come into money and are rich again. But that is not the end of it. Alice from chapter 13 finds peace. While Hawthorne's previous \\"Fanshawe\\" and \\"Scarlet Letter\\" ended on a depressing note, the \\"House of the Seven Gables\\" ends on a happy note. SIDE NOTE: If you are ever in Salem Massachusetts, make sure you see the House of the Seven Gables."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Many complain that Hawthorne's style is too turgid, too stilted and dense to be enjoyable. Admittedly, I was not that fond of The Scarlet Letter, though its merits probably rest beyond the attention spans of most people committed to reading it in lit class. As anyone will tell you, it takes supreme effort and time to wend through any Hawthorne book.I found The House of the Seven Gables much more enjoyable, a novel more accessible to the casual reader than the Scarlet Letter, but still imposing and impressive and just a bit pompous, as anyone can say of the little Hawthorne they have read. The characterization is marvelous. The adumbration of Hepzibah's insular misery and Clifford's simple minded pariah-hood, and the reforming agent of Phoebe's love and rustic vivacity, as well as multiple other character sketches and glorious descriptive passages, are what carried me through this novel. Unlike in the Scarlet Letter, it seems as though the tedium (what little there is here) is always at some point made up for, as though Hawthorne was attempting to counterbalance certain dry passages with heavenly description and character revelations.Those who detested the Scarlet Letter will likely find little but soporific tedium here; for those whose initiation into Hawthorne's craft was not overly harrowing, keep this one in mind for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Describe. Describe. Describe. When in doubt, heap on the adjective clauses. That's the strategy Nathaniel Hawthorne employs in the writing of his novel The House of the Seven Gables, originally published in 1851.The opening chapter promises a multi-generational drama with Gothic undertones, like an American Wuthering Heights. Unfortunately, the novel doesn't deliver on that promise. Instead of penning an epic that spans centuries, Hawthorne chooses to focus on minutiae. He revels in the minute description of the titular house--every piece of its furniture, every plant in its garden, every crack in its woodwork. He is equally adept at depicting humanity, in both its exterior appearance and interior psychology. The result, however, is a book populated by vividly drawn characters that don't do much of anything.The house in question belongs to the Pyncheons, a once prominent, aristocratic New England family whose glory has faded and whose membership has dwindled. Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, the family's most notable and prosperous surviving constituent, is the absentee landlord of the place. His cousin, the elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon, inhabits the house. She is joined by Phoebe, her beautiful young niece from the country; Holgrave, a photographer who rents one of the gables; and Hepzibah's aged and feeble brother Clifford Pyncheon, who has just been released from prison after a decades-long sentence for murder. Though the story revolves around crimes, both past and present, Hawthorne avoids talking about said crimes as much as possible, instead concentrating on the lives of the four people in the house--their habits, their eccentricities, and their relationships with one another. Hawthorne concentrates so intently on every breath and movement that it takes half a chapter just for a character to walk across a room. The atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife, but it leaves little room for activity. When things finally start happening in chapter 16 (out of 20!), it's too little, too late. Despite the macabre events taking place, the pace is still so slow it could put even James Fenimore Cooper to sleep.The House of the Seven Gables is a book better quoted than read. You can pluck almost any paragraph from this novel and hold it up as an exemplar of English language prose, beautifully poetic in its descriptive elegance. But the sum total of all these perfect passages is one tedious, disappointing book. There were moments in some of the better chapters when the writing reminded me a bit of Balzac, yet Hawthorne could have learned a thing or two from his French contemporary. Balzac excelled at both atmosphere and action, and could juggle the two expertly. Perhaps that's why his books still feel as fresh, insightful, and entertaining as the day they were written, while Hawthorne's novel seems just as musty and cobwebbed as the house it so intricately depicts."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"House of Seven Gables has been one of my favorite classics since the middle school days, decades ago. This review is of the CDs and the performance of the narrator himself, not about the novel. The reason I decided to buy it in the first place was becasue it was on sale for $15, and the fact that it's unabridged. Anthony Heald has terrible reading speed, he would pause at wrong places while not stopping at periods. Anyone that has read classic novels would know that most of them have long sentences with many semicolons, and conjunctions. He sounded like he's catching his breath quite often, and his pronounciation is kind of slurred as well. At least it didn't cost me that much. If you search for unabridged audio editions of this book, you'll find a few others by different companies, which all cost at least $30 or more. If you are poor then get this one, it's the cheapest. I'm certainly shopping for another set."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I have never read anything quite like this book. The authors style is very different and amazing. He is so descriptive. Every scene, every event, every little detail is written about in such a away that you know really start to connect with this time, place and people. This is also the books down fall. When it takes 3 pages to describe Clifford sitting at the window, it is hard not to get exhausted reading it. It took me over a year to finish this book because I kept having to stop and read something else for a change of pace. I mean really it is over 300 pages about a couple of shut-in's and their history. Nothing really happened until the last 40 pages or so. But to the books credit, I kept coming back, it was interesting how history and life can affect someone and I wanted to see how it turned out. I would only reccomend the book to an avid reader and someone who enjoy's classics. If you need suspense, romance or action, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"The story of &quot;The House of Seven Gables&quot; begins in the midst of Puritan New England (which Hawthorne paints characteristically, and forgiveably, quite bleak) with the fantastic tale of a severe dispute between stern Colonel Pyncheon and alleged wizard Matthew Maule over a piece of land. Maule is conveniently executed (while cursing Pyncheon) for his &quot;crimes&quot;, and Pyncheon builds Seven Gables on the aforesaid land. Several years later, the colonel dies suddenly, supposedly the mark of Maule's curse, which is to forever haunt the Pyncheon mansion.Several generations of Pyncheons come and go, and the family decays and whithers until it can boast only four remaining members, two of which are old and frail. But one, a Judge Pyncheon, rotten under his trim exterior, is up to unsurfaced mischief.The story tends to move slowly (much of the meat of the plot is not encountered until nearly half-way through!), but every word bears weight. Hawthorne weaves his story in such a way that every moment spent getting to know the characters is crucial. Neither is the slow development boring: far from it! Relax, enjoy the pace, and allow yourself to feast on Hawthorne's brilliant prose. As Henry James once stated, &quot;The House of Seven Gables&quot; is &quot;the closest approach we are likely to have to the Great American Novel.&quot;"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne gives the reader a lesson in descriptive writing in this 1851 American Gothic novel. The purpose of descriptive writing is to completely describe every person, place, or thing so that the reader clearly sees it in his mind. This is why the writers of the 1850's were accused of being paid for each word. How about his initial description of Judge Pyncheon: \\" It was the portly, and, had it possessed the advantage of a little more height, would have been the stately figure of a man considerably in the decline of life, dressed in a black suit of some thin stuff, resembling broadcloth as closely as possible. A gold-headed cane, of rare oriental wood added materially...\\" Okay, no use continuing with the description, you get what I'm saying. This kind of writing along with the use of archaic words is the reason it is so tough to get through these classic novels. Do you hear me Herman Melville? Try to read his 1851 'Moby Dick'. I'm not saying that I didn't like Hawthorne's book, I loved it as I loved 'The Scarlet Letter' (1850) and I'm sure I will love 'The Marble Faun' (1860) when I get around to reading it. In a preface by the author, he calls this book a Romance! But it really is what scholars now call a Dark Romance. Yes, I would agree that this book is very dark and gloomy!Hawthorne takes the reader on a emotional ride. In the 1600's, a greedy puritan Colonel Pyncheon has Matthew Maule hanged for witchcraft so he can obtain his land and build The House of the Seven Gables on it. Before Maule is hanged he issues a curse on the Pyncheon Family by uttering \\" God hath given him blood to drink!\\" Maule gets his revenge when the Colonel is found dead with blood on his beard. Two hundred years later, we meet the remaining Pyncheon family, most still living in the decaying mansion, destitute and alone. The reader will meet characters inclined to sin, self destruction, rapacity, a craving for wealth and one unpretentious lady. Lets meet the participants, shall we?We have the spinster with a scowl, Hepzibah Pyncheon, who opens a penny store in the front of the house in order to make ends meet. Her brother, Clifford, returns home after serving thirty years in prison for murder, a broken and imbecilic shell of a man. The only friendly neighbor is Uncle Venner, a old man on the decline.The mansion is falling apart, musty smelling and decrepit after nearly 200 years of neglect. Did I mention that it is currently haunted by the ghost of Alice Pyncheon? Sounds like a dark and dreary story, right? Well, yes it is! Enter Phoebe Pyncheon, a cousin that has come to live in The House of the Seven Gables. She brings joy and hope to Hepzibah and Clifford, who were decaying like the fungus of soft timber. Also enter the dishonest and deceitful cousin, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon! The Judge says that he would like to help the family by bringing all the cousins to his estate. But is that the real reason? Hepzibah vehemently declines the Judge's offer. Also enter, the house's lone renter, Holgrave ( no first name given ) who is an daguerreotypist and writer. What's his real mission in the house? Is he looking for retribution? Then Phoebe has to go home for awhile to clear up her affairs, and when she does: It sends Clifford into a bed ridden state and depresses Hepzibah into a maddening state of mind. Then the avaricious Judge Pyncheon returns to the cursed house for, as we would say today, round two! Reader, if you can get through this gothic novel of the 1850's, you will have read a true American Classic.I found this novel to be similar to a great painting with Hawthorne as the artist. The way he paints the mood shifts and the use of light and shadows gives the reader a feeling of good and evil depending on what character is about. Truly his descriptive writing is brilliant, whether it pertains to a person, the house ( dark and damp ), or his descriptions of the backyard garden where Phoebe has many talks at different times with Clifford and Holgrave separately. I also thought it was brilliant of Hawthorne to leave doubt in the readers mind, whether the Maule family were actually in possession of mystical powers, or not. I found myself re-reading the \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" chapter again and again. It was the most superb episode in this marvelous novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"With the success of The Scarlet Letter (1850), Nathaniel Hawthorne took his place alongside Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau as the leaders of New England's literary community; the book also made Hawthorne enough money so that he could turn all his energies to writing as a full time endeavor. The House of the Seven Gables was published a year after The Scarlet Letter came out, and although most of its themes had been considered in the earlier novel, Hawthorne's point of view in the newer work was as he put it, \\"a more natural and healthy product of my mind ... and a more natural book for me to write.\\" The book is less severe and even charming in its own way, and it was even more popular than the Scarlet Letter. Whereas both works are still considered masterpieces of early American fiction, The House of the Seven Gables is now generally seen as being much the inferior work.Hawthorne knew his reading public well and understood that the dark themes previouly developed in The Scarlet Letter could be counted on to sell a lot of books. The idea that \\"the wrongdoing of one generation lives into the successive ones\\" was not new, but Hawthorne was determined to give it his full attention; indeed maybe too much attention, resulting in a weakening of the book as a whole. In many ways, the book becomes an idea in search of a supporting cast and plot. It is too episodic (the train ride of Hepzibah and Clifford is not only irrelevant to the plot but could - if the names of the characters were changed - have been lifted from another book entirely); the ending is painfully contrived and all to easily ties up the missing links; and the characters are more like portraits than they are like real people - none of the characters are developed enough to compare to either Hester Prynne, Roger Chillingworth or Minister Dimmesdale.And while the book may not succeed in its entirety, it is not void of some elements of literary genius. Hawthorne was a master of description and the chapter entitled \\"Governor Pyncheon\\" shows him at his best. Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, a cousin of Hepzibah and Clifford, is the consummate hypocrite: a man, who while affable in society, is obsessed with power and greed and is a manifestation of his Puritan heritage. Having little sympathy left for this heritage, Hawthorne not only kills the Judge off, but spends an entire chapter detailing the dead Judge's vanities and ambitions, and tauts the deceased about the finality of death. And while the hours pass and rigor mortis sets in, Hawthorne takes pleasure in placing a common house fly on the dead man's nose. It is a wonderful touch and a startling demonstration of Hawthorne's literary talent."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I did not have to read Hawthorne in high-school, so my impressions were not based on some previous experience. I did not quite know what to expect when I picked it up. What I got was a moderately interesting book, which did not touch me on any serious emotional level. The problems faced by its characters are dated and don't translate well into modern world, the thoughts may have been original in 19th century, but by now are trivial, the characters are built through descriptions and not through actions. There are several paragraphs in the book that I thought were great and interesting, so the book is not a total waste of time. In a way, I can see why it became a classic of American literature, but it did not preserve well.One thing that I'd like to point out is a complete lack of any moral or a point to the story. It's just a collection of events that happened to leave positive characters prospering and the bad guy dying. Random stuff. \\"S..t happens and sometimes it happens for good\\" seems to be the main idea of the book. It's an OK idea for a \\"vacation-book\\", but I usually expect more from a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Though there were definitely times when this book was slow or difficult to understand, Hawthorne's writing, through the use of metaphors, allusions and other rhetorical devices is a wonderful accomplishment. It was hard for me to get into the book at the beginning and especially through the long discussion of the Pyncheon family but it payed off to know this information when the climax arose.

I am one who couldn't get into it. Hawthorne gets off of the topic often and takes forever to accomplish the discription of something I felt most writers could have done more quickly and more succesfully. All of the discription seemed excessive and only confused me. I had to force myself to read the first half of this book, and by the time I had reached that point I came to the conclusion that if it hadn't already captured my attention then it wasn't going to.I have always enjoyed early American literature, Greek literature, and have read my fare share of William Shakespeare, but I just couldn't enjoy this one. It was just too dry, and the story really seemed to go no where.

Instead it traveled one and a half times around the country with DHL (according to the tracking record it went from Texas to Kentucky then finally to California, where it was given to USPS to deliver.) Yes, it arrived within the 19 days window, but that was a very silly route to take. At the same time another order of mine came from the east coast to here in only 3 days directly with the USPS.

But I made my way through the House of the Seven Gables and think I should give my honest opinion. I read this when I was a voracious reader and was plowing through a book every two or three days. I made a point of making every third book I read a piece of classic literature. Without much exception I could really see why these books were classics. They resonate with meaning even today. This slender tome was one of the most dry, difficult and unstimulating books I recall reading during that time period. In spite of its modest size it took me more than a week to finish. Just when it would start getting interesting it would turn deadly dull. The language is the dry pretentious sort that leaves you feeling like you just swallowed the dust off the books in a thousand libraries. The book is all descriptive of the pervasive spirit that indwells the house as a result of its operatic history. The characters that dwell in the house are merely furniture for the house with little backstories of their own. But mostly they are there to set a mood. Little of interest happens in the book. It is a book about language and mood. Call me pedestrian but House of the Seven Gables could have made its point more interestingly if written by Count Floyd on SCTV. Look boys and girls...this house here is scary. It will scare the pants off you. Look at that picture on the wall with the frame. I bet your hair is turning white. Whooo. I am frightened just thinking about it. Hooowwwwlllll. House of Seven Gables inspires me to write a hundred seventy page book describing indepth the decay of my last television set. I am going overboard but this is a book ideal for people who like Hawthorne. If you like spending time decyphering meanings from carefully chosen words you may greatly enjoy this book.

However, the writing here is very good and the story is interesting. What struck me most of all about this book, however, is how funny it is. Not funny in a joke-cracking way, knee-slapping kind of way, but Hawthorne has a very dark sense of humor, and in this book he deals with dark themes like death, curses, witchcraft, and old age in a surprisingly humorous and deadpan manner. He writes the best death scenes! I don't want to give away any details, but you need to look past the image of Hawthorne as a stuffy dead white guy in order to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Purchased in anticipation of a trip to Salem, MA to visit the actual House of the Seven Gables, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book far more than I thought I was going to. Written in 1851, The House of the Seven Gables is at once both a period romance and history of the Pyncheon family, focusing on a several week period of the lives of the current owner, Hepzibah Pyncheon, her brother Clifford, cousin Phoebe and their lodger, Holgrave. Themes of guilt and retribution run throughout the novel, as the histories of both the house and the Pyncheon and Maule families are all brought to light.Hawthorne relies heavily on not only his own family's history to help him build some of the plots in his novel, but also on the general history of the area, with aspects of the novel dating back to the Salem Witch Hysteria of 1692. The house has stood for centuries as a spectator to these happenings, and seems to be haunted by the ghosts of the suffering that has occurred within its halls.While suffering from many of what I see as familiar plot devices for its time (family secrets, hidden identities, convenient deaths and sudden marriages that let everyone live \\"happily ever after\\"), Hawthorne was still able to craft and wonderful and imaginative novel. While some of the descriptions may seem extraordinarily long by todays standards, I felt as though this added to the books charm. Some may find it hard to read, but if you let yourself be picked up by the story and not try to think your way through the book, you'll soon find yourself completely engrossed in poor Hepzibah's trials and tribulations."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I have to admit that i thoroughly enjoyed this book. It consisted of love, fear, confusion, and suspense all at once.In the seventeenth century puritan colonel Pyncheon, an early settler on the New England coast, desired to build a mansion on the beautiful property that belonged to a man by the name of Matthew Maule. In order to get what he wanted, colonel Pyncheon accused Maule of practicing witch craft. Because of this, Maule was executed. Right before he was hanged, Maule cursed Phycheons family for many generations to come. Pyncheon went on to build his mansion. As soon as it was finished, Pyncheon died a sudden and mysterious death. His mansion went on to be known as the house of the seven gables.A century and a half later, the house is occupied by Hepzibah Pyncheon, an elderly maid, and Mr. Holgrave who rents out the upstairs apartments. The house is dark and gloomy until Pheobe, Hepzibah's niece, arrives to help. From this point on, the book becomes not only a mystery, but a love story as well. When Clifford, Hepzibah's brother, arrives home from his thirty year imprisonment, Pheobe helps him restore his health, she then leaves returning to her farm home, and the house becomes dark and gloomy once again. At this point i thought that Pheobe possibly had some kind of power. Hawthorne has that way of implying things, but not assuring them. It keeps you reading the book to find out what is really going to happen next. The story goes on to reveal mysterious deaths, unexpected plots, and a passionate love between two people.I believe that Hawthornes writing is unique and genuine. He has a way of persuading you to believe what he writes, making everything seem very real.

This is a complex tale spanning generations between the Pyncheons and the Maules; a blood feud which emanates from the infamous Salem witch trials. Hawthorne is a splendid writer of descriptive prose, and it is so descriptive, that I must confess I was confused occasionally as he goes back and forth between the late 17th Century Pyncheons and Maules and their mid 19 Century descendants. This novel isn't nearly as tragic as \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", ending on a somewhat hopeful, optimistic note."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This is another good Hawthorne book.

After getting off to a great start for a horror story, the story line sort of bogs down in the middle before coming back to an active pace for a predictable ending.Hawthorne sets the scene for a family feud between the powerful Pyncheons and the lowly Maules. Through a series of strong arm tactics, the senior Pyncheon brings a curse onto the family with the House of Seven Gables - a house designed and built for Pyncheon by Maule's son on land that had been wrested from the Maule family. After generations of failure and thwarted ambition, the Pyncheon line is almost dead and the curse continues to linger. There is only an old maid with a scowl to scare children, Hepzibah; her brother Clifford who returns from a long imprisonment for the murder of his uncle; Judge Pyncheon, the son of Clifford's victim, an ambitious man who cloaks the depravities of his soul with a false magnanimity; and Phoebe, a country cousin who seems not to be born down with the weight of the curse except through her exposure to the others. When the Judge dies under mysterious circumstances in the House of Seven Gables, the curse is set to either finally destroy the Pyncheons and the Maules or to expire and leave them to a new peace.House of Seven Gables is more notable for me in the language that he uses. The way he describes everything is absolutely beautiful, particularly when he is describing the young women - \\" All her little womanly ways, budding out of her like blossoms on a young fruit tree, had their effect on him, and sometimes caused his very heart to tingle with the keenest thrills of pleasure. At such moments - for the effect was seldom more than momentary - the half-torpid man would be full of harmonious life, just as a long-silent harp is full of sound, when the musician's fingers sweep across it.\\""},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This was a slow yet interesting read that definitely helps to build a strong vocabulary, something that is hard to find these days.

His short stories, by their very nature, move from conflict to climax without much ado. They are preachy, pedantic, and allegorical--and I love them. \\"...Seven Gables\\" moves along at a much slower pace, developing symbolism and characters with greater subtlety and depth. The plot itself is not much deeper than one of his short stories. We watch humbled, yet strong Hepzibah struggle for a living from a one room shop in the house. Along the way, she meets a variety of characters and becomes host and confidant to a long-lost relative, gentle Phoebe. Phoebe is sunlight, poking into the shadows of the gabled house, bringing vivacity to its occupants, Hepzibah, Clifford, and Holgrave. Yes, Hawthorne hints at sinister things in the past and present of the old house, but only with the arrival of Judge Pyncheon do we begin to suspect trouble brewing.The conclusion of the book involves death and hidden riches and suspicions and redemption. The symbols throughout--the house, the chimney, the elm tree, the chickens, etc.--manage to reveal their purposes in due time. In a satisfactory manner, Hawthorne contrasts the insidious nature of religious hypocrisy with the virtues of honesty and gentle love. The horrors of the Pyncheons' past fade away in the light of Phoebe's commitment and care. Her time in the house brings life to all within...all except one.Hawthorne could've encapsulated this tale in one of his short stories. He could've sliced away words with meticulous demand. Instead, he allows us to know and care for the people in his story. Some readers, granted, will find it difficult to care and will call it a waste of their time; sure, it takes a little effort. But, just as Phoebe and Hepzibah display sacrificial love, a reader who's willing to give the time might find worthwhile rewards by the book's end.If you're already a fan, you'll enjoy it.

Or if it has any direction at all. Also, I didn't really feel that this book had a lot of supernatural elements in it, there were some to be sure,though they were hardly anything to get excited about.

Though praised by Hermann Melville, Edgar Allen Poe, and other respected authors and critics at the time of its publication in 1851, many of today's readers may question the novel's reputation for greatness. Was it one of the first substantial novels by an American author? Where Americans of the era, tired of bowing to European cultural tradition, hungry for a literary hero of their own? Undoubtedly. Coming more than twenty years after the bright, crisp style of Washington Irving, the regressive 'House of the Seven Gables' reads like the kind of tiresome classic many people dread being forced to confront in higher education classes, for the book feels more like the product of the 18th rather than the 19th century. Like the balance of Irving's short stories, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is set a century earlier than the period in which it was written, thus making comparisons with Irving even more difficult to ignore.The major problem with 'The House of the Seven Gables' is that its story could be told by a shrewder and less indulgent author in one tenth of its 268 somnolent pages. Hawthorne worked within the framework of a specifically chosen plot and theme, yet the novel, taken page by page, appears to be about almost nothing: there seem to be vacuums between the words, voids between the sentences, gulfs between the paragraphs. Hawthorne considered this work a romance, and there are some suitably gothic shadows, but, if in fact a romance, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is the flattest major romance in Western literature. Though its plot elements include a corrupt judge, accusations of witchcraft, the hanging of a sorcerer, a poisoned well, and a murderous, disembodied hand, the tone throughout is tepid and airless.Structurally, the novel is disastrous. Elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon, one of the last members of a declining New England family, is opening a small penny goods shop on the lower floor of the seven-gabled house in which she lives in solitude. Now financially destitute, Hepzibah bravely faces down her elitist illusions concerning her family's social superiority when she realizes how completely present the wolf is at her door.After a turgid history of the righteous Pyncheons of Salem in chapter one, the second concerns itself only with an account of Hepzibah's fumbling attempts to open the shop on its first day of business. In the third chapter--\\"The First Customer\\"--Hepzibah encounters her first customer. By the close of the fourth, \\"A Day Behind The Counter,\\" readers find themselves on the book's 56th page, almost one-fifth of the book, and still passing the time unproductively with Hepzibah in the shop on its opening day.Unfortunately, Hepzibah's protracted confrontation with reality is the strongest part of the book, Hepzibah being by far the most distinctive of the characters within its pages. But Hepzibah soon fades into the background, taking away with her what little drama exists; none follows.In a later chapter, Hawthorne spends 6,352 words coyly conveying to the reader that an apparently sleeping man is not sleeping, but dead, something the reader has already guessed after completing the first of the many hammering paragraphs to follow.Winded passages like \\"You hear the ticking of his watch; his breath you do not hear. A most refreshing slumber, doubtless! And yet he cannot be asleep. His eyes are open!\\" and \\"an infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight! Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in a quest for what was once a world!\\" abound.Hawthorne was fond of exclamation points and short of self-discipline. It could be argued that Hawthorne was simply layering his prose with multiple crosshatches of irony, sarcasm, and satire, but, if so, Hawthorne, here already a king with no clothes, only doubly underscores his shortcomings as a prose stylist.Readers of Hawthorne's third novel, the punishing 'The Blithedale Romance' (1952), or his short stories 'My Kinsman, Major Molineux' and 'The May-Pole of Merrymount' know how willfully vague and turgid Hawthorne's work can be. His reputation today is probably some combination of accident of birth, proximity to high society, uncritical alliance to literary tradition, and the fact that his suffering prose style is interpreted by the pretentious or uneducated as evidence of highbrow genius. In truth, Hawthorne simply did not prove himself a very good writer in most of his work, regardless of the grandiosity of his themes or their genuine relevance to American history.In an often reprinted essay, Hawthorne scholar Newton Arvin argued that Hawthorne's dominant theme was the 'prideful sin' of \\"cultivating the intellect at the expense of the sympathies,\\" a phenomena which is generally understood to have been particularly commonplace in Puritan-rooted New England. However, Alvin, who clearly empathizes with Hawthorne on this point, fails to acknowledge that sympathy for others, whether sincere or unconsciously affected, can as readily become a source of sinful' pride as the intellect or any other human capacity.Hawthorne, whose best work is found in his simply written short works such as 'Feathertop: A Moralized Legend' and 'Young Goodman Brown,' in addition to his two books for children, 'A Wonder Book' and 'Tanglewood Tales,' was an intelligent man of strong emotion, and it was there, in his dominant feeling function, that he understandably forged his creative work.Those seriously pursuing a study of general Americana, American literature, or the history of New England should read 'The House of the Seven Gables,' and perhaps visit the lovely site of the actual house in Salem, Massachusetts. For everyone else except the masochistically curious, the novel is unessential reading."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"After reading The House of the Seven Gables, I think that it is a decent book to read.

At times I found it annoying because I did not understand all of the meanings, but then you have to remember that Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote this book in 1851. During the beginning of the book, I would find myself reading, and as I got down to the bottom of a page, I would realize I had no idea what I had just read.

But I never really think of James as American, since his works all seem so British...). And \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" is my favorite of Hawthorne's works. To modern readers who are wired for short attention spans and fast-paced, plot-centric, dialogue-heavy prose, I can see where this book would be daunting and difficult. But to readers who appreciate the beauty of language, the importance of meaning behind plot, and an author's ability to transport you to another time and place, this book is phenomenal. Hawthorne masterfully weaves an imaginative, romantic tale, giving us insight into a very specific corner of our heritage that is often overlooked in American history, and of which modern audiences (and even scholars) know very little.If you're not used to reading the classics, this might not be the best one to start with. But if you've already cut your teeth on Dickens or Austen or Eliot, this book will be a treasured favorite to add to your collection."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Wordy, pedantic, familial soap-opera... yes, yes, and yes.As much is made of Hawthorne's mastery of the English language, his style doesn't translate to the modern reader terribly well in The House of the Seven Gables. Many reviews here criticize the slow-moving story line, frequent digressions, and over-abundance of adjectives. Be that as it may, it's a wonderful period view of New England society. I, too, found the first half to be difficult going much of the way, but the detailed snapshot of life in the mid-19th century kept me going.It's not a horror story, it's a time capsule."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Hawthorne I believe is the best American writer of all time. Rather than romanticize the house for the purposes of story telling, he provides us with more of a lesson in community, law and history while putting the house of seven gables in such a perspective.His style is magnificent and he never strays from his purpose of uplifting the human soul to indulge in sensationalism, or the like except in his the artist's story of Matthew Maule and the Pyncheon's which is quite a humorous exposition.What impresses me most and distinguishes Hawthorne from most other American writers, is well beyond his excessive grace and knowledge is that his characters are all story tellers, and not just some stiffs spouting off one liners in the midst of some formulaic or contrived plot. His contrivance of plot the legal documents is funny and well put into perspective by his emphasis on the human condition in a new england town.Its a very good book, although the Scarlet Letter was more gripping to me. I think he is a far better author than Twain and especially Faulkner who I believe is a total hack, and even Melville for Hawthorne's spareness, clarity and grace. And Hemingway - give me a break, that guy is not in the same league as Stephen King. Hawthorne is definitely the greatest writer in American literature, although of course he didn't turn out the same number of books as some of these other guys, you can only read so many books anyway.Grace, style and exposition (with romance) of all manners of the human condition and sound advice are what makes Hawthorne the best. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne continues to prove his amazingly gifted talent as he writes The House of Seven Gables. This literary masterpiece is now one of my favorite of his works along with The Scarlet Letter. The most obvious common thing both novels share is the use of symbolism. It is undeniable how his novel is delectable and truly a work of art. Combined with the horror tale of ghosts, the curse following generations, a hint of humor, the history and setting of the nineteenth century, romanticism, and the drama that follows, Hawthorne proves how ingenious he really is.The novel beings describing the old Pyncheon House, otherwise known as the House of Seven of Gables, and divulges the house's misfortune. The House of Seven Gables was built by Colonel Pyncheon, who was an early Puritan settler. The land on which the house was being built, however, belonged to Mathew Maule who later was charged with witchcraft and forever cursed the Pyncheon family before he was hanged. Almost a century and a half later occupying the house is Hepzibah Pyncheon and Mr. Holgrave and Phoebe Pyncheon, the young cousin of Hepzibah who is only visiting. Soon after Phoebe arrives, Hepzibah's brother, Clifford, is just let out of his thirty year imprisonment for being wrongly accused of his uncle's death because of his cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon. When Phoebe returns to her home, the house is just as gloomy as it was before. Judge Jaffrey, then, visits the house and demands Hepzibah to speak with Clifford. After refusing, Hepzibah finally gives in and goes into Clifford's chamber to find that he is not there but in the parlor pointing at Judge Jaffrey dead body in the chair sitting. Quickly Hepzibah and Clifford take off to the train station and leave from the House of Seven Gables. Meanwhile, Phoebe returns and Mr. Holgrave lets her in, tells her about Judge Jaffrey's death, and then confronts her about his affection for her and she does the same. In the end, Judge Jaffrey's wealth is strangely inherited by Hepzibah, Phoebe, and Clifford.Hawthorne's writing is effectively powerful in the depth of this novel as he magnificently planned what may seem like a simple story really goes beyond the lines of realism and imagination. Although the book and characters seemed to move slowly because of all the descriptions and be a little difficult to read, I still grasped the concept and realized that the description served a meaningful purpose for Nathaniel Hawthorne, in my opinion, is one of the best literary novelists. The House of Seven Gables is genuinely a classic and a memorable masterpiece."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"At first I felt the characters were too gloomy for my taste and it took some effort to keep reading.

Unlike the films, Mike Mignola's Hellboy series is a dark and moody walk through crumbled castles and vine-ridden monasteries, albeit with the occasional gun fight and mad Nazi scientist. Reading it got me in the mood for more of the same, and after some research I discovered that Mignola was playing with a genre that's been around for quite some time. The addition of the Guardian List brought with it a large selection of Gothic fiction to the WWEnd site, including one novel by an author I was already familiar with, Nathaniel Hawthorne.By the time Hawthorne wrote his very popular House of the Seven Gables, he was working within an established genre whose shape and borders had already been established by such writers as Horace Walpole, William Beckford, Matthew Lewis, Charles Maturin, and Edgar Allan Poe. Hawthorne doesn't disappoint any reader who comes to his novel expecting the same as what these earlier writers provided: ancient aristocratic homes, tyrannous judges, estranged relatives, unspeakable crimes from long ago, one-sided depictions of ancient religious communities, and of course a good haunting. While his book was and is well loved, I'm not sure that I agree with those who love it.But the fault isn't, I think, with the genre itself. Even though this is probably the only novel I've read that accurately conforms to the classical tropes of the Gothic genre--authors like Bram Stoker and of H.P. Lovecraft wrote books similar to the Gothic, but were developing their own ideas--I still have a strong draw to its peculiar atmosphere. Hawthorne, though, is something of a hack writer, and that harms the novel. Never content to allow a metaphor to remain implicit, he often spends multiple pages explicating an image he just inserted into the narrative, as though afraid its meaning might possibly pass a reader by. His prose is hardly bad in and of itself, but he can't stop himself from pointing out his own cleverness. Adding to this weakness is his proclivity for digression, in which he interrupts an ongoing part of the narrative to talk about a character's or object's history, or to wax so poetic about something or other that the wax starts dripping all over the place. But for all his literary gurning, Hawthorne leaves a hugely important occurrence at the end of the narrative unexplained even after so much else is revealed. Sometimes one wishes he would shut up and tell the story.Here's part of Hawthorne's description of the eponymous house:\\"All, as they approached, looked upward at the imposing edifice, which was henceforth to assume its rank among the habitations of mankind. There it rose, a little withdrawn from the line of the street, but in pride, not modesty. Its whole visible exterior was ornamented with quaint figures, conceived in the grotesqueness of a Gothic fancy, and drawn or stamped in the glittering plaster, composed of lime, pebbles, and bits of glass, with which the woodwork of the walls was overspread. On every side the seven gables pointed sharply towards the sky, and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood of edifices, breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney.... Little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks.\\"Although The House of the Seven Gables is probably not the best example of Gothic fiction, its influence, especially on American horror, cannot be denied. Hawthorne himself is something of an acquired taste, but I know many people who think he's one of the finest literary figures from early America. Maybe someday I'll come around to their way of thinking, but it might be a while."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is probably one of the most despised figures in the American literary canon, at least in the minds of the millions of school children forced to read \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" I will go so far as to admit I never finished that novel. I took one look through the book and laughed at the ridiculous idea of reading such a convoluted looking story. That was at age seventeen. Now, many years later I am able to go back and actually read some of these daunting novels. What is surprising is that they are not daunting at all, just written in an ornate style from a different age. The plots often deal with the same issues and concerns modern people fret about. For those uninterested in relationships and human dramas, there are also great old stories with supernatural elements, which is where this book comes in. This edition of the book includes an introduction by Mary Oliver and several commentaries on the work by Edwin Percy Whipple, Henry T. Tuckerman, F.O. Matthiessen, and Herman Melville. The Melville commentary is actually a letter the author of \\"Moby Dick\\" sent to Hawthorne where he concludes with a demand that Hawthorne \\"walk down one of these mornings and see me.\\" Pretty neat.In \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" the author tells his reader the story is a romance. What he means by this terminology is not a cheap paperback that involves swooning hearts with Fabio on the cover, but \\"a legend prolonging itself, from an epoch now gray in the distance, down into our own broad daylight.\\" Hawthorne's specific goal is to show that the bad behavior of one generation devolves on future descendents. He accomplishes this by examining the Pyncheon family, a clan founded on America's shores by the stern Puritan Colonel Pyncheon, who used his considerable influence to inveigle prime real estate from one Matthew Maule in the 17th century. Pyncheon carried out this task by using the Salem witchcraft scare to secure Maule's execution. In his last moments, Maule laid a curse on the good Colonel and all of his descendents, telling him that God would give them blood to drink as a punishment for this evil injustice. Shortly after the Colonel builds his house with seven gables on Maule's property, he dies in a way that makes Maule's curse seem to be a reality. Rather than trace this terrible evil down through the ages in minute detail, Hawthorne only touches on a few important points before beginning his story in the middle of the 19th century.The Pyncheon family is slowly moldering into extinction when Hawthorne introduces us to poor old Hepzibah Pyncheon. She lives alone in the ancient estate, reduced to near starvation because her brother Clifford is in prison and Jaffrey Pyncheon, a rich judge who lives in his own manor in the country, refuses to offer her assistance. The only way to survive for Hepzibah is to open a penny store in an old part of the decaying house. Just when things reach a nadir, another Pyncheon turns up to save the day. This is Phoebe, a vivacious young lady who lives in the country. This fetching lass is a blessing for Hepzibah; she runs the penny store, helps to lift the gloomy atmosphere in the house, and when Clifford returns from his long imprisonment, Phoebe entertains the doddering man with her multitude of charms. She even strikes up an acquaintance with Holgrave, a young boarder in the house. Things start to look up when yet another tragedy strikes the Pyncheon family, leading to the momentary evacuation of the ancestral estate by Hepzibah and Clifford before Hawthorne settles all accounts in an ending that is both quick and highly implausible.The reputation this book has with many people is not good. They disparage the lengthy digressions, the massive amount of time Hawthorne takes to explore Hepzibah's dilemma over opening the penny store, the sentences that go on and on without seeming to make any point whatsoever, and the organization of the book as a whole. There is some foundation in these charges. The chapters describing the penny store do seem interminable, especially when viewed in the context of the story as a whole. As for the descriptions of Hepzibah's scowling countenance and Clifford's puny mental state, we get the idea well before Hawthorne quits harping on them. Yes, there are flaws in \\"The House of the Seven Gables.\\"However, I personally enjoyed the deeply rich 19th century prose. Hawthorne's command of the English language is impressive and, at times, as precise as a cruise missile. One need only read the chapter about Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon's unfortunate incident in the house to grasp the beauty of this author's style. As for the digressions, if people have a problem with chapters such as \\"Alice Pyncheon\\" and the introductory material setting down the history of the doomed family, it is really their loss. It is when Hawthorne writes about supernatural elements that he really managed to grab me. If this counts as a lengthy digression from the story, I will take more, please!If I had to assign a Hawthorne novel to a group of slack jawed high school students, I would give them this one in place of \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" At least with \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" someone might enjoy the eerie curse that united the Maules with the Pyncheons for two centuries. A letter sewn on clothing cannot stack up against ghosts, a disembodied hand, and mysterious deaths. The kids will still grumble, but not as much when they realize there are less \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" tossed around in this novel."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"It's very obvious from reading all of these reader reviews that The House of the Seven Gables is not for everyone. But, I urge you to determine if it is for you. If it is, you certainly don't want to miss it. This novel was not written with today's readers in mind. You cannot call it quick-paced, by any stretch of the imagination. The novel is however, a wonderful work of art. Every sentence, every word is carefully crafted, carefully chosen. This novel is meant to be read slowly, to be savored. The novel tells a fairly simple story--the story of the house, and its perhaps doomed family of inhabitants. Many years after a curse by a supposed warlock--there are only 4 members of the doomed family surviving. Is the house haunted? Maybe. Hawthorne is so clever--every time he tells us about a supposed ghost or haunting, he gives us a more &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation. Were they ghosts swirling around the house one evening, or was it just the wind. Is the family doomed? Maybe, but then there is young Pheobe who seems anything but. The House of Seven Gables is far superior to any contemporary gothic you can read. It is novel writing at its best. The characters have depth, the story is engaging, and even, at times, funny. But, you have to be ready for a novel written well over a hundred years ago. If you are, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I must say that the negative reviews that I have read about Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables are sorely off the mark. The prevalent sentiments are that the plot is dull (or almost absent), the characters are flat, and the description is overwrought. But you who say this are simply missing the point, as well as taking Hawthorne's work out of context. You have to understand that this novel was written during a very transitional period in literature. Writers had shifted from the Enlightenment to Romanticism (the period in which Hawthorne writes), and as Hawthorne writes his novels, another movement is being made to Realism. Realism is what we are used to in modern fiction. It contains real characters and real events. But Hawthorne had not yet fully employed these new ideas, and he still hung on to the Romantic sentiments. Therefore, he was much more interested in ideas rather than character development (a modern technique). Hawthorne chooses to convey ideas, emotions, morals, etc. rather than fully developed the characters like they would be in a novel today.As for no plot, you have to keep in mind that Hawthorne still looks to the old tradition (not to mention his guilt of his heritage), so he uses his writing as a way to teach moral lessons, not necessarily to describe a highly detailed story and plot.Finally, I can't deny that there is plenty of narrative description, but most of it serves a great purpose, and for the parts that you think do not belong, just read and enjoy them for their poetic beauty and technical merit.Hawthorne is a fantastic writer, but to acknowledge this, the reader must not take his work out of its context."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Sometimes it seems a mistake to force high school students to read 19th century literature. It does take patience to adjust to the \\"old fashioned\\" prose, but it's worth the effort. House of Seven Gables is an eerie ghost story based upon actual historical events. Hawthorne knew Salem and its history inside and out, and he also knew how to create a haunting atmosphere and a story that stays in the mind forever. He's one of the few authors who conveys a sense of Puritan fatalism and repression without resorting to gothic romance cliches. This is an excellent piece of literature, and if you haven't given it a chance by rereading it as an adult, you're missing a great experience."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I read the House of the Seven Gables about thirty five years ago. I enjoyed the book then and I enjoyed rereading it. Nathaniel Hawthorne has a way of turning a phrase. There are portions of the book that I have reread several times. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to read the classics. Hawthorne details scenes and emotion in a brisk, but complex way. I felt, sometimes, I was living in New England. As a classic, House is very readable. I try not to analyze, to deeply, all of the reasons a writer chooses how to handle a subject. Mid-nineteenth century literature can be a joy to read, it rewards one with a tangible sense of history. If you enjoy reading House, try The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"What can you say about Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;House of the Seven Gables&quot; that hasn't been said before? It's dark; it's Gothic; much of it is depressing; and the language is dense 19th century prose. Those who read primarily for plot will find it slow going, and those who look for likeable characters may be largely disappointed. In other words, for modern readers, this book may be a tough sell. Personally, I found it a little dull and a letdown after having recently reread (and enjoyed) &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot;Nonetheless, &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; has its pleasures. Hawthorne, the scion of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, injects an unusual sense of historical depth into his writings. This is certainly true of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; which explores the idea of character flaws, evil and retribution passed down from generation to generation in a single family. Of course not everyone in the family is guilty, but the sins of a few taint the lives of all. As in much of Hawthorne's work, the supernatural, sometimes implied and sometimes explicit, plays a role in the workings of the plot. Even the daguerrotypist--nothing but an early photographer to us--must have given the 19th century reader a frisson because of his combination of mesmeric powers and miraculous ability to produce telling images out of pure light.Hawthorne is a master of description, an expert at using his words to create images that convey far more than simple visuals. Even when the plot seemed stale and the characters wooden, the author's use of the language made it worth continuing. Hawthorne's descriptions of a little boy's love of animal-shaped cookies, of the garden with Maule's bitter well, and of the dead Jaffrey unmoving in his chair, to mention just a few, made the book well worth reading. &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; may or may not be Hawthorne's best work (that's always a matter of opinion--try some of his short stories too), but it is an interesting book nonetheless"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"A slow, leisurely, and deep read. Hawthorne has a wonderful prose style that is uniquely him. He has a poetic way of taking things that seem small or insignificant and making them large and thoughtful. The plot does not move along quickly, but I found that the reading did. The characters seem to move in slow motion for a great majority of the book, and every movement has volumes of meaning. I feel this book is very representative of the emergence of american values of equality, of a disdain for the importance previously placed on pedigree or heritage and of course, of the emphasis on things like virtue, humility, etc. A delicious read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Besides being a classic Hawthorne this is an exceptional edition because of the wonderful annotation."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"The story, Hawthorne's second, is a romantic mystery that takes place in a battered seven gable house in a small New England town. It begins with a complicated and top-heavy backdrop. At its center is the socially prominent Pyncheon family. The Pyncheons are a family that holds many dark, mysterious and often deadly secrets -- not the least of them being that 150 years earlier, the land on which the house of the seven gables was built, was actually swindled away from its rightful owner, Matthew Maude, by the locally prominent Colonel Jaffery Pyncheon. After the \\"good colonel\\" had swindled away the land, he then promptly (and conveniently) proceeded to have Maude executed for practicing witchcraft - an easy charge for a prominent citizen to level against someone of lesser status at the time. However, from the scaffold, Maude placed a curse on the entire Pyncheon family, and the plot of the story is launched. The rest of the story is primarily about both the unfolding of the deadly secrets of the Pyncheon family, and the effects of the curse that Maude had placed upon them, get played out.Colonel Pyncheon was so unfazed by the promised curse that he brazenly hired to build (on the land he had just swindled from his father) Maude's son as his carpenter. Well, he \\"shouldn't have oughta\\" done that because true to the curse, at the house warming the \\"good Colonel\\" is found dead sitting at his desk. To add more intrigue to an already galloping mystery, the Colonel had also left a will with directions to a deed for a giant tract of land somewhere in Maine.With this dense backdrop the prologue ends and sets up a complicated pretext for the second act of the story, which begins with Hepzibah, an old maid and one of the few remaining heirs to the now dwindling Pyncheon fortune as she opens up a penny store on the ground floor of the house of the seven gables. Finally waking up to her diminished social condition, becoming a shop operator was her last resort way of trying to \\"make ends meet.\\"The rest of the story and its intertwined intrigues, unfold within the store and with the tenants of the house being at its center. The Maude's curse continues to bring bad luck to the Pyncheon household, culminating in Jaffery Pyncheon II's alleged murder by his young nephew, Clifford. After spending 30 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Clifford, the last of the Pyncheons still possessing first hand knowledge of the complicated set of family secrets, returns to the house, to be cared for by his elder sister.Everyone thinks Clifford knows where the deed is, including his uncle who stalks the returned prisoner for his hidden secrets. But the deed is never found and the uncle, like his father, is found dead sitting at the same desk as his dead father was found. Hepzibah and Clifford abandon the house for a time but return in time for Phoebe and Hargrove (a photographer and tenant), to wed. This wedding appeared to be the cathartic medicine needed to rid the house of its evil spirits. Yet, Phoebe and her new husband chose to move the family away from the cursed home, and they (apparently) lived happily ever afterwards.The moral of the story is that the sins of one generation can live on to infect subsequent generations. Or said differently, the sins of the father will always revisit the sons of subsequent generations. This was a much too long and too complicated and illogical novel for my taste. Three stars"},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"This book is really good. Very deep mystery about a dying witch's curse. It's not a fast-moving thriller, by a slow and methodical one. Every word is chosen so carefully by Hawthorne, that it is fun to read and a challenge for the mind to find the hidden meaning. The novel starts with a discription of the house- the house with human attributes and ends with a lone cat watching the fulfillment of a witch's curse. Really excellent. There's plenty of characterization, hints of incest, and omenious surrounding to keep the reader entertained. Love love loved it, read it in a college American literature class."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Dusty classics of this type when assigned to poor high-school kids typically elicit a wave of one- and two-star reviews consisting mostly of complaints that the work was \\"boring\\", usually for the reasons of too much description or most commonly, \\"no plot\\". They have trouble simply getting through it, but their school deems the work edifying, or at least did the last time anybody bothered to review the reading lists, so it's off to SparkNotes and the sham continues.I claim boredom for this work but not in that sense, having read it voluntarily after all. Two novels I have ploughed through in the last year, namely The Idiot and Tale of Two Cities were more \\"boring\\" in the sense of being hard to get through, though both were greater novels by far I thought. I had no trouble on the other hand getting through Seven Gables. The boredom for me rather arose from finding nothing particularly compelling about Hawthorne's observations. Only a ponderous \\"behold my pronouncements\\" style. Rendered the more dull read so soon after that marvel of deft wit and light touch, Gulliver's Travels. Hawthorne is the anti-Swift--no travels for him! His lumbering, self-important prose reflecting his stolid, adventure-free life.An indiscriminate deployment of minute analysis unto every topic that wandered into his view--the chickens, the getting of Phoebe out of her bedroom and down the stairs (3 pages), as examples. And to what end? A dubious premise--that the sins of the ancestors are visited upon the descendants. By what mechanism--karma? The kind of God who keeps a ledger of credits and debits? Some mysterion he couldn't be bothered to elucidate, just woooo--ghosts! Then a banal and predictable outcome, in which all live happily. Half-baked trends such as \\"mesmerism\\" offered but not defended.How the novel might have been improved by Hawthorne getting out the damn house and down the street. Wade into the hubbub down at the Salem wharfs five minutes away--plenty of real adventure and drama to be found there, no need to resort to spooks. Dickens walked miles and miles in London. Melville went whaling. But this recessive little piggie stayed home, and the book suffers for it. Humorless gasbag, I say."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"I tried to read this book for the first time when I was in my late teens, but I couldn't stand it. The language was just too flowery and long-winded. After twelve years or so, I just tried to read it again. This time, I was able to get through the book.I thoroughly enjoyed Hawthorne's descriptive language. His ability to paint a picture through words is amazing; however, this same technique is what caused the book to move so slowly. Hawthorne took hundreds of words to say what could easily have been said in a couple of sentences. Yes, that is just the way American romantic novelists of the mid-nineteenth century wrote; still, for American readers of the twenty-first century who are used to fast-paced life, this sort of writing can be difficult at times.My biggest problem with this book was its ending. Everything was just too neatly wrapped up. The remainder of the Pyncheon clan and Holgrave had too happy an ending. With the background of the Pyncheons, they should not have had such an ideal ending! The ending should not have been so neatly tied up. There should have been loose ends and serious problems remaining for everyone.If you enjoy Hawthorne or just simply want to become more familiar with mid-nineteenth century American literature, read The House of the Seven Gables. If you cannot abide books that spend more time with setting, descriptions, etc., than actual movement of the plot, you might want to read another book."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"In my opinion, this is Hawthorne's masterpiece. Generally speaking, I do not like to compare Hawthorne and Dickens. However, this is probably the ONE TIME American Literature CAME THIS CLOSE to the fine masterpieces of Europe. Like Dickens, Hawthorne presents us with profound and chilling images. As Dickens presents us historical backgrounds and realistic pictures of Victorian England, Hawthorne does so (except with Puritan America.) As Dickens offers us deep psychological insights into human nature, so does Hawthorne. Hepzibah is fine as the poor woman who is out of place and needs to survive somehow and take care of her brother Clifford. Clifford is memorable as the character who teaches us about a second chance at youth, and who has to later take care of Hepzibah. Phoebe is touching as the innocent young woman who brings what cheer she can. Jaffrey is frightening as the villain who wants the mysterious lost treasure AT ANY COST. Chapter 18 not only offers a unique narration style, but is probably the most terrifying moment in all of Hawthorne's writing. As frightening and tragic as this story seems, Hawthorne manages to offer us a happy ending. If you are not that familiar with Hawthorne, you may do good to read Chapter 13 FIRST. The events in Chapter 13 take place before anything else."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"Hawthorne's work is a creepy classic -- one of the most interesting books to emerge from an entirely different era of American letters."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"What a great book. In truth, I found The Scarlet Letter a little hard to read, though I can appreciate its merit. This novel, however, kept me involved from start to finish and the symbolism in the text is so rich that one could read HSOG twenty times and discover something new each time.Hawthorne is really dealing with appearances in this text but is also suggesting the step toward modernity with the advent of the railway and electricity, things still \\"novel\\" at the time of writing.

Before dying, Maule uttered a prophecy to Colonel Pyncheon: \\"God will give him blood to drink.\\"Villagers could not understand that Pyncheon wanted to build his house over the unquiet grave of the dead wizard Maule and why he should prefer this site that had already been accursed in all the vastness of New England. At any rate the house was built in the grotesqueness of Gothic fancy with seven gables pointing sharply to the sky. On the day of the ceremony of consecration of the house, Colonel Pyncheon suddenly died and some said that Maule's prophecy could be heard throughout the house spoken in a loud voice...From father to son, the family clung to the ancestral house with tenacity. Bu Mathew Maule's prophecy seems to have planted a heavy footstep on the conscience of the Pyncheons as though they committed again the guilt of their ancestor thus inheriting a great misfortune.An impressive novel in which an old house itself is the major character. The story is filled with contrasts and oppositions between the dark and gloomy interior of the house and the bright and sunlit exterior. Shadow is the atmosphere of the invisible world of evil, of the past hidden in the recesses of the old mansion.

At his best he was sublime (&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;), and at his worst he was ridiculous (&quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot;). This books lies somewhere in between. It is based on an interesting premise, the handing down of a sin through generations, and the dark shadow of Puritanism. The plot is slow to get moving, however, and most of the characters are less than engaging. Still, it's worth a good look, especially if you have visited the house itself upon which the tale is based, in Salem."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"So far this is my favorite Hawthorn novel, although to say that is deceiving. I have only read \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" which I loathed... even seeing the cover of the \\"Scarlet Letter\\" brings on waves of nausea which only large quantities of sunshine and a good dose of trashy horror novels can cure. But that was long ago, and I am a much more mature reader now, besides, people call this a horror novel.They Lie.This is not a horror novel... It's some sort of family drama/morality tale with a smattering of bad romance thrown in. So is it terrible? No, Hawthorn does have a way with words... but I also believe that he thinks his readers have the short term memory of a melon, therefore he has a tendency to continually bash the reader over the head with an idea until he is absolutely positive that even a mouth breathing troglodyte will not only understand, but also have it burned into the interior of their skull.Short Summary: Loooong ago a maniacal Puritan leader by the name of Pyncheon falsely executed a local by the name of Matthew Maule by claiming he was a wizard and in league with the devil. As he was hung, Maule uttered a curse on both Pyncheon and his descendents. Pyncheon then takes over Maule's land, plows his house under and builds his own enormous dwelling on top of it - a house with Seven Gables. Flash forward to the 19th century and we have the descendants of Pyncheon, still living in the house and suffering as their family's wealth, status and sanity have dwindled to almost nothing. The elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon(that's a female name by the way) is forced to open a penny shop to try to bring food in. Enter Pheobe Pyncheon, a niece who has come to stay with Hepzibah and is full of life and vitality. They run the shop, do some gardening and entertain Clifford (Hepzibah's brother) all the while living in fear of their cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon who seems to want something from them.There were some parts of this book I enjoyed, and the over all concept was interesting... the sins of the father shall be paid for by the sons, but there is a lot that is left unexplained. And the reader is never sure if there truly is a curse or if the fear of a curse is what has kept the Pyncheon family down for all of these generations. Their sense of pride is almost a physical character in the book. In truth there is only one likeable character in the book, and that's Pheobe... and Hawthorn is so determined to make us like her that he goes on and on about everything she does, how she looks, how bloody cheerful she is, how everything is better as long as Pheobe is around... to the point that the reader hopes a ghost either gets her so that we don't have to read any more about her or grabs the rest of the household so that she can live in peace.I understand the historical significance of Hawthorn's works, and his mastery of the language. However this particular book becomes almost as suffocating as the house itself, dreary, stifling, repetitious and sadly... the reader may find themselves searching for a way to escape (much as Clifford does)... lucky for us the escape is much easier than it is for the characters. There are other classics that I would recommend before digging into this one. It's not a difficult read, after the first 15 pages or so the language clicks and you can read it quite easily... it's just not an overly exciting read, nor is it an overly rewarding read."},{"Title":"The house of the seven gables;: A romance (Rinehart editions, no. 89)","review":"To those who approach \\"classics\\" with trepidation, I heartly recommend House of the Seven Gables. Not only the characters but the very house come alive, in all their splendor and in all their shortcomings.Cousin Hepzibah Pynchon stands as one of the most pitiful but admirable characters of fiction.

The events and aliens from the first and third stories served as significant inspirations for Ridley Scott's 1979 film, Alien. Overall, this is the standard gallery of fantastic riches seemingly ubiquitous in Golden Age SF. Unfortunately characterization is often flat, and sometimes the story comes achingly short of its promised ambition. Still, the book is definitely worth reading as an embodiment of Golden Age work and should delight van Vogt's fans.

Along the way, the crew battle an intelligent cat-like predator with all the trappings of a scheming human consciousness, an amorphous male red monster with cylindrical body that kidnap members of the all-male crew to lay its spawn in (which gender study majors may knock themselves over with allusions to the male appropriation of the female womb in a very homoerotic act of procreation), and a bird-like species seeking to communicate with the humans with suitably disastrous consequences. The fact that this latter group of aliens first appear as double-images resembling the female figure suggest the threat of the female Other. That our smart-ass protagonist, Grosevenor, who is also a \\"Nexialist\\" (a jack-of-all-trades scientist who gains respect as he saves the ship time and again) identifies that they are a parthenogenetic race, reproducing without sex, arguably adds to the terror of the little patriarchal society, which is dreamily alluded to in the close of the book as \\"its little bit of human civilisation\\" on board the Space Beagle.But in case one thinks this book only invites feminist debates, it can be enjoyed for its fancy arsenal of retro-futuristic gadgets like the \\"encephalo-adjuster\\" that controls the mind and vibrators that resemble the modern-day taser with its adjustable wave intensity, among others.The novel is also incisive in its examination of human psychology and politics, especially of the society the crew of scientists have made for themselves on the Space Beagle. As much as the scientist study the theory of cyclical history in these alien civilisations, they are also apt reminders of the vulnerability of human civilisation as we know it."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"Written in 1959 - wiseguy, hard SF space novel readers don't knock it yet! A.E. van Vogt presents, carries and completes a beautiful presentation about a roaming scientific spaceship visiting worlds strewn acorss the glaxay. His vision of aliens don't have the normal Golden Age hokiness than many books at the time have. The Space Beagle meets four species which are so different from the normal \\"two-arm, two-leg, slimy\\" alien. These aliens can control wavelengths or exist as pure energy or can project hallucinations, etc. The way these aliens interact or deceive humans is an excellent read.The crew of the Space Beagle are always on the brink of destruction, if it wasn't for Grosvenor and his mysterious science of Nexialism. Whole none of the crew understand his science, they view him as eccentric and unreliable. It's Grosvenor's struggle to have the others see that his science can work wonders between the other scientists sciences."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"This is truly one of the great science fiction novels of all time, and I'm not exaggerating. This is far and away the best writing A.E. Van Vogt ever turned out in his notable career. This is a great story.Or perhaps I should say \\"stories,\\" as originally these stories were published as short stories. The time is far in the future, when Mankind has mastered interstellar travel, and sent the \\"Space Beagle\\" out into the distant reaches of the Galaxy on a voyage of exploration. What it finds is imaginative and fascinating--as much for the reactions of the human crew to aliens as the strangeness of the aliens themselves. My favorite story in the novel is the Beagle's encounter with \\"Couerle,\\" a tiger-like intelligent being evolved further along the evolutionary scale than humans. But all of the \\"episodes\\" in this novel are worth reading, and remain good entertainment despite this book having been published in 1939.Recommended. If you can find a copy of this one, buy it!"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"In this book VanVogt introduces the world of science fiction to nuclear winter, warp drive, and energy beam weapons. In an earlier book (The Beast) he introduced us to transporters as a means of travel. Very insiteful for a book first published in 1938! Cleary the basis for Star Treck. The book was back in print after Aliens was released due the fact that one chapter was the insperation for that movie. A must read for anyone who thinks they are a science fiction fan."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"Van Vogt combined four of his shorter stories into one novel, so although the novel publication dates lists 1950, parts were written in 1939 and 1943. A web search has led to the four stories being:* * Black Destroyer * A. E. van Vogt * nv Astounding Jul '39* * Discord in Scarlet * A. E. van Vogt * nv Astounding Dec '39* * War of Nerves * A. E. van Vogt * nv Other Worlds May '50* * M 33 in Andromeda * A. E. van Vogt * ss Astounding Aug '43Filler material was written by Vogt to combine the four stories into one novel. The 1939 and 1943 stories are the best part of the book, the filler material is mostly boring. Although a lot has been written about Black Destroyer and it being the seed for the movie Alien, I thought that the creature in the novelette Discord In Scarlet more represented the alien. Maybe people have gotten the two mixed up. At any rate, the high value of this novel, over let's say a short story collection that contains Black Destroyer, is that Discord in Scarlet as well as M33 in Andromeda are included. When you hit these parts of the novel, your just propelled through reading it. Although the aliens are indeed horrific, there isn't as much tension as there is in the movie Alien; it's more that's it's so compellingly written. Sections are also from the aliens point of view which are superb. From what I understand, the alien in Discord in Scarlet is so omnipotent, that when the story was written it was still considered that the Universe may be closed, ie cycles through indefinite Big Bangs and Big Crunches. Well, this alien some how resisted or survived the Universe's previous Big Crunch. In between the stories are discourses on a science called Nexialism which Vogt possibly took from the root word nexus. It's defined as \`applied whole-ism'. Yeah, Vogt really packed in a lot of information in that definition. From reading the novel, it appears it's just a basic knowledge of a combination of sciences. A sort of \`jack of all trades, master of none.'. Actually Vogt almost seems to say it's \`a master of all trades'. Considering the ambition of scientists, which scientists wouldn't want to be an expert in all fields of science instead of being limited by the shear wealth of information of just one small section of one field of science.A breakdown of the start of the stories are:Black Destroyer, chap 1-chap 6, SuperbFiller material on Nexialism, chap 7-chap 12, BoringDiscord in Scarlet, chap 13-chap 21, ExcellentWar of Nerves, chap 22-chap 27, MundaneM33 in Andromeda, chap 28 (end, pg 192), Great Finish"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"I first found van Vogt at a garage sale and ever since have been scrounging anywhere for these books!I just wish I had teachers like the Hero!

The book is not heavy like some SF and is easily accessible to all readers with average reading ability. Van Vogt introduces the reader to an array of alien life which makes the reading of the book a must for all fans of early SF."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"This book is about wo different things. The first is the four episodic plots where the crew meets a different alien in each plot, then it proceeds to try to kill them, and they find some way to stop it. That to mee felt like a bunch of Star Trek episodes. And, yes, one of the episodes inspired Alien, but the movie alien is scarier, while that particular plot is more thoughtful.The other plot of the book is far more interesting, and that is the plot of Nexialism versus the other sciences, and the arrogant scientists onboard who don't consider Nexialism a real science. Nexialism is supposed to be a superscience, which is wholeistic, in that one has to be a master of all other sciences and understand how they relate together. Part of this is maximizing a person's ability to learn massive amounts of information. If found this part of the book to be far more entertaining than the Star Trek plots, and much more devloped. Reading it, I wish such a science did exist. It would be awesome to be able to learn everything there is to know about chemistry in a month, then move on to another topic the next month."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"One of Van Vogt's most loved books, I have to admit that there was a certain thrill in here that was lacking in &quot;The World of Null-A&quot; probably because it's much less based in an unfamiliar philosophy, but at the same time it's much less complex. Still for straightforward authentic Golden Age SF it doesn't get much better than this. Basically you have four stories (it's all treated as one story but it's four separate situations) of the crew of the Space Beagle as they explore the vast reaches of space. Each is a little mini-adventure, two involve horrific aliens, one is a tad dopey and the last involves an alien so big that only in the Golden Age could you get away with it. Beyond the ideas the stories themselves are exciting, even if in the beginning the crew comes off as a bunch of total idiots (twice they bring the alien onto the ship! twice!) and they never really stop being self centered. Much of the book is seen through the eyes of Grosvenor, the new guy with the new science of Nexialism which is apparently a way to integrate all the sciences, among other things . . . unfortunately this means that the stories fall into a pattern where everyone has the wrong solutions to everything because they are self centered and can't see past their own disciplines until Grosvenor basically forcefeeds them the solution. But, as typical for novels from this period, you don't read them for the staggering charactizations but the ideas and Van Vogt writes like a madman here, cramming so many fanciful into each chapter and making you believe them that you find yourself devouring the book more than reading it, especially the bits with the aliens (the second alien was an obvious influence on the movie Alien, right down to it picking people off in the ship) which are genuinely frightening . . . it's a credit to Van Vogt that he can write the scenes from the aliens POV convincingly, sometimes more convincingly than the people. It may or may not be his best book, but it definitely ranks as one of the few all out fun classics from the Golden Age of SF. Sadly it's only available used these days but even then a little searching can probably dig it up."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950) is a standalone SF novel. The Space Beagle is a roving laboratory ship that is outward bound to another galaxy. Almost every human science is represented onboard the great ship, including one Nexialist. These scientists are searching for new and unusual data that they can use to evaluate and revise existing scientific theories.In this novel, Ellott Grosvenor -- the Nexialist -- observes as the other scientists encounter a huge black cat-like animal on a previously unexplored planet. The creature is obviously intelligent, as is shown by its straight-forward, yet cautious, approach to the scientists. It even has manipulative tentacles around its neck.Coeurl is hungry, but knows that it cannot directly attack the small strangers and survive. It acts friendly and later ambushes a lone individual among the ruins of the Builders. For the first time in weeks, it absorbs life sustaining id from the body. But its feeding is interrupted by the approach of a small flyer.The strangers are suspicious of Coeurl after the body is found. Gregory Kent -- head of the chemistry department -- is very angry at the death of his friend Jarvey. He wants to terminate the creature immediately, but is overruled by Hal Morton, the expedition director.The chemistry department analyses the remains and discovers a shortage of potassium. They prepare a soup of potassium suspended in an organic compound similar to its state within the human body and Kent presents a bowl filled with the substance to the alien creature. Before most of the department heads, Coeurl angrily dumps the contents of the bowl into Kent's face.After being thrown off his feet by the forcefully thrown substance, Kent responds by drawing his vibrator gun and shooting the creature. He is quickly disarmed, but the whole incident results in a loud argument. Eventually one of the participants notes that Kent's shot struck Coeurl without harming the creature.In this story, Grosvenor leads the creature into a specimen cage and the doors are locked from the outside. Grosvenor submits a report to the director about the incident and points out that, with the creature's known and suspected abilities, the current confinement has certain flaws. Later that night period, Coeurl manipulates the electrical lock with its control of electromagnetic energy and starts killing off the humans.At first, the creature kills humans in individual bedrooms and returns to the cage in sufficient time to fool the roving guards. When it reaches a dormitory, however, Coeurl goes into a killing frenzy and returns late to the cage. As it is killing the guards, one cries out and sets off alarms throughout the ship. It throws the bodies far down the corridor and slips into the cage, locking the door behind it.This story tells of the battle between Coeurl and the humans. It also relates the experiences of the ship's crew and passengers when they encounter the bird-like Riim espers, the almost unkillable space-living Ixtl, and the galaxy-spanning dispersed intelligence of the Anabis. As the ship's captain says, \\"scientists can find trouble where it never existed before.\\"This is one of the earliest novels by the author and is based on his first published short story -- \\"Black Destroyer\\" -- from the July 1939 issue of Astounding. It contains most of the elements that earned him a lofty reputation: high adventure, exotic science, and extraordinary individuals. While the book publication was almost sixty years ago, this story still seems to be as futuristic as the latest tales in SF magazines. The science of Nexialism could be announced anytime in the next year or so.Obviously, the title and plot of this story refer to the voyages of the HMS Beagle. This nineteenth century brig was used for three voyages of exploration, but is remembered mostly for the second voyage. In 1831, the Beagle sailed from Plymouth with the naturalist Charles Darwin onboard. While visiting the Galapagos Islands, Darwin collected the data that eventually led to his theory of evolution.This story, however, expands upon the voyages of the Beagle. Rather than a small vessel, the space version is a huge starship capable of tremendous velocities through intergalactic space. Moreover, the ship carries over eight hundred scientists and hundreds of tons of tools and instruments. The author doesn't think small.Highly recommended for van Vogt fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of high adventure, advanced mental training, and unknown worlds.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"The Voyage of the Space Beagle by A. E. van Vogt is a book that could best be described as Classic Sci-Fi. Science Fiction in general is a genre that is very new to me, and I have never read any van Vogt. So I decided to go on a voyage!This book was originally 4 short stories that were put together in a \\"fixup\\" by van Vogt. The stories are all about the crew of the Space Beagle (a Darwin reference) and its intergalactic expedition. The crew is made up of military personnel and scientists that are on board to study alien life in other galaxies. Eliot Grosvenor, is the books protagonist. He is the lone Nexialist aboard the ship. Nexialism is a relatively new science. It is one that encompasses ALL the other sciences and relates them together. It is more generalized than specific, but it also adds an element of hypnotism and mind control. At first, Grosvenor isn't given much thought. He is left to himself until trouble comes aboard and his skills are called into play.Each story, or section, in the book describes contact with an alien race. In the first story, the crew members explore what they think is a seemingly deserted planet. The stumble across Coeurl, a cat-like creature that has tentacles and an incredible hunger. He pretends to be just another dumb animal, and the crew members \\"capture\\" him and take him aboard the ship to study. But Coeurl is hungry and he has an agenda. He quickly escapes and terrorizes the ship.They also encounter the Riim, a bird-like creature that has great hypnotic power; the Ixtl, a devil-like alien that is keen on breeding, by implanting his eggs in the stomach of the crew members; and Anabis, who is galaxy-wide and is waiting to take over planets.While the aliens are the main part of the storyline, what appealed to me even more was the relationships of the crew members. If the creatures outside don't get you, the people inside just might! There is a political undertone that reflects the climate on the ship. The military and the scientists always seem to be at odds with each other and underlies the harmony on the ship. It seems to be a pretty accurate assessment of ventures even today that involve the same types of people. While a lot of the \\"scientific\\" stuff is really dated, I was intrigued by the politicking going on inside the walls of the Beagle. This was a short, fun read. I can see a lot of present day science fiction that was influenced by this writer. Overall, I highly enjoyed it!!"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"With all the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to read Van Vogt's \\"Voyage of the Space Beagle\\" with the same clarity and futuristic vision that perhaps inspired Gene Roddenberry to spin off Star Trek vesting the Enterprise with the five year mission to go where no man has gone before. In a style that will remind readers of Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" or Asimov's \\"I, Robot\\", this quintessential example of early pulp science-fiction and space opera - at once fun-loving, thought-provoking, intense, frightening and entertaining - is actually a series of four short stories joined together by the common theme of inter-stellar exploration and alien first contact.Each of the four stories is brim full of the stock in trade and requisite hard sci-fi toys and elements of the typical stories of the day - blasters, stun guns, force fields, teleportation, bizarre aliens, hostile landscapes, communicators, travel at near light speeds, and the like. But assessing it from the hard side of the sci-fi spectrum, \\"Voyage of the Space Beagle\\" is certainly not unique, has little beyond short-term entertainment value to recommend it and I think most readers would be unlikely to accord it the status of \\"classic\\".But look more closely at the softer side of the sci-fi field of play! Ah, now there's where \\"Voyage of the Space Beagle\\" comes into its own with some compelling and imaginative ideas, insights and questions - Elliot Grosvenor as the expert in the newly founded science of Nexialism which purports to be the nexus or bridge between hitherto unrelated fields of scientific endeavour such as physics, chemistry, metallurgy, geography or sociology for example (a means of looking at the \\"big\\" scientific picture from a new meta-level, as it were - do you think we're talking about a 1950s version of Science Officer Spock here?); the social difficulties of a population living in the confined quarters of an exploratory vessel for extended periods; the political, command and management clashes between scientific, technical and military personnel with their varying motives, agendas and decision making styles on such a mission; the completely ineffectual nature of democracy as part of a command structure in the context of such an operation; and the unbridgeable philosophical differences and overwhelming communication difficulties that might be encountered in an alien first contact situation.Clearly Van Vogt was appreciative of our ultimate smallness in the universe. Like Clifford D Simak, he was also openly critical of man's history of violence and the arrogant impression of his own power and importance:\\"You assume far too readily that man is a paragon of justice, forgetting, apparently, that he has a long and savage history. He has killed other animals not only for meat but for pleasure; he has enslaved his neighbors, murdered his opponents, and obtained the most unholy sadistical joy from the agony of others. It is not impossible that we shall, in the course of our travels, meet other intelligent creatures far more worthy than man to rule the universe.\\"I wonder if Van Vogt appreciated the irony in his own writing. Despite the obvious criticism of the human condition inherent in his character's words, Van Vogt persisted in writing stories in which every alien encounter failed to transcend that hostility and savagery and either began or ended with violent confrontation or battle. For the most part, the inhabitants of the Space Beagle barely even tried. Sigh!\\"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\\" is fun to read, entertaining and imaginative to be sure but not truly visionary and capable of lasting other than as a memento of what good space opera was like in the 50s! Recommended for lovers of classic science fiction.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"Let me say first that I'm the youngest and most eager Alfred Elton Van-Vogt fan I know.I'm 20 years old and so far I've read 11 &quot;Vogtians&quot; , and that's alot for someone in Israel - we don't have his books around.And ofcourse , everyone says that the &quot;Beagle&quot; is , if not the best , then one of the 3 best Van-Vogt novels.I disagree. O.k , the story is just too flat.

Van Vogt at his best, with the story of a major exploratory expedition and a young practitioner of a newly-developed science called Nexialism on board. Nexialism undertakes to combine the knowledges of the various branches of science and make something than is more than the sum of the parts, and Van Vogt provides an extremely cleverly-drawn summary of how this works under fire. As with several of his other books, its insight into social science is penetrating and original. The only minor drawback is the relatively two-dimensional characters, a feature quite common in older SF. But Van Vogt keeps the action coming and the narrative direct and absorbing. Even his not-so-great novels hold the reader's interest, and here he is in top form."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"This novel is a collection of four novellas that were originally published independently in various pulp magazines from the 30's to the 50's. This book contains four tales about the adventures of the crew of a star ship named the Space Beagle that travels to the far reaches of our galaxy and beyond. The ship is filled with a wide range of scientist from every major discipline (physicists, astronomers, geologists, chemists, biologists, etc.) as well as soldiers. The main character, Elliot Grosvenor, represents a new science/philosophy of Nexialism. This is a discipline that supposedly brings together all other disciplines but additionally provides a mechanism for viewing the totality of problems (kind of what Scientology purports to be). The science/philosophy of Nexialism is actually fairly well developed and represents one of the strengths of this book in my view. There really isn't a great deal of exploration (or even much voyaging) in these tales, in spite of the title. In each of the stories the ship is assailed by some alien menace that must be defeated. In all cases the threats initially appeared overwhelming, but were then defeated relatively simply. Much of the text is taken up discussing the internal political dynamics of the ship and the maneuverings of individuals and factions. The main interest in this story is, in my opinion, primarily historical. There are many details of the movie \`Alien' that are taken directly from one of the novellas in this series. There are definitely some imaginative ideas in this novel, but some of the physics is just nonsense. Overall this is a decent, but far from outstanding, book. This book is far less interesting than even the middlin' works of hard sci-fi greats such as Larry Niven or Arthur C. Clarke. It certainly does not merit some of the 5-star reviews given to it by other reviewers. It is a nice book to buy for $1 from a used book store, but I wouldn't recommend spending much more."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"Van Vogt combined four of his shorter stories into one novel, so although the novel publication dates lists 1950, parts were written in 1939 and 1943.

THE TERROR FROM OUT OF SPACE, which film inspired 1979's ALIEN film.The novel takes place in the far future. The Space Beagle is the first spaceship to travel to another galaxy. That's a pretty bold concept, if you understand astronomy. It's mind-boggling enough to think we'll ever span even our own galaxy, but the Space Beagle is traveling to another galaxy.The story takes place in that vast void between galaxies. The usual space opera/soap opera power plays aboard a spaceship on a voyage to discover new worlds. However, despite the distant future, people are pretty much like they were in the 1930s (kinda like how on STAR TREK they resemble 1960s people).Anyway, while they're traveling in that void between galaxies, they come upon a dragon-like monster floating in space. The monster is immortal, and cannot be destoyed. Doesn't need food or air. The author also describes what the monster is thinking. He was once a feared ruler of a galaxy, but is now exiled into space. He's indestructible, but he has a problem. Since he's got nothing to grab or propel himself again, he's doomed to float in the void unless something comes along, an astroid or whatever, that can take him back into a galaxy. Along comes the Space Beagle...So the crew sees the monster floating, they come up close, the monster grabs the spaceship and enters. (He can also float through matter, should he so desire, so at times he floats through the spaceship floors as a means of hiding from the crew), and the killing starts. The monster has contempt for these inferior humans. The humans must now trick the monster into leaving the ship.This monster tale only occupies about a third of the book. There are other adventures for the Space Beagle.The hero is a scientist who's invented a new dicipline: nexilism. It's the science of combining sciences (i.e., to find their nexus). In another story, he discovers a mind creature that has taken over an entire galaxy and killed all life in it.This is an okay book, interesting from a historical perspective, if you care about the inspiration of IT!, which inspired ALIEN! It's not a great book, IMO, but reasonably entertaining."},{"Title":"The voyage of the Space Beagle","review":"You hear that a lot. This is a classic, that is a classic. But this IS a classic.The Voyage of the Space Beagle is one of those books that have inspirited many later authors and movies. A. E. Van Vogt is one of the Fathers of modern Sci-Fi. While the Black Destroyer may, or may not, have inspirited the makers of the movie Alien I do know that two of the aliens in the book also show up in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials along side such great aliens as the Puppeteers, The Thing, the Overlords, the Guild Steersmen and the Old Ones.The book is four short stories put together. Or a novel that has been cut up into four short stories for other collections. But in the end this is the story of a huge spaceship on a deep space mission to explore and understand.

Though written in the 1920's, it does not feel dated, and its lessons and examples are still applicable today.The young character in the book, Bill Peck, has just returned from the war and is determined to get a job with the leading lumber company. He displays confidence, and that's the first lesson in the book. He refuses to take no for an answer when rejected by two of the top executives of the company. He takes his case directly to the founder of the company, who is impressed by his determination. Bill's confidence is demonstrated by the fact that he had his business cards printed before he had even spoken to the company.The second lesson is execution. Bill doesn't just throw out empty promises, but promptly delivers when turned loose in the field. It does not matter that he has been given an inferior, difficult to sell product. He finds a way to make it irresitible to his customers.Finally, the company's founder decides to give Bill the final test, asking him to \\"deliver the blue vase.\\" Bill shows his resourcefulness and refusal to quit in fulfilling this quest.Though you can knock this book out in just one sitting, its lessons will stay with you throughout your career."},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"It took me a few times to read the first chapter--I kept saying &quot;huh?&quot; (a weird opening) then finally got into it.

It hasn't been able to find a manager who will stick to his mandate once he is sent overseas and away from immediate supervision. The company needs a \\"go-getter\\", but how will it find one?Along comes Bill Peck, a war veteran who will not take \\"no\\" for an answer. He asks for a job, any job. The company relents and gives him a sales job, selling lumber that nobody in their right mind would want. He proves himself worthy by excelling in his sales position despite the odds. He is now ready for the ultimate test.From this point on, he encounters obstacle upon obstacle. As you read this story, consider at which stage you would give up. The Go-Getter displays just how much one person may accomplish if they decide to go beyond their usual point of giving up.Do you ever catch yourself saying, \\"I tried but...\\", \\"If only I had more time/money/resources...\\", \\"I'm just not good at...\\"?

This was the time when Tom Peters, fresh off his &quot;Excellence&quot; writings, was descending into his &quot;break all the rules&quot; type of exhuberant speechifying, and before &quot;business process reengineering&quot; hit the scene with Dr. Hammer, in suit and horn-rims from MIT. The Go Getter, by contrast, portrays a simpler, more direct world of business. You want the job? Pass this test.You only have one arm because the other one was blown off in WWI? Pass the test. No ADA type accomodating here, no &quot;norming&quot; of the test. And the guy does it. He goes on the wild goose-chase treasure hunt and locates the object defined as his goal: the blue vase. All to prove he's fit to represent his new employer in Shanghai.After hearing about business in China from a Chinese guy who shared our house in grad school, this seems like a good way to qualify for managing things over there. You want some guy spouting off about &quot;seeing the future first&quot; and making up slide shows? Or the relentless one-armed veteran who will stop at nothing to get the job done? If the job is all about moving lumber down rivers to be stacked and processed, doesn't sound too theoretical to me.So I like this book, and for several years forced summer law student clerks of our firm to read it, to disabuse them of the notion that practicing law is some lazy, sit around and blow air all day type of undertaking.

The guy clearly can sell ice cubes to Eskimos but as we go deeper into the story we find there's a bit of Joe Pesci's character in \\"Goodfella's\\" in him. To achieve his ends he bullies, threatens to beat the crud out of those who stand in his way, and at one point considers robbery to fulfill a promise to his boss.And I thought Kevin Trudeau was extreme.Stick with \\"A Message to Garcia\\". The Kindle edition will set you back $.95 but it has one thing going for it the other doesn't come close to: it's a classic of the genre.

I agree with some other reviewers that the language is a bit dated and can be confusing at some times. I had to re-read the first chapter because the language made it so hard to understand the story. Somewhere in the middle of the book, when we are introduced to Mr. Peck, is when the story takes off and it becomes a page turner till the end. Actually I ended up re-reading the book the next day and not only did I finish it faster, it made even more sense.After finishing this book, I immediately remembered times in my young life where I know I didn't give it my all on certain tasks or where I could have gone above and beyond what was required. I remember many times when I also just gave up. This book was inspiring and has given me a new outlook regarding my job and my life goals.

Lyon, Commander of the 65th Field Artillery Brigade, 40th Division, United States Army, which most likely influenced the story behind The Go-Getter: A Story That Tells You How to be One. Although the title sounds like a sales pitch, and possibly that may have been Kyne's intention, of selling one's self in any scenario, he tells convincing story that shows the power of first impressions.In order to understand this scenario, the story revolves around Alden P. Ricks, also known as Cappy Ricks and his lumber and logging company and his encounter with a go-getter that he described as anyone under 30 years old. And during the first few pages of the short story, the only man that he thought fit that trait was his son-in-law who he was seeking to fill a position at the company's Shanghai office. But little did he know that World War I veteran William E. Peck, a soldier who had list of unlikely circumstances after his service during the war, lost a part of his left arm, suffered a broken leg that was shorter than it should be, had a bout with pneumonia and influenza, and tuberculosis, would appear at his general office. And as he observed, illness did not stop Peck from pursuing his goal to land a job with Ricks's company. However, Rick and President of the company Mr. Skinner had something in mind to determine Peck's capability to prove his worthiness to the company. And as one reads Kyne's clever storyline, there is no denying how this narrative could have easily been included within the pages of a Dale Carnegie book.The title of the book indeed already gives the reader an idea what they may expect the storyline may be about. But that should not discourage anyone from delving into the pages of this very short story that tells an interesting perspective of how one man's persistence, logic, and common sense helped to influence his goal."},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"Great little book about old-fashioned values we seem to have lost.

Wodehouse of the same name and so to avoid confusion I found a couple of places that referenced this book by Kyne as Winning the Blue Vase. Other versions add the (original?) subtitle \\"A Story that Tells You how to Be One.\\"The book is a very short read (only about 70 pages) and our edition came with an afterword of another ~15 pages of commentary. The story is a parable/fable like tale. It tells the story of war veteran William \\"Bill\\" Peck and his efforts to get a job at a Logging & Lumber Company. The company is owned by \\"Cappy\\" Ricks but Cappy has delegated out normal management roles to two vice presidents. The book was written and is set in the time immediately following World War One.The book begins with Cappy berating his acting upper management team for their poor choices and their inability to find worthwhile employees. Shortly after that, Peck arrives on the scene asking Cappy for a job. However, he does more than just \\"ask\\" for a job. He comes to Cappy without an appointment and basically tells Cappy that Peck is the man for whatever job Cappy wants to throw at him. There are other details as well (Peck had already talked with the other vice-presidents and been turned down, he had a great working knowledge of Cappy's business, etc.) but the short of it is that Cappy is very intrigued by Peck and gives him a chance. However, at the same time, he makes the job as difficult as possible by giving Peck what is considered (as I understood it) the worst sales assignment in the company.I don't want to go through the whole plot with you (it's a short book...and it seems to be in the public domain if you want to read it online for free). But I will say what you've already guessed from the title of the book...Peck continues to impress Cappy and goes on to impress the other vice presidents. At which point, Cappy gives him \\"the test of the blue vase.\\" The test is a simple personal task that Cappy asks Peck to do, namely to go and purchase a blue vase from a shop window and bring it to Cappy. However Cappy throws all sorts of obstacles in the way to test Peck's ingenuity and resolve.The story is a cute little tale and it does include a number of quippy little comments that can be used as motivational blurbs. The afterward in my edition expounds on the concepts of the book in case you failed to make the leap from the fiction of the story to the moral and practical lesson it's trying to teach. The actual lesson being taught is actually fairly simple and straightforward on paper. It basically involves setting your eye on the prize and doing whatever it takes to get there. In addition it's the idea that you should go above and beyond just the status quo...that you should attempt to exceed expectations, not simply meet them (or worse, fail to meet them). When given an assignment, you should give it your all and do the best you can without excuses. When you see an opportunity, you should leap at the chance to stretch and grow even if it's outside your comfort zone or expertise.Bottom line (as I take it) you should not \\"settle\\", you should not \\"coast.\\" Life should always consist of your best effort, your best talent, your best energy. There will always be obstacles, sometimes more than others. Bill Peck's motto (as taught him by his general in the war) was \\"it shall be done.\\" Even if he'd never done it before or if nobody had ever done it before, he always went into a task that he could and would finish the task and no matter the obstacles, he continued trying to find a way to complete the task even when others may have given up. He continued after the blue vase even when everything was against him and his allotted time was up. And eventually, he succeeded.This is a fun little read and I can see the reason that employers might want their employees to read it. It's definitely a simple read with a simple message, but it's a worthwhile message.***3 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"I love this book.

The book runs along the lines of the \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" approach (though it was written in the 20's) of using a short story to explain a few very basic (though powerful) principles. This book really sums up the guiding principle of consulting: Even if you aren't sure you can do it, tell yourself that you can, figure out how to pull it off and execute (and don't give up). And above all...always go above and beyond what's expected - even if it's very painful to do so. A great little short story (though somewhat unrealistic - I don't know of any human being that would go to all of the trouble of the main character) that reminds us of what we can accomplish when our backs are against the wall and we never give up.

It is well written. It can be used in almost any setting to encourage the reader to accomplish what seems impossible to accomplish. I first heard the story 35 years ago and have told it at least one hundred times. I finally found the original source and purchased it. After reading it, I have already loaned it to others and encouraged them to buy and mark their own copy. It's a great book for business, for school officials, and just about any setting! Buy it and read it!"},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"Reading a book on leadership written about 80 years ago is an experience. While we all know that new advancements will lead to a need for new skills. This was true for all periods. The best part of The Go-Getter is its relevance for all ages.When I was reading the book for the first time without even referring to the period when it was written I felt that the author has used the lumber industry to indicate a generic pattern across industries. I felt its clear relevance in the software industry which is still in its adolescence globally.Go getter attitude will take us to reach any of our goals. This requires three important aspects - the ownership of the activity or problem, courage to handle it even without having the complete knowledge of the activity or the problem but have only broad guidelines and perseverance to withstand the hurdles come on the way in completing the tougher task on hand. The Go-Getter demonstrates the same very well. The blue vase test has opened some powerful insights in me and I should agree my thinking and attitude towards any activity I am looking at had been changed dramatically after reading this book.This book gives us great insights about making our own fortunes. There is a saying that the normal worker waits for the job description and the Go getter writes one and exceeds the same. This book offers motivation to look at opening doors(opportunities), finding ways to make way, take ownership, show perseverance, think laterally to find maximum alternatives on hand, respecting the designer/assigner of the job and his instincts and finally the strongest of the messages - It will be done attitude.A must read for the younger generation to learn how to find their way in the new executive jungle. Considering the economic growth majority of the economies are experiencing the managers are always flooded with priorities between managing growth vs creating supporting structures for planning further growth. The amount of time new age managers/leaders are spending on grooming and counseling the subjects has drastically come down and it is important that the subjects learn some life skills to sail through the tough waters. The Go Getter definitely offers the required life skill - being a Go Getter."},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"\\"The Go Getter\\" is a story about a one armed man who kicks ass at whatever he's asked to do. But before he's given the big promotion at his work, his bosses decide to test his mettle by giving him an impossible task. It's clear to me that this whole book is some melding of exaggeration and/or over-emphasis to make a point of how not to give up. At first I was put off by this, but soon realized that I was emotionally involved with the main character in the story. Since reading this book, I have found myself remembering the main characters example of what being a go getter is. No BS. It seems silly to even write it, but this book, even though probably not even a true story, makes me feel almost embarrassed about my procrastination issues. I'm almost hesitant to read read it again, until I've dealt with that. I recommend this book for any one's permanent library."},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"I read the Go Getter as my first e-book on Kindle.

The constant character catchphrases (see the title of this review), the \\"harrumphs\\", and I really thought the whole blue vase thing was kind of dumb. Why not give the poor guy a test that might actually enhance the company's bottomline, rather than tempt him to break a window in order to steal A STUPID BLUE VASE THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?

Its a quick read, read the whole thing in an hour or so. People are saying its one of the best books ever - agree to disagree. Sorry, but I got nothing out of it. Spoiler alert: its a story about an ex soldier who persistently applies for a job. Gets the job and is giving some fake ridiculous challenge to test how good he is. He meets the challenge, not thru anything extremely clever but thru some persistence. As another reviewer mentioned, several times thru the story he threatens violence - so the character loses the personable appeal you'd hope for a protagonist. The end. I dont get it.

Hired on by the crotchety Owner over the objections of his team, the war veteran is eventually given a trivial and unnecessary sham personal task by this Grand Old Man of the company. He handles it with the loyal determination you might expect of a good soldier in wartime, unaware that the task he has been given is the moral equivalent of a \\"join the club\\" fraternity hazing ceremony.Of course, the former dispatcher of German snipers succeeds (although only because he is able at the last minute to pawn a diamond-studded ring he kept as a souvenir of war, having removed it from the severed finger of one of the dead snipers), and is rewarded with the plum job, a demanding and highly paid posting to the Far East, presumably so highly paid because he will be selling off America's old growth forest treasure to the high-bidding Asians.The ideals set forth in The Go-Getter set aside all the progress and insights in business management in the last 50 years. Everyone's a critic, I know, but I'm nonetheless sure that both of my grandfathers, successful and modest businessmen of that era, would have been quite saddened to read of the unreasonable and inhuman behaviour depicted in this repulsive little short story."},{"Title":"The Go-Getter - A Story That Tells You How to be One","review":"This book was honestly the worst book I have ever tried to read.

It is interesting to read something written nearly 90 years ago and find some much that makes sense today. It is the story of an employee who is tested by his employer who gives him an impossible task just to see the mettle he is made of.My favorite quote is, \\"...esprit de corps doesn't bubble up from the bottom. It filters down from the top. An organization is what its commanding officer is--neither better nor worse.\\" Some things never change. I have seen this principle play out again and again in schools.I think a few more Go-Getters in the world will make it a better place to be.

Bill Peck and his \\"it shall be done\\" perseverance overcome doubts, tests and tribulations to ultimately find and deliver the ever-evasive blue vase.Deeper though, we learn the traits of a go-getter: passion, loyalty, personal responsibility and endurance. Character is everything, and having these traits engrained within our character is a recipe for success.Other themes surface as well. I particularly found deep meaning in the following:- We create our own opportunities in life, despite (and sometimes as a result of) numerous obstacles- We, and the people we work with, need to be tested for courage, drive and initiative- We must first \\"sell\\" ourselves (establish trust) before people will buy, or listen to, our offer- It's nearly impossible to reject a man who won't be rejected- We can demonstrate loyalty to ourselves and others by always following through on our word and promises- The quality of an organization is determined by the quality of its leader, it can never be better or worse.- Many laborers work to meet the terms of their job expectations. But the best laborers work to exceed them, treating every task as if it's their personal \\"blue vase\\" opportunity- Plan ahead for success by demonstrating a unique pattern of enthusiasm, commitment and customer loyalty- Great opportunities and growth come from realizing that the obstacle is the path. It's an attitude that sets the stage for achievement and purposeIn my personal and professional life, The Go-Getter reminds me to remain ambitious, hungry and to always persevere. Trials become opportunities for growth that enable me to experience a deeper, more poignant, heartfelt life. They compel me to expand and deepen, while reminding me to savor the relationships, simple moments and challenges that come my way.With that, I say, \\"Onward!

The second story in this volume was not good and I don't recommend it, but the book is worth buying for the titled piece."},{"Title":"The Evolution of North America","review":"In my opinion this is the best geological travel book ever written. At least it is for North America. If you want to really understand the basic geology of the country that you are traveling through, from the North West Territories to the Yucatan, then this book is for you. Several decades ago, this was my college textbook for Geology of the U.S. In my opinion there has never been a better single text written to take its place. King was an old time classical field geologist- he knows this continent like the back of his hand. I usually just leave it in my suit case as a permanent reference.The basic organization of this book is as follows: 1)The Natural History of the Continents, 2) The Canadian Shield, 3) The Interior Lowlands, 4) Appalachian and related Systems, 5) Lands and Seas South of the Continent, 6) The Cordilleran System, 7) The Eastern Ranges and Plateaus, 8) The Main Part of the Cordillera,and 9) Later Modifications of the Cordillera including the Coast Ranges.The real strength of the book is the many extremely well-done maps and cross-sections. There is even a full fold-out geological map of all of North America in the back of the book- along with a full index."},{"Title":"The Evolution of North America","review":"I read the 1977 edition when it was recently published and learned a lot of geology along the way. It is organized to take us from the oldest geology to the newest. By covering the material in this way King shows us how the continent evolved while taking us on a complete tour. I could never get through a geology textbook, but the story King told held my interest all the way though this one. I still have my heavily-annotated copy, and I recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The Evolution of North America","review":"I have to agree with oakshaman--this is one of the best books on the geologic evolution of North America that I've come across. First published in 1959, the edition that I own does not deal with plate tectonics (a subject that was hotly debated at the time, and generally not taken very seriously), so at least some of the continent-building forces that elude King have since been identified. Nonetheless, this book is still a wonderful introduction to the landforms of North America. As oakshaman notes, the maps and geologic cross-sections are particularly informative. Any books on the subject published since this volume came out build on the solid foundation that Philip B. King laid so many years ago."},{"Title":"The Evolution of North America","review":"I read the first edition of Philip B. King's \\"The Evolution of North America\\" 38 years ago when I took a course in \\"Tectonics\\" from John W. Shelton as a graduate student at Oklahoma State University. I reread it in the second edition (which contains an outline of plate tectonics) a few years later while I was in industry. I reread the book again in 1990 when I was putting together a course in historical geology at University of Missouri-Rolla. I purchased copies for two of my children when they graduated (as newly minted geologists) from college. In my opinion this is the best written book on the subject of geology that has ever been published. Philip B. King was arguably the greatest field geologist of the 20th century and had a wealth of experience that he shares in a relaxed, conversational tone. The book reads like a novel; it is as though he is in the room talking to you! King's illustrations are classic and in some respects \\"fine art\\". I was told by geologists who knew him (unfortunately I never met Dr. King) that he would sit on outcrops for hours making sketches, many of which ended up as illustrations in this book. Even though the book is in many respects dated, it still contains a great wealth of observations and data that are as important today as they were 40 years ago. So if you are a geologist and have never read \\"The Evolution of North America\\", it is time that you did. If you are just an interested non-geologist, you will enjoy the book too. It does not require specialized training to read this book."},{"Title":"The Rotten Romans","review":"The Rotten Romans is a really good book if you're learning about ancient Rome, or anytime you need a good book. It makes jokes (&quot;Dad's mad, Blad&quot;) and gives interesting information you don't find anywhere else (Did you know the Celts admired their hair so much that they didn't wear helmets in battle?). It tells stories and has made-up diaries of a warrior. It is a really funny book, and if you liked it, there are lots and lots of other Horrible Histories. There's the Awesome Egyptians, Measly Middle Ages, Vicious Vikings, and Groovy Greeks. There are also Vile Victorians, Angry Aztecs, Terrible Tudors, and Blitzed Brits (not available online).

They really draw you into their world and you feel as if you are going back in time to the streets of Rome under Caligula's rule and feel like a Roman.

It has a timeline, facts about Roman life in Britain, including the food, leaders, games, and so on. And it is also very funny.Some people question the history, but the funny thing is that history changes. For example, thumbs down was thought to mean kill him, and thumbs up let him live. Then it was decided that thumbs up meant kill him - stick the sword up into his ribs - and thumbs down meant let him live - put him back into the tunnels and cells under the circuses. NOW it has been decided that forefinger up means let him live and thumbs down, with palm open means kill him - the sword placed under the chin and thrust downwards into the ribs and heart.

This was then let sit for several months.Sounds disgusting, doesn't it?We know all this because there are recipes in a cookbook that is ascribed to a chap called Apicius and another guy by the name of Pliny wrote a huge encyclopedia where he says brand such-and-such is best. Unfortunately the author fails to mention that.(By the way, Maggi seasoning is made by putting soybean protein and salt in a large vat and forgetting about it for several days. No fish.)Things are never put into proper perspective, presumably because the author is afraid of spoiling the fun. Science isn't fun, it isn't meant to be fun. Science demands careful thought.

This book is aimed at the person who is apprehensive about going to the dentist. Based on the premise that most fear is of the unknown, Dr. Mac Lee, Joleen Jackson and Vicki Audette have written this book with the aim of demystifying dentistry.Speaking personally, I know that sometimes I struggle to explain things that to me make perfect sense in a nontechnical, nonthreatening manner. This book does that.It starts by discussing common reasons people are afraid to go to the dentist and tries to help get you past those fears. Whether you are afraid it'll hurt, or your embarassed for us to see your teeth, Dr. Lee gives tips on how to get past these feelings so that you can get the dental care you need.The book goes on to describe various dental procedures, what is involved in them, and questions you should ask. I especially like the section on children's dental needs. It covers every age range and answers common questions about subjects such as baby teeth, braces, and broken teeth.I can't tell you how strongly I feel that this is a great book for any dental consumer.

A well-educated, talented and confident dentist welcomes any patient questions. We know that the better informed our patients are, the better choices they can make for themselves regarding their dental health.This book is a milestone in bridging the gap between dentists and their patients. I give it to all my new patients and encourage them to spread the word to everyone they know. Mac and Joleen have helped not only the general public, but also the dental community with the publication of their informative book.

The book is translated with help from the traditionalist Greek Orthodox Christian theologian Philip Sherrard, who himself was an early follower of Rene Guenon (a convert to Islam and founder of the Traditionalist School). The book is published by the Institute for Ismaeli Studies based in London, which attempts to examine the esoteric and gnostic tradition within the theological and religious heritage of Islam. The book is divided into two parts splitting up the tradition with the death of Averroes. The first section of the book is devoted to showing the uniqueness of the Quran as the primary study tool for Islamic philosophers. Indeed, interpretation of the Quran, and mystical interpretation of the hadith or tradition, plays an essential role in the understanding of Islamic mysticism. For Muslims, there is no Magisterium (teaching authority) as there is for Christians residing in the Church. Thus, interpretation of the Quran is subject to various rules and methods for doing so. The author next includes sections dealing with Shiism and the Prophetic Philosophy (which involves interpretation of the Twelver Imams, gnosis, and Ismaelism), Sunni philosophy, Philosophy and the Natural Sciences (including mention of alchemy, astrology, and hermeticism), Hellenizing philosophers (including Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali - all of whom imported Plato and Aristotle to Islamic monotheism), the unique tradition of Sufism, a special section dealing with Al-Suhrawardi and the Philosophy of Light and his Illumination, and a section dealing with Andulasia ending with Averroes. Throughout this discussion of the various traditions within Islam we see the influence of gnosticism as well as of the other Abrahamic religions and \\"peoples of the Book\\" (Jews, Christians, and Muslims), and the influence of Zoroastrianism (with its dualistic worldview), as well as the influence of even Hinduism and Buddhism to a lesser extent. The book concludes with the modern period after the death of Averroes of Islamic philosophy including reference to Sunnis, Sufis, and Shiites. Indeed, for the author Shiism and Sufism seem to play an especial role in his understanding of the uniqueness of Islamic philosophy. In sum, this book offers a very good introduction to Islamic philosophy and its history from an esotericist's perspective. Metaphysics is too often cast aside in the West; however, by importing the rich metaphysical traditions from the East which often include original Greek elements, such as the Islamic tradition, a proper restoration of this ancient philosophical discipline can be attained. If you are interested in Islamic mysticism and metaphysics in particular you might want to also consult the works of Seyyed Hossein Nasr as well as anything issuing from the Traditionalist School (originally founded by such individuals as Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon)."},{"Title":"History of Islamic Philosophy","review":"A very informative and easy to read book. Author does a good job intoducing his readers to a wide range of thinkers in the Islamic world. Recommend it as a text book for serious students of religion and philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Islamic Philosophy","review":"This is by far the best work of its kind. If you aren't familiar with Henry Corbin, start with some of his other, more popular works, and then come back to this. It's key to understanding the scope of this book.Henry Corbin comes from the Traditionalist School (along with Frithjof Schuon, Martin Lings, Huston Smith, Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non, Seyyed Hossein Nasr , et al) and this influences his perspective. This is not a negative thing as it does help in presenting an \\"alternative\\" Islam that is beautiful, profound and filled with wisdom, a far cry from the Islam portrayed in more \\"popular\\" media today. He has found that the esoteric (batin) Islam, especially as manifest in Shi'ite and, in particular, Isma'ili Shi'ite Islam continues a long line of \\"gnostic\\" truth that gets lost in the more orthodox, exoteric approach to faith. This colors his emphasis and is key to accepting this book as it it.Respecting this, the book takes you on an in-depth journey through Islamic (not Arabic) philosophy. Philosophy and Islam? Yes, it does have a history in Islam and yes, it continues to exist. Islam is not a monolith and there are more alternatives to it than the legalistic and/or Rumi versions so popularized in the mainstream. It has been through many schools and many variations as it made its way across the globe, colored, as it is by influences, both theological and cultural. Corbin tackles this broad subject brilliantly.There are other \\"historical\\" books on philosophy in Islam and these may be beneficial in providing a more \\"traditional\\" view of the subject but Corbin presents an Islam worthy of study. While it may not be your imam's Islam it may just be the Islam of the Imam of your own being.Highest recommendation.If you don't want to pay a crazy price for the book do a search for amiscorbin and look under textes (I'd put the actual site but *()@#&% amazon keeps deleting the *(&*((@) address...).You can find parts 1 and 2 gratis along with Cyclical Time and Ismaili Gnosis."},{"Title":"History of Islamic Philosophy","review":"This is an excellent sourcebook for serious study of Islamic Philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Islamic Philosophy","review":"I like to find its English Translation for my children.

I wonder if the author was paid by someone in that region to write this book."},{"Title":"Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art","review":"This book attempts to redress the fact that cinematographers tend to be underrated, even invisible, in the making of films. Even though they are &quot;below-the-line&quot; contractors (they don't participate in the profits of the project), the DP is responsible for the entire look of the show. Rarely are they acknowledged, let alone celebrated alongside Directors or Actors.Author Pauline Rogers has been a staff writer for International Cinematographer, the monthly magazine of the IATSE local 600 Guild, for over 10 years and as such has enjoyed access to many sets and conversations with many cinematographers. This then is a distillation of her work, containing thirteen in-depth interviews with individual DP's.Feature Film DP's Dean Cundey (Apollo 13), Donald Burgess (Forest Gump), Roger Deakins (Fargo), Stephen Goldblatt (Batman and Robin), Emmanuel Lubezki (The Birdcage) and Thomas Ackerman (Jumanji), join TV DP's John Bartley (X-Files), Jo Mayer (Good Morning America), Donald A. Morgan (Home Improvement) and Donald M. Morgan (Geronimo), and SFX DP Dennis Muren (Star Wars), Aerial DP David Nowell (Jurassic Park) and Music Video DP Salvatore Totino.The mix is good. I've read a lot about feature film guys, perhaps most notably in the 1984 book &quot;Masters of Light&quot;, but little of contemporary shooters and even less from those working in TV or second-unit and special effects. All have interesting stories of how they got their career breaks and moved up through the ranks, telling interesting anecdotes on how the industry has changed as they go. Many offer technical tips, along with &quot;how we did it&quot; notes from their projects.If you like reading technical &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; interviews such as those found in the cinematography magazines, if you like photography and film-making in general, you'll like this book. If there is one coda (and why I give it 4 out of 5 stars), it is that the book seems to have been sloppily edited. This is perhaps understandable given that these are interviews assembled from a number of sessions, probably casual conversations recorded on tape, and which haven't made the translation to print quite as well as they might have. Still, this is a minor point ... both this and the follow-up second book are well worth the cheap price."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In this novel, set in communist China, the main character is a doctor who wishes to end his arranged marriage to his plain but virtuous wife. He wishes to marry the woman he works with whom he and all his associates view as his girlfriend, but, due to strict communist guidelines, is more like a platonic friend. Over the course of 18 years, they wait for him to get a divorce. By the time he is allowed to get one, none of the characters are really sure what they have been waiting all of these years for. He marries his girlfriend, only to become disillusioned that, now in her 40s, she is no longer the fresh young woman he desired. Now, as his new wife is dying of heart disease and he has the care of his infant twins, he longs for the simplicity and comfort of his first family. As the book ends, he has his first wife and daughter waiting for him, even as he decides that perhaps he never wanted to be married at all! This is a very passive and emotionally depressed man who effectively ruins the lives of the women around him. The real question left unanswered is why they wait for him at all?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The story was introduced well. The characters were well filled out. The language and dialogue felt authentic. The sense of place in China felt real. The book was well plotted. I enjoyed the book all the way through, but at the end of the book it just felt flat. I'm fascinated by China and went there this spring and felt that the book captured the feel and rhythm of China authentically. Unlike many of the other reviewers I felt the book moved fast enough, but not too fast. Maybe I was expecting to much in the American big finish kind of way. Maybe I was just disappointed that Lin finally got what he was waiting for and still wasn't happy."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I picked up this book in an airport because the cover not only showed the National Book Award seal, but it promised &quot;a suspenseful and bracingly tough-minded love story.&quot; What a disappointment! There was nothing tough-minded about any of the main characters, and the only suspense I experienced was whether the plot would ever pick up and whether I'd be able to finish the book. The plot finally picked up in the last fourth of the book, but at that point the characters were so dislikable and I was so tired of waiting myself...waiting for something to happen...waiting for some suspense...waiting for at least one character to become likable (Shuyu did for a while, but at the end she disappointed me) ...waiting to finish this book so I could start a new one.I was also disappointed in the writing style;I felt it was written at a 6th-grade reading level and was annoyed by the overuse of the phrase &quot;How come...&quot;Unlike the other readers, I didn't find this book particularly rich in its setting of the Cultural Revolution. I think the book _Becoming Madame Mao_ accomplished this much better."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin again proves that a book need not be filed with fifty cent words to be excellent reading.It's just everybodys speed!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I actually read this book while I myself was waiting - in a hotel in Guatemala to meet the son I was to adopt! Like most of the other reviewers, this book was a disappointment to me. Interestingly enough, it is the first book I've ever read which was written in English, but the style makes you think it was translated from Chinese. The best part of the book is that it offers a rare view of day-to-day life in China during a terrible period. In addition, the descriptions are quite beautiful; rendered in a rich, yet delicate manner. And I was thrilled that the author made the wife out to be a decent human being, and not some shrew. However, the plot just doesn't deliver. Even though the idea of it is quite staggering -here is this man waiting for almost 20 years to marry this woman - there is really very little dramatic content. Events just happen quietly, unfolding as if you were watching clouds move in the sky. Why it won the National Book Award is beyond me."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'm afraid that Mr. Ha Jin doesn't quite know how to write good English prose. The plot, although potentially delicious in a minimalist way (the book is quite literally about waiting) is underserved by his style. There are few authors who could write sparely and get away with it, e.g. Hemingway. Not Ha Jin, mainly because he just isn't that great, but also because he hasn't even nailed basic English language usage. On page 179 Ha misuses \\"bisexual\\" to mean \\"hermaphrodite\\"; on page 296 he forgets to translate the Chinese for \\"idiot\\" and leaves it in literal translation as \\"stupid egg\\". I don't really care about the exotic terrain: it isn't exotic enough to me (I'm from China and am quite familiar with life and culture under Chinese communism) to redeem the other, glaring flaws within this book. Perhaps after a few more English immersion courses Ha Jin will manage to write something that deserves the National Book Award. In the meantime don't bother reading this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting by Ha Jin is a tale set in China. It is story that stretches from the 1960s to the 1980s. The author presents a powerful story that tests the word love and documenting the that is evaporating feelings over time. Lin Kong is not a traditional man and he doesn't want to be trapped in the \`old' Chinese way. However, he is unable to live the \`new' Chinese way because he is trapped in an arranged marriage. While working for the Chinese army, Lin Kong met the love of his life, Man-na. Because he is still married, Lin Kong is unable to fulfill the love Manna needed. Each year, for eighteen years, Lin Kong went back to court and tries to divorce his wife, but each year he returned to Manna as a married man. Finally, Lin Kong's wish came true and he is able to marry Manna. However, living happily forever is far and remote. The stressful affair has stood up to the test of time, but the love is flushed away without a trace. At the end, all Lin Kong wishes for is peace and quiet."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I had had this book on my shelf for a while and because of all the awards it had won, I had high expectations. They were not met.The story is set in 1960s-1980s China which is post-revolutionary Red China. Lin Kong is a doctor in an army hospital, with a wife from an arranged marriage and a daughter. The hospital is in a city near Lin Kong's village. He leaves his wife and daughter in the village and only goes home once a year on leave. He does not love his wife and every summer when he comes home, he tries to get a divorce. Every summer for 20 years, his wife agrees to the divorce, but once they get to court she changes her mind.There is another woman, a nurse at the hospital, whom Lin Kong wishes to marry. She waits for him throughout the 20 years. Since morality is very strict under the communist regime, they have no physical relationship. This goes on for a good third of the book, so the reader is waiting as well and yes, that is as uneventful as it sounds.Finally the divorce is granted, the frustrated lovers marry and then their troubles really begin. They have a child, the wife becomes clingy and neurotic and Lin Kong does not really have the knack of being a husband. He had moved the ex-wife to the city after the divorce, which leads to an ironic ending that is actually good, but geez, I waited 300 pages for this?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Well, I was &quot;waiting&quot; for the characters to mature and find their meanings in life. I was disappointed by Lin's weak person and flakiness. He was selfish and immature his entire life. Manna acted like a silly woman with no self-respect. The only person I liked was Shuyu. At least she had some purpose in her being. The story overall was good, but the characters were unrealistic."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a very nice read, very peaceful, very simple. It's clear the writer's first and most natural language is not english. He writes simply but, in a way, also very rigidly. He's got a kind of formula. A little dialogue and then he sprinkles in some scene description, usually of trees.Also, positive reviewers love the phrase \\"against the backdrop of communist china\\" and \\"you learn so much about communist china\\". The truth is, you don't. His discriptions of the hospital are sketchy at best. You'll learn more in five minutes on wikipedia.This was a beach read, a little sad, a little corny, easy to swallow in a few bites. To pretend it's anything more than that is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Ha Jin's descriptive language throughout the book helped me get an image in my head. I just don't understand how one woman could give up her whole life just to wait for another woman's husband. I do give Manna credit for kepping her hopes alive and never giving up on love. I do believe that this book could have benn continued. Overall i think that this was a good book and it taught me a lot about the Chinese culture. Ha Jin is a great writer and I am glad that i got a good book to read for my book review. it kept my attention all the way through it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. It was a quick and easy read. Ha Jin wrote a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is beautiful. Its descriptions of the characters, the setting, and the times paints vivid pictures in the reader's mind. Although I could see where the writer was headed as the book came to a close, the ending was still a surprise. (I felt the ending was too abrupt, in addition to the content of the ending.)I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading fiction."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is definitely one of those novels where you learn quite a bit about how Chinese men view women. Although it's a love story, I think many American women would never call what this man feels LOVE. He is so much more concerned with physical beauty and what others think that he doesn't always convince you that it's true love. But regardless of his shortcomings, I think that this book gives real insight into the Chinese culture during this time and I love learning about that in particular. Another favorite of mine is Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"After much anticipation I finally got ahold of this book and began reading. Shortly into the story I realized it wasn't worth waiting for. What a disappointment. The main characters did not garner my sympathy for their situation, only pity for their lack of action. I thought the story boring and couldn't wait to put it back on the shelf."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This title is so fitting as I &quot;waited&quot; all through this book. I &quot;waited&quot; to see where the story was going, then &quot;waited&quot; for something to happen, and &quot;waited&quot; to find a character I even liked. (I think that character must have been Shuyu as Lin was nothing but a wimp and Manna needed to &quot;get a life&quot;). Then I couldn't &quot;wait&quot; to get to the end of the book!!I loved &quot;being in China&quot; and learning of how it must have been during the cultural revolution, but as for the rest of the story........DISAPPOINTED......"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The novel was a huge disappointment. Dramatically overrated by the critics and tough to slog through, despite the relatively easy writing style. I didn't warm to any of the characters and ultimately found myself just reading for plot, to see when their waiting, and mind, would be over."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I am an avid reader who usually reads very rapidly, but I had to slog my way through this book. I am astounded that it won the National Book Award. I did not find it &quot;well-written&quot;. In fact, I frequently found the sentence construction awkward. I agree with one reviewer who found it &quot;bland&quot;--I found it both bland and ponderous. There is only one likeable character in the whole book and that is Shuyu. It does provide an interesting insight on life in China in the latter part of the 20th century, but for me this book does not compare with a book such as Tsukiyama's &quot;The Samurai's Garden&quot;. Different books for different folks..."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I once saw a movie titled \\"Momento\\". It's about a man with short-term memory problem. The scenes were shown backwards, confusing the heck out of me, giving me a headache like you wouldn't believe. It was as if I had amnesia!I'm not as advanced a novel reader as most of the reviewers here appear to be.I can't remember why I decided to buy this book. The only fiction I enjoy is short stories. I don't have the patience to read any story longer than 50 pages. Maybe I wanted to try something different.I absolutely hated the pace of the book. I hated the characters. I hated their inaction. I hated how they allowed their lives to be taken over by fate and chance, and did nothing significant to change them! What I hate most was how it affected my commute over a three-week period. (It's when I read the book, about 45 minutes each direction, making the agony seemed prolonged...) It made me antsy, more impatient, and angry. I found myself anticipating for something exciting to happen, anything!The WAITING made me feel miserable......What a ride!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"It is such a beautiful, moving character study. Ha Jin has a very subtle way of using ordinary life events to build tension. It is interesting, as a reader, to be kept on edge by something other than the threat of violence or the possibility of sex. This book is very true and very touching. I'm going to recommend it a lot."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Story of a man torn between his arranged marriage wife who has been devoted to him and his lover who he is in love with. The book is pretty good and really puts you in the footsteps of this man torn and indecisive. I felt the environment of the story set in China added to the story greatly - making the situation more believeable than other settings."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a beautifully written story of the bitter love between Lin, a doctor and officer in a Chinese army hospital, and Manna, a modern nurse and Lin's coworker. Lin's pathetic attempts to sever his marriage of duty to Shuyu, the simple countrywoman with bound feet who was chosen for him by his parents, foretell his feeble nature.The beauty of the story is in the detail given to the characters and a sense of time, place, and history. What I liked about it: how easily the descriptions of a culture so foreign to me blended with the storytelling. I came to know the characters whether I liked them or wanted to bonk them on the head, and I cared what ends they would meet. It wasn't a tearjerker - I normally cry when reading even a bad love story. This time I didn't. Perhaps I was associating with the unemotional Lin and by the end I was too angry with him to sympathize.What bothered me about the story: I was saddened by both Lin and Manna's weakness time after time, and I even thought I wouldn't bother finishing the book. Yet, as the lives of the women hurt by Lin's \\"loyalty\\" crossed, I had to find out how it would be resolved. I couldn't imagine how it might have a happy ending. And I'm still not sure it does."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book was an easy read. It was a breeze to go through the pages because it was written well. I was fascinated and a little engrossed about the two women in this story, each representing two very different China. I was a little impatient with the male character, and ended up wishing that he had more backbone. I did not relate to him at all and felt trapped in the story because he was the hero.The plot itself is a little weak for my taste and the ending a little predictable. But overall, I appreciated the cultural detail and the beautiful way that it was written."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Understanding this book requires accepting a different view of living. The book hits on two levels. One is a reflection of daily life in Mainland China. A life where, since the 60's, so much attention is needed to live from day to day that international events are not much on the minds of the people. A society in which the communists have leveraged the bureaucratic way of life in a manner much the same as the prior dynasties.The other level of the book is the story of the characters and how their faults, frailties and personalities blend into well told tale. Waiting is a description of the modus operandi of the main character. Even if you don't like the person, the prose is exceptional and the story appealing.I can't profess to understand the Chinese mind any more than any other anglo can. But I do recognize that this book provides a subtle view of that mind in a well written style. A recommended read to anyone interested in trying to understand a life style totally differnet than their own."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has written an interesting love story of a Chinese doctor in an arranged loveless marriage who falls in love and wants to marry a nurse. His wife must either agree to a divorce or by law, he must &quot;wait&quot; 18 years to have the divorce granted by the government. His very old world wife will not grant him the divorce, so he spends the years waiting in a chaste love affair with the nurse. This novel, though beautifully and eloquently written, would have made a much better short story or novella. Though the exploration of the struggle between contemporary and traditional values and the politics of modern China were compelling, I found myself &quot;waiting&quot; for the book to end. This is a love story with an interesting twist but an expected. I don't understand why this book won the National Book Award."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Like a good commercial teaser, the plot is interesting enough to got me to buy the book. But after reading it, then I realize how empty and cheap the story is.First, to rationalize the dislike of Lin Kong to his parents arranged wife Shuyu, the author has to make Shuyu weathered and un-attractive (OK), but with Bound Feet? Come on!! Since the story was set in 60s, 70s, and earlier 80s, Shuyu's feet had to be bound the earliest in the middle of 1940. That is almost impossible, for by then the practice has been formally banned for almost half a century. If the story is set in the early 50s, there might be a remote chance of wife of bound feet. But then, the period would not be first hand with the author's own experience.Second, the main frame of divorcing process between Lin Kong and Shuyu is another trick. For anyone who is familiar with the marriage law and common practice of China during 50s and early 60s, will know that an Army Officer can easily abandon his rural wife by just declaring that \\"the marriage is family arranged\\" regardless the opinions of the wife. Countless of rural wives (mostly with unbound feet) were rightly devoiced by countless Army Officers this way, when the latter moved into the city and falls in love (seems naturally) with some middle or high school graduated girls - the so called modern women of the time.Thus, the whole story falls apart."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"How can anyone call this even interesting writing? Manna and Lin, the protagonists, are two petty-minded, weak people who, to put it bluntly, deserve all their sufferings. To the misled readers, life is much more interesting in China, in reality or in fiction. Even under the most severe circumstances in that totalitarian state, people have been more adventurous, more courageous and have had more fun than those two losers. Up to page 185, this is a depressing, dreadful, slow-death-evoking tale. But I shall read on just to prove myself wrong. I am not holding my breath.Suggested antidotal reading: Wang Shuo's &quot;Playing for Thrills&quot; or &quot;Please Don't Call Me Human&quot;"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Although there is some stunning prose in the book that is simple and profound in its wisdom, the language doesn't make up for unlikeable characters, slow moving plot and odd dialogue. The book reads as if it was translated which is wasn't. I enjoyed the glimse into the Chinese culture, but it was really hard to care about Manna or Lin, the main characters. By the end I didn't care what happened to either one of them. I enjoy reading books that are slower in pace (I loved Plainsong) but no book can get away with a thin plot and characters that are hard to root for. Waiting decades to get married only to be disatisfied with the marriage and want to end it. That's life I guess, but hardly the payoff the reader expects. We've struggled through all their tedious trials and tribulations only to have Lin realize he might have been better off with his now ex-wife. Hard to like the guy."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Several years ago, I stumbled upon Ha Jin's collection of short stories, &quot;Under the Red Flag&quot;, winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction in 1996. The stories, set in China at various times during the Cultural Revolution, were remarkable for their crystalline pure prose, realistic attention to detail and depiction of the intersection of the personal and the political in the quotidian lives of their characters. From that first reading, Ha Jin struck me as perhaps the finest prose stylist writing in English today.Ironically, Ha Jin was illiterate in his own Chinese language until his mid-teens, when he began reading voraciously while serving in the Chinese army on the Russian border. It was not until the age of twenty that Jin began studying English and, twelve years later, in 1988, began writing in English. By that time, Jin had completed graduate study at Brandeis University and, in the wake of the events at Tiananmen Square, emigrated to the United States. While Ha Jin's prose is remarkable for its austere beauty, and his themes are universal and set in the ordinary, everyday lives of his characters, the setting of his fictions remains exclusively and particularly Chinese.&quot;Waiting&quot;, Ha Jin's second novel, tells the story of an eighteen year love triangle among Lin Kong, a doctor in Muji City, his loyal, but illiterate wife, Shuyu, and his educated and urbane mistress, the nurse Manna Wu. Kong lives and works apart from his wife, in a hospital in Muji City, where he meets Manna Wu. Each year, for eighteen years, Kong returns to the country to visit his wife and to request a divorce so he can marry Manna Wu. Each year Kong's wife, whose bound feet are a sign of her rural backwardness, refuses to consent to his request. It is a simple story told in simple prose. Set during a period from the early 1960s until the 1980s, &quot;Waiting&quot; is a realistic and human tale of relationships set against the backdrop of Chinese culture and society during the years of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. Marked by Ha Jin's remarkable attention to the details of everyday life, &quot;Waiting&quot; is a sparkling gem of a novel, a deserving winner of both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is an interesting view into archaic although recent Chinese society. It's pretty slow going and the reader is left waiting for something to happen for the main characters the first third of the book. Things do get interesting towards the end, however by then I wasn't rooting for them anymore."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"just read the prologue and you've got the whole story. If you want to immerse yourself in Communist China through the 50s and 60, there is a certain value in the story. There are many little surprises about life in that culture. But if you expect to connect with the characters and fall in love with the love story like you may have with Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth [parts of which are still with me after fifty years] then you are in for a disappointment."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is unexpectedly simple and beautifully written. A must read for anyone who likes to read on human nature."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I read this book in three sessions. This past summer was the first session, where I got through part 1 and most of part 2, in a weekend with Waiting as my only source of reading, I finished part 2. Two nights ago, I started Part 3 after Montaigne made my eyes hurt, and was finished by sunrise. I may have forgotten a lot of the beginning details, but I remember the laconic pace necessary to drag out the years of rejected divorces. The crowing between Lin and Manna became boring; I no longer cared whether or not they got married. I can't imagine writing the first two parts, not counting the enchanting prologue, was fun for Ha Jin. Politics is brushed past, unlike the Amazon reviewer I thought the commentary sat next to the story, we could draw our own judgements about the politics of the camp, I tried to focus on the characters, which is probably why I was often bored.Part 3 is only good because you've waited through parts 1 and 2. Instead of growing wiser with their age, Manna, Lin, and Shuyu (his embarassing village wife) remain embedded in their stubborn convictions - Manna and Lin's unconjugated love becomes as arbitrary as the descriptions of Chinese propoganda. Jin's description of Shuyu touched me and brought the book to life for me. Her simplicity made the austere love life of Lin and Manna look hedonistic. Shuyu is the character best portrayed, especially when Jin takes her from the subsistence life in the village to the more modern city compound where Lin and Manna live. Her bound feet clatter through the courtyard where everyone knows who she is. Jin often paints an abhorrent picture of Chinese people. They are so repressed they need to purge their thoughts through gossip and slander. The women all come off as petty, image-conscious, all with streaks of martyrdom."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I liked the book for the first 200 pages, then began wondering what the fuss was all about. It was an interesting study on Chinese culture and mores. I liked the characters, but felt the last 1/3 of the book was disappointing, especially the ending. The characters themselves were intriguing, but the plot could use some development."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I tried but there was not enought plot for me. The author drew the characters very well. I also liked the atmosphere of the story but in the end I was bored."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I purchased this book to read for a book club I have recently joined. In the beginning, I wondered about the characters, but soon grew bored of the relationships. The \\"waiting\\" that Lin experienced was cowardly and did not gather any sympathy from this reader. Manna's love and willingness to \\"wait\\" grew to be a pathetic desire for a union that was not based on real feelings. I thought the rape scene was extremely graphic and unnecessary use of language...to the point of almost not finishing the novel. I did finish it, against my better judgement, only to be continually disappointed. I am looking forward to hearing from the other members of the book club..."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book would have been vastly improved by being written in Chinese and then translated by a competent translator. While Ha Jin usually writes in competent English, it is seldom lyrical and more often clunky. His command of idiom is weak and his dialog in particular is utterly unnatural. The story I felt was engaging enough, but really I was not all that impressed and I can't help but wonder whether the good press this book has received is not due to an anti-Communist perspective popular here in the States rather than the intrinsic merit of the book. However, I did think his portrayal of life in China and continued attitudes of Chinese toward family and marriage was accurate and perceptive."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Criticism of Ha Jin's writing by the Chinese reviewer from Boston seems excessive; yet, I agree with his basic observations. Ha Jin's writing style and use of the English language hardly seems award winning caliber. In fact, my first impression, as I began to read Waiting, was that the translation was pitifully weak. Then, I realized my mistake: the book was not translated; Ha Jin, a professor of English at Emory, wrote the story in English.It is difficult to understand why a college English professor, writing a serious novel, would use countless trite and hackneyed phrases such as: &quot;Mama ran into Gang Yen&quot; and &quot;How come he was so benign...&quot;Ha Jin's writing style seems to be directed towards the 10 to 12 year old reader. However, to be fair, he periodically displays flashes of good writing with plausible metaphors and descriptive passages.Coincidentally, similar inconsistencies, though to a lesser degree, are found in other Asian writers who seem to be straddling a fence between greatness and mediocrity, however, unfortunately, leaning precariously towards mediocrity. Two notable examples: Jung Chang, author of Wild Swans, born in China, now living and teaching in London; and Haruki Murakami, a prominent Japanese writer, author of The Wind-up Bird Chronicle which was translated in English. With some polish and effort, they, perhaps, can leap the fence to greatness.Ha Jin, Like Chang and Murakami, ostensibly has the innate ability to write well but needs refinement. In Waiting, he tells a story with meaning and thought as well as a reasonable plot to hold the reader's interest. And yet, I found Waiting to be tiresome. The title may be a warning to me. Beware of &quot;waiting&quot; titles. As with Waiting For Godot, I grew tired of waiting...and waiting...and waiting."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"After all the hype and hoopla surrounding this book -- I finally succumbed. I would have put it down immediately, if not for the the prize it had received. I kept hoping... well, entirely in vain, there was nothing there. It was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a book I hhad been wanting to read for a long time and finally managed to complete while waiting out the last days of my pregnancy. The title was also appropriate enough: Waiting. The story had potential and I stayed with it based on reviews and my own hope that it would turn and end up with a surprising end. I read and read and did enjoy the process but was disappointed with the final course."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"At first I was very disappointed by the book's ending, which I will not disclose. I think I always expect to like the main character of the book and I didn't like this one, Lin. I felt that he was a weak person and I couldn't sympathize with him. Then I realized that the author might not have necessarily wanted us to like Lin. Maybe he was only using Lin and his story that spans over 18 years to tell us about China and the culture of the communist party. In that context, Lin's story isn't really important. The &quot;waiting&quot; was not the main theme of the book, the main theme was the life of an average Chinese man or woman in communist China in the 70s and early 80s. In other words, I was too focused on the plot of the book, but I think that wasn't what the book was about, it was just an instrument for the author to describe modern China and the Chinese mind-set.I felt that the book was definitely written for a Western audience. I mean, if you're writing a book for the Chinese audience, you wouldn't be describing the food at every meal, which was what the author did. He didn't say Lin and his family sat down for dinner, he described every dish they were having. I don't know if that was good or not. I found it a bit annoying, but others may appreciate the details because it showed them a different culture.Read this book if you're interested in how the average person lives in China and what it's like to live in a communist country. It's hard to imagine but very well captured by Ha Jin."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, and would suggest it to others looking for a good romantic novel . . .If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"For those of you who described that you were &quot;waiting and waiting&quot;, and no bang bang, shoot em up every happened, this book wasn't for you! The title is simple, &amp; the last chapter is where a man comes to grip with his own soul. The Doctor (Lin) immediately is discouraged with his arranged &quot;homely, older, harsh looking wife&quot; and while he lives in the city, and she in the country, it is easy for him to disassociate himself with spousal and parental duties. He meets a young nurse,(Manna) &amp; Lin discovers it is not easy to obtain a divorce. So they are caught up in years of hoping, praying, and scheming for togetherness. Lin even persuades to give Manna to few prospects so she won't be the &quot;old maid&quot; she so desperately fears. Usually cheating lovers are so blinded with peripheral vision for one another and don't plan &amp; agree their future once they are &quot;free to marry&quot;. So it is the last chapter that the culmination evolves for Lin. True, I believe that the author could have elaborated on Manna's ever changing shifting personality. But it seems obvious that Lin will never be happy and would &quot;stoop&quot; to using his first wife again, simply because he &quot;needed&quot; her, even though he doesn't even really know her. So, he most likely would be &quot;looking&quot; again. Excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's 'Waiting' is tale about an army doctor named Lin who travels back to his village each year to try to divorce his wife Shuyu, so that he can start a new life with a nurse who works in the city with him named Manna. What proceeds is a love affair based on common interests and enjoying one another's company, devoid of physical intimacy. The story takes place in Communist China, the spectre of Mao always looming in the background and influencing the way people lived and interacted with one another.Although this novel won the National Book Award and a whole slew of other accolades, it really is not as strong as it may seem. The central theme of the book revolves around the idea of 'waiting' and watching your life pass you by as you wait and look forward to something that may not be as fulfilling as you may have originally thought. I liked the pacing and everything is very clearly written, but I think for a book to win these sorts of awards, the language either has to sweeep you off your feet or the general plot has to be something astounding. Bottom line: the book has to be head and shoulders better than the other books published at the same time, and this unfortunately wasn't. It's a little trite and a little too neat. It's an enjoyable book, but not something to get overly excited about."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"As a young man Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese army, is asked by his parents to let them arrange a marriage for him. Having no great objection to this, he agrees and finds himself marrying Shuyu, a deeply traditional Chinese woman with bound feet. Embarassed by such an outdated bride, Lin goes through with the marriage but keeps his wife separate from his life in the city, keeping her and the daughter she gives him away in their village. Things get complicated when Lin meets Manna, a nurse at the hospital who falls deeply in love with him and whom he cannot resist feeling attracted to. Due to the strict social constraints surrounding how men interact with women, Lin and Manna are denied any way of expressing their love so long as he is married to Shuyu (the two are only allowed to interact by taking walks through the hospital compound where they can be watched by the gossipy doctors they work with). When Lin is repeatedly unable to divorce Shuyu the two are forced to put their love -- and their very lives -- on hold for each other, believing that it will all be worth it in the end so long as they can finally be together. But what price will this couple pay for waiting? By holding out for Lin will Manna come to resent him for her wasted youth? Is Lin really willing to hurt Shuyu, a woman who has never done anything bad to him except adhere to an outdated set of rules regarding how a wife should honor her husband? When you put love on hold can you ever get it back again? Ha Jin explores these questions and more with remarkable ease and clarity as he takes us from Lin's marriage and first meeting with Manna at the height of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's to the summer in the 1980's that Lin finally has solid legal grounds to divorce his wife -- if he still wants to go through with it, that is. Jin's depiction of life in China during the reign of Chairman Mao is thought-provoking and interesting as a setting, and his keen eye for writing intelligent but stunted characters serves him well. However, while it is not difficult to empathize with Lin and the decision he has to make, I did start to feel a little distant from him in the end. It is a little difficult to relate to such a uniformly passionless and seemingly apathetic person for me. But, on the whole \\"Waiting\\" is a great read with an interesting premise and excellent execution on Ha Jin's part."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I loved the way Ha Jin drew you into the characters. You felt the conflict of each main character and because they were so complex and well written, you couldn't characterize any as the antagonist or protagonist. I was sorry to see the story end, it truly drew me in."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's Waiting is a bittersweet love story set against the backdrop of Communist China (mid '60s-'80s). While the plot seems simple enough - a young man, both physician and soldier, in love with an educated, modern woman, though married to a traditional, peasant woman - the daily, mundane decisions of an ordinary life are magnified by the dichotomy of Chinese traditional beliefs and communist philosophies.The protagonist, Lin Kong, is in a traditionally arranged marriage with a woman whom Lin finds unsatisfactory even before the marriage, though his dissatisfaction with her lies almost entirely on her physical appearances. As a doctor and soldier, Lin lives in the city where he is stationed, and returns to his rural country home annually. Lin inadvertently complicates by falling in love with an attractive nurse, who also is a soldier working at the same hospital. During the course of twenty years, Lin repeatedly requests a divorce, something traditionally frowned upon, and virtually impossible to obtain via the communist regime. Thus, the story revolves around the doctor's dilemma and the two women who inextricably complicate his entire adult life.Waiting is a love story that seems to be at the mercy of a fickle, communist regime, where trends are determined by current political interpretation and thought. Love is put on hold, sacrificed for the greater good of the State; there to stagnate, as opposed to being nurtured naturally through intimacy, trust and affection. Among the many subtle messages in this novel, Ha Jin shows us that emotions, including and perhaps especially, love, cannot be regulated as one would try to regulate and control the economy. There are forces in nature more powerful than any dictatorial force thus discovered. Finally, although love with its full complement of accompanying ambivalent feelings is the prevalent theme throughout the story, Ha Jin writes of the human condition in a communist state and intimately reveals how many Chinese survived during such senseless communist reforms as Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The protagonist of Ha Jin's \\"Waiting\\", Lin Kong, is a Chinese Army doctor who is trapped in an arranged marriage. His wife, Shuyu, a simple and uneducated woman with \\"a country way\\" of being, although the most embarrassing thing of it all, is that she has bound feet.Yet, Lin is happy with his organized military life working for the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Muji City, while his wife and daughter is staying back in Goose Village. But then he falls in love with Manna Wu, one of the nurses working at the hospital. Being in an arranged marriage Lin has always been dreaming of true love and romance. And together with Manna he experiences the sensations of love for the first time.All of a sudden Lin find himself caught between two completely different worlds. A life with his uneducated wife in the rural countryside of Goose Village or with Manna, an educated beautiful woman, in Muji City. He is trapped by a culture in which adultery (if caught) will ruin your both your life and career. The rules are though, you can obtain a divorce automatically only after 18 years, so his only hope is that his wife will agree to a divorce. So, year after year, for his holiday, Lin returns to his village to ask for a divorce, and year after year he returns from his vacation to the city and Manna, still married, still not able of consummate his relationship with her. When Lin, after 17 years, finally is granted a divorce, he finds that things don't turn out the way he thought they would. (You know what they say \\"Wanting what you can't have - the essence of wanting..)All those years of waiting and waiting... A nice twist to the story is when we in the end realize that it's not Lin's waiting for true love that inspired this book's title, but the waiting his wife Shuyu and daughter endured until Lin returned to them.I simply adored this book. I am not sure what I was expecting, but this book took me by complete surprise! I read it in fifty-page gulps, completely fascinated by the story and its beautiful, beautiful prose. I found myself hypnotized by Ha Jin's spare and economical prose. A style I've come to like through authors such as Coetzee and Hemingway, and at times \\"Waiting\\" is a bit Hemingway-esque. Despite the economical prose, the story is rich and characters are beautifully developed.\\"Waiting\\" is highly deserving of the \\"PEN/Faulkner\\" and \\"National Book Award\\" it won. This bittersweet novel will linger on your mind for a long time after you've finished it. It was the first book I read by Ha Jin, but I am already looking forward to his next book.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's latest novel is one based on reality, told with graceful, elegant prose. Its protagonist, Lin Kong, an army doctor, is one of the least appealing heroes I've come across, yet Ha Jin does a superlative job slowly unfolding the odd love story that swirls around Lin Kong and his wives Shuyu and Manna. It is a captivating look at rural Chinese life during the 1970's and 1980's, yet its universal themes of love and betrayal transcend its setting in the People's Republic of China."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting for your life to happen is one of the saddest things that humans go through, but we do go through it. With so much criticism of books and movies where characters commit adultery, you would think that everyone would be happy to see &quot;morally responsible&quot; characters, but then people complain that the characters spend too much time &quot;waiting&quot; and should move on with their lives. Some people will never be happy.This book is a wonderful cultural critique and I enjoyed it a great deal. Yes, you may get irritated waiting for something to happen, but something IS happening. It is just much more simple than a passionate sex scene in the middle of a park or in the quiet office. Characters are lovers without being lovers. We do get frustrated waiting for something to happen, but that is the subtlety of the writing style. We are made to feel what the characters feel through the author's masterful use of language and imagery.If you're looking for fast paced action, go see your local summer blockbuster. If you're looking for a thoughtful and interesting look at another culture, read this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In this book, I did spend a lot of time waiting. Waiting for something to happen... I turned each page anticipating the next big event, but much to my surprise there was no big exciting event. Then I realized, this is what life was like in communist China. People lived their lives following all the rules and waited for their chance at happiness. Problem is, they never found that happiness. This is not to say they were unhappy, they just always wanted more. At first I really did not like this book, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized the author did an amazing job of getting me to feel the emotions of the characters."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I must give this book a 5 star rating because it shows one of life's greatest lessons. The grass IS always greener on the other side. How many of us are spending precious time looking for the happiness in life we already have but just don't appreciate? How many of us are as painfully honest with ourselves as Lin finally was with himself? Better late than never, I suppose. It's a good book, with a good lesson to learn."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is the second book I have read by Ha Jin. The first, \\"The Crazed,\\" was somewhat slow, but quite enjoyable by the end. This one was a much easier, faster read -- one with a very different objective. Both novels are set in China during the time of the Cultural Revolution, a very interesting time indeed. While \\"The Crazed\\" focused more on a historical and cultural experience for the characters, \\"Waiting\\" truly is a love story, one that is heartbreaking and touching on so many levels. The characters are complex even while the storyline seems simple. The themes of waiting and restlessness, of dissatisfaction, and ultimately of regret and redemption really resonated with me. I felt a part of these characters' lives, and that is why I read books in the first place. Be patient with this story; let it unfold at its own pace. Stories like this need to be savored, not rushed. Take some time when you are finished to reflect not only on what has developed in these 308 pages, but on what you yourself have done over the last 20 years or so. What are YOU waiting for? What have you missed? (In both senses of the word: what have you failed to notice and what do you long for?)"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"One of the few extravagant touches in this plain-spoken, calmly narrated novel is its attention-grabbing opening line (''Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.''). For nearly two decades, Lin has been trying to get his long-suffering wife to agree to a divorce so he can marry his coworker, Manna Wu, but Shuyu always changes her mind at the last minute, for one reason or another (usually under pressure from her meddlesome brother). Eighteen years of separation are required by law before Lin can be granted a divorce without his wife's consent, and the novel opens just prior to the end of this long delay.\\"Come on, next year I'll divorce her, whether she agrees or not. Let's just wait another year, all right?\\"\\"Another year?\\" Her voice turned rather shrill. \\"How many years do you have in your life?\\"This humorous beginning launches Ha Jin's reflective meditation on the nature of love and the lengths (chronological and emotional) that lovers go through to fulfill it. Many things other than the patience required by a wait of eighteen long years complicate the couple's journey: Lin's feelings toward his first wife, while not passionate, are hardly opprobrious; he is nearly a stranger to his only daughter; Manna Wu, a single and otherwise available woman, must suffer the reputation of a spinster and the aggressive advances of powerful men; and, most fascinatingly, every character in some way endures the clash between, on the one hand, \\"Western\\" ideas of literature and of divorce and, on the other, Communist ideology and Chinese traditions.Stylistically, \\"Waiting\\" is, as its very name implies, a quiet novel, but its simplicity is deceptive: the events and the characters it describes are fully animated. The prose itself is what the word \\"lyrical\\" was invented to describe. True--the resolution of the characters myriad affairs is somewhat expected, but the details of this comedy are a pleasure."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Humans cannot understand others until they know themselves. The theme of Waiting is the idea that in society, individuals are constantly searching for an identity, and Lin, the protagonist of the novel, searches the most out of any of the characters. Essentially, he is waiting to discover something that ignites his sense of self.It is crucial to the plot of the novel that the setting be Communist China. While western philosophy focuses on the individual, the concept of Communism values the collective. Therefore, numerous examples in the book show Lin's inability to find his true self, because of the oppressive government. For example, since most literature has been banned in the society due to the cultural revolution, he is not exposed to a myriad of literature. The communist society in which he lives parallels that of George Orwell's in 1984. Just as Orwell proves in 1984, in a Communist society,Lin and his comrades lose their identity due to conformity.Lin looks for some sense of identity in Manna, the woman he is waiting to marry. Manna is a strong-willed individual who waits with Lin for eighteen years of separation in his marriage to pass so that she can marry him. Lin hopes to find some identity in the rock of Manna's personality, but as she changes with time, he realizes that her personality is not as stable as he had hoped.There is irony in throughout the story in the fact that Lin misses the point that it is not the destination in life that matters, but the journey. He is so focused on marrying Manna and living in an utopian that he envisions, that he never focuses on the bits of happiness that he experiences in the present. Lin hopes to find an identity when he marries Manna, but in the end his waiting proves to be futile."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I won't waste anyone's time by going into the details of the book. The other 276 reviews posted here do that in plenty of depth. I would merely be wasting my time restating what countless people have already said. Generally, the book is titled Waiting. And it's about waiting. That's about all you need to know going into the book. There's an everyday adage about wishing and being careful, which we see the fruits of in this book. Enough said in that regard.The book is simple, no doubt. The story itself is mostly unremarkable, but I think that's what makes it what it is - an interesting read. Those familiar with Chinese culture and sociology at any level can probably appreciate the simplicity. Manifest in that simplicity is a patience which breeds a longing. As we see, the longing must be tempered with patience. Thus the waiting. Am I being too vague?Almost any modern book about life in China will see a fiction littered with discussions of life under Mao and the Cultural Revolution. Again, readers who are familiar with Chinese culture and it's modern literature will be well aware of that. It's virtually impossible to read a Chinese author and not see that in the pages. Perhaps only Amy Tan has managed to avoid it, but I have yet to read her full complement of books.I'm not surprised by those who give the book 1 star, and I can't disagree with them in terms of subjective assessment, since they obviously had certain expectations going into the book. However, it's clear these expectations were misguided. In almost every case, the reader likely knew nothing of the culture they were reading. Collectively, these negative reviews express their impatience with the overused quip that, \\"I'm still waiting for something to happen.\\" Their impatience is overshadowed only by their unoriginality.However, I'm not going to sit here and proclaim this a brilliant book. I bought it because it was the National Book Award winner in 1999 and the PEN/Faulkner Award winner in 2000. Knowing that, I expected more than a slowly meandering walk through pages which mostly brought you exactly where you thought it would. Nothing happens in the story that you can't reasonably expect. Not to say that this is bad, per se. But it is what it is. And the narrative's slow crawl in an expected direction leads you to an anti-climax when you reach the end.Still, the narrative is enjoyable enough to keep you interested, and the writing style is top notch, as you might expect. The core of the story is something many people in life never learn, true \\"forest for the trees\\" stuff here. If it only takes 300 pages for you to understand, you should consider yourself lucky. For most people, it takes a lifetime. More than likely, this is why it won those awards."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a well-written story that describes an unconventional love triangle stretched out over two decades.The protagonists are Lin Kong, a Chinese physician serving his Communist masters faithfully; Shuyu, his peasant wife from an arranged marriage; and Manna Wu, a nurse at Mr. Kong's hospital.The central drama of the book revolves around Mr. Kong's repeated attempts to divorce his childhood bride so that he can marry Manna Wu. Lin Kong himself is conflicted. On the one hand, he feels shame and guilt over even trying to divorce his wife, as she has done nothing worthy of divorce, faithfully serving both him and his entire family without a single complaint over the years. On the other hand, he longs to be with Manna, a much better match for him by intellect and by temperament -- so his repeated failures at finalizing the divorce fill him with a mild case of self-loathing.One of the beauties of this book is that it stretches the narrative over nearly 20 years. You live with these characters for twenty years, seeing them change, age, and grow. This kind of story-telling is the antithesis of the whirlwind courtship followed by \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" (a la Bridget Jones' Diary).The backdrop to this story is China, which itself changes dramatically from the 1960s to the 1980s. For a very different sense of China during the same period, I recommend reading the non-fiction \\"Gang of One\\" by Fan Shen.The writing is astounding for someone who didn't learn to write in English until so late in life. I found the external events more dramatic and compelling than Lin's internal conversations with himself, which sometimes felt a little stilted. Still, overall, this is a compelling read and a remarkable achievement for a non-native writer."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"For me the greatest aspect of Waiting was Ha Jin's writing style; even though this book is about what its title declares: waiting, I had no such experience while reading it. A bonus delight was to look back and see this novel as an allegory of China's need to appreciate the provincial, rather than sell it in favor of what the government currently considers urbane. (Will the mistress retain her allure despite time and self-discovery?)As for my concerns with this book.... The first one had to do with Manna, as a nurse, should have known better than to try jumping around in hopes of warding off conception. This seemed grossly ignorant, thus inconsistent. Next was during her labor, Manna's cries seemed ludicrous in light of her own possessiveness over her finances and belongings. Given this, I laughed out loud over her pain, which was disturbing since I doubt Ha Jin intended that reaction. As for the strong sense of longing successfully sculpted into my reading experience, it was not on behalf of Lin and Manna; for that I also wondered if it was intended by Ha Jin."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This novel takes place in China during the Cultural Revolution and afterwards, but it is a social, not a political novel. Its protagonist is a military doctor assigned to a hospital in a small city, with a peasant wife living in a rural village, and a long standing relationship with a nurse at the hospital. The doctor entered his marriage out of respect for his parents who needed a daughter-in-law to help them, and he is not allowed to divorce for 18 years. Ha Jin tells a quiet, unadorned story, which is mostly interesting and occasionally dull. For the most part, the characters are colorless, perhaps reflective of their situation. The doctor is a well developed character, a moral, competent, yet passive human being. His wife is drawn broadly, but with sympathy and appreciation. The reason to read this book is to experience a slice of Chinese life of the period, a time and culture when a small degree of freedom and material comfort went a long way."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a National Book Award Winner. It's title, &quot;Waiting&quot;, seems to tell you what it's about, it's about patience, endurance, constancy of human spirit. Why should you read it? Were it not for the depth of the characters and the beauty of the writing, this book might bore us--after all, it's about waiting--but Ha Jin pulls it off, we stay engaged throughout, and the payoff is terrific. Even, at the end of the book, there is a surprise, when we learn that we have been reading the less important of two stories. The greater story, merely implied, has been waiting for us to discover and write it in our imaginations. But this is not a box of crackerjacks, you can't open your surprise early. The surprise is worth waiting for.Having said that, be careful which reviews you read. Some people can't keep a secret and will spoil it for you."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a lovely book. It's text is simple, but moving. It plot remains with you long after you've finished the book. A beautiful glimpse into the mind of a fine Asian writer."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's new novel, Waiting, is understated and restrained as it is eloquent. Lin Kong is an army doctor entangled in a dissatisfying arranged marriage. His wife, Shuyu, lives in the country tending to his ailing parents while Lin pursues his military career in the city. Lin meets Manna, a nurse who works in his ward at the army hospital. Despite obvious obstacles, they pursue a courtship and fall in love: &quot;Her moist lips curled with a dreamy smile as though she were drunk. Slightly dizzy himself, he stood up and hurried away for fear that others might see his face, which was burning hot.&quot; Jin constructs a powerful tension, a dichotomy of individual desire versus obligation and stifling conformity within a collective society that drives the narrative. Lin's desire resonates as an aching yearning yet strangely he quietly accepts her lot. For seventeen years, Lin treks back to his village in the hope of being granted a divorce from Shuyu. Each year his petition is denied. The village council sees no reason why the couple should divorce. Lin returns to the city disappointed and weary, his relationship with Manna impossible and unconsummated. The simple plot is less interesting than the political allegories the lie underneath the surface of the story. Shuyu represents a remnant of China's past, with her bound feet and subservient manner. She continues to defer to Lin even after he treats her indifferently or poorly. Manna is a product of China's revolution after Mao's regime. She is disconnected and appears to be self-reliant yet paradoxically she is emotionally crippled and clings to Lin. Lin is the most fascinating of all the characters because he's an anti-hero, flawed, almost meek, yet the reader feels sympathetic to his situation. He is a protagonist on the cusp of change, straddling two worlds. Ha Jin is a skilled writer and undoubtedly there is more to this story than I grasped during the initial reading. The characters and their entanglements are interesting and multifaceted. This book can be read on many levels."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I don't know why this book captivated me so. I was unable to leave it alone even when I was supposed to be doing other things(I suppose this theme of secret happiness stolen at the risk of official censure is appropriate to the book). English is a second language for the writer, and he doesn't make daring attempts at prose style. Most of the sentences seem to be about as simple as they could possible be made. At some points, where the characters experience tragic emotions, the prose is embarrassingly simple, and you feel even more moved, somehow, that their sadness hasn't even the dignity of sentences that can please in themselves. The prose is as drab as Communist interior decoration, but it is compelling. I suppose in some ways my response to the book could be seen as consistent with a racist impression of &quot;Chineseness,&quot; equating China with inscrutability: that is, the book's surface reveals little yet one feels that there is much there. I can say, though, that this novel made the idea of life's brevity much more urgently apparent to me than any of Shakespeare's sonnets. When you're thinking about something like &quot;When I consider everything that grows/ Holds in perfection but a little moment,/ That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows/ Whereon the stars in secret influence comment,&quot; you are so fascinated by the sentences' grammar (&quot;shows&quot; changing from a verb to a noun, or &quot;everything&quot; changing from the object of &quot;consider&quot; to the subject of &quot;holds&quot; as quickly as your eye travels over a line break)that the sadness of lost time doesn't really strike you as mournful. After all, it is the occasion of so much gorgeous writing. But in &quot;Waiting,&quot; the ache of lost life creaks in the ungiving sentences. This novel is almost unbearable. The lack of explanation is worse than explanation, or dazzling display. The characters are so sympathetic, so dutiful and &quot;good&quot; according to their rules, that one wishes that they would find love; one wants them to be loved as the reader loves them. But I suppose that the book's point may be that obedience to morality and rules, which makes these characters sympathetic and deserving of love, in practice frustrates their chances to realize love. In fact, while the book is a love story, the only consummated sex scene related in any kind of detail whatsoever is a contemptible rape, as though only scoundrels have the courage to get what they want."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The cover of this novel boasts a suspenseful love story, which it is. However, don't let it fool you, it wasn't the same kind of suspense one would expect...yet, I still couldn't put it down! The way Ha Jin writes is so so calm, simple, nothing crude or crass. It's a story about Lin Kong, a doctor who lives in the city, who's fallen for Manna Wu, a nurse who lives in the city...but they can't get together because Lin has a wife from an arranged marriage, Shuyu, who lives in the country.This is a story spanning over 18 years, with Communist China as the setting. I liked how the description of the regime sort of paralleled Lin's story and the choices he made. On one hand, you see how the communist regime sneaks itself into the fabric of everyone's personal lives and decisions. All the while, Lin mentally commented on the idiosyncrasies of the past traditions. Yet, near the end, he started to appreciate some of the concepts that the old tradition held.I was surprised at how the writer was able to manipulate my feelings for each of these characters (or maybe I'm just easily manipulated--lol!). For a while I was sympathetic to Lin's plight, but then I was annoyed at his selfishness and lack of passion. Again, I thought Manna was a sweet woman who deserved to be with Lin, but then eventually, she seemed cold...but she had a good reason to be so, after 18 years of waiting for a man she loved, enduring some painful incidents throughout. Finally, there's Shuyu, whom I wanted out of the picture from the beginning, but could see how special she really was.I just think that Lin Kong was such an odd character. He went through life almost like a passive observer. He became frustrated when he found himself in these difficult situations, yet did little to get out of them. He looked at life like a series of events that just &quot;fell into his lap.&quot; Fortunately, it seemed that finally he started to realize that he was, in fact, the master of his own destiny. Yet it was a bit late in life when he discovered this. Still, I'm not sure he would really make the transition to emotional maturity by the end of the novel, but at least he started to appreciate the good things he had in his life.It's a wonderful theme to which any of us can relate: Take stock in what we have. Find the beauty that surrounds us. People who want something they can't have may spend their lives reaching for it, only to have anger and bitterness in the end because they never appreciated what they already had. They wasted their lives wanting what others possessed, be it love, money, or freedom."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"because that's what you do, as you're reading... wait... for something to happen. And it's all about people on the cusp... the problem is they never take the plunge, really. I found this book to be well-written, thoughtful, but ultimately meandering, at best."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I hope readers will ignore--and manage to forgive--the profound stupidity displayed by the last two readers. What is exquisite and understated about Ha Jin's beautiful novel will be lost on those expecting the equivalent of Jurassic Park and Terminator 3. This novel operates on a very different level, with a different sense of time and plot development. If you're genuinely interested in reading about another culture, and prepared to give this book the time and attention it deserves, Ha Jin's novel really is a magical piece of writing."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I am not sure why this is called a love story, since Lin, by his own admission, has never been in love. He finds the true details of love intrusive and is actually looking for maid and laundry service. The language of the book is extremely uneven. The narration is sometimes lovely, sometimes archaic (they copulated a long time.) while the conversation is full of jarring Americanish colloquialisms (Girl, you're crazy!) which do not fit the characters or events. The omnipresent voice couldn't be a more overused device. Lin's stilted conversations with 'the voice' was like being hit over the head with the obvious. Ultimately, this is a dreary book about a self-centered man who only wants what he doesn't have and the two women who, for reasons never understood, love him."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"An expert in wine may appreciate the smallest nuiance in it's character, but the search for that nuiance takes precedent over the enjoyment of the bottle. If you want a story that will require you to revell in the smallest of subtleties at the expense of enjoyment of the book, then Waiting is for you. If you a looking for a tale of love, faith or hope, there are much better pages to turn. The prolouge reveals to us that the Lin's sought after divorce will not materialize for 18 years, so we read the next 200 pages knowing that Lin and Manna Wu will not be united, if at all, until much later. While the details of the 18 years are, at first, interesting, they begin to blur together into a series of inconsequential events. Like Lin and Manna Wu, who become comfortable in their relationship rut and plod along, the reader churns through the pages and plods through the story. While it is true that the years build and develop the characters, they do so at a snails pace. How many times do we have to be shown that Lin is indecisive and timid ? How often will Lin and Manna Wu suffer because they cannot break out of societal norms ? The plot develops more in the final chapters, but the outcome is telegraphed. Lin's eventual revelation that they waited just for the sake of waiting is both predictable and, worse, emotionally unsatifying for the reader. A true critic might call this a love story of infinte subtlety. I would not call it a love story at all. Ha Jin has instead written a political allegory of 60's and 70's China. Lin's wife and his love respectively symbolize the old and the new China as they fight for the soul of Lin. Lin is the people of China whose infinite patience ( or is Ha Jin saying infinite timidity? ) makes them unable to act and unable to change things for the better. For a book praised for its' subtlety, the symbolism is obvious."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a hauntingly graceful story of a man torn between love and convention. Set in communist China, Lin Kong, the protagonist, is an army doctor from the country side. He has a wife, Shuyu, in the countryside who he thinks of as old fashioned, unlearned, and unfashionable. He makes his life in the city and eventually connects with emotionally (NOT physically) another woman, Manna. Lin goes home year after year to try to divorce his wife, for 18 years, as Manna waits for him. He realizes finally that he has \\"waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting.\\" On this backdrop, we learn a surprising amount about politics and life in communist China.Its simple style makes for an elegant and smooth read. The introspection tends to make the book drag. However, it very fitting for a book titled Waiting. I found that just as I started to get bored, the book offered a few surprises. Don't take just my recommendation - it won the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award. With that said, I don't think it's a book everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book takes you into the culture of China under Chairman Mao in the 1960's and 70's. Ha Jin was born in China. He moved to USA to study. He had delays in bringing his wife here after he immigrated. He knows about waiting and the frustration of state regulations. His book takes you into the mind of a man, who has repressed his own instincts in favor of respectability. The hero is ineffectual but credible. The two women portrayed belong to the pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary worlds. Again the emphasis on the way culture shaped the individual is clear. The writing feels natural, as if written by a native speaker. Really worth reading, especially for Westerners who now are now steeped in individualism and notions of self fulfillment."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's Waiting essentially illustrates the saying that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive. Its main protagonist, Lin Kong, has entered into an arranged marriage to please his parents. Having left his home village in favour of the urban world and risen through the ranks as an army doctor, he now wishes to divorce his wife Shuyu so that he can marry the woman of his dreams, Manna Wu. But both traditional peasant China and the communist system have their norms, and the divorce procedure, repeated year after year, is somehow frustrated time and time again. Meanwhile, Wu and Kong's feats of abstinence only work to heighten their expectations, raising the risk of disillusionment.Shuyu is an illiterate peasant whose feat were bound in her youth and who is entirely devoted to Lin Kong. Manna Wu, a nurse, is both forbidden fruit and soul-mate. Waiting is a subtle and well-pace piece of psychological drama. Spanning several decades, it also provides a glimpse into the changing Chinese mores of early Maoism, the Cultural Revolution, and the 1980s market transition. And though Ha Jin is a Chinese-American author who writes only in English, he lived in China until 1984 and knows what he is writing about. This is well worth waiting through."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I would like to thank the author for this lovely tidbit of insight into the cultural life in China (1960's-1980's). As an American who has not been to China, I found this book informative. I have a new appreciation for the Chinese culture that my immigrant neighbors would have experienced at the same time I was coming of age. I will read more of the books by Mr. Jin. For those of you reading these reviews, some of which state he gives too many details, I would like to say this is incorrect. If you are reading in a peaceful place without distraction, you will find all of the details recreate a realistic setting. You will immerse yourself in the sitatuations presented in the book and find you cannot put it down. I read this book in several hours within a week, despite other commitments. It was terrific and I will purchase it for my bookshelf in the hopes to share it with friends and to read again."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I agree with many of my fellow reviewers -- it's a solid bookwith lots of insight into Chinese customs, but it's not nearly at thelevel of winning something as major as the National Book Award. After the first 100 pages or so, the narrative starts to unwind a bit -- if not for the fact that i don't like to leave a book unfinished, I wouldn't have kept going. Plus, the main character was so devoid of passion that it was hard to believe that he would have even made it through the 18 year wait. I suppose the ending has a philosophical point (ending up back where you started), but I found it unsatisfying. Remains of the Day was much better in the vein of inability to acknowledge feelings and emotions while a book like Memoirs of a Geisha was infinitely more interesting. I did enjoy this book, I just thought it was 100 pages too long and not quite at the National Book Award level. For both those reasons, I found it disappointing overall although I certainly enjoyed parts of the book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book has a wonderful premise. Every summer for 18 years a man returns home to his village to divorce his wife, but something always goes wrong. The tone is somber, the story telling is restrained and clear. This book also won this year's National Book Award for fiction. I do have a couple of criticisms about the book. The first is that the story leaves you feeling unsure of who to sympathize with--the wife, the husband, or the girlfriend. The second criticism is that there is something of a &quot;short story trick&quot; at the end of the book. I can't explain what it is w/o giving the story away, but I felt slightly cheated by the story's ending. I think the trick would have granted a short story immense value, but I think it brought the novel down a notch. Regardless, I'm just picky. This book is worth the money and is a great read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's Waiting invites readers into the post-War China where predetermined marriages still prevailed. It was the time when divorce was not even an option. Anyone who tried to divorce was labeled anti-revolution, heartless, and cruel. The court rarely granted divorce but tried its best to repair the marriage. A man abided by his parents' will and married a woman Shuyu whom he did not love and gave birth to a daughter. After finishing medical school, Lin Kong served as a physician in the Revolutionary Army. Lin was content with his tidy military life until he met and fell in love with Manna, one of the nurses at the army hospital. Regulations forbid an army officer to divorce without his wife's consent--until 18 years have passed, that is, after which he is free to marry again. So year after year, every summer Lin Kong returned to the Goose Village to divorce his wife Shuyu. Shuyu, a woman in her forties who looked like if she was sixty, had humiliating bound leg. Her face withered. She had been attentively taking care of Lin's parents who passed away before Lin met Manna. Shuyu found favor in the eyes of villagers and the judge. Madly in love with Manna, Lin also felt trapped in a marriage that embarrassed and repelled him. Lin felt he could not bring Shuyu with him around his work. Ha Jin has encompassed a wide range of truths and attitudes about human heart-Lin's insecurity and indecisiveness; Manna's jealousy and Shuyu's faithfulness. I was completely mistaken for what the title of the book really means until the very end of the novel. The meaning of &quot;waiting&quot; is in fact two-fold: the 18-year wait for divorce is only the surfacing idea. The true waiting that Ha Jin refers to is that of Lin's wife Shuyu. She had waited for her husband to come to senses what he really desires and treasures in his life. For 17 years in his life, Lin had been people-pleasing: he tried to please Manna by divorcing his wife; he tried to please the fellow workers by getting a more &quot;presentable&quot; companion. Lin became blinded to who he really was. You have to persist to the very end when the author takes a turn and surprises you with the ending. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was quite simple and nothing dramatic happened, to some readers' disappointment. But I found that it's what life is like. We all have waited for something, and often the process of waiting turned out to be the most exciting part. When we got what we wanted, we're often not so sure it's better.In the book, Lin Kong tried to divorce his peasant wife Shuyu unsuccessfully for 18 years. Some reviewers here argued that it's actually very easy to divorce a woman in China in the 50s or 60s. But I think they are missing the point. Of course, in the book other officers divorced their wives easily. Lin clearly didn't try hard enough, because he was ambivalent towards both women. He thought he had no love for Shuyu, but he's also not sure if he really wanted a marriage with Manna, his lover. He never thought hard about his relationships. So, the court's rejections were actually his excuses for inaction.On another level, I can really identify with the characters in the story. My grandmother had bound feet, and she was a quiet, always obedient woman just like Shuyu. I also could understand Lin Kong's indecisiveness and apparent lack of emotions. He's an intellect, and it's considered superior in China to be a reserved man. But the writing is very touching and moving. These characters were just like us here, with real emotions like jealousy and fear, and their lives were plain, just like most of ours.I definitely don't think the book was written to exaggerate the conditions during cultural revolution in China, or to be exotic as to appeal to a western audience. I have read many other books that were like that, where the characters endured unimaginable sufferings and then triumphed miraculously. In this book, life is strangely familiar and similar to what we have here. I enthusiastically recommend this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This novel is set in China during the Cultural Revolution of the late twentieth century. The three main characters are Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese Army, Shuyu, his wife through an arranged marriage and the product of a traditionalist upbringing (i.e. with bound feet) and Mannu Wu an educated, mordern nurse that Lin plans to marry. Under military law, Lin must wait 18 years before he may secure a divorce without the consent of his wife.The story operates on multiple levels. It is in part a story which explores the nature of love -- what does it mean to love someone and how does one know when he or she is in love? The story also works as a political allegory of the Communist regime in China. Closely related to the latter, it is a fable about a traditional way of life coming into contact with modernity and industrialisation (communist or not).On all levels, the story shows the ambiguity of the human heart and the difficulty of self-knowledge. These are basic difficulties in being human, and their understanding is basic to human love, politics and change. The story shows both how hard it is for people to know their own hearts and also how difficult it is to pursue any ends without bringing, in some way, harm to another person.The story is told in an eloquent, minimalist prose. The writing is simple and beautiful. I found theprimary characters and a host of secondary characters well, if suggestively and sparely, presented and developed.This book reminded me of another highly acclaimed book: Disgrace by J,M. Coetzee. Both books are written in a restrained prose. Both are about repressive political societies (South Africa and China) in an uncertain state of transition. And both present situations fraught with moral ambiguity which seem to point beyond themselves for understanding.This is a thoughtful and sad story about what a party leader accurately describes at an important moment of the book as &quot;a bitter love&quot;."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Subtle, smooth, slow and cold, Ha Jin's Waiting moves at a glacial pace and cuts as deep, carving its path deep into the hard ground of everything you once thought you knew. The book is unrepentant. In its quiet-but-raw way, it builds, it swells, gaining tension, ever advancing. Finally, it opens, gradually, languidly, like a delicate, fierce, hungry, dying black flower of pure, exquisite anguish. And at the center of that flower is both the wonder of discovery and the despair of utter futility, all wrapped up in a tangled mass of memories and hopes, and, most of all, regrets. This is a book that shows you what it doesn't -- what it can't bear to -- tell you. In its elegant, composed and even tranquil way, it chops you right down to size. Once you miss your chance, it says, that chance is gone. Poof! Forever. So, you have learned that Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans. Too bad. The book feeds you just a meager taste of the truth, but even this teaspoonful is insufferable, intolerable, gagging, and bitter as bile. The book does to you what Lin does to himself, makes you wait...and wait, and wait and wait, and seems never to deliver. But it does deliver. Only what it delivers is pain, pain disguised as a rare treat, enticing you to take a bite, the Garden-of-Eden-what-the-hell-did-I-just-do bite, the bite that made all the difference."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I seem to be the only reader on earth at the moment who found this novel bland and bloodless. It does offer a rich look at China in a historical time and place, but so would a good history book. Jin's been compared to Henry James, which means that no one has read Henry James lately. Ordinary, dull sentences, wooden dialogue, and irritating characters. Certainly there were more compelling reads available to the National Book Award jury?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I was a little bit disappointed after reading this award-winning book. The dilemma that the main character faces is nothing new and many China-related novels tell the similar story line. I feel that the book receives more credit than it actually deserves for. The good thing about Waiting is that the author presents his story in a smooth writing style and makes the book an easy-read. Overall, the book is still worth to check out but please do not keep the expectation too high."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"With a short but precise prologue, Ha Jin introduces the main conflict in this novel effectively to his readers ---- Lin Kong returned to his countryside home to divorce his wife every year. That did surprise me. Why he had to do that every year? -- The reason is: his wife agreed to his divorce at home, but changed her mind every time when they were in the court. Lin had a difficult decision to make. He did not love his country wife at all, having been away from her for over fifteen years. However, the country wife had done everything for his family - looking after Lin's parents, saving money for Lin and so on. Manna Wu, a girl at Lin's hospital who fell in love with him, had been waiting for Lin to divorce his wife for over ten years.In this way the story develops, with many twists and turns. The main story line is clear. I find it difficult to criticise this story. I would like, if I may, to criticize those negative criticism about Lin's novel instead. The story is set in mainland China in the 1970s and early 1980s. I do understand that the cultural revolution in China has been blamed by a large number of people. However, I do not think Ha Jin wrote this novel so as to blame the destructive ten years in China. Instead, the author set the story in this background that he himself had lived through, to bring out a universal understood theme - love and affection. This reminds of (Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, though there is a large cultural and time gap between the two stories.) I have always been asking myself what the main characters in the novel are waiting for throughout my reading. At first glance, I thought Manna Wu and Lin Kong had been *waiting* for Lin's divorce and their own marriage. However, I was wrong. In my opinion, what they have been waiting for is under sub-consciousness ---- they are waiting to grow up spiritually and to understand their life better. Lin waited for eighteen years to divorce his wife. He finally was granted the divorce and married Manna Wu. However, the two's relationship did not last long. Manna Wu soon became ill and was diagnosed to have coronary heart disease and that she would die in a few years. The second last chapter devoted itself to reveal to us Lin's deepest thoughts in his heart ---- he has never loved Manna Wu. They &quot;loved&quot; each other because of the presence of this seemed-divine &quot;years of waiting&quot;. They fonded each other because they had not understood what true love was.Ironically, the true love lay in no other than the one between Lin and his own wife, Shu Yu.A person in the review section claimed that Ha Jin's novel looked rather like a translated work. Were it translated, I would describe the translator as a brilliant one. There are always differences between the two culturals which have been separated by the Pacific Ocean. Had Ha Jin set the story in America, it would have sounded as convincing as the original script. Further more, from my point of view as a Chinese, I have to admit that Ha Jin has a wondrous manipulation of the English Language. Arriving in American in the middle of the 1980s, Jin has been able to win the national book prize is indeed something not easy. I feel proud of him, and am indeed reassured that Literature is borderless. It is argued that this unfortunate story happened because of the communist China. Although I agree that the Cultural Revolution has brought negative effects to the growth of China, we should not pump out unreasonable anger at it. The reason is because the environment is set there. It is difficult for an individual to alter it. I believe we should look more at characters rather than the evironment they are in. A good book teaches us a good idea. Ha Jin's Waiting fullfiled this. Do give this book a try. I find it enjoyable and hope you too."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I found this novel extremely easy to fall into. The storyline was intriguing describing as it does Chinese societal mores through the personal struggles of one man.However, I found the conclusion to be extremely disappointing and not up to the high standards of the rest of the book. It is a 308-page book that flows nicely until about the last 50 pages where it seems to rush to a very unsatisfying conclusion.While quickly getting Lin to some personal understanding, the author simply concludes the story without ever showing us what his main character does with his new-found insight.I was all the more disappointed because this book is, for the most part, extremely well-written and appropriately paced. Though I hesitated doing so because of the uninspired conclusion, it is for the writing style that I gave it three stars."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Reading this book one is reminded of the old Hemingway saw about how fiction should only give away the tip of the iceberg. The graceful, simple prose of this book reveals just the smallest portion of the complex emotional and politcal currents that run beneath this story. This is the kind of book that, once you have finished, you cannot get out of your head. The book jacket calls Ha Jin a &quot;sturdy realist,&quot; but that's not really right; his prose has much more in common with a modernist minimalism. A must read for anyone who thinks that fiction writing in America is moribund."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I believe I can understand the negative comments this book has received, but I do not agree with them. Having several Asian friends, I was fascinated by the glimpse into Chinese culture--not only the political landscape, but family relations. I think people may be expecting something more grandiose from this book since it is an award winner. Rather, this book is like its main character, subtle. The narrative is straight forward, and the story is literally about &quot;waiting,&quot; waiting for a period in your life to begin. I think what this book gives us, besides a wonderful peek into Chinese society, is a lesson to find what we love in life and revel in it. This is not a book to &quot;polish off quickly.&quot; Rather it is one to read and think about each word, and the way those words are presented. I loved it. I finished the book several weeks ago, and I still think of Lin, and wonder if he will ever really know happiness."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - as much for what it reveals of China as for the plot. The three people at the center of this novel --husband, wife and the 'girlfriend' (not mistress, that step is too dangerous for them to risk) who waits 18 years for him to get a divorce-- are in a state of limbo for much of their adult lives, constricted as they are by the laws of their society and by the limitations of their experience. This is a fast, easy book to read, but I don't mean this to sound negative, much is going on beneath the surface of an apparently straightforward story, and it left me contemplating how much we all take for granted about the laws of our society, how rarely we question the conventions we're brought up with. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin does some things splendidly: his prose style is supple and evocative for all of its simplicity , especially his descriptions of nature, and he conveys a wonderful sense of the living conditions under which his characters labor and love (or try to). For the first third of the book, I was remarkably engaged. But I don't think Jin has quite escaped the trap of how to wrtie about waiting without becoming a little dull--sort of like trying to write about boredom without becoming boring. These characters never quite came to life for me, and the author's own unkindly dissection of his protagonist's shortcomings near the end undermine the book's ongoing critique of Communist China--yes, Communism bad, especially in the quasi-rabid forms it has taken in China, controlling almost every aspect of these charaters' lives (good thing capitalism doesn't do that)--but could this character have been happy in any society? Another pitfall is that Jin seems to set us up for some sort of slam-bang ending after all the waiting--yet the final 50 pages or so are surprisingly muted. I may have unconsciously docked the book one star for what seems to me the beginning writer's ploy of having characters ask themselves questions in sets of threes--obvious questions at that, and a bit too frequently. After my initial engagement, I was frankly a little disapointed, especially after following up &quot;Waiting&quot; with J.M. Coetzee's &quot;Disgrace&quot; which covers some of the same themes in a starker yet richer tone."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"i am a chinese woman myself &amp; find this to be a beautifully written book with a real story to tell about love &amp; life in modern china.admittedly the novel does sound strangely &quot;translated&quot; from the chinese. u can actually pick out many literal chinese phrases like &quot;stupid egg&quot; that a western reader would perhaps find weird, disjointed &amp; possibly unintelligible.believe me when i say that this book describes very truly how chinese people love &amp; why.not only has &quot;waiting&quot; magically captured the universal truths of love (in all it's fragility &amp; forms)amidst the pressures of society, culture &amp; enforced political climate, which would explain why it won a well-deserved national book award, it also serves as a very accurate behind-the-scenes look at why the chinese act &amp; behave the way they behave.there are different little character rhythms from lin kong, manna, shuyu, hua &amp; her uncle sprinkled all over the book that are only too familiar to any chinese who have been brought up in strict households from infants to be ruthlessly filial, obediant &amp; good to the point of being uptight &amp; submissive.i am not saying that western people are not brought up with the same good qualities but the almost-oppressive way that these virtues are drummed in from young are a totally chinese thing.read this book with an open mind &amp; heart to learn more about the chinese people &amp; i believe u will not be disppointed."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What many of the reviewers of this book seem to be missing about this work by Ha Jin is its allegorical nature, that draws more than one reminder in this reader's mind to Orwell's \\"Animal Farm.\\" Yes, it is written in a simple manner both in style and in plot. Some would call this the story's strength and others, it's weakness. One thing is clear, however. The narrative that Ha has crafted is not simply one about lovers who through the constraints of their cultural and political situation cannot consummate their relationship. It is not simply about not being satisfied with what we have and waiting for what we want while life passes us by. Put simply, to classify this a love story is to do this work a disservice.On a symbolic level, Ha is telling us the story of the China of the 20th century and the struggle of its people to come to terms with the convulsive transitions (e.g. Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution) that this nation has experienced over the past 100 years. To say that China is a land of complexities and contradictions is a vast understatement. One of the most basic dilemmas of the last century has been the struggle between old China, the land of emperors, Confucius, and bound feet, and new China, industrial and economic man-child, forcing its way into the modern world. This is the conflict around which this story unfolds. Every character is a symbolic representation of larger belief systems, ideas, and positions in modern Chinese society. In this context, it is not difficult to guess what Shuyu and Manna represent.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, because of the poignant statement it makes about the state of China, a land that, as a Chinese-American whose family has lived abroad for 50 years, I have a profound need to connect with. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; shows the truth in the maxim that life is what happens when we wait for life to begin. Set in industrial Northeast China in the years before, during and just after the Cultural Revolution, the book is not overtly about politics, but rather about how individuals try to find their bit of happiness within the constraints imposed by society and character. On another level, the ambivalence the protagonist feels toward his traditional wife in the village, and the woman he loves in the city, is a proxy for China's own transition from a traditional culture to a modern, communist state -- which itself becomes weary and exhausted as the world changes around it. Ha Jin has a wonderful touch with evocative details, and brings to life a time and place that is already slipping into history."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The author, Ha Jin (Xuefei Jin) left China in 1985. Illiterate until his mid-teens, he presently teachs English at Emory University and has published two books of poetry, two collections of short stories, and two novels.&quot;Waiting&quot; is a simple fairy tale, a story in which much is being said underneath its surface. Based on an old ancient Chinese folktale (or a true story as defined by the author in an interview), Ha Jin recreates and sets the plot in a moder post-revolutionary China. There is a two-fold approach: the universal, in which Ha Jin deals with human nature, its virtues and frailties, the issues of loyalty, duty, friendship, betrayal, and love; and the strictly Chinese, the social/political system. Although the characters are not politically oriented and the plot evolves indifferent to the chaotic world outside the insular setting, there is a clear political allegory and ideological irony (the book has been banned in China). All the characters are directly or indirectly victims of a social/political system, of a collective society where the individual can never exist or act &quot;per se.&quot;The plot is a love triangle: Lin Kong, a Chinese physician, loyal officer of the Revolutionary Army, entangled in a loveless pre-arranged marriage, for 18 years desperately seeking a divorce; his wife, Shuyu, an illeterate village girl, bound feet, subservient, and with a moral superiority which the author does not explore; Manna Wu, a modern woman, hospital nurse, in love with Lin Kong. Lin Kong personifies the sleepwalker, a man who is pushed and pulled by others' opinions, by external pressures, and by internalized official rules. A fourth character (Gen Yang), although secondary, is the anti-thesis of Lin, being opportunistic and ruthless he holds to the belief that &quot;character is fate,&quot; he defies and uses the system in his favor, and gets away with what he wishes.The prose is concise, clear, with beautiful lyrical passages and imagery. It portrays a life perspective different from Western society, a reality much un-known outside China and sometimes difficult for the outsider to understand. It will much depend on the reader's sensitivity and cultural openness to get the most out of this novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has done it again! &quot;Waiting&quot; is absolutely wonderful. Ha Jin has a way of bring a character to life, and give even the most minor player in the story flesh and blood. The honesty in his work really touched me. Buy the book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"WAITING by Ha GinOnce in a great while, a work of art-a book, a play, a painting-reveals a truth so profound that you cannot believe that you were not previously aware of it. Waiting, the 1999 National Book Award for Fiction by the Chinese author Ha Gin, is such a book. \\"Your character is your fate\\" is such a truth.The book is brief; it can be read in one sitting. The writing is spare, unadorned, and as natural as breathing. The subject is love: love as loyalty, love as hope, love as comfort, love as passion, love as endurance. It is as much about the absence of love as it is about its presence. In a dual setting of rural and urban China following the Cultural Revolution, there is much to learn of the history, the culture and the boundaries of the individuals who live the story. The individuals, like people everywhere, are a living kaleidoscope of their background and their environment. Like spinning silk, Gin develops their character, which, in turn, propels their fate.From the metaphor of the single dark braid on the cover of the book, Gin laps and twists and binds his story. The opening sentence sets the repetitive structure in motion: \\"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.\\" For eighteen years Lin Kong goes back and forth between his wife, Shuyu, and his unconsumated lover, Manna Wu; between the ancient culture of Goose Village and his life as a doctor in modern Muji City. His eventual marriage to Manna Wu is not a culmination; it is another loop in the braid. There is much more to come.Waiting is not exceptional because of its adept English prose written by a Chinese author; it is exceptional because of its clarity, its honesty, its compassion and its universal humanity-appropriate values to honor with the last National Book Award of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is an excellent book that I highly recommend. Although it is slow in some parts, it is really worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I just finished reading WAITING snd 1. I enjoyed reading it 2.I have a feeling of catarzis 3.I learned a lot about life in China It is a weird story about weird people that abstain thmselves from love making for 28 years it is a weird society with weird rules but the people are people and they don't seem so weird because they seem human and real. I don't know yet what will sink in me from this book in the long run but for sure a lot of knowledge abut the athmospere and life in China and also some insights about love relations and mariage. I recommend."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Perhaps I missed something, but this was a truly boring book. I found myself waiting for something to happen which never did. Man marries. Man moves. Man finds new love. Man tries to get rid of Wife year after year after year after year only to succeed and then to find there is no place like home. Well written? Yes, but so what?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I don't understand why this book won any awards. I found the main character to be an irritatingly passive male about whom I cared little. The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything turned up that made it worthwhile. I would have to say, no. Furthermore, the writing seems stilted and elementary -- like a very poor translation."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What's unforgivable in Ha Jin's novel is not its historical inaccuracies obviously catered to the tastes and beliefs of a foreign audience. What's truly unfortunate is its depiction of Chinese people and society as being without some understandable passion or recognizable human emotion. Who are these aliens depicted in this novel? Real humans don't act like this. People in China during the cultural revolution certainly could not have acted like this. While reading this novel, all I could think about is how incredibly cold and uninteresting the characters are. Where is the pain and the suffering these characters supposedly endured during the cultural revolution? Yes they are Chinese, and yes they are therefore subdued, but that does not excuse the characters from their competely lack of inner struggle and psychological depth. Why should I care whether the divorce comes through or not? It's hard to give a damn when the characters don't seem to give a damn themselves."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is a disgrace, I can't believe it won the National Book Award. As a Chinese who spent his childhood in China, this book to be nothing more than a romantic potboiler. There is one cliched situation happening after another, not to mention the random positionings of irrelevant details. This is nothing more than the work of a novice. But I can understand why an American would like this book, because of all the exotic details. If you really want to experience China, go on a vacation and you'll see enough to write your own book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I love oriental food and art, but the culture is difficult to appreciate. This book is set mainly in the 1970's Communist China -- hardly romantic. Ha Jin offers us a love story as unromantic as they come.The hero, Lin, is a spineless intellectual bore. The heroine, Manna, is a career-girl shrew who breaks up Lin's marriage to Shuyu, a good, but plain woman rooted in Chinese tradition -- bound feet and all. Lin is embarrassed by his non-intellectual wife and abandons her and their daughter while he pursues his career as a doctor in the military. He turns to Manna, an old maid by Chinese standards, whose only previous relationship resulted in her being jilted. All three characters plod through life for 18 years until Lin is able to divorce Shuyu and marry Manna. After their marriage, Manna's temper tantrums lead Lin to a revelation -- he doesn't love her.I suppose it is a triumph for Ha Jin to successfully publish such an acclaimed novel fourteen years after emigrating to the U.S. However acclaimed and successful it might be, this book left me bored and unmoved. The characters were either emotionless (which is, upon further reflection, a characteristic of Communism) or cold (yeah, Communism). Even the highly emotional Manna fell flat.It was a quick and easy read, but, I haven't gained a thing from reading it."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a terribly slow tale filled with dispassionate characters. Everything about the story and characters is bland. It is story of 18 years where nothing changes. If you are looking for a simple, yet elegant, story, pass Waiting by. It missed the mark. Go read Shipping News."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is truly about waiting. Waiting for Lin to grow up and appreciate all that he has. Waiting for Manna to grow up and realize that there are better men out there then Lin. Waiting for plot to develop. Waiting for Shuyu to realize that she's better off without him. Waiting for it to be more than predictable.I gave 3 stars because I didn't feel it was a COMPLETE waste of my time reading this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a review of the price of the Kindle version of this book. It is unconscionable for publishers to set the price of the Kindle or electronic version of a book higher than the price of the printed version, in this case, the paperback version. Authors, don't stand for this kind of pricing. I will not read your work until your publishers lower the prices of the electronic versions below that of the printed versions. I would love to read this book, but not until the Kindle price comes down."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is not written with the outlandish style and genius of many contemporary writers. It's extraordinarily simple, both in its prose and in the story it tells. But something about it drew me in and kept me reading - maybe it was the sense that I was observing something about Chinese society that I'd never seen before, maybe it was the story itself. But I couldn't help but keep reading and was glad I did. This story captures the complexity of human relationships with a sort of Zen simplicity that takes deceptive skill - skill that is all too easy to miss perhaps.This is a very well written book. A very well thought out examination of human emotions. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a bittersweet testament to love ~~ Chinese style. It is also an unexpected surprise to read something based on a foreign culture and totally relate to the characters. And &quot;Waiting&quot; is an apt title for this book ~~ probably the best title for any book I've ever read as it matches closely the story.Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese army returns to his village every summer to end his loveless arranged marriage with his wife, loyal Shuyu, only it fails. Lin wants to marry Manna Wu, a nurse in the same hospital he works at. Lin is caught between two different women and trapped by a culture in which adultery can ruin lives and careers. And when the divorce is granted, much to Lin's surprise, he's in for an interesting journey through self-discovery and love.I have found myself becoming impatient with each of the characters at one time or another ~~ but mostly with Lin because he just couldn't seem to make up his mind about anything. Then I would get impatient with Manna ~~ why doesn't she leave Lin and find happiness on her own? Or with Shuyu, why doesn't she let go? And the answers that come along are very interesting and revealing. I promise this is a good read ~~ and the descriptions of some of their food are just mouth-watering.Ha Jin writes a very intimate and revealing book, one that explores the definition of what love is and how love between a man and a woman, wife and husband, father and child affect everyone around them. Jin writes thoroughly of the Chinese Culture and how the Revolution changes the way of people's mindset ~~ and how the rural folks resist the change.This is a definite book I would recommend to anyone and everyone who even has a slight interest in Chinese culture. I am not even surprised that it has won a National Book Award ~~ it is that well-written. And Lin will linger in your mind for hours after you've put the book down. His conflicts and confusions are just the same as anyone else's when they confront what love is."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is one of these rare books that through reading you enter a whole different world with very different rules. It is an exceptionally well-written novel, with a great deal of details on life during and after the years of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This is a work of creativity and sensitivity.It is the story of an army doctor, a man who worked his way out of an essentially peasant background through the help of his family. As tradition in China dictates, he needed to take a wife to care for his aging parents. An arranged marriage addresses the problem of the care of the elderly superbly but leaves him totally unfulfilled. Ha Jin portrays a sensitive, caring, weak and often frightened man, who is a victim of events and insecurities; and an ignorant loving peasant wife who accepts what the husbands offers and does not ask for more.As a reader you are tortured by the couple's blind adherence to custom. The main couple in the story though is the Doctor and the nurse girl friend. Unable to consummate their love they wait and wait and wait. Here you are more tormented by their total adherence to army and Cultural Revolution rules, mandates and norms, which are often at odds with the traditional Chinese culture. So here you have our great army doctor obliged to the wife through traditional values with no complaints, unable to marry the girl friend, but also due to army rules he's unable to have an affair with her and unable to divorce the peasant wife.Ha Jin's Waiting takes us to a whole different world, every time you pick it up, you travel across cultural and time zones; first to China and then on to the Cultural Revolution days. This is a truly wonderful work, not a novel of fast paced events; the main character is portrayed in very realistic terms, not necessarily sympathetically. For me I appreciated the slow, meandering movement of events, it made it far more realistic and transformed me totally to this fascinating culture at its most peculiar of times. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I find it interesting that so many of the previous reviews of this book focus on the constraints a Communist society places on relationships. To me, the message was more about the tendancy for people to be disatisfied with what they have, never being fully happy in the moment. By always waiting for things to improve we can take the focus off how we are feeling in the moment and instead focus on how things will always be better in the future. Without gving anything away, let me say that I belive the end to this book demonstrates this perfectly.In conclusion, I enjoyed this book becuase it operated on a number of levels. It not only delivered a message about oppresive politcal systems, but also one about the basic defects of human nature."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The title is deceptive. By definition, it insinuates that nothing of significance will happen until whatever is waited for finally occurs, and it further insinuates that this will be the experience of its characters as well as its readers. However, Ha Jin takes on the formidable task of telling a story about what happens _during_ the act of waiting; that time period that one usually brushes off as lost to fidgetiness and anticipation. He shows us that, inevitably, if you're made to wait for someone or something too long, the satisfaction of the payoff ultimately decreases. Something about you changes: your disposition, your insight, your emotions, your desire for what you're waiting for. There is an enormous amount of intimate action that takes place in this story, even as it appears as if nothing of much relevance is happening.Every summer Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese army, returns to his village to ask his wife for a divorce. Their marriage was arranged and it is a loveless union. Manna Wu, a nurse in the army and his mistress (the term is used loosely as they have no sexual contact whatsoever, purity being essential for an unmarried woman within their culture) waits for the day the divorce is granted and the two of them can become engaged. Each year, however, his wife promises the divorce but does not see it through, and he and Manna must wait another year before he can go back and try again. For eighteen years, summer after summer, they bide their time and endure this waiting. The emotional changes that occur, subtle as they are, during the course of every year that passes is \\"what happens\\" in this story. Jin unfolds their story lovingly, quietly, and deftly, with such rich detail that we understand alot of what is happening between them even as they don't. It's a tender, often harsh, look at two people caught within and crippled by the boundaries of their culture.For a book in which so little happens, \\"Waiting\\" is a very compelling read. It won the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Well deserved."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's plot moves steadily, at times blandly, through several decades of Lin Kong and Manna Wu's lives. Lin and Manna, hardly in love, wait 18 years for nothing at all! Eighteen years wasted struggling for a divorce and Lin finally realizes his cowardly mistake.I was impressed by Jin's portrayal of a vivid and lively China. However, I was frustrated with the extraneous, needless, superfluous descriptions that were quite apart from the whole narrative. I was also frustrated by ALL the characters: Lin, Shuyu, Manna, Bensheng... there is no hero, no one admirable, all are flat, tragic characters absorbed with their own selves.The only reason I give this book 4 stars is because, in the end, Lin realizes a few of life's harsh lessons. He finally opens his eyes. Jin executes this revelation with such poignancy that, upon finishing the book, I couldn't help but linger on Lin's future and happiness. The finale in _Waiting_ leaves a mark quite like a church bell that rings and leaves a residual humming..."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I stayed up until 3 am reading this novel. When I was done, I got up and started cursing and shaking my head: I couldn't believe it. It was so beautiful I wanted to cry. The sustained and meditative style of _Waiting_ is quite different than his other works, which can be quite bleak. But this novel is utterly, utterly beautiful. Haven't read a book this good since Kazuo Ishiguro's _Remains of the Day_."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Rarely will you find a novel like &quot;Waiting&quot;. It is simple, yet has a powerful message in it that does not reveal itself until the very end. Lin Kong, the key character in it, endeavors to do everything to honor the Chinese political system of 1960-80's, his medical career and his first marriage. He also allows true love to wait ! &quot;Wait&quot; being the operative word. The result of such &quot;waiting&quot; is what the reader must read on for. It is not what we normally find it to be.It may make you ponder some of your own life decisions.I recommend this book for those with an interest in socio-political issues in an Asian culture."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is such a good book: realism and allegory, irony and especially honesty are all intimitely wound up with one another in Ha Jin's masterfully precice writing. There is also a wry sense of humor that pervades the narrative just beneath the surface, and this--as well as the simple background details like Chinese social conventions, the politics of the Cultural Revolution, and, above all, food--makes the novel a quiet joy to read, just on a page-to-page level. But I think that what makes this book so good as a whole, more than anything else, are the Characters: Lin and Manna are drawn so well but so subtly, through small but crucial details, that they acquire flesh almost without our noticing it; because of this, it becomes almost shocking how emotionally affecting the novel's conclusion is. It is one of the most satisfying books I've read in quite a while.Whether or not we deserve or appreciate it, Ha Jin is a gift to American readers. I think it's to our benefit as well as to his that he is not a native speker of English: his spare, precise yet nevertheless rich prose reads like fresh mountain water amid the mess that so much contemporary American fiction has become. For &quot;Waiting,&quot; I'm grateful."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A year ago, I stumbled upon Ha Jin's collection of short stories, \\"Under the Red Flag\\", winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction in 1996. The stories, set in China at various times during the Cultural Revolution, were remarkable for their crystalline pure prose, realistic attention to detail and depiction of the intersection of the personal and the political in the quotidian lives of their characters. From that first reading, Ha Jin struck me as perhaps the finest prose stylist writing in English today.Ironically, Ha Jin was illiterate in his own Chinese language until his mid-teens, when he began reading voraciously while serving in the Chinese army on the Russian border. It was not until the age of twenty that Jin began studying English and, twelve years later, in 1988, began writing in English. By that time, Jin had completed graduate study at Brandeis University and, in the wake of the events at Tiananmen Square, emigrated to the United States. While Ha Jin's prose is remarkable for its austere beauty, and his themes are universal and set in the ordinary, everyday lives of his characters, the setting of his fictions remains exclusively and particularly Chinese.\\"Waiting\\", Ha Jin's second novel, tells the story of an eighteen year love triangle among Lin Kong, a doctor in Muji City, his loyal, but illiterate wife, Shuyu, and his educated and urbane mistress, the nurse Manna Wu. Kong lives and works apart from his wife, in a hospital in Muji City, where he meets Manna Wu. Each year, for eighteen years, Kong returns to the country to visit his wife and to request a divorce so he can marry Manna Wu. Each year Kong's wife, whose bound feet are a sign of her rural backwardness, refuses to consent to his request. It is a simple story told in simple prose. Set during a period from the early 1960s until the 1980s, \\"Waiting\\" is a realistic and human tale of relationships set against the backdrop of Chinese culture and society during the years of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. Marked by Ha Jin's remarkable attention to the details of everyday life, \\"Waiting\\" is a sparkling gem of a novel, a deserving winner of both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"WAITING tells of a story of love, and waiting, between two lovers caught in a restricted environment where the tiniest show of affection between them could cause them their future.I had expected to be drawn into the story like it was when I read MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. The settings of Waiting was unfamiliar to me and I couldn't connect with it as much as I wanted to. The reader is not given an insight to the setting of the story nor the lives of the characters and that gave me a superficial feeling in regards to the story.However, the characters are well developed; Lin, the male lead - a gentle loving man who is unable to get what he wants however he fights for it and Manna, the female lead, waiting, for the man she loves to finally be able to belong to her and during her wait, we see the events that cause her to lose her youth, her bright outlook to life and her vitality.The prose is smooth and almost engaging. But it doesn't make one feel for the characters; the pain of waiting, the shame of being intruded upon, the guilt for Lin's wife, Shuyu.The plot is simple and unassuming. At the end of the story, we all hold our breaths for a twist that seemed inevitable. Does it come? ... ...Waiting did not live up to my expectations, but it did entertain me. It was a &quot;could be put down&quot; kind of book, but it wasn't difficult to bring it up again."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; is an appropriate title for this book, as I kept waiting for something to happen. The protagonists fall in love, but must wait 18 years for the man to divorce his wife from an arranged marriage, because of the legal limitations on divorces at the time. Throughout this lengthy courtship, nothing much happens between them.The tale in Waiting supposedly spans the Cultural Revolution, and a few years after its end. What bothered me most about this book was that it almost ignores the realities of life during this oppressive time in history. The portrayal of life is unrealistic, based on what I have read. The &quot;harshest&quot; thing which we hear about is the almost voluntary &quot;confiscation&quot; of a few books (leaving many more behind). Otherwise, the Cultural Revolution appears to have no impact on the story.The interaction between the characters is interesting since they reflect views of both &quot;traditional&quot; and Maoist China. However, the book drags, so much so that I found myself waiting (with the &quot;lovers&quot;) for something to happen. At the end, your sympathy for the primary characters vanishes."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I found this book so interesting, yet very subtle. The story line is slow moving and not to be hurried, just like the life of the main characters. I found this a delightful story that builds slowly, inch by inch, to a very thoughtful and surprising finish.BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin does a good job of drawing the dynamics of each character into the story and tying them together. His book gives a nice window into the lives of people in China during the Mao years. One of the most rewarding things for me is seeing the commonalities between any relationship, regardless of culture or country."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Realistic,detailed description of the people and events occurred in the Mao\`s age makes me reminiscent of the days spent in China.The content of the story is nothing original to the Chinese who are over 30 years old.However,the story is still attractive to alien readers who are not so familiar with the background of Culture Revolution.The totalitarianism,the puritan discipline,the serfdom to obey. what I admire most in Ha Jin is his courage to write in an entirely new language with such fluency,confidence and clearness.Is\`nt it a miracle!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Because I love writing which is (truly) &quot;spare and elegant,&quot; it irritates me to see this phrase so blithely thrown around--such as by many of the reviewers of this decent, but not great, novel. Many of Jin's descriptions of the natural surroundings (in the city and in his home village) are, indeed, spare and elegant. Where Jin gets into trouble is in describing his characters' thoughts and actions. In these sections, his writing is often klunky and melodramatic. If you want truly spare and elegant (and great) writing, try Ron Hansen, Cormac McCarthy, or Michael Ondaatje. And, as for reading about Chinese culture, I'll take Amy Tan any day."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I agree whole-heartedly with those who loved this book. It is sad that some readers saw so little in it. I believe that maturity is necessary to enable one to appreciate this story.It is about waiting, yes, and how we postpone what we want so often for what we OUGHT to do. But what some reviewers do not acknowledge is the element of choice involved for all characters. Lin CHOOSES not to divorce his wife for many years (he does not press the issue); Manna CHOOSES to wait for Lin; Shuyu CHOOSES to remain married. In the end, the great irony is that in most respects, every character gets what he or she wanted. And no, they do not live &quot;happily ever after.&quot; Isn't that life? How many times do our choices turn out to be neither right nor wrong, but rather a mixture of both? Different choices would surely have resulted in different effects, but to what end? Would Shuyu have been happier if she had agreed to a divorce in the first place? Would Manna have been happier had she left Lin and married another? Would Lin have been happier had he remained in the country, or had he been able to marry Manna when they were young and so much in love? I think not.One way to view this story is that it has a happy ending. It is not a fairy tale, but a story of real people who make real choices and learn to live with them. If you're over the age of 35, you will surely see yourself at some point in this story. What a marvelous novel!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is an easy read.Although I enjoyed the perspective and descriptive prose of a native of communist China, the story line was not challenging enough for me. The story seemed to become choppy and fall apart towards the end.The explanation of Manna's change in behavior towards the end was thin, too. I kept expecting for her to be disgnosed with a nervous disorder."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I didn't think I would want to read a book about Communist China, but this book intrigued me.The characters are symbolic of China's political state as it changes from Communism to its present state of an &quot;open&quot; COmmunist fashion.I didn't see it as a love story, but more of the endurance of man's spirit. To wait and wait for 20 years is an amazing feat. I love the irony of when Lin's waiting of 20 years ends and he is finally with Manna, they do not live happily ever after. Instead Lin struggles to maintain his sanity.This is alludes to CHina's current state in maintaining it's Communist values as it heads in to the next century."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A love story set in China, involving two people who have waited 18 years to be together, is bound to be intriguing. And the first half of the book was. Ha Jin did a good job of setting a backdrop but the psychological aspects of the main characters, Lin Kong and Manna Wu, left something to be desired. I wanted to feel more sympathy towards these two, and the fact that I didn't means that Jin wasn't completely successful. I also thought the book was somewhat choppy, which made me frustrated. And the ending was anti-climactic and I kept wondering if I was missing something. I don't understand why this won the National Book Award. There were lots of problems with the narrative and the flow and I'm sure there were other books out there more deserving."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I disagree with my fellow readers who found little to admire in Ha Jin's Waiting. I found the same careful and insightful kind of psychological realism that we find in the French and Russian writers of the 19th century. If you're looking for a page-turner, this is not it. This novel does not share the gimmicks and flashy prose of many recent American novels, but it takes us into the mind of a man who lives a human life in an inhuman time, finally recognizing his own limitations. I was delighted that it won the National Book Award. You should also know that this book met political opposition in China, where it cannot be published precisely because of the honesty with which it is written."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; to me , is on a whole a deceptive romantic love story. Initally, through reading the first two parts of the novel, the reader will get an idea that she is reading an enduring love story where love can conquer all odds.However, at the end of the novel, I get the idea that no love exist at all between Lin Kong and Manna. They are just together because they have been Wating for each other for so long. &quot;Waiting&quot; thus gives the reader a depressing view of love in the end. To me, no true love exists in the book and the last line of the novel clearly illustrates the idea that Lin is just waiting for Manna to die so that he can return to Shuyu.The protagonist is selfish and crowdly to the very end and he is a pathetic character who does not know what he wants.This book is a fine literary read that offers many ideas about human emotions . It is a must read for anyone who wants to think about the issues of love and the selfish nature of man. I truly enjoyed this book although it is , on the whole, a really bleak portrayal of human nature and love.Ha Jin's simple and direct prose also assists in bringing his ideas more closely to the reader ."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Readers of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome will find striking parallels between that classic and this new book by Ha Jin. In both, the atmosphere is claustrophobic, in both, the hero is trapped in an bleak life and a loveless marriage. In both, a younger woman offers escape and hope. In both, the conclusion is not quite what the hero plans or expects. Ha Jin is a Chinese living in the US, writing in English about a life in China. As such, I think the writing of this evocative novel is a triumph. His style is terse, without frills - no flashbacks, no elaborate metaphors - and cheerlessly evokes the daily grey-beige life of a middle-class professional in the post-Cultural Revolution era. How would happiness be possible in such a sepia-toned world? - one longs for a ray of sunshine, a burst of color, but there is only overcast sky and endless cadres in uniform. An old Chinese saying advises: &quot;Be careful what you wish for; you might get it.&quot; This story is a good example of this idea also."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A beautifully written book describing the harsh reality of living in China in this century. Deals with love, family, repression, sex, mores, and power. A book that accelerates in its second half, and a writing style that feels Chinese. Recommend highly but be ready to be depressed."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; grabbed me from the first page with its gripping and moving story of frail, mortal human beings in a China very much under the thumb of the Communists. For the first time I saw the people of China as PEOPLE not the faceless masses they are presented as in our media. Ha Jin's story is populated with human characters whose travails became my own as the plot progressed. This to me is the true test of any work of fiction - does it take you away, for a few hours, into a world whose characters' concerns become your own concerns and whose fate becomes, however briefly, your own? This book meets that test. Read it and enjoy something quite special. A very deserving winner of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Subtlety. Ha Jin takes us to school on this subject. The book, richly written, is loaded with subtlety.I enjoyed reading this book, which is probably the most appropriately titled book in the history of the written word. Lin Kong returns home every year to his small village to his wife and child, asking for a divorce. He has fallen in love with Manna Wu, a co-worker, but he remains faithful to his wife despite his never have loving her.It is interesting to read about the trials that Kong and Wu endure as they are &quot;waiting&quot; for eighteen years for the divorce to go through. It made for a better love-story and it helped the character development, even though it did move along somewhat slowly.I did appreciate the wonderful language used, as well as the simple flow of the book. Such a nice easy prose made for crisp reading and using a background of the political views of the China was also a nice touch, and it help to add meaning to the story.The thing that I found most entertaining was the subtle humor peppered here and there. You have to look for it, but it is there, and makes for a more pleasant reading experience. Overall, this book was quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, because it sounded like it would be very rewarding and thought-provoking. However, nothing about it convinced me that it is worthy of a National Book Award. The writing was elementary, unimpressive, and rather simple. While this made the book a fairly easy read, and while I never seriously thought of not finishing it, whenever the plot would build to some sort of climax (and there weren't any exciting ones, to be sure), the next section or chapter wouldn't deal with it. It was just on to the next thing, which was equally unexciting. I kept hoping something monumental would happen, but halfway through I realized that since the author told the reader the pivotal thing in the first pages of the book, there was nothing else to be told. It plodded along, from year to year, which is I guess the point of the book--that life goes on no matter how we try to change it--and when I reached the end, I was glad to have finished the book so I didn't have to read it anymore. The ending was disappointing also; something happens that makes you think &quot;Aha! So this is the message of the story,&quot; but even that falls flat."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"To understand the characters of this novel, you have to be able to wait along with them throughout their ordeal. When introduced to Lin Kong, he is at court, trying to divorce his simple but loving wife, for yet another unsuccessful time. The reader wonders what could justify his patient yet undeniably cruel wish to divorce her year after year.Then we're taken back almost twenty years, when Lin meets Manna Wu, another notoriously patient character, who has been jilted by her lover. Eventually these two fall in love, yet are not able to consummate the relationship due to the social politics of 1970s China. This setting was perfect and wonderfully detailed as to why Lin and Manna suffer along in their comfortable misery, in development reminiscent of Kundera's &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being.&quot;In the end, neither is satisfied with the wait, but the reader comes to understand how Lin, Manna, and even Shuyu's minds are warped by their heart's sense of impending justice.Jin, as always, writes quite simply but effectively. I highly recommend this work, and any of his."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"thinks the main character in this story about tradition, family, love and loyalty. Army Doctor Lin Kong, at the urging of his family, agrees to an arranged marriage with a footbound woman from the country. They have a child together, but little else in the way of a relationship. She remains at their home raising their daughter, caring for her ailing parents (and his), while he works at a hospital in the city. Eventually, he becomes interested in having a relationship with a nurse named Manna, and, in order not to jeopardize his standing at the hospital and to comply with the strict rules involving relationships between members of the staff, he decides to divorce his wife. Year after year, he returns home, discusses the situation with his her and cajoles her into going along with it in front of a judge. But invariably, although sometimes with the intervention of her loyal brother, she gets cold feet. He waits \\"torpidly,\\" knowing that at the 18 years of separation mark, the divorce can be granted without his wife's consent.Novel negatives: The writing is on the stiff side, a particularly graphic scene is included, and getting through the first two-thirds of it is about as insufferable as the wait of Lin and Manna. Positives: With only a handful of characters appearing in the novel, there is ample space to learn what makes them tick and (patience being a virtue) the virtuous will be rewarded with an entertaining resolution. The story's message may fall somewhere between: \\"The grass is greener on the other side of the fence,\\" \\"If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with,\\" and, \\"You reap what you sow.\\" Whichever, it provides a lesson about how an individual's choices can affect the lives of many. Was it worth the wait? For the reader, yes, for Lin Kong, read and find out. Better: Pearl S.

As such, I was an observer of the culture and the indirect way of communicating that permeated the company. \\"Waiting\\" was a novel that was familiar to me due to my experience, yet startling new in its exploration of the character of a man willing to wait, rather than to act. The character development of the major players is excellent and the emotions that each feels is described in a way concise, yet palpable way. I am not sure whether to give this 4 or 5 stars - I keep waffling so I wish there were a 4.5 designation. Nevertheless, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I gobbled up this novel very quickly because it was written in such a way that I made me eager to unfold the next development in the problematic love story between Lin and Manna. However, I felt that the best part of the novel was not the love story itself, but it's message about the nature of the dynamics between men and women. The novel relates a love story of how a humble, virtuous man and a humble, modest woman still encounter the relationship problems decribed in Men from Mars/Women from Venus! I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has written an eloquent story of longing and the effects it has on ones own reality. This story flows with grace, providing the reader with much to think about. This would be an excellent choice for a book group as well as for the individual reader."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A disclaimer: My wife and I disagree about the literary merit of Ha Jin's Waiting. While I felt it was a perfectly competent novel, but undeserving of NBA, she was moved by the story of the two lovers, waiting for happiness, unable to find meaning in the limted sphere's of their lives. Where my wife found allegory, I found pedantry and clumsy psychology. Where she found interesting detail, I found only superficial description and little insight into a society in the midst of enormous transformation. To cover nearly 2 decades of China's most tumultuous period and hardly mention the pogroms, the reeducation camps, the starvation, detente, the trials of the Gang of War! I woudn't mind the lack of political/historical context if there were psychological subtlety, but alas there isn't any beyond the occasioanal rhetorical question.In short, dear reader, if you want to read a novel about waiting, read Love in the Time of Cholera."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What's the main point of this book? Not until the last few pages did I recognize it. In this book, Ha Jin told us what was the real waiting&iexcl;XNeither Kong Lin's nor Manna's, But Shuyu's. As a silent and humble character, Shuyu was &iexcl;naturally&iexcl; forgotten by most readers. However, only patient readers could enjoy the ecstasy finding the surprising ending Ha Jin tried to tell us after the long read. At this point this book was very beautiful and successful &iexcl;V and sometimes a bit metaphorical, even philosophical --- hitting its climax, simultaneouly testing the readers and awarding those faithful. By design, we readers SHOULD wait patiently, waited for the ending. Impatient readers would never find the beauty and the true meaning of this story. In fact, since the pace of this book was so slow, the stories and scenerios during those 18 waiting years were repeated and predictable, I almost gave it up in the middle. But after I finished it, I was deeply moved and burst into tears. The book totally deserved it's reputation.BTW, Why \\"18\\" years? Chinese, and only Chinese, knew that. It refered to an ancient folk tale of China. A woman (WANG BAU-CHUAN) waited for her husband (SHUE PING-KWEI), an officer, for \\"18\\" years in a shack, not knowing her husband had another lover in the army. This tale was so famous that almost every Chinese knew it. So we knew that Ha Jin tried to write a modern Wang-Shue tale. Each main character in the \\"Waiting\\" had its own corresponding character in the Wang-Shue story.The only flaw in this book, in my opinion, was the chapter about Manna was raped. It read so cheap."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Years ago, I went to a presentation of this wonderful book by its author at Powells' Books Store in Portland, Oregon. I was shocked at his response to a question from the audience about the validity/possibility of the plot in China. He replied that his book was written strictly for Westerners and their romantic ideals. That this story could never happen in China. That remark hurt my impresion of this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is an extraordinarily annoying, yet suspensful read. The author makes the reader wait to find out if the new relationship will outshine the hollow relationship that Lin Kong had with his wife Shuyu. The ending makes the drawn out sequence of events -- in which Lin Kong travels back to his home town each year to divorce his wife and fails -- worth the wait.The book is not just about love and arranged marriage, like the cyclical events appear to imply. The book is about a man's struggle to realize who he is, what he desires, and how long he has waited to find it. Though Lin Kong's girlfriend, Manna Wu, waits for decades before she can marry Lin Kong, her wait is inconsequential. Shuyu waits for her husband to return to her and Lin kong is waiting for realization, contentment, and home.The book's ending is one surprise you won't mind waiting for."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'm confused, like those who gave the book both good and bad reviews, as to why this story merited the National Book Award. I think that raised my expectations too much, because while I liked the idea behind the story, I found the writing to be slightly ponderous. The passage of 18 years is supposed to happen to the characters, not to the reader."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In the novel Waiting, Lin, the main character is the victim of circumstances in both of his marriages. One, he is the victim of tradition, where love is secondary in a marriage. Second, his new relationship is dictated by his government, where the party line is more important than individual needs. Lin is a great character, and the book a very good novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Charming,ingenious,and profound, the author Ha Jin has pegged the human heart correctly and written a brilliant story to match. This love story is full of bittersweet pathos that is very believable: we wait and wait for the one great love of our lives only to discover the gem that we overlooked along the way. Westerners will get a unique glimpse into the Chinese culture, political system and the pressures that influence their lives and decisions. Highly recommended for the contemplative reader."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is such a simple story that I don't know why it is so good. Possibly because the reader discovers the thinking and reality of the average citizen in China in a way that all can understand. You are always sympathetic with the two women in Dr. Lin's life and always want to know what is going to happen next. &quot;Waiting&quot; is an apt title..but to the new reader...what is the waiting for? The winning of the National Book Award is warranted here."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"One of the things that I got from this book was - grass is always greener of the other side. Lin waiting so long to be with what he thought was the love of his life, Manna and when he finally got to be with her, it was not the bed of roses he had expected. In the process of waiting for her, he humiliated his wife - who as one of the critics mentioned was not explored as we do not know what is going through her head, he finally realized that she is such a sweetheart. In short, appreciate what you have know as you will lose out on so much time 'waiting' to be happy or be rich or whatever.Also, I found the ending was rushed. Okay so the divorce was final and the rest just raced. The whole moving process of his wife, getting to know his daughter, the married life with Manna, his sons...Though the book was short enough and very easy to read, I wish he had written more and explored more of the characters that effected Lin's life - his daughter, Shuyu, his brother-in-law. Also his married life that he waited so long for. This way we could have know his thoughts before the marriage, which were detailed and after marriage - more detail would have been good.Also maybe tell us that divorce is something you have to really think about because you do not want to regret it. I think he did regret in the end divorcing Shuyu because I think he felt like he did not give her a chance or their marriage. He worried about what others would think, that he was forced into marriage.. but he did not try to see the positive side or find the light in what is already done.Overall, a good book as you do get the message and learn about the lifestyle in China at that time. The frustrations, the rules."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Eighteen years of waiting. That's what Lin Kong and Manna do. And what becomes of all that waiting? Well, the book aptly tells. This is a love story set in conservative Chinese culture. Communism, with its rigid convention, spills over and provides the backdrop for Lin and Manna's relationship. The three main characters represent three tiers of attitude in this society: Manna represents the modern; Shuyu, the conservative; and Lin Kong as the one stuck in the middle. Lin is bored of Shuyu, convinced that he does not love her, and wants to divorce her. As for Manna, she is the carrot and Lin is the mule craning his neck after her. He plods forth in his occupation, waiting, and seems to come closer to getting the carrot. And when he gets the carrot.... I found the writing succinct and colorful but the pacing of the story was the one thing that made me pick up Hemingway. Eighteen years! It reads like one of those long family sagas--but not so long. It seems that Ha Jin was trying to stretch things out, and by doing so he made the story a little thin. I wanted more conflict. Sure, I got it when Manna was raped and when the villagers gathered outside the courthouse waiting for Lin Kong. But overall, the story is rather slow and dull for my liking. Feels kind of like a series of journal entries in the third person. But I just might read it again."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This just like a new one.The book is worth to read I think.I recommend others to buy a 2-hand book. The quality is very good and it can save your money."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I thought this was (at best) a cute book. The message seems clear to me-go ahead and enjoy life as it presents itself; it won't last forever mixed with a little grass is always appears greener...This book was written in such a simple and almost stilted fashion it was as if it were translated from another language.I really felt for Lin throughout the story. I often wondered if he was trying so hard to be a good communist that he forgot to pay attention to the life he (and others) were living. The fact that he would not take Manna as a mistress made me think that he thought he could just put his life and his emotions on hold.Overall I would say that the book it worth reading. We all need to be reminded that me must find a way to have some joy in our lives.

But the book's real reward is its ending, which takes the story into a much more complicated emotional terrain than expected."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The language in this novel is simple but very expressive. People with many different levels of reading ability will enjoy it. Charcteristic of some of our greatest writers reading and understanding Ha Jin's work is effortless. Not the least pretentious in his writing Ha Jin who was born and raised in China amazes. His command of the English language which he learned as an adult is marvelous. Unlike Conrad who chose to write in English, his second language, he avoids long complicated sentences and wording that drives the reader to the unabridged dictionary. This lovely tale describes life and social mores in China on the cusp of its change to a capitalist society. The protagonist, Lin, is a passionless man who never feels great love for any woman or anyone.He comports with all the requirements of a good highly educated communist,but he never rises to the level of success a man with his native intellect should. He lacks leadership skills on some levels. He is uncomfortable taking risks and therefore never does. He is considerate with his subordinates, but he lacks originality and passion. We are offered a glimpse at the changes in China's society. Where it was once evil to make a profit, be creative and individual, those traits are now being rewarded. Lin cannot adjust to these changes. He is rigid in many ways. This story revolves around Lin's relationship with his country wife Shuyu and his city girlfiend Manna. He is embarrased that shuyu has bound feet. However, he finds Manna's more worldly demands annoying. He seems to want a mate who is worldy like Manna and submissive and undemanding like Shuyu. He does not even feel a fervant passion for his daughter,Hua, which is almost unnatural. However, he cares enough for her that he moves her to the city as soon as possible so she does not live the hard life of a farmer in a country village. He also does not understand why in modern China families value boys so much more than girls. He even prefers that his only child is a girl. I wondered that,perhaps, he was a closet homosexual closeted even from himself. Homosexuality is probably not accepted among the Chinese. However, he didn't have passion for men either. He was a doctor with a university medical degree, one of only three in his regional hospital. He has empathy for the suffering of others except for those closest to him. When Manna has a terrible time giving birth to their twins, he runs out of the room. The screaming is more annoying and embarassing to him than upsetting. He is simply an unfeeling man in many ways. Our glimpse at China offers the frightening details that one becomes an obstetrician after attending a year and a half of trade school. In the U.S. a midwife has a great deal more schooling. Additionally, he performs surgery by directing a team of surgeons who don't have medical degrees. He as well as many adult workers at the hospital share rooms with two or more people. Only married couples have private quarters. China now realizes that capitalism is the road to a higher standard of living for everyone. While the communist revolution was neccesary to equalize educational opportunities, reduce famine, and provide a semblance of the neccessities like food, housing, and medical care to the majority, it has outlived its usefulness. China is now a socialist country trying to improve everyon'e standard of living. Increasingly it more closely resembles a capitalist country. In Waiting we see one individual's turmoil as the rules change like shifting sands under his feet. It is particularly troubling to him, because he has no strong family bonds and can't confide in anyone about his personal difficulties with the change. After reading Waiting, I intend to read all Ha Jin's novels including his newest \\"War Trash\\". Waiting is a quick read. It is a good vacation or beach book with a serious subject that can be finished in three hours. If you like Pearl S. Buck, you will like Ha Jin's novels too."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's novel is a perfect allegory for the living conditions in communist China. Like arranged marriages, arranged lives kept people waiting for something to happen. The carrot was career promotion, if you marched along the party lines. The stick was discredit and displacement.Of course, those rules applied only to the common of mortals. The bunch of mostly corrupt party bosses could live a more exciting life and profit fully from their uncontrolled power.This sometimes poignant, sometimes boring novel has not the same high standard as 'The Crazed', which was far more appealingly constructed, although it dealt with the same themes."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin weaves a story of love that might seem a bit flat and callous in some respect, but it properly analyzes assumptions of love.Lin returns to his home town every year for many years to attempt to end an arranged marriage. Shiyu is not pretty and has a style which has fallen out of fashion in Maoist China and this causes him shame. In the hospital Lin works, he becomes enamored with Manna, a nurse, and enters into an affair of some sort with her, although they have no sexual relations.Shiyu, year after year, refuses to divorce Lin but the hospital allows an automatic divorce if the couple has not been carnal in 18 years-hence the waiting.So...Lin gets no play from either woman, is under obligation by the hospital to keep his relationship to Manna on the down low (although everyone assumes its his woman), and is miserable, since he is just not not comfortable.What makes this book interesting is the clash between old and Revolutionary China and the casulties o love caught in the middle.Good read.."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This well-written novel, which takes place in 1960s and 1970s China, tells the story of Lin Kong, a doctor, Shuyu, his wife, and Manna Wu, a nurse who Kong has feelings for. This story, told over many years time, is interesting but depressing at the same time. Lin believes that he is not happy in his marriage to Shuyu and divorces her in order to marry Manna. Once he marries Manna he believes that he will be happy but finds he is not. Much of the story revolves around his attempting to divorce Shuyu and the problems that he and Manna encounter, but the larger idea that can be taken from this is that there is not one thing in the world that can make you a happier person. The grass will always be greener somewhere else."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"\\"Waiting\\" takes place in China during the Cultural Revolution. This backdrop of Maoist thought, repressive social rules, and austerity is where we examine the relationship between Lin, an army doctor, and Manna, a head nurse. Lin is married to a country woman with bound feet who lives in the village. Lin works and lives in the City at the hospital. Lin returns home to the village every Summer, attempting to divorce his wife, so he can be with Manna, who, at 27, already feels an Old Maid.China's social rules are a major player in this lean and honest novel. Manna, as a young single woman, feels desperate to marry. Since she and Lin have become \\"friends,\\" the whole hospital treats them as fiancees, reducing Manna's possibilities for finding another man. Meanwhile, in the village, Lin's brother-in-law pulls strings to keep Lin married to his country wife.Love is never JUST love in this novel. It's the feelings and actions of Communist party superiors, the whispered rumors of co-workers, the angered villagers who resent Lin's \\"citified\\" ideas about divorce. But at its core, this novel is about the darkness that lies within the human heart, its complexitiy and occasional fickleness, its difficulty choosing and loving wholeheartedly, and the spiraling confusion, pain, and changed lives that such a heart leaves in its wake.This novel's strength lies in its descriptions of social mores in China, its simple, lyrical language that gets to the heart of the matter, and its unflinchingly honest assessment of human relationships and love."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"People speak often of the sadness and pathos of this book but its rare humour is as provocative. Specifically, I refer to the moment when, after years of waiting, the protagonist has finally remarried and had children. The woman he suffered so much for has lost her looks and the mundane and frustrating efforts of child rearing replace romance. Then he discovers that his wife has cancer. His first though: he hopes she doesn't die before the twins start kindergarten. This reminds me of a similar passage by one of America's most famous Jewish writers. His male character, frustrated by married life, decides to leave home. Just as he is about to walk out the door, he turns to his son and says something to the effect: I am leaving your mother. Can you spare me taxi fare?I howled at the awful hilarious sadness of both scenes."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"well...i'm from mexico and i read this book and i just wanna tell you &quot;it's great&quot;, it kept me readin' and readin' is a great and different history and a love novel where they have to fight against many things the protaginists are facing to be together, althought, at the end this history gave me a surprise...read it and you'll know what i'm talkin' 'bout"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Perhaps a more descriptive title for this book would have been &quot;Wanting.&quot; The main character, Lin Kong, only seems to covet a life that he doesn't have. It's a powerful and tragic story. What is all the more impressive about this tale is what's left unsaid by both the characters and the author, and yet, these omissions make the story all that much more compelling.Ha Jin completely drew me into the world of his characters, and more importantly, into his characters minds and hearts. Both of his leads, Lin Kong and Manna Wu, are perhaps not very likeable characters by virtue of their many, many flaws, and yet Ha Jin makes you care about them all the same.This was one of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a great book, simply written, with clear images. I liked that there weren't an excessive number of characters to define and keep up with. I got to really focus on the people involved in the story, and I liked that. The story was an interesting one, and I can't think of another book more appropriately titled. I am amazed that Manna Wu, Lin Kong's girlfriend, would wait for any man for nearly 20 years, much less a married one. I was really drawn to the character of Lin's wife...I think she is the real hero of the novel. It's a really good book that you can read in a couple of evenings, and it's not overly complicated. I finished the book feeling good, feeling that life isn't always what we expect, even when we get what we think we want."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has created a novel which gently leads the reader down the path of one man's life in today's China. As a young, well-educated man from a rural farm setting, Lin Kong's personal struggle to maintain his integrity while finding some personal happiness is the subject matter of this beautifully written story. His (Lin Kong's) struggle is effectively personified in the characters of his two wives and it is through their devotion to him that a somewhat ironic resolution is achieved. I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This guy is good. His words are stunning. Just opening the book and looking at them on the page...simply goregous. But I must agree with some others, the story drags, the plot is flat, and it is a galatical bore at certain points. But if you are looking to study the craft of modern literature in its finest form, read this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is truly about waiting. Waiting for Lin to grow up and appreciate all that he has. Waiting for Manna to grow up and realize that there are better men out there then Lin. Waiting for plot to develop. Waiting for Shuyu to realize that she's better off without him. Waiting for it to be more than predictable.I gave 3 stars because I didn't feel it was a COMPLETE waste of my time reading this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I liked this book, and I'm pleased that it has received so much recognition. The story is fascinating and suspenseful. The characters are sympathetic and rounded. The novel as a whole is quite satisfying.What did irk me, though, was that the style so closely resembles that of a fable, not a novel. The sentences are clipped and their structure is invariably simple. I felt like I should be drawing lessons from the story instead of enjoying it for its own sake, like the title should have been &quot;The Story of the Man Who Waited Too Long and of What He Learned.&quot; But if you're in the mood for a fable, this one's the way to go."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"It sort of read like a romance novel.. but as I read further on, I began to feel the futility of the characters lives... how they seemed powerless to change things that were within their power. It was heartbreaking, and I think we have all been there!! A simple, yet powerful story, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Jin's patience in developing and exploring the restrictions of Communist China is simply remarkable. This is no archetypal love story, we have no perfect mates with perfect intentions. Instead Jin divides our sympathies for the old, discared wife while the new lovers struggle to find happiness in a system designed to prevent their relationship from ever occurring. Jin's prose has the feel of a translated work in its unusual pacing but his mastery of the language has the distinctly poetic feel of a master. Waiting is perhaps not the heart-wrenching, page-turner of a &quot;true&quot; romance but Jin's muted, introverted sensibility commands our attention and appreciation."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jing opened up an entire culture for me. His voice is distinctive, perfect for the story. There was no waiting by this book. I couldn't put Waiting down."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The cultural revolution is redesigned but it is not over in China. A great deal of modern and commercial society is seeking to romanticize China and there is still a great deal that is wrong and inhumane created by the government. This books presents a look from a very personal side but one should not pretend that all is now well in China. I would reccomend &quot;Tears of Blood&quot; by Mary Craig and &quot;In Exile from the Land of Snows&quot; by John Avedon for a look at what it means to live under present day Chinese rule without the softness of a romantic eye. Ultimately when we trade with China we have to have a clear and unromanticized picture of who we give our money too. This book will help with your understanding but it is not a full picture if you are concerned about your role in the human race. Look into the other books. Another great NEW book is &quot;Whispered Prayers&quot; by Photographer Stephen R. Harrison."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Perhaps the reason I didn't like this book is that I'm Chinese, or that I bought it after reading Golden's &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; which I thought was lyrical. The prose style here is wooden, as if the author were trying to sound &quot;translated&quot;. The narrative style seemed to me bureaucratic; again, this may have been the writer's intention, but it seemed ultimately clumsy. The characters were almost caricatures; given other reviews, perhaps they were exotic, but they didn't engage me at all. Even the metaphorical political and environmental ambiance seemed mechanical. National Book and PEN award winner???"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Although this took place in China, there was none of the flavor of the country. A very shallow, rather spineless man cannot obtain a divorce from his wife for many years. When he finally does, he lives the addage, &quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;. It was adult subject matter, but written on a 6th grade level. I was truly disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The prologue tells of a man, Lin, who has a loveless marriage to a woman Shuyu, whom he attempts to divorce several times, so he can marry Manna, a woman with whom he works. Without mutual consent, and barring extremely extenuating circumstances,during the time this story unfolds, a person must wait 18 years to be granted a divorce.After the prologue, the author fills you in on what he has already divulged. Why would he tell what is going to happen when you're going to read it anyway.Save yourself lots of time. Listen to the song \\"After, You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\\", and you'll get the gist of this tedious book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I found this book highly disappointing, both as a result of its colorless prose and endless hammering of &quot;truths&quot; that, in a society obsessed with self-help, are already part of our collective consciousness. OF COURSE obstacles make romance more attractive. OF COURSE relationships begin reflexively. OF COURSE people are often unable to see themselves with enough clarity to undo self-damage. OF COURSE communism is a hypocritical construct.Waiting offers little enlightenment, no subtlety, and a complete absence of reward for the insightful reader. This text is as bland and pointless as its characters."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I bought this book because of all the awards it received but never will I make the same mistake again! Not only is the story dull, boring, the characters silly, but even the writing style is poor.The only reason why I gave the book 2 stars is because it gave me some idea abt the Cultural Revolution in China and its impact on ppl's lives."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin, Waiting (Pantheon, 1999)Waiting, the 1999 National Book Award winner, is something special. It is one of the first few books of what will hopefully become a renaissance in American minimalist writing.The story is nothing new; an army doctor, Lin Kong, has been separated from his wife for years. During that time, he's met and fallen in love with a single nurse, Manna Wu. But every year, when he goes home on leave, he tries to divorce his wife and fails, for varying reasons. Will Lin ever get his wish? And if he gets it, will it be what he really wants?I find it hard to imagine the reader who can't find someone in this novel to identify with. Everyone's had relationships before. Most of us have found ourselves entangled in the with-one-person-attracted-to-another net a few times. Ha Jin's soft, unobtrusive narrative style allows us to get to know the characters, giving us a leisurely pace and spicing the drama with gentle humor now and again.The book's only real downfall is in that pace. Being able to read more than one book at a time is a boon where Waiting is concerned; this is a book that demands to be put down every couple of chapters and absorbed, rather than to be read all at one sitting. Switching off between Waiting and something less cerebral may be the way to go with this one, if you're not the most patient of readers. One way or the other, though, Waiting is highly recommended all around. ****"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has an eye for detail and the quirks of Communist China, as well as for the average human being, that makes this book read like a fable. I found myself hypnotized by his spare and economical prose, where the people and the situations they dealt with were the story, and not flowery language and metaphor. This book wasn't a metaphor for a certain life led, it was life itself. It was funny and had me rolling on the couch at times. It is a very whimsical look at a very harsh and disturbing time. He is to be commended for his accomplishment. This is realism, people. A word many readers (and writers) hate, being as it so often is identified with plotless, depressing, and dull prose. Hell, if I had to live in Red China, I sure hope I would have been able to remain vivacious about my life, if not entirely satisfied. You grab what you can, and milk life for what it is worth, which Ha Jin's characters do. Maybe it takes an author whose first language isn't English to remind us what good writing is all about. Never tell more than you need to tell, never tell less than the story demands."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin writes with such lovely, engaging prose that I was immediately drawn into this novel. His characters seem so human, their flaws so believable as to seem both slight &amp; forgivable -- flaws of patience or foolishness that one might excuse in oneself. His portrait of masculinity is almost feminine in its description -- a gentle &amp; unflinching look at the heart of a man. The characters seemed so true to life &amp; the portrait of the cultural changes in China that emerges like a backdrop only serves to make the people more real, their emotions &amp; choices more believable. The pacing of the story is as thoughtful &amp; deliberate as a heartbeat, drawing the reader steadily through the two decades until we look back with the protagonist &amp; wonder where the time has gone. In the preface, one wonders if he will choose to stay with the arranged marriage he keeps at a distance &quot;in the country&quot; or break with convention to marry the woman he works with in the city. His life &amp; goals seem to work out as being both less &amp; more than he expected. This is a fascinating portrait of a man who seems drawn down the path of his life by the external rules of custom &amp; the decisions of others. This shouldn't seem like a criticism, though. I didn't mind waiting until the end of the book to find out how the opposing demands of honorable behavior would work themselves out. I enjoyed every word."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I was not impressed by the initial chapters of the book but, like its theme, my patience was rewarded in spades. Ha Jin's writing is simple and schoolboyish at times, not what I would expect from a prize-winning effort. However, it is quite apt for this tale of simple unambitious characters from the heartlands of China caught in the thick of the country's evolution into capitalism. It is to Ha Jin's credit that the waiting is as frustrating for the reader as it is for Manna. The beauty of the novel lies in the underlying themes of the rapid changes in China and how it eventually drives home to even a most loyal follower like Lin Kong. The final chapters where Lin Kong finally realises how he lost 17-years of his life trying to marry the woman he thought he loved and missed the growing years of his daughter, completely blind to the devotion of his duty-bound wife, is simply heartbreaking. This book is a little gem that's worth the wait."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is the story of a man who seeks to divorce his wife in order to marry a woman whom he has grown close to at the hospital where they work. The story takes place in China. The wife is not a worldly woman, but she has been a faithful wife, a good mother and taken care of her in-laws in their old age, illness and death. Her husband seems to be a man who has not truley known love, his marriage was arranged and was a &quot;suitable&quot; match. He lives away from his family and visits them once a year. His female companion, a comrade at the hospital, believes that she should be his wife and after many tries to start a life without him, she decides to wait until he is allowed to divorce his wife. The span of this tale is an 18 year marriage. The story portrays the lives of the people in China.It describes the military and political aspects as well as their daily routines, living conditions, meals and attitudes etc. It does so in a very concise and simple manner that gives you a clear glimpse into their lives. All of the characters seem to be waiting for contentment and love....the question is who waits the most patiently and eventually receives what it realy is that they were waiting for. This is an interesting book and very well written. The big surprise is which character(s) you really dislike and which you care about."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I read the first 75% of the novel with disdain, and most of it was directed at the two protagonists of the novel, Lin and Manna. I've never read any main characters as passive, stupid, and pathetic. I don't know if Ha Jin was trying to generate sympathy for the characters, but it didn't work for me. Like I said before, I looked down on the characters--most of their misfortunes were self-inflicted, whether from Lin's arranged marriage to his dumb wife or their pointless &quot;waiting&quot; itself. And I didn't buy for a New York minute that Lin would keep on going back to his wife for a divorce once a year for 18 years without thinking of trying something else; I mean, how dumb can a guy be?So . . . going into the final quarter of the novel, I expected a total cliched tragic ending. A lot of these Chinese books and movies always go for this, like Joan Chen's witless movie Xiu Xiu. However, Ha Jin does something interesting, and the ending surprised me. Far from being cliched, it was quite original and utterly believable and realistic. Ha Jin shows what reality is: that no matter how sad the people and their situation, life goes on. Sad people generally do not commit suicide or die of cancer when it's convenient for the plot. As such, I applaud this novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was an mildly interesting book written in classic, no-frills Chinese prose. The characters were deep but only if the reader was willing to do the analysis of the character motivation themselves. Ha Jin did not assume his reader would need to have this spelled out for them. There were no excess words here to describe feelings. His words focused on describing facts and situations. One really has to look behind the facts for the emotional parts of the story. I liked that. If you are sympathetic by nature, you will find the book very deeply touching. I found it also to be immensely sad since every character in this book was a victim of themselves, a victim of the life at that time in China, and a victim of circumstances. If the reader is not able to be empathetic with the characters, this book will be utterly boring and may seem pointless. The morale of the story, and perhaps the biggest downer is- sometimes when you finally get what you want, it's not what you think it's going to be (a twist on the old &quot;grass is always greener&quot; concept). Don't let the rather depressing theme deter you from reading this book if 1) you have an interest in fine, clean writing and 2)using your brain to intuit the characters' psyche and motivation doesn't scare you. I would, however,suggest you read this when you're in pretty good spirits or it may give you that &quot;so this is all there is in life?&quot; kind of feeling."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a wonderful story. It's characters are brought to life in a simple calm narrative that engages the reader immediately. The effects of the book are felt long after the reading experience has ended. The book is not only an exploration of the effects of living in a severely repressive environment, but it is a study of what it means to be a full human being. Desire is withheld for an eighteen year period between two compatable workers at an army hospital. They are seemingly in love. Yet, the effects of their witholding of their passion from one another leads to a very tragic end. Understanding their choices and restraint is a difficult journey that the author skillfullly takes the reader on. I have beneffited enormously from the ride and recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Jin has been called a \`realist' by less perceptive critics, but \`realism' is not to be equated with dullness. A great writer knows how to highlight those \`realistic' moments that catch a snippet of the transcendent, and juxtapose them with other elements to create a poetry of the real. Jin, however, writes dully on dull events and people, content to let the PC trappings of the exotic do the heavy lifting a strong narrative should accomplish. Much of his prose seems to bear out the fact that English is not his native tongue. How this book could win many prestigious awards is a testament to the power of PC over excellence. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and there is not a single defining \`event'. Not that a plot-driven tale is necessary for excellence, yet this novel is not merely a \`slice of life', ala A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, or The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter. Worst of all, though, is that the book begins with a prologue that removes any surprise this dull tale might reveal. Right away we definitely know all that will occur, save for the very end, where Lin regrets his waiting for Manna, which any astute reader could see coming anyway. And, despite the claims, this is not a love story, since none of the characters really loves, nor knows how to love. As Jin banally tells us of Manna, \`the long waiting had dissolved her gentle nature, worn away her hopes, ruined her health, poisoned her heart and doomed her.' Yes, this is very like most marriages around the world, but it's not the crux to build a compelling work of art around. At least a novice writer like Jin cannot do so. Waiting, despite its Political Correctness, is not a terrible book, merely yet another bad book that should never have been published. But, when did that ever stop PC from giving out laurels?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"After reading Ha Jin's collection of short stories (&quot;Bridegroom&quot;), I eagerly anticipated visiting a full novel, more to see if this writer of succinct, crystalline prose could maintain interest over the course of a complete tale. &quot;Waiting&quot; succeeds on every level. Not only does his clarity of vision and description of the most minute bits of beauty in his created world remain intact, he caresses his reader with simple people, simple situations, simple outcomes that make the overall effect of his novels simply heroic. The story of the ideals and frustrations of waiting for the right way only to find at the end of the day that the waiting dislodged the pleasure of what was already in place - this simple lesson is universal, tender, heartrending, and wholly understandable. Ha Jin distills life into a prism of words that reflect and refract life. What a rewarding and refreshing writer he is. The National Book Award was justly deserved!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.-WaitingSo begins Ha Jin's aptly named novel. Lin Kong is a country born doctor now practicing at an Armyhospital in Muji City in Maoist China. There he has fallen in love with a nurse, Manna Wu, a modernurban woman. But his country wife, Shuyu, refuses to grant him a divorce, despite the lovelessness oftheir arranged marriage. The moral strictures of Communist society are sufficiently severe that LinKong and Manna Wu are forced to wait until Shuyu gives her okay, which she continues to withholdwhile her daughter by Lin Kong is growing up. Thus, the lovers are forced into a decades longholding pattern, until Lin Kong compares himself to a sleepwalker and wonders if he's not more inlove with an illusion than with a real being.Though this story is sometimes maddeningly slow, it is quite beautifully told, in very direct andstripped down language, and does develop a certain tension as we wait for Shuyu to set Lin Kong free.Along the way Ha Jin, who was himself a Red Army soldier, provides a fascinating cultural history ofChina in the 60s and 70s. But the real power of the story is allegorical. Lin Kong wants to shuck offthe traditional China (Shuyu) and embrace the new, modern, Communist China (Manna). But as theprocess of attaining the new drags on, with no fulfillment in sight, he begins to question why hewanted Manna in the first place, wonders whether he even retains the capacity to love, or whether thecontinuous deferral of love and suspension of life has emotionally paralyzed him, and grows nostalgicfor Shuyu and the more traditional China of the village he grew up in.One imagines this must somewhat parallel Ha Jin's own experience, and/or that of many people heknew in China. At any rate, he deftly takes one of the oldest of romantic plots--the dependable anddecent spouse abandoned for the sexier, but ultimately illusory, lover--and imposes the story ofCommunist China upon it. It works quite well and makes up for the at times too stately pace of thestory-telling.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I &quot;read&quot; this book on audio, and at times I thought how interesting the book was, and at times I was bored. The last third of the book was definitely the best. It was hard to be sympathetic to any of the characters except Shuyu, the dutiful wife. I felt very sorry for her. Lin Kong, the absent husband was a very weak man, with no passion in his life for anyone or anything. At times I was angry with the characters, at times (a few), I felt sorry for them, and at times I was disgusted with them. However, they were real people, with all the faults that go along with being human. Perhaps what I liked best about the book was its description of communist China. It is hard not to have a morbid fascination with the country. The culture is so completely, totally different from American culture; it is hard to fathom living in a country in which the individual simply has no value as an individual. It is definitely one of the books that will stick with me a while."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This novel allowed me a clear and vivid visualisation of the daily life of the central characters, and enriched my understanding of the cultural climate of China during that period. I found the personality composition of the leading characters to be refreshingly balanced between human strengths and weaknesses. A good read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A rather complex read, in that the language is often beautful, but the characters are difficult to care about. By the end of the novel, one hardly cares what the resolution is. One just hopes the waiting is over. On the other hand, our book club had to 'dig deep' in discussing this book, which many members disliked initially, and found interesting cross cultural and historical aspects of the novel to sustain our conversation. \\\\"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The familiar, ironic Chinese &quot;wish,&quot; or curse, is that you &quot;live in interesting times.&quot; In this serene, miraculously modulated narrative, Ha Jin's protagonist and other main characters pass through interesting times indeed--the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the period of &quot;opening&quot; to the US and, later, the broader world, and, finally, the post Mao period of Deng Xiaoping's reforms--with their humanity intact. Needless to say, Jin's lives are warped by external political and sociocultural forces, but, to a much greater extent than such works as Chen Jo-hsi's wonderful The Execution of Mayor Yin and whole shelves of memoirs from the Cultural Revolution decade, Waiting underscores the possibility of human relationships during a &quot;scoundrel time.&quot; Although the book's final third moves toward outcomes that are somewhat trite and predictable, Ha Jin is a carefully observant guide who details the mores and folkways of his native society in anthropological detail, using these details in dabs to create a delicately wrought pointillistic tableau. Waiting satisfies at several levels and deserves a broad readership, and not only among admirers of literary fiction but, particularly, in undergraduate sociology and political science courses that now depict the Cultural Revolution, and Chinese society of the Mao period in general, either through horror stories or hagiograhical tales of failed idealism. Ha Jin's book has an honest texture of true lives lived."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Beautifully written and very moving, the characters in this book are portrayed with the utmost sympathy and yet without rationalization or romanticizing. I have a hard time understanding some of the negative reviews that complain the book is too long or goes nowhere. It was much more of a pleasure to read than a lot of the lowbrow genre fiction I read for entertainment. I never felt that there was a single wasted sentence."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book amazed me with its seeming simplicity somehow expressing the depths of complicated emotions. The writer put me in China complete with smells and sounds from the natural world."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Upon the completion of this novel one may very well find himself shaking his head. What was that all about? Is that it? The thing is, there's not much of a story here. A Chinese doctor, Lin Kong, during and after the time period of Mao, marries a woman he never loved, then spends the next eighteen years trying to divorce her. He wants to marry his girlfriend instead, the one he believes he truly loves. He finally gets his wish, and realizes that things aren't as great as he thought they would be.Knowing that this takes place during the time of Communist suppression, one might be led to believe that the novel would be an indictment of totalitarian society. But it is not. At least overtly. To be sure, the effects it has on everyone are apparent. Because of the dictate of some high-ranking, now-deceased bureaucrat years earlier, for example, one may not get a divorce without the permission of one's wife. And he is not even able to carry on with his girlfriend secretly. As an army officer, on an army base, extra-marital activity could lead to his dismissal from the army, or at the very least, a transfer to a remote area far away from his girlfriend. And there are comments occasionally, unrelated to the plot, having to do with the confiscation of banned books and China's one-child-per-family policy, which began in the seventies.But again, this is not the focus. The focus really is on Lin, and how he perceives he should live his life, according to his own standards and the standards set by society. He is an honorable man. So he marries Shuyu at his parent's insistence. She is a country girl, with her geese and her chickens, and despite the fact that she is a year younger than him, she looks about ten years older. Her hair is in a strict bun, her hands are calloused, and worst of all, her feet were bound in her youth, a sure sign of rural backwardness. He does not even wish to be seen with her. So she stays behind in the country to take care of his ailing parents and his only child. Every year he returns to ask her for a divorce. To please him--her only goal in life seems to be to please him--she agrees. And every year, at the last minute, she backs out of it.In the meantime his relationship with Manna, the girlfriend, becomes strained as the years go by. Their love for one another remains physically unconsummated--at his insistence, not hers--and by the time he finally gets his wish to marry her they are both well into middle-age. Complications ensue.It is in reflection that one discovers that this has in fact been a very thought-provoking piece. Lin's adherence--to his honor, to his country, to his family--has resulted in nothing more than waiting. His own waiting, Manna's waiting, and tragically, the waiting of the most honorable of them all."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Loved this book, captures the dilemma of many people over the years in a country which is close to my heart."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This story built me up and half way through let me down the rest of the way. This was the classic tale of a man in a emotional affair with another woman yet he strings her along for years wasting her youth and emotionally abusing his faithful, non complaining wife back at home with their child.I found this story to be painfully drawn out which in itself does hold true for some lives and in this sense I found the book realistic but not the man's 'saint' like attitude towards the opposite sex. His emotional mistress ( which he has not slept with) ages and becomes bitter but then is raped by a friend of the main character.The rape is detailed and unnecessary and to make matters worse , the rapist never gets his due and becomes wealthy and successful. Yeah I don't like that.Emotionally stunted main character who by his lack of conviction makes two women miserable. He himself seems minimally affected and content to go on like this forever if not for his pushy mistress. At the end of the story I could not believe it. After finally getting what he wants, his divorce from his wife he marries his mistress. There is no big love scene or sex scene, it just sort of falls in to a sour relationship which guess what folks? he wants out of but since he didn't have the minerals to make his first marriage work, he doesn't have the minerals to make this one work either. His ex-wife, who now lives close by her ex-husband ,sends that message that she will wait for him ( either until his new wife dies or he grows a pair I assume)The writer does do a beautiful job describing life and situations in communist china which I appreaciated so that is why this book got two stars.I'll go poke my eyes out now."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I am a sucker for books set in China, especially during the Cultural Revolution, and this did not disappoint. The setting is so engaging, and the writing is beautiful. The characters were engaging, but almost mysterious, in that I never truly understood their motivations. That did not make it any less enjoyable of a read, though. I liked it very much."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"For me, this book is an observation of human nature, i.e craving for something that we don't have, come to regret it later when we have already attained what we are wanting for, &amp; wondering what life would be like should we maintain status quo. Matter of the heart is never black &amp; white but constantly entrapped us in the &quot;gray&quot; area where we are seeking for answers but none we shall find. Rather, we just have to take life as it comes. Along the way, we also come across the ever changing &quot;political storms&quot; that swept through China over many years. What &amp; who would be deemed the right ideologies &amp; model citizen of the moment respectively would become the news of yesterday. To put it succinctly, the only certainty in life is uncertainty. The novel also explores how human behaviour is effected by their surroundings &amp; the system that has been imposed upon them. What I'm finding intriguing is the ability of the author to interweave many issues together &amp; to narrate them as one simple tale. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a straightforward, gorgeous book, written in elegant, charming prose. It makes you think about the difficulties of sustaining relationships and the abusudity of human institutions. What could be better than that?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"After reading several negative reviews, I approached this novel with some trepidation. However, I wanted to read it for two reasons. First, it won that National Book Award. Second, I have a daughter from China and I want to read and understand as much as I can about China and the Chinese people. I took much more away from this novel than I thought I would.Ha Jin's prose flows so easy, I found myself reading through this book much faster than I anticipated. His writing has a sparseness that suggests a poetic back ground. Like poetry, it also describes the scenes in ways that really pulled me into the book. The politics of China were presented almost without comment. It is only through the actions of the characters that we really see how the regime affects their day to day lives.Despite all this, Waiting gives us something even better and more universal. Too often we are all waiting for something. Waiting for a relationship or a better job. Waiting for a vacation or a visit with a friend. We are planning for something to come. Yet, while we are waiting, our lives move by us. Isn't this really the point of the novel?Lin Kong waited eighteen years. For what? To wait some more?Stop waiting and buy this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Review from a 28 year old Asian female:As a Chinese American, it is always nice to read a book written by an Asian author. What's nicer is that this book is not the usual tale about an Asian individual going to America trying to cope with cultural differences! What a relief!This book was beautifully written with a hopeful storyline, but it failed to culminate in a satisfying conclusion. I waited and waited for something that never happened. I felt betrayed, as if the author was leading me on. Overall, it was an average read. Not especially intriguing, but I was able to get through it without too much effort."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The reader spends the greater part of this book waiting and rooting for the love between Manna Wu and Lin to materialize and bring them happiness. Their circumstances prohibit consummation, allowing them only a prolonged platonic relationship. While implausible from today's American perspective where divorce and adultery come easy, the situation is understandable in the Communist Chinese setting. Tight control is exerted over personal lives with divorce very rarely permitted. The punishment for adultery for modern military colleagues threatens them with permanent geographic separation. When longing for fulfillment is replaced with discord ensuing from blame and fault finding, deep disappointment overcomes both the reader and protagonists. It is at this very point that Ha Jin's profound sense of irony takes over. In the final act we see the stage set for yet another surprising entirely unexpected wait, one that promises with the book's last sentence to be another long one. Ha Jin's irony extends to the broad changes he has witnessed in his native China during this time period as well. The book's early events occur during the Cultural Revolution. Books must be hidden to prevent destruction. The treasured contents of a locked jewelry box turn out to be just Chairman Mao pins, the only beautiful material collection possible. In contrast modern day Chinese television programs today feature wealthy capitalistic entrepreneurs as paragons of a new society. Some have even been rewarded with Party Membership. Are we seeing a return to the Old China symbolized by the waiting faithful Shuyu with her bound feet after a disappointing flaunt with the modern woman? The author's plot and writing style are simple and easy to read on the surface. His hidden insights on society and human relationships make this a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In some ways, this amazing novel is best described by telling what it is not. It is not an &quot;epic,&quot; and it was not written with the film rights in mind. You don't hear the soundtrack somewhere in the back of your head, nor do you get to &quot;identify with&quot; or &quot;love&quot; the characters. One of its central characters is rather shy, timid, and nonverbal. Ha Jin does not tell the reader how to feel - or what to think. There is no sly authorly manipulation of our emotions. Ha Jin tells an important and essentially sad story which he narrates with control and purpose.John Lennon said that &quot;Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,&quot; and this novel makes that point, among others. The story unfolds during a specific time (1960's) and place (People's Republic of China). A group of people is caught in lives over which they have varying degrees of control. Ha Jin fleshes out his characters - but just enough. This story is written concisely and economically.This is a quiet, strong, meaningful, and heartfelt novel. Its quietude and lack of melodrama - its remarkable menus are often the most colorful aspects of its characters daily lives - serve its humane and important message. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"It really did. I bought Waiting because of the attention it had been getting, winning and being nominated for major literary awards. Because I usually read African-American literature, I usually don't have a lot of opportunity reading other literature. I have to be very selective. My discussion board was down this past week, so I stole the moment to read Waiting. I adored it. I can't say what I was expecting, but the book floored me. Beautiful, beautiful prose. Words like subtle, and graceful comes to mind. Three lives; Lin Kon, Shuyu and Manna Wu are bound together through their individual concept of love and what one has to do to obtain and keep it. Where we are use to stories in which the main characters leap head first into passionate affairs and lustful relationships, Ha Jin chose to focus on a love affair where the participants had to be patient and restraint. There are moments of great beauty and an insight into human nature. Truly a novel not to be missed."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"To me Waiting was a poor man's Remains of the Day, a story of life deferred because of the main character's willingness to conform to convention (in this case, the government of Communist China). For many years a man who has no sense of committment to anything but his advancement in a stultifying bureacratic world refuses to act on his love for a young woman. Life passes them both by. The communist mentality influences every aspect of their lives. The story is tediously slow, going over the same ground over &amp; over. I subsequently read a book about the effects of the communtist mentality which moved me greatly and deepened my understanding of a people wounded psychologically, economically, and politically by the forces of communism--that was Memory of the Forest which is a beautifully written novel with beautiful character development and a gripping narrative. In Waiting you just wait for the characters to gain insight or to do something that is interesting, and it just doesn't happen. How did this book end up as a National Book Award finalist? Please explain."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a spare and elegant novel, one of quiet emotions that never threatens to overwhelm. The story centers on Lin Kong and his failed (and arranged) marriage to the plain and rustic Shuyu. Although Lin has not slept with Shuyu since the birth of their daughter years before, he must remain married to her. For without Shuyu's consent, Lin cannot obtain a divorce for eighteen years.A doctor in a medical school in a small Manchurian city, Lin goes home to Goose Village every summer to ask Shuyu for a divorce so he can marry the woman with whom he is passionately in love, the youthful and beautiful student nurse, Manna. Although very much in love, Lin and Manna eschew physical intimacy believing Lin will be expelled from the army if they are ever caught.Although Shuyu does consider giving Lin a divorce, she always changes her mind at the last minute and this is where the waiting of the title comes in. While Lin is waiting for Shuyu to grant him his freedom, he and Manna conduct their &quot;affair&quot; hemmed in by Party rules and regulations and the sharp tongues of the hospital gossips. Ha Jin does a wonderful job of portraying Lin's stunted emotions and drawn-out tensions, which are engendered by the pressure put upon him by both of the women in his life, Shuyu and Manna.The English-speaking public has been exposed to very little &quot;real&quot; Chinese fiction. Chinese literature in translation has not enjoyed the popularity of Latin American literature, Russian literature or even Japanese. There have also been no &quot;crossover&quot; Chinese authors such as Japan's Haruki Murakami or South America's Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Mario Vargas Llosa. And Chinese writers do share a penchant for the purple and the political; they tend to be melodramatic and over-the-top, something that makes them a little unpopular with English-speaking readers. Chinese writers living in the West, such as Amy Tan, Lisa See and Maxine Hong Kingston, despite their genealogical background, are really as much outsiders to China as are those with no ties to the country at all. In essence, their writing, while good, is not really &quot;Chinese.&quot;Ha Jin manages to overcome all of the above. Although he now lives in the United States and wrote Waiting in English, he is a native of China and he manages to depict his country of birth without indulging in the romanticism, exoticism or Orientalism so prevalent among native Chinese (and Indian) writers of today.In Waiting, Ha Jin gives us a perfect look at the city and countryside of northeast China in the 1960s to the 1980s. The setting is perfectly rendered, with a beautiful eye for mundane, but telling, detail. Although Jin never stresses the deprivation of life in Communist China, it is painfully evident in this book. Fruits, vegetables and even medicines are expensive and rare; a wedding feast may consist of no more than cigarettes and candy; doctors at a medical school must live three to a dorm room and bathe in a communal bathhouse. Even the more simple pleasures are denied: one of the rules forbids unmarried men and women to meet in the hospital compound, thus preventing Lin and Manna from consummating the love they share.This novel can be said to comprise a part of the &quot;wounded literature&quot; (shanghen wenxue) of China's Cultural Revolution, however, compared to the denunciations, struggles, beatings, incarcerations, executions and suicides included in other novels of that period, the suffering of Ha Jin's characters can appear to be mild. But that is a surface impression only. A deeper look at this book will show an astute reader that these characters do suffer greatly; Ha Jin is simply a more quiet and restrained writer, which is much to his credit, for it is in quietness and restraint that Waiting derives much of its power. The emotional and spiritual pressure the characters endure builds slowly, it has a cumulative effect, and the reader is left wondering when and how tragedy will occur.At its heart, Waiting is a novel about the ambiguities and tensions inherent in love, a universal theme. This is a masterfully written book and one that, ultimately, evokes the joys the sorrows and the quiet desperation of an ordinary life, whether that life be lived in Goose Village, Paris or Boston. Waiting is a wonderful book and one that is wonderfully-written as well. An absolutely unbeatable combination."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The prose is straightforward, elegant, precise, and powerful in an understated way. The novel has little in the way of melodramatic twists and major revelations, so readers looking for them would do better looking elsewhere. Instead, &quot;Waiting&quot; is about helpless lives swept along by political tides, about promises kept but not fulfilled. It's a distinctive vision that rewards a careful reading."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What struck me about Waiting by Ha Jin, was not necessarily what this novel said about love, but instead the way it used a love story to portray life in China under communist rule. At the heart of this novel is, as the title suggests, is waiting - but it is not waiting for love, instead it is waiting for the public acceptance of that love. The need for an outside source to defend and give validity to a relationship ultimately is that relationships destruction.Lin Kong is a doctor in the army, stationed in Muji City while his wife remains in the remote Goose Village to raise their daughter and care for her husband's ailing parents. While in Muji City, he falls in love for the first time with a nurse named Manna Wu. For the next 18 years, Lin is torn between the two women. He has never felt love for Shuyu, and never had the chance to let a love grow between them. What he feels for Manna is completely foreign to him, and over the years, as he waits for his wife to grant him a divorce, his feelings for Manna become something that he cannot explain or define.Every aspect of Shuyu, Lin and Manna's lives are controlled by the government and it marks every decision and move they make. Manna and Lin cannot be together because the army forbids it. Lin cannot divorce Shuyu because the government will not let him. When one character gets raped, she cannot tell anyone because the government would not believe her. It's a comedy of errors that is as heartbreaking and frustrating.This is not the first time that an author has used that concept of waiting to explain or define a corrupt government. One that always comes to mind for me is a movie: La Muralla Verde (The Green Wall) is a Peruvian film that uses the same mix of waiting, inevitability and senselessness; it is a very effective combination that, unfortunately, paints an accurate portrait. Waiting has received mixed reviews as a love story, but as tragedy it succeeds. Lin is a tragic character above all else, unable to rise above his own indecisiveness to have a fulfilled life. Instead it is a life filled with waiting, always waiting for the happiness and love that never come."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I had a chance to spy on a love triangle of ordinary people living and working in China. Lin Kong, a reserved military doctor. Manna, his younger girlfriend who works in the hospital and is afraid of becoming an old-maid, and his family-arranged wife Shoyu, who has bound feet and who politely will not grant a divorce. It's universal in it's complexity and dialogue, and there's lots the reader gets to learn about Chinese culture. Ha Jin's wonderful storytelling is the real gem of this rich read. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a really great story about what the passage of time can do to things. How it erodes and eats away at the value of things and relationships and emotions etc. Yet conversely, there was no waiting when reading this book. For sure it was a story told by a man because there was no time spent lingering too long on anything. It was perfectly paced. He just kept it moving and while you were reading you would know that something else was about to happen soon because the pace was predictable and that made it a great page turner too. The feminine voice of his female character was not ruined by the manly pace of the book. The setting is a Chinese military hospital. It's about a relationship between a couple who never consummate the affair because they wanted to wait to get a problem out of the way. but as the problem persisted, and the waiting went on and on, the waiting ate away at their deepest emotions and time threw everything including the bathtub and kitchen sink, causing them to question both their character and those deep feelings they once thought they held. This book is a great piece of literature and is perfect for a book club."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The title succinctly expresses the book's theme. The irony of the title is that all three main characters are waiting for something, but once that something materializes, it's anti-climactic. The reader does a lot of waiting, too, for something tragic to happen, but when it does, it's a bit of a surprise. Still, like the characters, the reader realizes at the end that the waiting was the best part."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"When I first picked up the book Waiting, I was immediately drawn to the NationalBook Award on its cover. Remembering the saying, \\"never judge a book by itscover\\", I disregarded my original rationale and opened to the prologue. Rightaway I was shocked at the authors pinpoint broadcast of the events. As I readon I decided that this, along with impeccable detail made for a productive andartsy way to present this sad love tale. At some points the plot seems predictable,until you reach the next chapter and are thrown from your allegation. Thisquick read novel is far from clich&eacute;. It outlines the important aspects ofsocial life, self responsibility and caring for others.The author's clever approach begins with introducing the main character. LinKong is a well respected doctor for the military, he's stationed away from hiswife and daughter in the town, Muji. Lin supports his family well, although hismarriage was arranged and he no longer loves his wife. His futile efforts todivorce his wife is due to the strict unwritten marriage laws of Chinesesociety. Lin's unhappiness with his wife Shuyu is the direct reason for hisdivorce attempts, but it is clear that his new friendship with his comrade Mannais the biggest factor. Lin loves his job and respects his marriage and does notwant to complicate them by having an affair. Year after year he returns homeand he and Shuyu face another judge to appeal their case. The year Shuyufinally promises to divorce Lin, Shuyu's brother Benshang interferes and tellsthe judge not to allow their relationship. Mean while Manna and Lin are gettingserious but don't know how far to take it. By means of a bylaw, Lin and Shuyuseparate, Lin still has to support his family financially. Lin and Manna marryand give birth to twins just in time to find their partner's wrinkly face andtired body, and realize the length of time that has passed by waiting for eachother.This Ha Jin masterpiece ends with an indeterminate resolution in a way that letsthe reader decide what the characters are thinking and their emotions. Afterreading the book, it is realized that the things that a person says and does ona day to day basis have more meaning than you might think. Take for instancewhen Lin went out of the house to tutor some nurses on chemistry. Manna wasleft pregnant with two twins and no one to help with the house work. While Linthought that he was helping other people learn chemistry, he was denying hisobligation to his wife. This book should be read by any newlywed or someonethat is thinking about marriage. This book reminds us all of our personalresponsibilities within our relationships, but it does so in an utterly subtleway that highlights the characters' realistic attributes and the plot's multipleclimaxes."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"HA JIN's Waiting is a quick read for me. I spend only one day to finish it off. But its simple narrative enthralled greatly. I am a native Chinese speaker and English is my second language, same as the author himself. But his command of the English language is really impressive. From the interviews of the author, we know that he treats his draft very seriously, often rewrites them more than ten times. Some vocabulary are definitely impressive, such as \\"nippy\\",\\"french chalk\\", \\"kraft paper\\", \\"dog-dead\\", \\"wisp\\", etc. His narrative has a rather fixed plot - first, some hope for marriage, then some diversions, either a potential mate, a sexual encounter, it makes the waiting more unexpected, as a supposed long march to marriage. once in a while he will describe the physical environment such as the polar trees, grass, the sentry post, which reminds me a Brownte novel. The historical context is always present. the cultural revolution, the reform after Deng. Ha Jin described what he know best, namely the chinese army. He served in the PLA for a number of years before enrolling in the university after 1977. This background will reapprear in his newest novel, WAR TRASH, in which he described the wrenching expierence of a chinese POW in the Korean War. I reject some reviews which read too much politics in the novel though. This novel is basically a novel about humanity, love, relationship, society, not about ideology. Both Manna WU and the protagonist is not ideologically inclined to anything, all they believe is humanity and progress. that is all. This novel reminds me a recent short fiction by JIAN MA in on recent issue of New Yorker, in which a mid-level party official try to get rid of his baby-girl fruitlessly, for consecutively dozens of times. I suspect some borrowing here, I mean on the part of JIAN MA. But obviously JIAN MA is shadowing more family planning politics in his short fiction."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I have to agree with many other reviews on this one. I spent the first 100 pages of this novel waiting for the story to pick up the pace. The story is about a love affair in perpetuity. Manna Wu and Lin Kong are comrades and soul mates who meet while working at a hospital in China during the Cultural Revolution. The relationship has one huge hurdle, Lin is married. Although the marriage was arranged by his parents and based on the parents' need for elderly care, Lin is bound to the union by tradition and law. Each year, Lin returns to his village from his job in the city to request the court to grant him a divorce from his wife. Each year, the request is denied and Lin returns to the city where he and Manna's relationship grow more intense - the absence of any physical expression of their love also serves to intensify their bond. Finally, after waiting eighteen years, Lin is granted a divorce from his wife with the understanding that he is to pay alimony and find their daughter a job in the city. He and Manna are married and begin their life legitimately as husband and wife. Lin, newly married - and unlike his previous marriage, living with his wife - finds the daily demands of marriage exhausting. Soon, Lin begins to questions his love for Manna and his decision to leave his first wife.Ultimately, the novel explores the nature of love and personal commitment in the face of social and government restrictions. Although \\"Waiting\\" starts off slow, it picks up a bit in the later half of the book. Ha Jin does an excellent job with setting and depicting the Chinese atmosphere during the Cultural Revolution. This wasn't a bad read, just a slow one. Perhaps it was the author's intent to have the reader experience waiting in the way the characters do. So, is the grass greener on the other side? Well, like most things, it depends on the eyes through which the observation is being made. I'm not suggesting that you run out and buy this one but if it crosses your path give it a try."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I also read this book immediately after Arthur Golden's &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; and agree that the writing styles are in stark contrast to one another. But the point is not to be &quot;lyrical,&quot; as the other reviewer suggests.I found myself transported, each chapter moving slowly but purposefully to the next.Although the narrative seemed to drag a bit in places, Ha Jin's light touch lends the story a subtle urging throughout. Despite the pity you feel for Lin's faithful but unloved wife, the longing between Lin and Manna is heartbreaking, lingering on for years while circumstances keep them at arm's length from one another. Some might call the ending anti-climactic, but I thought it only made the story stronger and all the more compelling."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; is a well crafted tale that will elicit thoughtful discusion in a book club. The characters may be hard to relate to given the setting and the culture but that is precisely what makes the book interesting. The order and simplicity of the lifestyles portrayed allow the underlying question of &quot;What IS love?&quot; to be revealed.With prose that is clear and never distracting, Ha Jin weaves in irony and resolution for a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I found this an engrossing look at life in modern China--it's hard for us in the West to grasp the restrictions--not only political but personal--that these characters lived under. But on a deeper level this book is about home, and tradition--the annual visits home were beautifully described--watch especially for the character's description of the food he eats in the country as opposed to the city. I loved the description of the simple country wife--her shopping list. Her stubborn patience, asking nothing for herself, is something no Western woman could ever understand."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Personally, I loved the book and found it very philosophical. However, I admit it didn't end as I expected, and so therefore required much thought afterwards, such as in the choices I've made in my love affairs--when I was passive (and waited) and when I was not. I believe no matter how well-calculated decisions can be, we are never totally free from outside influences and pressures. There are no fouled-up choices, only ones that lead to opportunities for something else, hopefully something better, as this applies to love, politics, health, etc."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; turned me into an enthusiastic Ha Jin fan. I cannot exactly describe the book as a page turner but it's interesting and downright suspenseful towards the end. The story is an unsentimental one about feelings, often deep feelings of love and yearning. Jin has an irrepressibly wry sense of humor. I chuckled throughout the book.I feel sorry for those who got turned off by the first several chapters and never finished the book. In simple and un-flowery language, Jin reminds this reader - who struggled through the slow beginning - that the heart sometimes has to hibernate, and even die in order for the body to survive in a cold and repressive environment. And who hasn't experienced the disappointment after a long wait, and the regret after a careless loss?"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I was excited to read this National Book Award winner, but wow, did it start slowly. The first two parts of the book are tedious and depressing, but once the third part begins, the author shows us why he is so acclaimed. This is definitely a book that sticks in your head after you finish it.I often wanted to kick some sense and emotion in to the head of the main character, Lin, and finally realized this is exactly what the author wants the reader to feel. The book was a great insight in to people living their life as tools in a restrictive society."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This work was excellent, loved it from page one. fascinating discussion of life in that period, with some great themes running throughout.i now plan to find more works by this author and hopefully devour them with the same appetite that the first few pages of waiting instilled in me.i recommended this to everyone I know, well almost, I didnt recommend it to my impatient friends who would be better of reading a book based on a movie like terminator 2"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"'Waiting', by Ha Jin is an interesting exporation into the nature of love as the novel travels between cultures and across years. Lin Kong, an army doctor, is held between two worlds: He lives and works in an army camp near the city where he waits with his girfriend Manna Wu for the divorce that will allow them to marry. For two weeks of each year, he visits his wife, Shuyu, in provincial Goose village. Each year he attempts to secure a divorce. Each year, he fails.Ha Jin makes subtle use of the flow of political and cultural change in the People's Republic to provide an intricately drawn backdrop to Lin Kong's life at the hospital. Meanwhile, Goose village remains relatively unchanged. It is a timeless place of dirt floors and hard work. It is a place in which Shuyu's bound feet, frugal ways and quiet devotion to an absentee husband make her a peerless wife - and Lin's attempts to divorce her absurd in the eyes of the villagers and local judges.While Ha Jin does a wonderful job of bringing the times and places in 'Waiting' to life, he is less successful with his female characters. Neither woman, Manna Wu or Shuyu, is fully developed. Both are architypes - revealing much in general about the kind of women they represent in large, but lacking the spark of soul that would bring them to life in the mind's eye of the reader.This last is the great failure of 'Waiting'. The author's view of love in its many forms and ways is seen through the filter of an uwaveringly male viewpoint. Ha Jin never succeeds at getting inside the hearts and minds of the women in his story. The wants and needs of Shuyu and Manna are built on little more than duty and tradition on one hand and the fear of ending up alone on the other. This turns what might have been a great book and a memorable story into just another week at the book club."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is spare writing, the kind Mark Twain had in mind when he apologized to an audience by saying he'd have written a shorter speech if only he'd had time to write one. A highly disciplined writer, Ha Jin only gives us the words that matter. Despite the lean, elegant prose, the story and characters are down to earth and richly understood. They are as real and complex and endearing and frustrating as your friends and family, but we know them better because Jin lets us spend time inside their heads. And despite Hemingway-esque word and sentence lengths, the lingering effect isn't cynicism and emotional sterility. Kindness and warmth underly most of the warped relationships here. What's most original about this book is the plot structure. How does Jin manage to keep us moving forward when we already know how the story turns out? I want to re-read the book to figure that one out; all I know is he kept me going. Oh, but don't get me wrong -- there are intriguing twists ... all the way up to the last page. Only one plot line struck me as implausible and devoid of truth-like detail, but I don't want to give that away. (It's a trauma that falls to Manna Wu.) An added bonus: The backdrop for the story is China's cultural revolution, a fascinating study in change and human nature. This &quot;insider's view&quot; personalizes history for us, fleshing out the emotional content within one of the world's greatest political experiments. Our book club (six people) gave this a thumbs up, though we were divided in our degree of enthusiasm. Raves came from those of us who particularly admire understated beauty. Others in our group merely enjoyed the book and felt they'd learned some things about China."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"\\"Waiting\\" is the story of the long relationship between Lin Kong, a doctor of the Chinese Army and Manna Wu a nurse who works in his same hospital. Lin feels in love with Manna but he is married and moral rules are very strict in the Communist China. Although every year he tries to divorce his wife to end his loveless marriage he always finds a refusal on her side and he is forced to postpone his plans. Trapped between two different women he leads his life, in quite desperation, waiting for happier times.In spite of the very good description of the Chinese habits, environment and customs during the period of the Cultural Revolution this is not a book about China or, at least, only about China. I think that the main themes of the story are about men's life styles and attitudes. The story, although China during the period described is a very favourable set, could have happened in every other place and time. Lin is presented as a very considerate and sensible person. These qualities and the subsequent fears of hurting others bring this character to an unnerving state of paralysis. Sometimes this lack of action might be unnerving to the reader who sees the lives of the characters going by without major events.I found this book exceptionally enlightening especially for the way it ends. It really makes the reader think about life and about the soundness of our aims. As Tolstoy wrote in \\"what men live by\\" referring to a character that ordered a pair of shoes when he actually needed slippers because the next day he was going to die: men really do not know what they need."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I don't believe it is fair for me to review the plot, the storyline or the character development in this book. I liked the book for the insight I believe I received into Chinese society, thinking and view of relationships. Even though fiction, I felt special in reading this book. I felt as if I knew the characters, could understand their very oriental motivations and could appreciate the beautiful analogies and words that describe the situations and the characters' reactions. I feel that Ha Jin has enhanced my understanding of a great many things as a result of reading his fiction."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I knew nothing about this book before it was nominated for and won the National Book Award. But then curiousity got the better of me, and once I began reading this tale set in China, I gulped dpown the pages of this intriguing novel.Ha Jin, who teaches at Emory University in Atalnta, has written a well constructed tale set agains the political climate of Commusinst China almost 30 years ago.The main character, Lin Kong, a doctor tries year after year to obtain a divorce from his country wife whom he only married so she would take care of his aging parents. But Lin Kong works in a a large city most of the year where he has a mistress who is urging him to marry her after all this time. And while his city mistress is more worldly than his country wife, it still doesn't change the fact that every year there are stumbling blocks to Lin being free to marry anyone.And in an ironic twist worthy of O. Henry or Alfred Hitchcock, by the book's end Lin King is found still waiting.I really enjoyed this book and while I'm not sure it should have won the National Book Award I do think its well written and very interesting."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"As a fan of Ha Jin's short stories, I was pretty disappointed by this book. The plot moves along well in the first part: we witness the romance of two young medical professionals who have a certain chemistry, but cannot take any action due to the restrictive communist China. Jin's critiques of China during that time period are alternately banal and riveting: we all know that corrupt bureaucrats are bad, but most of us probably didn't know that people were so controlled by the government that men would have wet dreams for lack of outlets for their sexuality.Unfortunately, most of the really interesting details about China appear early on, and we have to settle in for a long slog through the rest of the book with some very predictable villains that do little to break the monotony. Some sketches of the attitudes of people who inhabit one of the main character's villages feel alive, but apart from these breaks, Jin's story follows a lifeless plot arc. The ending allows us a little more psychological understanding of the male protagonist, but it is too little, too late to save this book from falling into some of the most predictable tropes that have been approved by the corporate-liberal establishment that seems to vote on the National Book Award. What tropes do I speak of? Among them are excellent craft, a critical yet compassionate look into a foreign culture, persistent progressive themes such as women's rights and the need for economic mobility, gritty description of traumatic events from a politically correct viewpoint, and epic scope. None of these things are bad, but it's not good when they feel like they're in a book just for the sake of being in there, adding nothing to the exigence of the story. My rating of this book is lower than it might have been because the National Book Award boosted my hopes for it. I've noticed that recent recipients of this award seem to go to a sort of \\"lowest-common-denominator\\" work that touches on the tropes I've named above rather than really saying anything new. It's too bad; if I had to sum up this book in a single sentence, I'd say that it's a simplified version of Love in the Time of Cholera about boring, prudish people."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is 300 pages of nothing going on.

This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful.

I suppose it did not hold the allure to 'read me now' when I first obtained it. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally picked it up. Waiting tells the story of a man torn between two women and two lives during the Cultural Revolution in China. I found the author to have tremendous insight into matters of the heart within the framework of Chinese culture. Lyrical prose, an interesting story and perspective, and incisive insight into the human heart all contribute to make this a great novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a book I hhad been wanting to read for a long time and finally managed to complete while waiting out the last days of my pregnancy.

I read and read and did enjoy the process but was disappointed with the final course."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I liked this book a lot.

The &quot;plot&quot; never thickened - and the characters plodded through years of waiting while remaining uninteresting and predictable. I myself waited and waited to get caught up in the story - but only landed up waiting for it to be over!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I enjoy reading books by Asian authors. Their stories are sometimes exotic and other times very familiar. Ha Jin's portrayal of China and people living in China seemed brutally honest. I was taken to another place and another time. I got to understood the characters' emotions and behaviors in the context of the time and culture. And I enjoyed the experience. That is why I continue to read books by Asian authors. However, at the end, I am brought back. I recognized Lin's feeling of ambivalence and identified with him living his life from a third person perspective and trying to sort out many emotions and thoughts to draw the bigger picture, to construct one's life. That message transcends time and cultural borders. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'm about 2/3 through the book. I've learned enough about it to have an opinion. After all, you don't wait till the very last page to discover a book great. I'm Chinese. The story sounds totally trite to me, the writing ranges from tolerable to awful. Come on, you native English-speakers. English is my second language, if I can see this, shouldn't it be obvious to you? Can't you see his uneven vocabulary (well-grown in his garden and menagerie but thin elsewhere) and his consciousness of his sentences. Ther are parts that read like intructions you find on Chinese products. It boggles the mind that a book like this has won such prestigious awards. I don't recognize any more that this is the land that has given the world such writers as Nathanial Hawthorn, Henry James, or even Henry Miller, grumpy as he was. I don't have much against the book, it has the right to be published and read. But such high praises? You folks are funny. As a matter of fact, if this book was written as a memoir, it would deserve a few more merits. I just read Morris Berman's The Twilight of American Culture, in which the author claims that few Americans read serious books any more. The reader's comments here provide ample evidence to me. The majority have even lost their ability to tell good English from bad (even more amazing some are among the top 1000 reviewers here. Slow down, folks, chew a little more, good for your stomach). A great book should appeal to all people, it would be really weird if it appeals mostly to people outside of the culture it is writing about. Imagine a book about the Holocaust that fails to impress the jews. What is its intrinsic worth going to be? This story is a folk story, at best. It has no depth, psychologically or otherwise. The author's translation of Chinese song lyrics, chinese idioms, etc, are, in most cases, inexact and ungraceful. His use of the term Manchuria at the beginning of Part 1, ch 1, shows his lack of knowledge of history(quite basic). &quot;Manchuria&quot; was a name used for the northeartern provinces of China at the time when it was occupied by the Japanese invaders. It is insulting to the Chinese. No Chinese patriots use that name today. Of course, the author might not consider himself Chinese. I understand. The episode where Whitman's poems are concerned was unlikely to happen at the time. I bet it is there because the author was impressed by them while he was a student here in the US. No crime, but sounds unreal to my Chinese ears. But these are minor charges. For me a novel should be first and foremost an art of language, which this book is anything but. I've read somewhere that the author himself claims to have been benefited by studying Chekhov. Sorry. I've studied Chekhov myself. I don't see a shadow of Chekhov here, perhaps he meant a poor translation of Chekhov. Keep reading books like this, native English speakers. you are helping me to see greater hope for my own English. An earlier reviewer has hit the nail right on the head when s/he said, &quot;This book would have been vastly improved by being written in Chinese and then translated by a competent translator.&quot; I feel generous today, so I give it 2 stars."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"When I finished this book I felt like the characters in Waiting For Godot. These characters wait and wait for someone who never comes. Like them, I waited for the reason this book won prestigious awards to appear and, like Godot, it never did. I finally decided that the reason it won was its comment upon life in Communist China. Unlike some of your reviewers I found no humor in the book but I do understand those who thought it political commentary. To decide thus is to rationalize that one has not wasted her time in reading it.Alas,one could take the cynical view that such puts a book in the running for prizes. Still, I would recommend it--just not too highly. The social commentary is interesting and the theme unusual. Additionally, while I do not agree that the characters necessarily deserved their lot it was definetly not a Hollywood ending. It is also a quick read and enjoyable if one does not expect a stellar work."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is not a book that evokes strong emotions. I found it mildly moving, mildly humorous, mildly involving. The reviews I read in the New York Times Book Review and other places lead me to expect something more. It wasn't a chore to finish it but I was left vaguely unsatisfied- like after finishing a light snack when you are hungry for a meal."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I admired the Professor's ability to write in English, whose first language is Chinese. I know how hard it's. But the book just described a plain story, too be honest, just by using plain words, nothing exciting to read, nothing to think about after finishes."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Although I liked certain aspects of this book and the somewhat spare style with which it was written, I found it terribly depressing. The whole part about not being able to divorce year after slogging year was a bit too much for me."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A little boring, but a smooth read. Definitely gets across the idea and feeling of Waiting as you keep waiting for something to happen in the story. The characters were difficult to like, but the story shows how waiting a lifetime can affect people differently. 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"One of my favorite books. Ha Jin manages to create a spectacular novel where it is so serious, yet so funny at the same time. A page-turner. I would recommend this book, even to those who are not familiar with Asian literature. You will enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book demonstrates the culture, habits, and politics of communist China, and also, it is a love story. While reading, however, I found that army doctor Lin Kong remained remote and uninteresting, more an allegorical everyman rather than a fully developed character. Manna Wu, the nurse at his hospital with whom he's been having a secret relationship, has a little more personality but is still not all that likeable.Lin cannot get a divorce from his loveless, embarrassing (she has bound feet) arranged marriage without consent from his wife until 18 years have passed. He promises Manna that he will try, summer after summer when he goes home to his village, but he never succeeds. His repulsion for his wife increases, as does his secret ardor for Manna, but even early on the reader can sense that all is not what it appears to be, for rather than Manna Wu herself, Lin has fallen in love with the anticipatory, things-are-going-to-change nature of waiting. And also he loves the allure of what he cannot have, which seems to be the ironic political moral of Ha Jin's story.Because of the beautiful descriptions and the capsule of Chinese life that is experienced through the novel, I definitely recommend _Waiting_. However, I think it would help to go into the book knowing that it is a parable rather than a romance. I know it would have helped me."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I never knew that Emory had such an incredible writer for one of its English professors when I went to law school there. Had I known, I would have audited one of his classes. I absolutely loved this book. Ha Jin's style is so simple and straight forward, yet honest and compelling. I was amazed by the depth of Lin's (main character)thoughts on love and marriage and not surprised by his inner conflict between wanting a marriage based on love and mutual respect (Manna) and comfort and peace as represented by his wife Shuyu. Lin's liberal ideas nonetheless lead him back to his parents' foregone conclusion that a wife should be someone that makes your life comfortable. There is so much detail in this book that shows where a man's heart is. So many cliches are embedded in a very subtle way and ring true even in a culture so different from ours(such as 'the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,' since Shuyu's cooking seems to represent comfort,peace and stability on Lin's visits home). Lin's inaction and passivity is at times frustrating but in any case realistic and consistent, both with respect to his love-life (or lack thereof) and his acceptance of the political ideas that surround him. Lin is such a typical character in so many ways, who's trapped in an atypical situation. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book lives up to its title. I was waiting the entire time for something to happen! While the ending is interesting, the book drags unbelievably on its way there. The character of the wife is a particularly interesting one---whom we do not really get to know until the last tenth of the book! The National Book Award is a real puzzle.Try it at your own risk. For me, it wasn't worth the time put into it."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I loved this novel for the relevance it shows to my own life. Ha Jin leads us through Lin's life as he seeks to secure a divorce so he can marry his true love, only to find himself less than fulfilled 18 years later when it finally happens. How many of us waste precious time waiting for something better-that ultimate fulfillment, as life changes us and ultimately passes us by.This reminds me to try to enjoy the here and now."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"While I could appreciate this novel as a good (not great)work of literature, its depiction of the dry life of the spirit in Communist China is so realistic that the reader will have a difficult time getting through it. The protagonist is a man with divided loyalties; he has a lover who keeps waiting for him to divorce his faithful, long suffering wife in the country and he knows that he cannot do this and be completely satisfied with his decision. He waits for an opportunity to be able to have everything he wants -- both ways. I struggled to have sympathy with this man or his impatient mistress, but they, along with the wife, are all victims of the coldly impersonal system in which they all must live their lives. There is no freedom of the spirit in their world. The first time I tried to read this book, I simply put it down in frustration. I went back to it and finished it at last, but must say that it was not a book that touched me other than intellectually. Emotionally, it was empty and dry (except for the portrayal of the poor, illiterate country wife), although I believe this was the author's intent. A fable for our times, perhaps."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a very slow book for me. I wouldn't recommend it. The plot seemed to lack the complexity necessary to hold my interest. The plot seemed redundant covering the same ground each year as he went back to try to convince his wife to divorse him. The only reason I finished the book was because it annoys me to buy a book and not finish it. And The Ladies of the Club is the only one on my shelf not read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This simple story of Lin Kong, a doctor in China who is married to a woman he doesn't love and waits for a woman whom he does love, is written in Ha Jin's spare, simple prose. The irony of the story is that when he is finally able to divorce his wife, his mistress is very sick and she has changed, so that he no longer loves her, and after having divorced his wife, he finds himself seeking her love and forgiveness. At the end of the novel, Lin Kong's relationship with both women is intentionally ambiguous and at best doubtful. Lin Kong is therefore waiting for something that will never occur, and in that sense, he is the existential protagonist with no exit. While Ha Jin succeeds in portraying the agony of waiting, he fails to make Lin Kong a sympathetic character. Lin Kong seems more like a selfish, immature child, rather than a compassionate character who is immobilizied by forces beyond his control. Stylistically, Ha Jin seems more proficient in writing short fiction. While \\"In the Pond\\" is satisfying and complete, \\"Waiting\\" is dreary and monotonous. Look for \\"In the Pond\\" and Ha Jin's short stories."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A suppose to be bittersweet 18 years romance between Lin Kong(a Chinese Army doctor) and Manna(head-nurse).Lin Kong waited 18 years to get a divorce to come through..actually he did apply for it every year but his wife Shuyu, a simple and devoted wife always disappoint him at the court house.Lin Kong is a highly-educated modern man and yearned for free love and true romance, he met a beautiful young nurse and decided to give up his wife and daughter but unwillingly to be a heartless man, therefore year after year he hope and wait for his wife to say yes and part peacefully.Lin's hope finally materialised after 18 years because according to their law he can automatically divorce his wife after 18 years of separation. He quickly marry Manna and regretted soon after....Actually after so much hardship and long wait,Lin and Manna should be really happy ever after!! The answer is rather ironical. All those years of waiting and waiting...In the end it's not Lin's waiting for true love but his wife and daughter waiting for him to turn back that's touches my heart and that's a real waiting."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Man marries a woman out of respect for his parents.

Boy was I wrong. The book never lives up to the expectations of the average reader. Believe me, I'm not looking for much. All I'd like to find is relief from the mundane feelings of boredom. If I'm to sacrifice 6 hours of my time for a book as opposed to learning a new language, watching a new movie, playing a new computer game, I expect to be entertained not with dull Chinese realism, but with a sensational story, a new custom, worthy vernacular, anything but mind-numbing realism full of bad human choices and self-pity.My opening sentence of this short criticism summarizes the whole book. The rest of the story relates daily human interactions of an ill-conceived society. Do yourself a favor, learn a new language, play a new computer game, watch a new movie, anything but pick up this agony. If you must learn something about Chinese history, the Cultural Revolution, or complex societal relationships of the Eastern world, then I highly recommend \\"Wild Swans\\" by Jung Chang.- By Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Who got paid off to grant this award?

I kept feeling like I was on the verge of really falling in love with the novel and that, with each page turned, I would be closer to having my breath taken away. Instead, with each page turned, I grew more frustrated to discover that I wasn't getting any closer to the character's hearts. I have a feeling that if the book had been written entirely from the points of views of the two women, I would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is Ha Jin's flagship work, despite not necessarily being his best or most important. It is his flagship work because it is a quick read on topics that he knows well.One feels like one knows Ha Jin somewhat after reading this book, and you may either sympathize with him or dislike him. It depends on your personal views.Generally, he shows his ability to be an emotionally-affecting writer. The book gives a good presentation of bottom-up history of a communist nation, with references thrown in to other communist nations like Russia and to China's foreign relations with countries like the United States. Special attention is paid to how these relations affected culture from the bottom up (learning English becomes popular).It's an interesting book and enjoyable. What you think of it later depends on your literary and moral views."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Like Miso soup, subtle but fulfilling. Ha Jin keeps you waiting, playing on your patience for what you hope will be a closure at the end of the novel. Of course that never comes. It such a poignant story, where hope and happiness lie always at the outskirts and the complexities of patience and longing lay at its heart. His deceptively simple narrative style carried me along like a leaf in a slow and gentle stream, but before I knew it I was caught up in the tublent waters of the final chapters."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin has proven time and time again to be a master story-teller. Waiting may be his masterpiece. In elegant prose he tells a &quot;grass is greener&quot; tale of a married man who loves another woman. Every moment of the novel is a heart-wrenching joy to read as Lin Kong weighs the balance of what is right and what he wants. Soon the reader is waiting along with Lin Kong to see what the end result will be. This is an absolutely amazing novel that draws the reader in and should be on every reading list."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Since I often listen to a book while driving after having read it or while reading the book at home, I've often been disappointed with a reading. Too often, it seems, the reader doesn't match my own imagination; too often, the reader doesn't put himself/herself into the writing; too often he/she reads words, not emotions.But those negatives are not the case with Dick Hill. His intonations are superb; his phrasing is perfect. His reading does Ha Jin's beautiful work justice. In many ways, Hill's reading is more than that; it's a performance with expressive talent. If you've read the book but have not heard the tape done by Dick Hill, try it. It's a real treat."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. What was touted as a delicate investigation of the human heart turns out to be a depressing reminder of how selfish and immature grown adults can be.

The glimpses of the events taking place in China over the story's time period were interesting, as were the glimpses into the Chinese culture. However, I felt bogged down in the minute details of characters' actions, that had no seeming relevance to the story.Although the conclusion was similar to Aesop's dog/bone fable...(you always want what you can't have, and by the time you get what it was you thought you wanted, you still want the other thing), The story did not make me care enough about any of the characters to feel that the time spent reading it was worthwhile.I felt Lin Kong was a weak man and that Manna Wu was a manipulative, shrewish woman, and stopped caring about both of them about midway through the book. Unfortunately, I kept reading, waiting, and hoping that there would be some greater relevance to be found within this tale. Alas, there was not."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The simple beauty of this book is wonderful. Strikes home to anyone who has ever waited or thought of waiting for something. Haunting."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"(Review of the book, spoilers inside)\\"Waiting\\" tells a story about a doctor, Lin Kong, who was well-read, decent, and kind-hearted, but had some serious short-comings that had caused misery and trouble for himself, his lover, and his family. He didn't love his wife Shuyu (an arranged marriage) because she was not attractive, and she couldn't read. As a result, he felt ashamed to let Shuyu visit him in the city where he worked. So for many years while this marriage continued, he only went home to visit his family in the village for 10 days a year. He had one daughter with Shuyu. And he never made love to her after their daughter was born. Shuyu, though illiterate, was a loyal and dependable wife. She took good care of Lin's parents until they passed away, and she brought up Lin's daughter all on her own (with Lin's salary he sent home). She always thought that Lin and her would be husband and wife for the rest of their lives.Meanwhile, Manna, a colleague of Lin, found him attractive and pursued him. He was happy to have woman who had education and who looked good, so he accepted Manna, and started a romantic relationship. However, due to the pressure of the society and the Party, he couldn't have an intimate relationship with Manna while he was still married to Shuyu. An official who was on friendly terms with Lin cautioned him not to get \\"physical\\" with Manna, or punishment would fall upon them (being kicked out of the Party and demobilized and sent to the countryside).Manna loved Lin dearly (although she had her own agenda at times and had never trusted Lin in revealing her finance), and pressured Lin to divorce Shuyu so that the two of them could be together lawfully. However, Lin was not a brave or resolute man. He was so soft-hearted that he never successfully divorced Shuyu for 18 years (Shuyu's brother also caused a lot of obstacles). While Manna was waiting for the divorce to come through, they also tried to get Manna a boyfriend in another city, who wouldn't know of their relationship (many coworkers assumed they had physical relasionship and shunned away from Manna as a suitable girlfriend, as brides' virginity was the most important thing to the grooms those days). They tried a couple of times. The first time, Manna didn't like the man; the second time, a prominent official was looking for a second wife, but turned down Manna replying that Manna was not good enough, which made Manna an instant laughing stock, bringing her much humiliation. A traumatic incident happened to them shortly after Manna was rejected by the official. Lin made friends with a vulgar, rude and merciless army officer, while they were both recovering from TB in the same hospital room. Lin told him everything about his dilemma (not able to marry Manna and not able to leave Shuyu), and revealed that Manna was still a virgin. Little did he know that when he left for a few months for some meeting in another city, this cruel beast planned and executed a rape of Manna, which aged her tremendously and brought down both her physical and mental health. The rape rumor spread all over the hospital, which made both Manna and Lin laughing stocks, as in those days (even today), many Chinese people assumed that it was the fault of the victim that she was raped, and would treat her as a slut.As years passed by, Lin would go home for 10 days to carry out his divorce, yet failed year after year. After 18 years had passed, according to some army rule, an army officer was allowed to divorce the spouse without her consent, Lin finally became free. He was a kind man in nature, so he helped Shuyu and their daughter to stay in the city and live a much better life. And he managed to sell his country home to obtain enough money for his wedding with Manna.However, he soon found that after 18 years waiting and hardship, Manna was no longer the carefree, energetic and sweet girl he used to love and feel passionate about. Manna, now in her fourties, had become resentful, angry and bitter. They had twin boys not too long after their wedding, which was envied by many people, as boys were treasured by parents as they could contribute to the family more. However, Lin found himself lack of interest in being a parent, although he slowly became attached to them and loved them. Generally, he lacked any interest in being responsible to carry any burden of life. He would rather be taken care of by others than taking care of his wife and family, especially if the situations got tough. As Manna's health (already fragile after years' of hardship) deteriorated, he found himself more drawn to his former wife, Shuyu, who was always caring, peaceful and obedient. Although he never loved Shuyu, after so many years, he realized that he now only cared about comfort in life and peace of his mind, which he always had when he was with Shuyu. While Manna and Lin waited 18 long years to become husband and wife, Shuyu waited 18 years for Lin to accept her and appreciate her. Lin was the type of people who always wanted things he didn't have while never appreciated what he had until he lost them. What a sad person!Ha Jin did a great job in \\"Waiting\\" depicting the life of ordinary people in a society where other people's opinions ran the courses of your lives. There are also many elements of the book that are universal and representative of all cultures.I finished reading \\"Waiting\\" using two evenings. I find myself absorbed in the story and cannot put the book down. I find the depiction of Manna's rape especially horrific and unbearable, and I am heart-broken to be reminded by the author that most women in those days never reported their rape, and never found any support and proper care in the society. It is so sad to think of such injustice and contorted beliefs prevalent in the Chinese society. But I respect Ha Jin for his accurate and truthful depiction of the lives of Chinese people. We have to first acknowledge that there is something wrong with our society before we can correct it and make it better."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I was disappointed by this book, and surprised to see that it was a bestseller. Although the characters and plot are very well-crafted, the language is stilted and uncomfortable. If you can forgive clumsy writing in your search for character development, then give this book a try."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'd read a bit of this book, get bored, put it down, pick itup. It's taken me nearly six months to get through. Ithas its lovely points- and the historical context is fascinatingto one who has no reference points with modern China.I learned from it. As beautiful as the imagery and thelanguage sometimes is, it is also, on some levels, acolossal bore. It reminds me of the beautiful film, &quot;TheScent of Green Papaya.&quot; Nothing much happens, but atthe end you do feel you've watched a magical vision unfold."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"\\"Waiting\\" starts by making the reader wait for something to happen. Well, things do happen but they are not very exciting. It is a mark of rare skill for a writer to hold the attention of the reader with sparse prose, short sentences, plain life tales, for long enough until the reader gets engrossed enough in the tale to stay. As the book unfolds, one gets the point of the style: a boring style to illustrate the boring life, of boring people, in a boring Chinese outpost, in the boring years of communist China. Even the great political turmoils are only a distant echo for these people set in a life of routine protected in the safe setting of a hospital. This is the really the secret of the book, to tell us that the oppressive system of Maoist China was a fitting continuation of the oppressive social values that allowed for such a revolution. Women perhaps had their feet bound before, but they still cannot date freely since the eyes of people watch any deviance, political or personal. Men now could aspire to a divorce from a loveless arranged marriage, but they still recur too often to loveless arranged marriage. In the 50ies and 60ies Chinese did not fare much better on a personal level than before. China is China, always full of people and watching eyes. The only refuge is blandness. At the end of the book we do not care much for the fates of the book's heroes. They followed the rules and pretty much got what they deserved. What we feel is a great sadness for the millions of lives that flickered through half a century of Communist, lives unable to risk anything, to tempt happiness, without any real hope but those that society would allow, never those that they could forge for themselves, even within the frame-works of these rules. A great loss. It is a great book forces you out of the book, into thoughts on how society oppresses you and makes you do what is not good for you, while making you think it is good.."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting was just &quot;okay.&quot; I agree with the reviewer who said it was hard to care about any of the characters. Lin became irritating by the end with all of his continuous questioning and indecisiveness. Get this one out of the library."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book was an easy read. It was a breeze to go through the pages because it was written well. I was fascinated and a little engrossed about the two women in this story, each representing two very different China. I was a little impatient with the male character, and ended up wishing that he had more backbone. I did not relate to him at all and felt trapped in the story because he was the hero.The plot itself is a little weak for my taste and the ending a little predictable. But overall, I appreciated the cultural detail and the beautiful way that it was written."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I bought this novel expecting and wanting to love it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by both the style and substance. Although the prose sometimes achieved elegance, it was frequently clumsy and obvious, especially when the author attempted to flesh out the personality and thoughts of the characters. Perhaps this was because the author was attempting to show how simple and callow the characters were, but I don't think so. Also, I found myself bored with the shallow and obvious treatment of some of the major themes - city vs. country, modern vs. traditional, capitalist vs. communist. The structure is good, the author's heart is in the right place, but the execution is clumsy and disappointing."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This novel provides an excellent fictional counterpoint to Nien Cheng's autobiographical Life and Death in Shanghai. Ha Jin's characters' internalization of political rhetoric and submission to the whims of the dictatorship under which they live becomes understandable when viewed in the glare of Mrs. Chen's ordeal. China was and continues to be a place that expects total fealty to the State and to its normative values, stripping the wayward as well as the loyal of their humanity. This novel illuminates the slow erosion of the human spirit that accompanied the characters' acceptance of their fate as opposed to the physical punishment meted out to Mrs. Chen and others who strove to maintain individuality under the weight of their society's crushing demand for conformity."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book was recommended to me by a Bulgarian woman because she said it was a very accurate portrayal of the beliefs and limitations on peoples' lives under the control of a communist government. The story of Lin's plight to divorce his wife in a society that does not accept such practices for the average worker is both eye-opening and compelling. It is important for anyone with an interest in China to read this novel for a very well written (although somewhat depressing) portrayal of the struggle of the average man."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What a remarkable, gentle, story. I was enchanted with Mr.Jin's style of writing. I felt that the story wasn't &quot;told&quot; so much as it was unfolded. I enjoyed reading a story set in contemporary China. The contrasts between the village and the city were interesting and told in enough detail to really give you a feeling for how life would be. Plus the information about traditions that were still being upheld and others that had been let go was fascinating. Overall I felt this was a relaxing, pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I read 'Waiting' and enjoyed the meditative style of Jin's portrayal of an innocent, yet illicit, love story of a married doctor and a nurse. Jin's story enlightened my limited knowledge of the Chinese culture. It takes a dedicated and patient reader to enjoy this work by Jin. The title itself sets the mode for the reader. Patience is a prerequisite for 'waiting.' The National Book Award validates the importance of this work."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I can't quite give it five stars because the first two parts of this three part novel were a bit slow for my tastes. In fact, I almost stopped reading the book before I got to page 12, but the diaogue on that page hooked me for the rest of book. Ha Jin is a minimalist in the best sense of the word. He gives you just enough to keep you intrigued, but rarely knocks you over with powerful passages. As the story develops, it becomes increasingly more poetic, gripping and provocative. The last third of the book is truly remarkable, containing some of the best prose I have ever read. By the end, I was left pondering age-old questions about male-female relationships and family obligations with fresh new insights as developed by the main characters. My advice is to be patient with the book. There is a method to his slow development of characters and plot. It is worth the wait."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"When you write a novel about waiting, about the long sense of one's being suspended in anticipation of something that may happen and change everything, you inevitably try to incorporate the sense of dead time.Unfortunately, if you do this successfully, what you get is a very boring reading experience.Ha Jin is a skillful creator of character and setting. The reader breathes with the characters, sees what they see and feels what they feel. But his deadly accurate replication of the waiting experience will yield for many readers a deadening read.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andbang BANG: A Novel ISBN 9781601640005"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is one of those books that makes you think long afterward. About a Chinese doctor who just does not know how to be happy. Very expertly crafted."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"'Waiting' is a strange tale to a Westerner. Jin Kong and Manna Wu wait 18 years for Jin to finally successfully divorce his wife after many attempts. They seem to be in love, but are they really? Or is the waiting simply making Jin desire what he cannot have? Or once he gets it will he just want something else, like what he had or could have had but always rejected?The book deftly portrays the interplay of rural Chinese traditions and the Communist Chinese bureaucratic rules - both of which seem designed to prevent happiness and to constrict and bind the characters (sometimes literally). The restrictions force Jin to live in his head and make the reader want to strangle him at times.Not necessarily a 'fun' book, but a fascinating read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In this highly structured novel of life within the Chinese People's Liberation Army and in the very rural countryside, Ha Jin offers the reader a way to understand the culture and character of people living under repressive conditions. To Lin Kong, his wife Shuyu, and his chaste lover Manna Wu, life is a process of acceptance, not choice, a life in which there are no personal goals, other than working for the greater good of the country and its leaders. Because the concept of freedom simply does not exist here, it never enters anyone's mind. No one feels its loss or yearns for it, and an individual seeks neither happiness nor pleasure, instead finding satisfaction within the system.Lin Kong, a physician working eleven months of the year in Muji City while his wife works the farm in Goose Village, experiences the sensations of love for the first time when he is attracted to Manna Wu, a nurse at his army station. Having previously accepted an arranged marriage, he is the legal husband of an older woman whose only attraction has been the care she lavished on his sick and elderly parents. For eighteen years he endures the limbo of trying to obtain a divorce from his wife while obeying the army's requirements that he and Manna Wu remain physically chaste.Ha Jin's prose is efficient and straightforward, much like the life of his characters, and one neither expects nor misses the flights of poesy so often found in novels of China written by westerners. The chief attraction of this novel is the care with which Ha Jin recreates the atmosphere of life in Communist China, showing us how ordinary people conduct their lives under conditions which we would find intolerable. His careful choice of details to illuminate the ironies of his characters' lives give power to a narrative about people who have no individual power. He succeeds admirably in bringing to life characters whose whole concept of what it means to be a person is diametrically opposed to our own, making humans out of people who live lives of structure, not of choice. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I enjoyed the book, except the almost very end where Lin started to feel discontented with his second marriage life. The ongoing voice in his head was just a bit overstated for me. Other than that I enjoyed the story. The simple language easily helped forming the scenery, environment and the characters in my mind. I especially enjoyed the developing of the story to the point that I found myself reading it straight through for several hours three nights in a row. In some way Ha Jin was able to keep me engaging in the book to find out what'd happen next.As an Asian I realized that the characters portrayed in the book do exist in real life. The wife's loyalty towards their husbands, the double standard upon women, the well and long kept thoughts and feeling inside the characters. All these things were based on reality."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"While the message of this book (&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot; or &quot;The grass is always greener on the other side&quot;) has a quality like that of a Grimm's fairy tale, the writing style is much more reserved and devoid of emotion. However, this isn't a criticism. I find that this is often true of Chinese writers and can appreciate the cultural difference. I almost think the writing style enhances Lin Kong's pathetic character by making him seem more bland and spineless. I agree with other readers that Waiting doesn't feel like a love story, but I don't think it's intended to be--it's more an exploration of one man's misinterpretation about what matters most to him in this world. At first, he thinks it is his lover Manna, but after becoming so entangled in this belief that he can't turn back, he realizes that it is his routine and solitude that he most values. I think this novel is worth reading for a look at the culture, but I agree that the subject matter doesn't really leave you feeling satiated at the end."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A man convinces himself that he is unhappy with his marriage, waits forever for the Chinese bureaucracy to grant him a divorce so he can marry the woman he is infatuated with.Without giving up plot specifics, let me say this novel is a fable that underscores George Bernard Shaw's famous quote: \\"There are two tragedies in life. Not getting what you want and getting it.\\"This novel is both emotionally felt and brutal of its examination of the ironies born from self-delusion. I read the novel 8 years ago and remain haunted by it."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What a read! So many lessons on writing can be drawn from this book, including a \\"what not to do\\" lesson. Ha Jin drew me into China with vivid settings, insights into the social culture, and the harshness of old Chinese law through an exploration of Chinese history through his character's eyes.Jin's main character Lin is a self-deprecating man who believes himself incapable of loving another person. We can see through both plots and subplots that Lin not only can love, but loves deeply; two women and his children from two marriages, but perhaps not himself.This book, at times, left me with the sense of wanting to shout at or shake Lin: Ha Jin drew me in that effectively. This example of creating a strong emotional reaction in a reader is of priceless insight to me. I want to move my readers and emotionally tie them to my characters as Jin does.Jin teaches us lessons in respect through his characters, as well. He coaches us in proper human behavior through allegorical scenes as his story plays out. As his characters grow, we somehow grow along with them, experience their mistakes, and even learn from those mistakes when the characters do not.He paints beautiful settings using descriptions of sight, sound, scent, taste, and touch. I believe, however, that his story would have been a bit stronger if Jin would have woven his setting descriptions into character dialogue or thought, instead of using multiple paragraphs to describe the surroundings in the midst of an active scene."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I can always tell when a book is well written -- I think about it days after reading it and observe more and more about it long after I've put it down. This is one of those books. It's written in almost folk-tale style and centers around Lin, a military doctor who pines for the life he thinks he wants, with his military nurse lover Manna. He longs to be free of his village wife Shuyu, who is simple and has bound feet (apparently long after such things were generally done) and who, frankly, embarrasses him. But year after year, she refuses to divorce him. So year after year, his life is one of longing. The situation does (slowly) resolve, but that's mainly the whole story -- the lives of these people moving along, marking time.But what goes on underneath this little folk tale is what's so interesting. There is the obvious caution to be careful what you wish for. The parallels with The Good Earth cannot be ignored. All characters are affected in some way by the ongoing Cultural Revolution: in the way they live, react to their fates, see their place in their world.It's a very easy little tale to read, but will leave you thinking for days after you've finished. Go ahead -- give it a read!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's novel, \\"Waiting\\", resembles a more contemporary version of Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth.\\" Like Wang Lung, Lin Kong never seems to be at peace. The love he wants is always beyond his grasp. Lin waits 18 years for his wife to consent to divorce before he can finally marry his love, Manna. But the ideal Lin has carried with him for 18 years is not what life presents. Often times I wanted to scream at Lin and Manna, but other times I could feel their frustration and wanted to reach out and comfort them.All in all, I enjoyed \\"Waiting.\\" It was a moving and sometimes comical tale full of recent Chinese history and great character development."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin does a great job of showing the duality of human nature. The two characters are forever caught between two equally valid interpretations of reality.Is Lin Kong's love for Manna true love, or simply a symptom of his own stunted emotional growth? Is Lin Kong truly a caring and sophisticated man, or is he just too timid to express his true passions?Maoist China serves as the force which divides reality into these two spheres of interpretation. The traditional Chinese ideal is constantly being overturned by Mao's suppression of the old ways -- an embrace of the new which forces Lin Kong to sometimes despise the village life. Yet he can never completely suppress his love for the idyllic rural family life.As the novel moves to the post-Mao Deng's \\"to get rich is glorious\\" era, the carpet is swept from under the characters' feets and they are forced to consider the possibility that they are pathetic victims who never actually made a real choice in their entire lives. Ha Jin portrays this internal conflict by having the characters actually holding conversations with voices inside their head.If you can identify with these characters -- and I think anybody who has ever looked back on their lives with some hint of regret will be able to -- you will find that Ha Jin successfully tries to assuage those regrets by universalizing our suffering. There is a universal element to Ha Jin's prose because it speaks of emotions so literally. His use of analogies are used to explain specific emotional events, rather than to offer over-arching interpretations.Unlike a plot-driven novel where the author intentionally deceives the reader (to the reader's great joy), Ha Jin leaves these characters completely exposed to us. And unlike characters in a plot-driven novel, Ha Jin's characters are without clear intentions, without unambiguous motivations, but constantly flooded by internal conflict.What the Chinese call \\"mao dun.\\""},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book held my attention and I looked forward to picking it up and reading every free moment I had. Look inside this book and read the excerpted first pages. The writing style continues the same throughout. The author is a master writer; he is almost a minimalist painter (with words) much like the Chinese landscape painters. I would say it gave a good picture of China during the time of the cultural revolution, which was the reason I decided I wanted to read this book. As for the storyline, it made me think about the question, \\"What is love?\\" Naturally, the book did not really answer the question and the reader has to decide for him/herself. I came away from this book being glad for the time I spent reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone, provided they aren't looking for an action packed thriller about cops and robbers or a passion packed sex-filled romance novel. To me it is a piece of poetry."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"A man manages to get what he wanted, struggling through the inflexible Chinese social system disallowing freedom. The essence of this story, however, resides in man's nature of which the desire is endlessly unfulfilled regardless of his struggles. I interpreted this story to warn against chasing something for many years, which we may find we don't want in the end. We are all apt to fall into this type of situation more or less, for countless and endless desires human nature. Also, the writer illustraes an interesting way the man's tendency to follow a more presentable woman to find in the end that she was not what he wanted."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"What makes this 20th century Chinese fable so memorable is its subtle portrayal of time. The portrayal of time's passage in a life we see as \\"not fully-lived\\" and marked by restraint, is told so elegantly and richly that moments lost to the characters are transformed into those which are the best lived, and truest (certainly the most innocent) of their lives.It may strike readers as a fairy tale or fable for the ending, when the illusions that were bound up in the doctor's years of waiting for his sweetheart are unleashed. Then the reader must question the years he waited, following the law. What were they for? Was his commitment to a woman in the world or to waiting itself? The allure of the unattainable is perhaps a universal human weakness, but you cannot ask for a more beautiful portrayal of it than in this fine book. His epiphany on love at the end of the novel still does not ultimately change his character, one in which the act of waiting for something is almost his very own reflection.Historically, this is an excellent portrayal of both interior life as it existed under Chinese communism, and the interference of public onto private life found in any society."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"If you can recall the feeling of wild expectation you had on Christmas eve, and then the sudden flatness of Christmas day once the gifts were all opened, you can relate to this book. I'm not going to recount the plot here, other reviewers have done that very well. But, I will share some of my thoughts and feelings having just finished reading the book. It is no secret that the culture in China has never valued women. Imagine then, the de-humanization of all Chinese people under the reign of Mao. Men were de-valued, they were cogs in the Communist machine. Women went even lower, carrying all the Chinese cultural ideas about subservience to men, but now they were also subsurvient to the greater ideas of the Chairman. How did any individual find fulfillment in this \\"all for the greater good\\" environment? Sometimes their attempts aren't pretty, using other people to provide them their value when none can be had through normal societal means. Perhaps some people overcame this oppresion. The main characters in this book do not. Unfortunately, they use each other, everyone trying to attain some kind of fulfillment, hoping their dreams reside in attaining the admiration of someone else. It is a sad book. The emotional immaturity of all the characters is something that I could relate to, but, luckily, the way they choose to interact with each other, and the world, is something in my childhood memories. But, lest I sound smug, I was raised in an environment, a culture, a society, where I was allowed to grow. This book is a frightening parable of suffocation of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I read this book in three days and enjoyed it very much. The story of Lin and Manna gives you something to think about. The moral of the story is be careful what you wish for as it may eventually come true. Lin and Manna were so obsessed with the idea of getting married and being together that they never considered if they truly loved one another. It was intresting to read about the culture differences and customs people of their country had to face. I agree with some of the reviewers that the ending was not in keeping with the rest of the book and seemed rushed. The book was not fast paced, but then it wasn't meant to be. I would recommend this book as it is well written, keeps your interest, and is a good read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's novel, &quot;Waiting,&quot; is about Lin Kong, a gentle and scholarly man who is stuck in a loveless marriage with the stolid and dependable Shuyu, who was given to him in an arranged marriage. He leaves Shuyu in the countryside with their daughter, Hua, and he becomes an army doctor. The novel spans several decades, as Lin forms an attachment to a nurse named Manna, and decides to divorce his wife. The novel has little plot. Ha Jin concentrates on how Mao's Cultural Revolution changed the life of the Chinese, and how the social atmosphere in China from the sixties to the eighties limited the choices that men and women could make in work and in love. Ha Jin explores the attempts of the characters to express themselves as individuals and, at the same time, do what is proper in the eyes of the state and of their fellow citizens. How can they accumulate wealth without being denounced as bourgeois? How can they find love when the State stands in their way? Both Lin and Manna make difficult choices and they pay a price for their &quot;happiness&quot;. Only Shuyu, who asks for nothing and gives of herself unstintingly, seems to emerge emotionally unscathed. Ha Jin has written a touching and low-key novel that beautifully describes life in China from the Cultural Revolution through its aftermath. He captures the feeling of rural China particularly well, describing the hardscrabble life that people live on a day to day basis. The characters and dialogue are simple yet affecting. Ha Jin seems to be saying that happiness, especially in a culture as constricting as that of China, is an elusive commodity. People who are brought up to repress their feeling and emotions often forget how to feel and often do not even know what they want. &quot;Waiting&quot; is a glimpse into a culture with which most Americans are completely unfamiliar."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This was a great book on two levels. The portrayal of China during and after the Cultural Revolution was revealing and did much to humanize the lives of average Chinese during that time. It gave a nonjudgemental accounting of one man's life during that time. The heart of the book is the telling of a long term affair and its effects on the lives around the affair. Told by a male narrator in spare language, the reader is able to see into the mind and heart of Lin. As a single woman, the descriptions of feelings,changes, and outcomes of this affair ring true. I will give this book to anyone considering an affair. Lin and Manna cross cultures to provide insight into what is normally romantized."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Does &quot;Waiting&quot; tell a tragic story? My answer is no: worse than that. Why, then, and how? These are questions hard to answer, although the story seems simple, and simpler is the writing style.&quot;Waiting&quot; must be read in a rather philosophic way. It is not a novel that enhances the process for waiting. Instead, the constant hopelessness and frustration of waiting in the story are its very effects that Ha Jin tries to configure and then to denounce. The plot is a deceptive cover in order to portray a sheerly deprived social reality where the most instinctive human desires and impulses are condemned. This explains why, after such a long period of waiting, the protagonist Lin Kong couldn't even enjoy the union, not even physically, with the woman who had waited 18 years for him.Although the author does not explicitly attribute Lin Kong's pathetic status to the social reality, it is clear that, as the only intellectual in the novel, Lin Kong embodies the outcome of Chinese Communism ideology.Worse than a tragedy which still expresses a strong value system, the nihilism is the ultimate spiritual reality of the protagonist. I find the ending of the novel masterful: it perpetuates such passive aspects of social reality by letting the former wife wait for the protagonist to return home, thereby starting another viscous circle.I admire the courage of Ha Jin in insisting on a realistic writing while the major trend of creative writing seems to pursue a fashionable, postmodern, and often incomprehensible style.Regrettably, I find the narrative development lacks imagination."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin, who taught himself English while working as a railroad telegrapher on the Sino-Soviet frontier, decided not to return to China after Tiananman Square, and, like Conrad and Nabokov before him, willed himself into becoming a writer in English, is a self-made man. His personal story epitomizes the American Dream and underscores a certain political point of view about China. Perhaps for this reason, \\"Waiting,\\" his first novel, has been overrated and over-awarded.The backdrop of the novel -- the daily life of proletarians and party officials in Mao's China -- is interesting enough and sometimes amusing, but the author's development of his central characters and his narrative technique will disappoint readers used to Western fiction. There is little of the subtlety of Checkov or Turgenev, or the expanse of Nabokov, here.Physician Lin Kong and his chaste lover, nurse Manna Wu, begin and end as tentative, slight characters, virtually devoid of inner lives or major contradictions. The so-called \\"twist\\" at the end of this book is, in reality, little more than a double dose of the tentativeness which affects Lin throughout. To the extent Lin and Manna face dilemmas, they do so, not through actions which the reader might interpret and identify with, but rather through interior monologues of the angel-on-the-left-shoulder, devil-on the-right-shoulder variety. As a result, their problems never really become our problems.This is easy, but unfortunately not rewarding, reading."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"It's interesting, but not surprising, that most reviewers either thought this book was a masterpiece or a waste of time. I find myself empathizing with both camps- on the one hand I feel that the glimpse that the book provided me into a fascinating period of time in China was worthwhile, but on the other hand I felt that the reading was definitely laborious at times (particularly in the middle of the book). The surprise ending was definitely a redeeming feature, but I almost thought I might not get there. I was also torn with both liking and becoming bored with the very simplistic prose. Overall, I don't regret having read the book, but I can't strongly recommend it, and I certainly can't understand why it received the National Book Award."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I see that people have beat me to it. Waiting is a no frills novel that cuts through the extras of life and gets right to the brunt of the problem, which, in this case, is the &quot;love affair&quot; between an army doctor and nurse in communist China. The characters are all wonderfully developed, though not particularly as people that you'd want to spend heaps of time with yourself. It's not a novel, though, that leaves the reader with a sense of satisfaction when he or she has finished it. Perhaps it's because Ha Jin tells his story about the senselessness of life but doesn't offer any convenient salvation for Lin and Manna, the two &quot;lovers.&quot; And though I know that sometimes life goes that way, people are disappointed, frustrated, and unhappy, I guess that in a way I read books to get away from all that. Still, Waiting is well written and gives you a periferal insight into Chinese society, but it's most certainly neither a relaxing nor joyous read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"How refreshing to read a book about modern China that doesn't involve incerations or focuses on the Cultural Revolution. I love books that do, don't get me wrong, but here's something different.The role of women in China has really changed. That's no secret but this book highlights the dilemma created, and what was lost what was gained and the sacrifices on both ends. The traditional wife in the village compared to the modern, educated woman in the city.We also get real insight on lives and careers during the era and how they changed.The doctor was the only disappointment. A real limp fish. Definitely not a guy worth waiting for! But the book is worth reading. Can't wait to read more by Ha Jin."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"despite the ratings is below four, i would give this book full five stars.

Thus, despite its quiet style, the book will have a dramatic impact in its readers.A man married to a wife that he does not love falls in love with a woman whom he cannot marry because his wife does not give her permission to a divorce. Set in communist China, all characters struggle with leading private lives in what is an un-private world. Nothing can be kept secret. Thoughts, emotions and actions are constantly exposed and put under scrutiny. People are put under the microscope and individuality is suppressed. Meanwhile, there is a huge double-standard between the regular worker and the politically involved elite. If you have never been exposed to Communism and what it does to the people that live under its regime, this book will provide you with a wonderful insight into how lonely and depressed this society is.Widely different in their quest for happiness and a fulfilled life, the three main characters are emotionally bounded for over 30 years. The reader will move through history with them, being exposed to each characters good and bad sides. He/she will grow with them and experience that really nothing is simple in life and that people who live in a suppressed society have little options and hardly any choices.Jin's writing is masterful in its lyricism. With simple sentences and words, he is able to show - not tell - the lives that his three main characters live. The reader is swept into this story quickly and not much is needed to keep him/her engaged. \\"Waiting\\" is a wonderful book that is highly recommended for book clubs or class room discussions."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"It is rare that the essence of a book is so completely captured in its title. The title of this particular book, \\"Waiting,\\" is apt in many ways. First of all, the protagonist, Lin Kong, spends 18 years waiting to divorce his wife. While he is waiting, as is his intended bride-to-be, the reader also waits in the daily grind of his job, duties, and other human interactions, for the day Lin Kong is finally able to divorce his country-bumpkin wife and marry the woman of his dreams. So both the protagonist and the reader wait, page after page, event after event, yearning for that end to his unhappiness.If, however, the \\"waiting\\" was meant only for this long-awaited divorce, the reader finds out that the book goes on to narrate the married life of Lin Kong and his new bride, Manna Wu, after the supposed end to his waiting. Is the book all of a sudden not about waiting anymore? It turns out that this \\"waiting\\" is not just for the one event in life, rather it turns out to be the very condition of continuing human existence. As the protagonist realizes that he was waiting \\"for the sake of waiting,\\" it is the very thing that kept him alive and living.Thus, when his waiting for the divorce is over and he starts a family with his new bride, he starts to have regrets. When his bride turns out to have a heart condition which would eventually kill her, he yearns to wait again. This time, the reader is left with the impression that he will have to wait for Manna to die, in order to be reunited with Shuyu, his first wife, whom he now regrets divorcing. The very last image with which the novel ends is telling: as Lin comes to the realization that he will have to wait for her to die, Manna looks out the window, radiantly and so alive, greeting those outside it. There is no mistake here that the reader is being led to believe that the waiting this time will again take a long time. Just as the divorce was certain but slow to come, the reader is left to believe that Manna's death, which will set Lin free again, will be certain, but again slow. So the waiting game begins again.Ha Jin's prose is impeccable. It is flawless. He writes better than most native English speakers. It reminds me of Franz Kafka's prose, written in impeccable, but book-learned German. Undoubtedly the fact that both Ha Jin and Franz Kafka are writing in a language that is not native to them sets them apart from those to whom language comes easily. At the same time, both Ha Jin and Franz Kafka, because they are conversant in a non-native language, are able to see common human condition before they see particularities in disparate cultures. Therefore, both Jin and Kafka end up writing in a universal language that is easily understood by everyone. It speaks to everyone and is felt by everyone. At the same time, as writers of \\"minor literature,\\" as inside outsiders, they are able to jar consciousness and make the reader see things differently.In a short story by Kafka called, \\"The Judgment,\\" the protagonist, Georg Bendemann, jumps off of a bridge because he has seen the true nature of human condition. Not being able to deal with it, he opts to die while the endless traffic crosses under the bridge. This image of Georg in his final moment and Manna Wu's radiant face at the end of \\"Waiting\\" seemed to me two sides of the same face, one who is denied the kind of \\"waiting\\" that sustains humanity and the other who enables it."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is the second time I read this book. The first time, I totally dismissed it as boring. This time, I had more time and perhaps more patience. This book requires patience. It's slow, somewhat repetitious, yet interesting. The culture of China during the 1960-70's is more than just a backdrop to the story. The affects of the Cultural Revolution and the overwhelming philosophy of control so shape the main character that he is unable to come to grips with who he really is. He is a doctor, a brother, a husband, a father, a government worker, and those roles always determine what he thinks and who he is. He almost never contradicts what he thinks is expected of him; his life is always determined by others especially others who are the least personally involved in his life. His respect and feelings for his boss, his roommates, his professional acquaintances is stronger than his respect or feelings of his wife and the \\"other woman\\". Only his daughter can cause some kind of emotional reaction in him.Lin is a person who is entirely shaped by others, what people think and how they react to him. Everything is analyzed; nothing is felt. The wife, Shuyu, is almost unbelievably complacent, but again, that's the role that the culture assigned her. Manna, the woman who waits eighteen year to finally marry him, shows the most independent emotion, but she also is so restricted by the culture. This is a sad book in many ways. Lin thinks at one point: \\"How we're each sequestered in our own suffering\\" His life is an example of unintended selfishness; he simply knows no other way to be. He has no ability to emotionally connect with those who should be closest to him.It is so subtly sad that it is humorous at times. The deception and posturing of the characters is so exaggerated in places that it is laughable. Laughable to us in modern American; seriously repressive to those lives we see in this novel.The writing is beautifully done; the reader can almost feel the chill which seems to pervade the buildings and the air itself. It is a dreary and lifeless environment. The buildings are functional, concrete, where a few cuttings of red paper on the window can create a \\"festive\\" feel. Lin, in his effort to be perfect, simply forgets to live. He was \\"certain ..between love and peace of mind he would choose the later. He would prefer a peaceful home.\\" Just too bad that love and relationships have to mess it all up.If you want an exciting read, this isn't it, but if you want to meet a man who is the exact opposite of Zorba, the Greek, come meet Lin Kong."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The title to this book is both about the doldrums encountered by the protagonist and the vacuous resignation to the degradation which it brings to those in his world.Under Chinese Law, Lin Kong's attempts to divorce his arranged spouse cannot occur without her consent until 18 years of dispassion have passed - effectively making the last act of consummation to have occurred prior tot he separation. The net effect is the two-parent household for the vast majority of the children, and great anguish to the husbands who cannot obtain their wife's acquiescence to divorce.Lin's wife Shuyu refuses to accept the divorce for neither monetary nor spiteful reasons - she just is a simple woman his simplicity is best characterized by her bound feet, something the women a generation older than she had ended as cultural norm in China.During the 18-year separation, Lin has passionate feelings for Manna - a young pretty woman who catches the attention of many men younger than Lin. But, she opts for Lin's hand and they commence the waiting, knowing after a decade that Shuyu's refusal to divorce will require the statutory.Contrasting Chinese concepts to American norm makes the revelations of this book alarming. Men and women cannot be seen in public with one another without a third person. Holding hands illegal. Thinking about sex, let alone having sex, is beyond societal allowance. Only high-ranking military personnel and politicians can deviate from these incredibly constraining laws.When reflecting upon the 18-year sexless courtship of Manna while waiting for the right to divorce Shuyu, Lin concludes, \\"\\"All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. . . . Fool, eighteen years you waited not knowing for what! Eighteen years, the grime of your life, gone, wasted, and they led you to this damn marriage [second to Manna].\\"Once when reviewing a collection of Manna's Mao buttons, Lin pondered, \\"He realized that someday these trinkets might become valuable indeed, as reminders of the mad times and the wasted lives in the revolution. \\"China ultimately prevails in making their lives respectively miserable and seemingly worthless. Although Lin is a doctor, he cannot even diagnose his wife's illness, her having a pregnancy of twins, or many other physiological items which doctors would ordinarily observe more completely by noticing the little details. He is blinded and dulled. China's waiting game atrophies his mind, and perhaps his soul. Government triumphs over personal character - even those who ask for just a little of personal character. Like the suffocating governments portrayed by J.M. Coetzee or George Orwell, Jin shows us how the firm soul of the protagonist can melt beneath the horrid sunny hot oppression of the Chinese bureaucracy which makes arbitrary and unnatural rules about permissible societal behavior.The end of this novel is not what I would have expected, but is what makes perfect sense. For many, it may be a surprise."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book is amazing! One of my favorite books ever. So surprising and wonderful and sad at the same time. You will learn about Chinese culture as well as get a fantastic story. LOVE this author. I've also read In the Pond, Ocean of Words and A Free Life."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting is simply a beautiful book - beautifully written and with beautifully illustrated themes: It is often impossible to be true to oneself without hurting others. One must live in the moment deriving every possible joy even when life is disappointing or difficult. Perfect romantic love is an illusion, as is perfect happiness. In this book, Manna is often hurt because her dreams don't match the reality of her life. The educated and philosophical Lin is unhappy because he turns away from his socially undesirable wife and country life. Only Lin's simple country wife finds happiness in her ability to live dutifully and accept whatever twists of fate life shows her. What a refreshing relief from \\"the girl/guy/ gets the girl/guy\\" and lives happily ever after."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"\\"Waiting\\" is two faceted. On the surface the book is a sweet, simple story that is an entertaining, simple read. Under normal circumstances, it is a tale that would soon be forgotten. But because the book addresses an issue we all encounter, albeit in different ways, it continues to gnaw on the reader long after the story is over."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Hard to say what I liked about this. Very simple story about people that are very believable. Ha Jin does a good job of getting the reader to care about the characters."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Ha Jin's deceptively simple novel contains many carefully crafted critiques of the People's Republic of China. There is an evolution in the character's thinking, especially in Lin Kong's, about the fundamental confusions of life in the PRC. One telling section is when Lin writes a report for Manna about Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Lin is unable to write about the \\"subjects of sexuality and self-celebration\\" (just those aspects that could have saved him from a bad marriage) and instead sticks to the Party line: he writes on \\"A Song for Occupations\\" which emphasized that \\"workers and farmers were basically the same everywhere\\". Life in the PRC leaves people with little inner life to contemplate sex and individual freedom, and here that is played out in Lin Kong's life long debacle with women. Chinese culture and Chinese Communism, with its unique brands of individual self-exclusion, scuttle Kong's emotional life. We see a man who is baffled by his needs. Yet interestingly, individualist capitalism and its values are bankrupt was well. It is telling that when China opens up to market capitalism in the 80s, the only capitalist Ha Jin shows us in any detail in Waiting is Manna's rapist. Waiting opens to door for one system to be the salvation of the other, and then closes it. In the end, there is no simple resolution to life's bitterness"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'm not quite sure how to feel about this one. The characters' denial and waiting becomes almost unbearable for the reader as the book wears on, and I suppose this could be a mark of Ha Jin's genius and ability to make you feel what Lin and Manna feel, but it doesn't make for fun reading. The only lead character who I felt much sympathy for was Shuyu, and, because little of the book is devoted to her, this made for a lot of irritated page turning. None of the characters come across as fully realised, they travel through the story as more or less one dimensional plot points designed to fulfill their role in the story then move on. The setting is this book's strongest element, Ha Jin has a gift for description and makes the reader feel like they are really there watching this story unfold, but, in the end, scenery alone can't carry a novel. I wouldn't say I wished I hadn't read this, but it wasn't the most pleasurable reading experience I've had lately, and I probably wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"There is no need for me to go into detail what this book is about. I just have to say that this is one of the best books I have read in a while. I love reading books that teach me about different cultures and what goes on in other parts of the world. I am not saying that agree with what went on- with Lin being in love with another womam while being married, but I understand that other cultures look at marriage different than I am use too, I thought what happen to Manna, with the attack was terrible and wish it would have been left out of the storyline. I must say that I loved Lin's brother in law's role in the book-looking out for his sister and all. This is one of the better books out there, I have already ordered more books from this author. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The author writes a good story building on a innate trait that the Chinese people seem to have, patience. He does well to set the story with this foreboding, eventually to the breaking point in the last fifth of the book. This author uses the patience ideal, building up scenerio after scenerio. As the reader you know that the protagonists are being frustrated by the waiting but don't show it. You know something is going to happen, you just don't know what. It is the last dozen pages that give away life's issues.Don't read unless you have patience. The author emigrated from his native China to study at Brandeis U, teaches English at Emory U. One of the few Chinese American men who write good fiction based on life in the new China."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Waiting explores the world of the Chinese cultural revolution from the perspective of two ordinary citizens, or comrades as they are called. The book explores two evolutions- that of the Chinese society, and that of Lin Kong, the central character.Lin Kong is a Chinese doctor during the period of the Cultural Revolution. He feels duty-bound to accept Shuyu as his wife after she is chosen by his parents, but falls in love with a woman, Manna, at his work in the city. Each year, he returns to Goose Village to attempt to divorce his wife, but each year returns to the hospital without the divorce and resulting permission to change his life. Thus, Lin spends 18 years of his life waiting to marry Manna.When they are finally able to consummate their relationship, Lin discovers what the waiting has done to both of them. For the first time, he realizes the futility of what he has done, and wants back that which he can no longer wait for.Ha Jin writes this book with sparse language, yet it is incredibly moving and evocative. Any reader interested in probing the intricacies of the heart is sure to find it fascinating."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; was a book club choice, not my choice. This is why I am in a book club; because sometimes a selection is made that I would never have considered for myself, and discover that it is completely compelling. Like the love affair of Lin Kong and Manna, I couldn't wait to find the time to pick it up and continue reading.I usually did not have to wait long. Lin and Manna did, and that may be the ultimate theme of the book. It is said that delayed gratification makes the getting all the sweeter, but after 18 years, Lin who had settled into a kind of routine in a world where life IS routine, finds it difficult and unsettling to adjust.In some ways, I felt that the story of Lin and Manna's unrequited love was backdrop to the setting of China as it moves from the days of the Cultural Revolution, with all of its rules and strict codes, to the days when influences from the western world begin to creep in and change the fabric of life. That a couple would so willingly abide by such restrictive laws about marriage is incomprehensible in this world of disposable marriages. That they were able to control their passions for over 18 years is incredible to those of us who live in the land of instant gratification. It is this restraint and control, more than anything, that truly explained the absolute power in China at that time in its history.Beyond the historical and cultural themes, though, the sad discovery of Lin Kong that maybe his life was not so bad after all is universal in any time and place, making his story all the more poignant to the reader."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I thoroughly loved the sweet simplicity of this story. It is so true to life: we wait and wait and wait for something, then it ends up not being all we hoped it would be! The insight into the restrictions and pressure for conformity to Communism was so sad. It gave a wonderful insight into the Chinese culture. Don't be fooled by the simple prose...there's alot more going on than meets the eye! This book is recommended for the contemplative reader, not the thrill seeker."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I enjoyed the insight into Chinese culture. I bought this book as a gift for my wife for Christmas. My expectations were high about its creative content. I kept waiting and waiting for a climax which never came. I guess the author was quite ingenious to master the subject, story, and the book's readability into a waiting experience!"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"In this age of instant gratification it seems almost unimaginable that two lovers could live side by side for the better part of their adult lives yet never dare sleep together. That is just what the two lead characters do in Ha Jin's prize-winning novel, Waiting. Lin Kong and Manna Wu meet and fall in love while working at a hospital in China during the Cultural Revolution. However, they dare not move beyond the platonic because Lin is married, though living apart from his wife, and they would risk severe penalties under the strict Chinese system if they became intimate and were found out. Divorce is an option but year after year when Lin returns to his village to cajole his reluctant wife into agreeing to a divorce circumstances conspire against him. It's a great story line and Ha Jin guides us through it with brisk, dialogue-suffused prose. In the process, he enlightens us about Chinese culture and provides ample evidence of the limits of freedom during the days of Chairman Mao.Most reviewers classify Waiting as a love story. And, indeed, the incredible restraint that both characters model through much of the book is both romantic and sexy. It reminded me in that sense of a Victorian love novel. But Ha Jin also infuses the story, especially in its later parts, with a heavy dose of reality that makes one rethink the quality of the love that Lin and Manna share and question their choices. The most intriguing character might be Lin's spurned wife, Shuyu, whose simple, unquestioned devotion to Lin gives her moral superiority and a kind of serenity that none of the other characters ever achieve. But she is a secondary character whose thoughts and motivations Ha Jin leaves unexplored.In the end, this is a good story, well told, that can be read on many different levels. It's also short enough - 300 breezy pages - that one can read it again, as I may, to pick up on some of the subtleties missed on the first go-through."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I'm surprised more reviewers didn't compare this work to Edith Wharton's &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;. The same passive personality of Frome that makes one grind one's teeth in frustration is found in Lin Kong--a good, yet essentially weak man caught in a social lose-lose situation--yet Ha Jin takes the story that one step further that makes it so much more true to life: that there are no quick fixes in life, whether triumphant or (like Frome) tragic. One must carry on, daydreaming perhaps (of which Kong does aplenty) of an easier time, but at the end of the day, one goes home to twin infants who need their diapers changed, a spouse who has needs, and a life that needs living. This quality of realism lends an optimistic twist to Waiting that made the book so enjoyable for me."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I agree with one of the previous reviews, &quot;Life is what is happening while we wait&quot;. I think Ha Jin proved that several times over in the book. I could see what was right for Lin, but he was too busy looking in the wrong direction, waiting and hoping for this exciting life when the life meant for him was passing him by. I enjoyed the story. Reading about life in China during that time period was not something I was intending to do, but I enjoyed learning about that culture. It has prompted me to read more about the culture and the people. I learned and I had fun reading a very interesting story."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"Comrade Manna Wu has spent most of her adult life waiting for the love of a good man that she can call her own. This story gives us a glimpse at the personal lives of couples in Communist China 30 years ago.Manna sets her cap for a doctor in the military hospital where she is a nurse. The doctor, Lin Kong, is torn between the desire for Manna, an intelligent modern Chinese woman that is so far untouched, (nurses must be virgins when they enter the program), and the comfort of his familiar life in the country with a dutiful wife whose bound feet and submissive ways are from an era gone by.Lin's marriage has produced one daughter and the separation between Lin and his wife has gone on for 17 years. So far for various reasons he has been unable to obtain a divorce. In the 18th year of separation he is finally given his freedom to marry Manna Wu. At this point the story takes some unexpected turns that I will save for the reader to discover.Lin is a man who would rather take the easy way out, yet he's concerned with how people view his actions. The 18 years of waiting becomes a comfortable way of life for him, so comfortable that when he is finally freed from the obligations to his wife he realizes that the arrival of his dream might eventually lead to his undoing. A comrade opens Lin's eyes by pointing out that his problem arises from his own character, \\"If you have the will to change you can create the condition for change\\".I enjoyed this book on several different levels, it was a twisted love story that kept me reading and rooting for the underdog, and it gave me an appreciation for a culture and way of life completely foreign to me. I certainly couldn't have showed the patience instilled in the females of this culture but that made it all the more interesting to me. 12/12/00"},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This book offers a fresh, rare look at life deep inside Communist China. There are no formulas for the plot: it's original and the self-effacing perspective of the narrator intrigued me. Waiting is a book without ego. At first the narrative style seemed to read like a translation. But I realized that the author's technique was really an extension of the cultural distinctions about which he described in the novel. He made the culture of Mao inside China come alive for me. The characters were roundly drawn and credible, and the story line, while quite simple, offers an exquisite beauty in the irony of its denouement. Jin impressed me with his sincerity, honesty, vivid portrait work and originality. We are fortunate to have such a well-drawn look at such an inaccessible society by someone who understands it so well. His accomplishment in crafting such moving literature in his second language speaks volumes for his intelligence and creative sensibility. I eagerly await his next novel."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"This is a nigh perfect novel. I loved the sparse simplicity of the writing even though I was initially bored by the soap opera plot of a man in love with a woman, not his wife. But then as it developed I thought, no, this story is more like a post-Cultural Revolution Good Earth. Afterall, there is the loyal, long suffering wife -- Shuyu, only in the modern version the husband abhors the fact that she has bound feet. (In The Good Earth, the wife is equally unsuitable to the upwarding mobile farmer because she has big feet.) In The Good Earth, the good wife steals precious gems and pearls to save the family from starvation. Here, Shuyu's herbal remedies save the lives of Lin's twin sons who are wasting away from dysentary. The concumbine in The Good Earth is little more than a Pekinese pet masquerading as a human being. In Waiting the second wife also becomes a bit of a haridan at the end. At the end of the day, Lin Kong realizes at last the gratitude and love due his loyal ex-wife and daughter. He begs them to take him back as soon as the second wife dies -- which is imminent due to a bad heart. Looking back, Lin is puzzled by the disaster that has become his second marriage and the ultimate failure of his life. He thinks of himself as a good and civilized man. What went wrong? Was it waiting too long? Did he miss the tide in the affairs of men? Or was it an absence of passion on his part? Did he lack the ability to love, was he only able to be the object of a woman's love? Lin played by the rules of the Communist society and led an unsatisfactory life. The brute who raped Manna thrives despite the curse she places on him. His brand of sociopathology serves him well in the modern capitalist China. Well, life isn't fair, even in post revoluntionary China. All of this makes for a most interesting and discussable book."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"I read 3-4 books per month and I kept waiting for Waiting to speak to me.

It was true to it's title--I WAITED, all the way through, for it to become something I would value having read. It was essentially a passionless story about a very dull life, and though it was instructive about the difficult nature of existing in post-Cultural Revolution China, it lacked any real sense of the uniqueness of the land. It was a literary white-wash, which may be of scholarly significance, but it was of no interest as a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Waiting","review":"The only thing of value in this book is the background--China and the way things worked or didn't work in that country before and after Mao. But even that becomes tedious. The characters are about as interesting as stacked wood because wooden is what they are. You learn nothing about them from the way they act or speak. Everything is developed through questions they ask themselves and similar techniques that would earn a &quot;C&quot; in a college writing course. I think the author's background is what won him the award--not the book. After all it is chic of us to heap such honor on a recent arrival to our country.

In 1958, a Virginia couple was arrested for violating state law on interracial marriage. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the law was unconstitutional, thus outlawing miscegenation laws some as old as three centuries. Mr. Wallenstein points out that the laws on interracial marriage tied very closely to social attitudes on race throughout the nation's history and in many cases back to colonial timesHe eloquently and interestingly points out the history of interracial couples and miscegenation laws. The author makes the case that the more you allow the state to dictate about adults, the more everyone loses. Imagine what that means with an amendment.

This book proves that God is the Master Mathematician and we're not. Actually, I'm not any good at math at all, but I understand the basic concept Harrison is writing about. As a matter of fact, its easy to do this stuff yourself. For example: In Chapter 8 I read that &quot;153&quot; is Jesus' celestial number, so I found out on my own that the word &quot;lamb(s)&quot; is in the Old Testament 153 times (Jesus is the &quot;Lamb&quot; of God that takes the sin away from the world)! Also, regarding the 144,000 Jews that will be saved after the rapture, I counted Jerusalem in the New Testament and its in there 144 times! I love this book!

I found it to contain some very interesting information. The book mainly focuses on a limited number of key numbers, such as 3, 7, 144, 153, etc.. It does not attempt to be a comprehensive listing of the significance of all Biblical numbers and their occurrences. E.W. Bullinger's book \\"Number in Scripture\\" is a far better book on this account. Bullinger also provides much more sound analysis of how various numbers are used in the Bible.I found \\"The Pattern and the Prophecy\\" to be weak whenever the author strayed from the mystery of numbers and began sharing his doctrinal views."},{"Title":"Security Adequate... or Not?: The Complete Guide to Premises Liability Litigation","review":"McGoey's incisive analysis of premises security litigation should be mandatory reading for anyone involved with security management.

Barrett Tillman's new book, written for the Smithsonian Institution, is a fresh look at these warriors and their exploits.The book is arranged by war and service, with each recipient being individually covered. What's novel about this effort that author Tillman doesn't rely on just the official (and frequently stilted) citations, but interviewed numerous experts and witnesses of the events along with as many of the surviving medal recipients as he could locate. What you get is what Paul Harvey would call \\"The rest of the story\\", and it includes inter service rivalries and a fair dose of politics as well as courage, heroism and sacrifice.Among the familiar names- Bong, Rickenbacker and Foss you'll find many whose valor have been lost to history. The author also covers aviation-related awards, such as men who received the medal while POWs as well as mentioning some who are commonly believed to have received the medal- Army's Colin Kelly, and some who probably should have- including Marine Marion Carl.Tillman takes time to compare other nations' counterpart medals and deals with the changing criteria for the award through the years. He also includes things you may not have thought of, such as that the B-17 Flying Fortress has been the mount of more CMOH winners (17) than any other aircraft, while the Grumman F4F Wildcat leads all fighter types, with eight.Highly recommended for those who enjoy reading military aviation titles."},{"Title":"ABOVE & BEYOND","review":"Now here is a perfect match of author and subject! Over the past 30 years Barrett Tillman has penned some of the finest non-fiction books and magazine articles on military aviation to see print. His trademarks - in-depth research coupled with a wonderful narrative style - come to the fore in this volume, an unvarnished, incisive look at the Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. airmen for in-flight actions \\"above and beyond\\" during America's past wars.ABOVE AND BEYOND is a marvelous blend of aviation history and detective story. Rather than accepting the official version of events that resulted in the awarding of a MOH, Tillman researched each action, uncovering information that provides a much more definitive account of the aviation Medal of Honors. In some cases Tillman's research amplified the official accounts; in other instances, it corrected the historical record. Though the exploits of many of the airmen in this book are well-known to the public (Rickenbacker, Luke, Foss, Bong, Boyington, etc.) the feeling you get after finishing Tillman's book is one of finally having a true account of the actions of some very brave men.Tillman's book is also enjoyable for the background material he presents on the Medal of Honor winners, the aircraft they flew and the Medal itself - how it was created, criteria for awarding the Medal, myths and misinformation regarding some aviation MOHs not to mention the role politics and inter-service rivalries played in the awarding of a MOH.Until something better comes along, I would have to say this book is the definitive story on the subject!"},{"Title":"ABOVE & BEYOND","review":"PLEASE, America, before it is too late, read and learn about the massive sacrifices and bravery in our past that allowed us to live the lives we lead today. We must restore the honor of stories such as these which will hopefully lead to more young people willing to take risk for our freedoms"},{"Title":"ABOVE & BEYOND","review":"\\"Above and Beyond: the Aviation Medals of Honor\\" by Barrett Tillman is the definitive book for Medals of Honor awarded for in-flight acts. In a single volume, Tillman provides the details as to how each of these aviators earned America's highest honor for a warrior. There is no better book to catalog these great achievements -- and sometimes ultimate sacrifices.The book is logically organized. The first chapter focuses on the \\"Heritage of Valor\\", a very short history on how America recognizes gallant actions in battle. The next five chapters are chronologically organized around World War I; the interim years; World War II; the Korean War; and the Vietnam War. In the book's final chapter, Tillman provides an analytical summary of the awards.Tillman does an outstanding job of putting each medal into context going far beyond what was included in the citation that accompanies the medal. He is an accomplished author who brings the stories to life (which can be appreciated by anyone who has ever had to read a military award citation). Each aviator is given 2-3 pages to describe the events which earned the Medal of Honor, and each entry includes either a black & white photograph or lithograph of the honoree.Many Airmen will be disappointed with the treatment of William Pitsenbarger's Medal of Honor. Tillman considers his actions to be \\"aviation related\\" instead of \\"acts of aerial flight\\", so Pitsenbarger receives only a brief mention at the end of the Vietnam chapter. Also included in this group of \\"aviation related\\" Medals of Honor are the ones earned by Adm. James Stockdale, Colonel \\"Bud\\" Day, and Capt Lance P. Sijan. Maybe a subsequent edition of the book will add the contributions of these warriors too.As can be expected with all of Tillman's works, it was expertly researched, well-written and a delight to read. I highly recommend this book for all Airmen."},{"Title":"Running Wild: An Extraordinary Adventure from the Spiritual World of Running","review":"I first read \\"Running Wild\\" several years ago while recovering from a running injury and it not only gave me the confidence to come back from the injury but also became my running companion. I have since re-read it many times especially before an important race or when the reasons for training get blurry. For a runner it is a spiritual connection to the joy and mystery that running can be as well as historic proof of the origins of American running.

Annerino is a compelling character, with great courage and anyone who has regularly run long distance on trail can see, a man who must have incredible commitment. The book however comes up short of where it could have. After the first couple of run descriptions, the rest merely become a repeat of lack of water, tough conditions, danger, exhaustion and route finding problems. Annerino frequently references that his motivation in running these routes is to gain information on how preceding Indian generations would have used them for trade, however with the exception of a small amount of info, that aspect is largely not covered in the book. It is a shame, as dedicating more print space to that objective would greatly enlivened the book.

With an occasionally scathing and frequently witty style, Laxer uses a variety of personal experiences garnered while travelling in the US to paint a fascinating and disturbing portrait of American society. The first third of the book is particularly effective as the multiple elements of violence in the U.S. are exposed. This book is like a mirror held in front of one's face; it forces Americans to confront some uncomfortable truths about our national character. With nationalistic fervor high from the Sept. 11 attacks, this may not be a popular read at the moment, but I think Laxer offers an intriguing and sobering view of the U.S. that merits our attention."},{"Title":"Discovering America","review":"If you've ever wondered how American life looks to an outsider, turn to this book. If you have any kind of a sense of humour it will make you laugh out loud. These days there is a real need for some self-analysis and where better to start than with this insightful, witty and critical look by someone who has really explored (and understood)the United States."},{"Title":"Discovering America","review":"Yes, Laxer is a socialist. But no, that's not a bad word where he's from. I have read articles by Laxer in the past, and disagree with his leftist take on most issues.But in this book, he is on the money. Canadians have a hard time defining their culture: &quot;hockey&quot; and &quot;not Americans&quot; don't quite do. But being Canadian helps to understand America, and point out the absurdities it stands for. Laxer's book serves to list those characteristics that Canadians know are distinctly American, such as its self-absorption, its in-your-face Christianity, its gun culture, and its do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do approach to foreign policy.Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, given Laxer's political leanings) the book does not touch on solutions, but it does stimulate thought. This is a useful book for introspective Americans, and wary non-Americans."},{"Title":"Discovering America","review":"James Laxer delivers a scathing assessment of the American way of life and the &quot;empire&quot; that has been established. An admitted socialist, Laxer's travels in America for this book carried a specific agenda, which makes his thesis of being a modern De Tocqueville fall short. While he wrote about his disconnected travels from a series of years in this country, his writing was very cohesively wrapped around one simple theme: the U.S. is turning into a glutton wasteland of obesity, greed and delusion. That and the right wing is to blame for everything.I give this book such a high review because Laxer does a superb job shining the light on the inconsistencies in America's history compared to its ideals of freedom. Being the lone &quot;superpower&quot; in the world, Americans have grown accustomed to outsiders attacking our way of life. I found Laxer's assessment on most social issues, including the rampant obesity and the lust for money, to be on target.Had Laxer not had an agenda, he would have talked to a few people like me, whose goals are simply to find meaningful work, raise a family and live in quiet solitude. Money is large amounts does not appeal to me. Stuff, I can do without. America is still made up of millions like me, and they are of every color and religion.I am with Laxer on the inability of many in this country to see this growing American empire. And I believe Laxer would cringe to know that people even as right as Pat Buchanan agree the rampant U.S. involvement militarily all over the world needs to re-thought. I'm sure the two would disagree on the solutions.All in all, Laxer makes some direct hits, but I still believe I would want to live nowhere else."},{"Title":"Discovering America","review":"I found this book interesting because it provides insight into how others might view the United States. Granted, it's only one person's observations, but he has some facts to back up his ideas. A lot of his experiences are just anecdotal.

However I didn't like the formatting. The paragraphs should start with an indent of one centimeter or so, but they don't have any indent at all. It's kind of amateur."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Forget everything you've ever heard about Ulysses. Some people love it, some people hate it.I found that once you get into the flow of reading it, Joyce has a way of representing thought that feels more like you're thinking than reading something. That's what they mean by stream-of-consciousness. Sure, it's old. Sure, it's dense. You probably won't understand every single sentence or word in this epic, but try it. You might like it. It's a fun - yes, fun - book. Joyce jokes around. He is witty, unique, and yes, nonsensical.I loved this book. Not everyone will, but drop your fears and read it. Its difficulty is overhyped. You'll never finish it if you don't start it. It's definitely one of the more rewarding books I've read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a daunting and difficult prospect, contemplating the reading of ULYSSES. Much like Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, this is a book more quoted than read. It comes freighted with the most serious of professorial endorsements and a reputation for \`difficulty' hardly belied by its length.Does it justify its reputation as difficult? Yes. Does that hamper one's enjoyment reading it? Hardly at all. Jonathan Franzen's intervention in a debate about the differences between obtuse and clear writing is hardly helpful when considering ULYSSES. There should be a place for the products of literature, as for any art form, which requires the active participation of a reader, without succumbing to the charge of \`elitism'. Most great writers teach their readers how to read. The same applies to Joyce and ULYSSES (does the same apply to FINNEGAN'S WAKE? I don't know. I'm too scared to read it ...).My advice to any would-be reader - don't be intimidated by this book's reputation. Don't worry if at points, you find yourself confused or lost. Yes, there's a chapter in which Joyce recapitulates the evolution of written English to mirror embryonic development in humans. And yes, the chapter commonly known as \`Circe' is a bit long-winded. Despite that, the novel is a joy to read and to spend time with. Joyce's concerns in writing one day in the life of Leopold Bloom are life-fulfilling. There is tremendous joy, wit, fun and compassion in his portrayal of this most (un?)usual of heroes. It may help to avail yourself of the many resources available on the web. I found a lengthy pr&eacute;cis of each chapter particularly helpful at the start of my journey; and found that, about half-way through the book, I didn't need it any more. It is true that Joyce relied on allusions and references that are now all-but-lost to any modern reader. Again, don't worry. Any annotated edition will carry you through; and/or you'll find that the need to know each reference declines the further you journey along with Bloom.Have courage and you'll be rewarded. The book is life-affirming and very down-to-earth in its concerns. Joyce borrows the structure of Homer's epic in order to lampoon its myth-making and to play with its martial obsessions. Bloom is no hero. And that's the point."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't watch The Producers now without thinking of James Joyce. This stream of consciousness stuff is fun to read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Book was delivered on the scheduled. It arrived in perfect condition. The book is a very challenging read. It is a good choice for a long winter."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One can dispute various things regarding the Gabler edition of Ulysses, but, for me, there was one compelling reason to purchase it.If a reader wishes to purchase one or more books that discuss and/or annotate Ulysses, then this, the Gabler edition of Ulysses, should be given prime consideration. Many of these supplementary books are line coded to the Gabler addition, such as:1. Ulysses Annotated by Don Gifford. This is a large book that annotates almost everything in Ulysses.2. Ulysses Revised Edition by Hugh Kenner. Another book of annotations.3, Reading Joyce's Ulysses by Daniel Schwarz.4. New Bloomsday Book, by Harry Blamires. Line coded to Gabler, but also has line codes for 1961 Random House and 1992 Penguin.5. Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd is an exception as it refers to the 1992 Penguin version of Ulysses. But this book doesn't use line codes.I own all of the above books (+James Joyce and Ulysses by Stuart Gilbert, and am grateful that I bought Gabler."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce through his language and characters reproduces the many complexities of life down to the subtlest of nuances. So much so that, everything being said and done in the book is at once, posessed of a disturbing clarity and a strong undercurrent of confusion and chaso.Just in case you donot understand the book even after the 1000 odd pages, you still come out a winner. for without having understood anything you have understood the primary characteristic of life, which itself at times is like the book. Chaotic.And in case u have understood it, you have succesfully unravelled the mystery called life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First of all, I won't even begin to say what this giant hulk of a book was about, but it still remains my favorite work of literature of all time. The trick to enjoying this one, if you can use a verb like enjoying to describe it, is to simply let it flow and seep into you. It is like Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon in that, there's so much knowledge stuffed into the narrative you'll never be able to grasp every word... And that's okay. You don't have to. It would probably take you decades anyhow. Just sit back and take your time with this one and somehow, it will become clear to you, the same time it's confusing the hell out of you. A definite challenge between love and hate and both of them will win out by the end. But you will feel rewarded when you're finished, if only to say: &quot;Yeh, I actually got thru the whole thing... Finnegan's Wake, which is really mindboggling, may be more of an experiment but this book is the more satisfying work. Don't let it discourage you. It wasn't meant to be read in one week, or even one month. Personally, I read passages of it in different locations, and somehow, that actually helped..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since I would hope most people are convinced of the merits of the book, let me talk about the edition. Academic infighting notwithstanding, I think the Gabler edition is as close to a &quot;correct&quot; Ulysses as we're going to get. The work he has put into studying each word is really astounding, and he's cleaned up a lot of sentences that never made sense earlier (I'm sure plenty of graduate students wrote long papers on how brilliant those nonsensical fragments were), and restored several sections that make it a much richer read - the telegram to Stephen, especially, opened up a lot of things for me.The book itself can get infuriating if one doesn't read it with a guide. Reading it beside the Bloomsday book allowed me to enjoy it the first time I went through it; if I hadn't done that, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much at all. It occasionally seems like he is just throwing in a different gimmick each chapter just to make it opaque - Oxen of the Sun, especially, just annoyed the hell out of me.But there are moments in this book that are unequalled by any other writer in English, and everyone should at least read it once - no matter how many people have ripped Joyce off, no one can get his style just right. Honestly, it is difficult to love this book as much as one might love Portrait, or even Dubliners, but there are moments of great compassion and insight here - you just have to cut through some of his tricks first. And the tricks usually aren't without purpose - most of them do need to be there. I find myself flipping through the book and reading some of the chapters again and again - the first two, Hades, Nausicaa, Circe, and Penelope, especially - and they're rewarding no matter how many times I read them. Beat through the whole book. And get this edition. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've always laughed at X-Files fans, but I'm beginning to suspect a conspiracy. For years now, all I've ever heard is 'Ulysses' is unreadable, obtuse, unwieldly. It is anything but, being outrageously funny, unstoppably readable, dementedly inventive. Why would 'they' want us not to read it? Although it has saturated modern culture, Joyce's frightening lessons have been ignored or emasculated - film, literature, art, music are as timid and cliched today as they ever were, as if 'Ulysses' had never existed. 'Ulysses' demands that we think for ourselves, it bursts with inchoate possibilities we must take up for ourselves. Of course we shouldn't read it. But you really must get this edition (Oxford World Classics, edited by Jeri Johnson). go to 'Ulysses' bald, as I have done so many times, and you will probably throw it down after three pages, frustrated, annoyed, anchorless in a river of unfamiliar words, ideas, style. Johnson's annotation here is scrupulous. For each chapter, she registers the Homeric paralells, she discusses the various schema (each chapter has its own colour, art (eg literature, medicine), body organ etc.), she offers a brief critical precis of what is going on. Her notes, explaining historical literary, popular etc. allusions, are indispensible. With the exception of the (mercifully few) Stephen Daedalus chapters, as dense and (generally) dull as their hero, the book is a joyous breeze (well, almost). This in itself is a betrayal of Joyce - we are supposed to be jolted, confused, lost, such is the nature of modern life Joyce wanted us to taste. But he provided all his friends with clues, and we're just as good as them, right? There's no point talking about the discrete ingenuity of each episode, the depth of character, the unheard-of realism in describing their emotional and intellectual lives, the satire, the comedy, the seething anger at authoritarianism, communal idiocy and intellectual myopia, the parodies and pastiches of all literature and other cultural products. Like all great post-modern works (and like Godard, Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce is a fertile POST-modernist, not a strangulated modernist), it will be impossible to read previous literature in the same way before, while it makes almost everything that came after it seem diluted and half-hearted. Leopold Bloom has been called a bourgeois everyman, but if only he was. His kindness, his (however unmethodical) voracious curiosity, his self-awareness, his humour, are as unusual in 1904 Dublin, as they are in our racist, money-mad, mean-minded, self-obsessed, greasy-tilled society today (I mean Ireland of course). My favourite episode is 'Sirens', the ultimate fusion of everything that is 'Ulysses' - character, language, humour, style, parody, satire, anger, emotion. Life. Now for the Wake!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What a read! Stephen Dedalus's pretentious aestheticism reminded me a lot of Thomas Mann's Death of Venice's character Gustav Aschenbach, without of course the cynical hatred of the rotten Europe, more the wide-eyed lover of the growing Dublin. Leopold Bloom on the other hand seems to be a man to my own naive (or ignorant) tastes. The poetic consumer of words versus the materialist producer of words, a unity of humanity seen through two (or maybe including Molly three) eyes. The allusions to Aristotle and Blake needed a regular flicking through literary notes and for the Proteus chapter even a German dictionary! This was no bad thing though for if anything Ulysses is an education. Like all good things it required work, but with some good notes of history and literature its a must read, as beautiful as the Lithy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is so bizarre it made my eyes itch.

It's worth reading though, because you'll never look at regular novels again the same way."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For the first couple of hundred pages, I found myself throwing it at the wall in frustration pretty regularly. Not merely because of the difficulty (I like long, 'difficult' books generally) but because it's a book that you've got to totally submerge yourself within. Once you get comfortable with the bizarre minutia of daily life in Dublin circa 1904, and with the way that Joyce will change register, tone, syntax and structure, often within the same sentence, it becomes a little more manageable. A little. Each section is deeply challenging, deeply strange. Just when you begin to get the tempo of one, it ends, and you sort of have to teach yourself how to read the next one all over again. It often wasn't clear to me where the mythic and mundane end and begin in this book, because they bleed into each other in different ways both structurally and thematically on almost each page. There are moments of real stylistic brilliance throughout the book (the incredible 'wandering rocks' section, the hallucinatory mythological hodge-podge of the 'cyclops' part), and there were even some parts where I was genuinely emotionally moved (the funeral scene, the final, love-affirming pages of Molly's monologue). That being said, Joyce is also an insufferable intellectual show-off. And while this might be his 'biggest' work, for my money, 'Dubliners' is still his best, because he's at his best when he makes you interested in his characters instead of being merely interested in his own intellect. It definitely helps a bit if you've read 'Portrait of the Artist' first, but you certainly don't have to. And don't bother with a reader's guide. It might help you get some of the references (and god, how this book references things), but it won't help you to actually read it. Enter at your own peril."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stephen Dedalus, Molly Bloom, Milly, Leopold Bloom, Buck Mulligan, and Paddy Dignam, except that Paddy Dignam is dead, (as is poor Rudy), inhabit this tapestry of a book. Dead dog, body bloated, exists just beyond the sands, outside of the Martello tower, Stephen's digs. A dead father, a dead mother populate the story along with sights, smells, but most of all noise-- songs and chants. There are ditties, rhymes, advertisements, sayings remembered, refrains, art songs, Baroque and classical music filling the pages of this book.There is a great send-up on newspapers and the misinformation embodied in them. Parallels exist with Stephen mourning his mother and Bloom his father. The hectic flush indicates a finished man, a drunkard. Paddy Dignam is dead. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam considers his last night, boozing.Molly Bloom is from Gibraltar. Eating liver, Leopold Bloom recalls when Molly laughed at another singer, Ben Dollard, who needed a suit. Poor Mrs. Purefoy has been in labor for three days. Tap, tap, tap sounds the cane of a blind man. Leopold Bloom helps him across the street. Cornelius, Corny, Kelleher is the manager of the funeral establishment. A new character emerges, the citizen. Bloom wants to meet Martin Cunningham about the insurance of Dignam. For an advertisement there must be repetition. That is the secret according to Bloom.Gerty MacDowell is lady-like, pretty. Words used by Cissy Caffrey embarass her. Another of her companions is Edy Boardman. Gerty wishes that her father had avoided the demon drink. Bloom admires Gerty's beauty and has sympathy for her lameness.Stephen, a stand-in for the author, uses a self-description of bullock befriending bard. Stephen is seeking a career in literature, and hopes to avoid a career in the church or in journalism. Bloom was warned by his father not to go with drunken goys. Bloom warns Stephen, taking a fatherly interest in his well-being, away from Mulligan.The most densely written and exciting book of the twentieth century remains exactly that. Its artistry has never been exceeded except, perhaps, in Joyce's FINNEGAN'S WAKE."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I only just finished reading Ulysses myself for the first time and believe I may provide at least some small aid for other prospecitve readers. Obviously the book is complex. I would characterize it as the most difficult book I have ever read, whoever, I would not take this as an offence to the genius of the book. I have read (and performed) Hamlet, Homer, Dante, and a host of other &quot;classics,&quot; but even if you have not you can still appreciate this work. I would be lying if I said I understood all of the esoteric references even to the literature I have read, but lets be honest how many of us can say we havn't been stumped by a book, or movie, or story, or whatever even with references relativly close to our times and places. I know people who would have no clue if I made a reference to somthing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; even though it is both a best selling book and huge motion picture success (Lord of the Rings for that fact). Don't worry if somthing goes over your head. This is not a casual novel (no Koontz or King here). This is a thematic character study. I recently heard an interesting interview with Quentin Terrantino in which he said somthing to the effect of &quot;people don't talk about 'the plot' they talk about their everyday s**t,&quot; and actually that is a pretty fair description of what the framework for Ulysses is. It is one day in the lives of predominantly two people. We are all dynamic individuals, try to immagine a day in your own life and the stresses and desires you face. What memories creep into your concious. What little games do you play at work, with friends, your lover? I bet your not the same person in all those places are you? Don't sweat it if you don't understand a word here and there just take your time and be carefull with the text. The perspectives will shift and the stream of conciousness will kick in and you have to roll with the punches.It will probably help most people to have some reference books available during a reading of Ulysses, but I personnally felt I became too distracted with every little newance (that's probably spelled incorrectly) so I just went with it. There is a reason all the ivory tower types love this book and that is because you can literally spend years deciphering all the layers. The book, like all pieces of art, is a product of its time so be prepared for that as well. It helps to have some knowledge of turn of the twentieth century Irish/English relations, world views, even literary styles of the era. I had a duece of a time getting through the collected works of Poe because so much of it was in German, French, or Latin (you know people in America used to learn Latin in school, how lame ;) ). I have rambled for way to long so I will close with a point. Many people don't understand modern classical music because they don't understand its place in history. Many people don't understand Jazz or Punk or Hip Hop because they don't understand their places in history. Ultimatly Ulysses will be like many other works of art in this regard. Take your time with it and relax with it (you are not being graded on how many of the top 100 of whatever you have read you know). You may not really like it after having read it and thats OK, but don't be a close minded neigh-sayer just because its not your style. I don't really like Russian novels, but I see their quality, just as I see the genius of Pollack, Whorhal, and Basquiatt (probably missed at least one of those names) but would rather hang a Munch or Picasso. To each his own just don't be pretentious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In 2000, the Modern Library came up with a list of the one hundred greatest English language novels of the 20th century. Topping their list at number one was Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce. After completion of this novel, I can conclude that they have made a wise decision.Ulysses follows the lives of two Dubliners, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, on a single day in Ireland. Leopold Bloom is a lonely middle-aged Jewish man who has a wife, Molly and a daughter, Milly. He also had a son that died as a child. Stephen Dedalus is a young school teacher who has seperated himself from his old drunken father. During the day, Stephen and Bloom make their seperate ways through the hectic streets and taverns of Dublin. Along the way the encounter various characters (such as the Citizen and the Anonymous Narrator) that act as symbols for Dublin society and the world in general. By the end of the novel, the theme has been understood. Like that of Homer's Odyssey (hence the name of the title), Leopold (Ulysses) has gained a son in Stephen (Telemachus), and Stephen has gained a father in him.Ulysses is undoubtedly Joyce's masterwork. He takes command of the English language, as well as nearly a dozen others, throughout the course of the novel. Various literary styles are exhibited to fit the theme of each chapter. For example, to show the busy workplace of a newspaper office, Joyce begins each section with a headline that sums it up. A complete five act drama is even included in a single chapter of this novel. Joyce's methods of characterization are also very obscure, yet brilliant. Characters are not characterized by their actions or by dialouge, but by their thoughts and fantasies. This allows the reader to see each character's hidden emotions and fears. These inner monolouges may be triggered by the smallest occurrence, then escalade into the meanings of life and death.I would only recommend Ulysses to an experienced reader with a lot of spare time. This novel is 783 pages long and takes roughly thirty to forty hours to read. Joyce's various writing styles, although genious, are very difficult to read. So, if you think that you can get past these obstacles, should you read Ulysses? There is a simple answer that you will only understand after completion of the novel: Yes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The performance of Donald Donnelly is certainly far better than Jim Norton's one in the Naxos edition of the talking book. But, unfortunately,this is a messy edition and there is no index for the tracks.Naxos edition has an index in the sleeves of each cd cds of the Naxos edition are packed in individual sleeves, unlike this edition )where you can see the first lines that are read in every single track. It helps a lot to find a particular passage or just to find the track that you last listened to.Naxos edition also has music that makes the experience of the talking book a better, more complete one. It also has a cdrom with plenty of information on Ulysses.Moreover, many of the female \\"voices\\" are read by Donald Donnelly whilst the female readeris more present in the Naxos edition.I am going to return this item and it is a shame because Donald Donnelly is really good. I can't say the same about Recorded Books lazy, disorganized edition.PS. There is one last thing. Some words read in this edition are different from what is in the book whilst Naxos edition is exactly like the book.The book I have is the Modern Library edition, 1992."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has taken something like a month, but Ulysses is finally done. I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).Many aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.There are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.I remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.Joyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd.

This copy is a good size, fits in a bag easily, and is easy to carry. Some editions of U have a table of contents with the Greek parallels noted--did Joyce do this at some point? Anyhow, there is no table of contents (which it typical for most editions). This makes it difficult to study, esp. to link it with annotations. I find myself going from text to text trying to find my place in U and the annotations (I use Don Gifford's text). If you aren't willing to put in the time to study the text, I would suggest a text with a table of contents, if you know U and/or like the game of the book, I would highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you've ever wanted to join the intrepid few to have done \\"Ulysses\\" from cover to cover - but have found the task too forbidding - then this is probably the easiest and most palatable way of accomplishing your wish. The two narrators bring the work to life in a way that the printed work can only hint at; with the aid of their command of a dizzying variety of languages, accents, and dialects, you grasp (fairly often at least) what the flat-looking verbiage of the text only intermittently suggests.There are, however, inherent problems with a spoken-word reading of this work. The flitting from thought to thought that characterizes much of the text is slowed down and made too deliberate. The stream of consciousness is slowed to a trickle. Eighteen hours is stretched out to forty two in this reading and the sensation of a flurry of impressions that an ideal inner reading might capture (in Heaven?) is missing. In practice, however, only somebody utterly familiar with all the recondite allusions of the text could possibly read it so rapidly and you will probably get through the work more quickly by hearing this version than by reading it silently.I thought the \\"Circe\\" episode was the most compromised in this reading. It seems to go on for ever with the narrator having to announce the identity of the speaker every couple of sentences and the sense of whirling delirium goes missing because it drags so much. I don't know if this problem can be solved but I wonder if an ensemble of voices in this episode might more closely capture its atmosphere. Another gripe is that Donal Donnelly has a tuneless singing voice and the many musical snatches lose their point as a result. Joyce was highly musical but you'd never know it from this audiobook.But I moan too much. \\"Ulysses\\" is highly problematic - I would say self-contradictory - and I can't imagine any version in any medium could possibly elucidate it completely. This version comes relatively close to giving it point and for that I'm grateful. I've finally \\"done\\" Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since there is virtually no info about this book on this page, here is a brief description. This is a facsimile of the Shakespeare and Company 1922 edition of James Joyce's Ulysses. It is hardcover, and bound in cream-colored cloth. The book was published by Ann Arbor Media Group in 2005. The only other facsimile of the first edition (at least, that I found here at Amazon) costs considerably more. Basically, this is a cheaper option if you want the facsimile. The book is attractive and the text is nice and clear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is said that \\"Ulysses\\" is one of those books no one has ever read. Certainly, simply sitting down and trying to read it cold turkey is much too daunting for anyone who is not a literary scholar (and even some of those, too).The way I did it was to listen to these wonderful CDs while following along word-for-word in the Gabler Edition, published by Vintage, which is the version used by Irish actors Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie. (Purists may cavil that this is not the approved edition, but it's one that matches the audiobook.) The reading is very clear and understandable to non-Irish listeners, and journeys through Gaelic, Latin, French, and even a bit of cat language, if I heard right.Yes, indeed -- one chapter every day or two, followed by an analysis by a professor from one of those CD/DVD college lecture series, and I not only finished the thing but understood it rather well, enjoyed it immensely, gave it as a birthday present to a friend, and now plan to take a second run-through.I must caution that the book and the audio should be used together, or the reader will get lost in the stream-of-consciousness writing that seems almost schizophrenic. In other words, it's not to be listened to in the gym while jogging on the treadmill (I found that out pretty quickly)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim Norton, the actor reading this rendition, is fabulous in all his characters.

If reading this tome while flying, don't be surprised if an attendant comments on your \\"light reading\\". A summer novel for the beach, it ain't. Start preparation with a visit or revisit to Homer's ODYSSEY which forms the circuitous modern adventures of Leopold Bloom in this one-day Dublin \\"odyssey\\" paralleling Homer's hero Odysseus. There are many excellent critical treatments of ULYSSES, which are recommended as guides once the ODYSSEY episodes have been (re)familiarized. These critical guides are not in the nature of the high school/college crib sheets CLIFF'S NOTES, which are to be avoided as the plague, but are scholarly treatments linking the classical approaches with those of Joyce's Bloom. One is advised to read one chapter of Joyce first, consider what was read and how it connects to characters and actions in Homer. If foggy, or puzzling, the treatment of this chapter in the critical treatment should be visited. Then the Joyce chapter should be reread and contemplated. So, on to the next chapter. Sounds challenging and time consuming? Yes , but what a reward awaits those who persevere. Understanding and the layered richness of Joyce will unfold. And then, you are off on the ride of your life.

I personally don't think that Joyce can lay claim to writing a true literary masterpiece simply because the language is immensely challenging. I strongly suspect that the accolades come in part precisely because of the fact that Ulysses rises far above the language of the less-intellectual novels that grace today's best-seller lists, and there is only a certain breed of reader that will wrestle with such a monster and live to tell about it. Not to down-play the other reviews here (which I think are all valid), but this veneration of Joyce seems to have a slight odor of literary snobishness. I can think of many more modern classics that are written with such clarity that even the less 'intellectual' can grasp the depth of the work...and isn't that truly the hallmark of a premiere author?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Masterly done. One of the greatest novels I have ever read. James Joyce always hides another story, an image that passes us during the first read, that envokes us to read the novel a second time. And as soon as we pick the book up again, just when we thought we knew the allegory, another story surfaces itself from the pages. Stunning. An example of this two-sided method Joyce uses in his story is the first chapter. We see Stephen Dedalus shaving himself while he talks to his friend Buck Mulligan, but after a second read of the chapter we don't see Stephen Dedalus shaving but as a reciever of communion from Buck Mulligan who is actually a Protestant priest that consecrates the host at the beginning of the chapter. Only a master can put two stories in one chapter."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you want to understand Ulysses, you HAVE to read Portrait first, by JOyce of course. Try to get some portrait commentary so you know where Joyce is coming from, preferably an essay or two on JOyce's aesthetic theory and on the role of Stephen. If you can, read Dubliners too. I listened to an audio book lecture series on Joyce before i began his work ... it spoke of how the book begins in this oddly shaped tower the likeness of which can only be found in Ireland, hence, an American reader would most likely be ignorant as to where the books begins. As you read, consult the ANNOTATED ULYSSES for vocab and sentences that just seem too complex ... like the first sentence of the Bloom section and the ineluctable modality... - most people would not pick up the Jakob Boehme reference in the sentence, and when you do, if you dig Boehme as i have, let's just say it is a pleasant experience. I suggest the Everymna LIbrary series edition, it is a beautiful edition and has some very insightful supplements, including an introduction, the statement by an American judge that has become so renowned, a history of how the book has been printed(and more oft, destroyed) and a helpful chart on the structure of the book. I suggest one reads as much of this book as one can, even if it is just the Stehpen section, else one might die without at least experiencing part of this genius. Knowing a dash about Aquinas and Aristotle and reading some Berkeley will also sharpen one's mind to what's going on here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great writer. For first readers &quot;Dubliners&quot; and maybe &quot;A Portrait...&quot; are the best books to begin with. The later celebrated and larger books require help in the form of a companion or annotations (Burgess's books -ReJoyce-, and/or other Companions you can buy here at Amazon. In addition his life history is also important) to approach because the scene is a century ago and the references many.

I think it must be the most difficult reading I ever made. Joyce built an entire new language of literature to write this remarkable novel, an original work in all aspects from tale to structure and language. People talk in many codes, from old rude Irish to Latin, Italian and common english. The description of inarticulate sounds like the cat's &quot;Mrkgnao&quot; was quite new to literature. The tale grasps to describe the everyday action of early century Dublin, a single day of the common life of some Irish villagers - every action, every thought and discussion, every joke, memory and dream! The story is about a man that represents the classic hero inside of the common man. Heroic deeds aren't done only in the bloody fields of senseless wars; the common man does great deeds every day without bloodshed. Remember that Ulysses was a a hero that hated war. Joyce believed that modern literature was empty within its meaningless structures and tales; only the profound significance of the classics could inject human soul back to literature. Joyce believed that people were always unconsciously reliving the classics models in their lifes, like a circle that never ends. Finally, the structure is made of many styles in order to create an entire new genre of modern literature. Think of something and you find it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: popular songs, discussions, theatre, oniric events, medieval tales, monologues, mind narrative... &quot;Ulysses&quot; has what it takes to stand among the greatest works of mankind's literature. Scholars say that Joyce wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the book that would end with all books, the final stone of modern literature in its way to regain the soul of the classics.

We are no more than a couple initials followed by a family name that appear above the abstract. In contrast, the degree of immortality gained by an author such as James Joyce in the writing of Ulysses is immeasurably greater. Infused into his character Leopold Bloom are the important details of a day of a life. From his morning ablutions to his final repose, marked by the famous soliloquy of his wayward wife Molly, Leopold reveals to us the broad spectrum of what every rich life might be expected to encompass. From birth to death, from the stirrings of love to betrayals both great and small, Joyce's protagonist experiences them all as his moves through the day--and through reflections on his life from the vantage point afforded by middle age.To help bring this book to life I urge the reader to look up Molly Bloom's soliloquy as performed by Angeline Ball."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is a great facsimile of the first edition.

The flipside of this theme is that human beings don't treat each other like family; rather, we treat each other like dirt.The unity theme in Joyce inspired Joseph Campbell, the great comparative mythologist.The Gabler edition is superior if only for the preface where the simple theme of love is discussed.This book, as the professor I had told the class I was in, will change you.

This tale of the adventures of advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism, philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man. There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the reader to have a wide base of knowledge. The act of interpretation becomes not a burden but an essential part of the act of reading Ulysses for without it the reader might not gain the sense that they are one of the people that the novel is addressed to, rather than just an observer of a finite experience..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Imaginative literature can't afford to dissociate itself from its readership because the &quot;lay-reader&quot; is the very rationale for its existence! Joyce is not a model to be followed by any writer. Granted that it is the reader's prerogative to choose and pick - it is not up to the author of imaginative literature to be selective about his readers. This extremely gifted man had set out to surpass everything produced in literature up to his time, and if his goal had been tedium to the max, he achieved it. I am the first to give Joyce due credit for the linguistic scope and the skill with which he engineered the plot in Ulysses - but answer me honestly: does any of the characters come to live the way - say - Tolstoy manages to animate his people with a much more primitive technique? I seriously doubt it. Joyce the human being had limitations which got in the way of Joyce the writer which prevented Joyce the artist from living up to the full potential of Joyce the talent. Style is a direct reflection of an artist's temperament - obviously the writer of &quot;Ulysses&quot; could never make up his mind what kind of style it is going to be - the book lacks unity and appears in places unnecessarily oracular due to the style, but not necessarily for the subject matter, which can be looked up in a good reference! And if that wouldn't be bad enough, more than once Joyce went off on a rather revealing tangent: take for instance the masturbation scene in &Ograve;Nausicaa.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thought-process of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of a certain and in Joyces time very fashionable &quot;anti-philistine&quot; snobbery. Or perhaps the only reason for writing this way was that Mr. Joyce wished to flaunt his stylistic versatility? I am not objecting to have readers making an effort to get into a difficult text - not at all. But the reward should offer better things than the gratification of a crossword puzzle. We talk about participation. Participation in the artist's temperament to see things the way they present themselves to the artist. This does not prevent us from disagreeing. (I disagree with many things Tolstoy had to say when he couldnt resist to step on his collapsible soap box. But I also appreciate his artistic genius whenever he spares us the lecture.) To give another example: Compare &Ograve;Oxen of the Sun&Oacute; in Ulysses with the moments when women break their water in Tolstoys novels. Giving birth is not a linguistic exercise. Joyce's choice of style (in fact a display of 60 different styles and modes of speech) is just clever but completely detached from the event. What is to be expected at the very least, is a certain coherence of artistic vision, which I find utterly lacking in Joyce. He can't make up his mind, so he throws at us all the imitative bits and pieces from a (very talented) schoolboy's exercise book. Ulysses is the portfolio of a writer's versatility - it is not a work of art. When I was much younger and naive, I had read every single line of Joyce, including his letters and poems and even Finnegan's Wake (what a waste of time). I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories wouldn't be barely remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield. Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. If Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed, then, I am sorry to say, the game wasn't worth the candles. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. In the end, all I ask for, is the readers honesty. Don't just think something is great because a certain establishment says so. Real great artists (like Dickens or Shakespeare) can do without this sort of approval. Don't make it a mission to reach for an icon for no other reason than seeing it hanging high. A failure is a failure even if it is a great man's failure. And Joyce wasn't made of the stuff of greatness. But this is a different story. Approaching Joyce is an experience not unsimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great.

Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the &quot;I'm too deep for you, dummy&quot; school have massive good press from academics. Books like this keep them in tenure, one can devote a whole semester to explaining what is happening on Bloomsday. If you don't have to read this book, you shouldn't bother.

I'll just say one thing to that; if you need to read a piece of research (\\"The New Bloomsday Book\\", etc) in order to appreciate a work of art, visual, literary or otherwise, then the work of art in question has no value whatsoever. I do not need to buy a thick volume on the history, theory and imagery of surrealism to appreciate Dali's paintings, and I sure don't need it to appreciate a work of literature.And of course there is the \\"you didn't like/understand it, you're a fool\\" attitude, very common between so called intellectuals and college poseurs, but, what could anyone do but laugh at that?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I just finished Ulysses (five minutes ago) and was blown away with the psychological insights Joyce was able to display through the characters thought processes' and interactions, both male and female.

I hate Stephen Dedalus. I hate Leopold Bloom. I hate Molly Bloom. I even hate their cat. They're all fatuous and arrogant and dull and dishonest and insecure and insincere and superficial and greedy, and they all take part in a story that's a boring, tedious, frustrating, incoherent, big fat waste of my time and energy. Anyone who claims otherwise is either a massive liar or a sick masochist who deserves to have a bag slipped over their head and be taken away from society. As such it remains one of the most astoundingly honest and ambitious works in modern literature. There is not a book currently existing which is simultaneously as repelling and compelling. Is there a more divisive stirrer of passionate debate in the field of art? Normally a very relaxed, some may say apathetic and pacifistic, individual, I once heard my English teacher saying that Ulysses was nothing but complete garbage. I calmly stood up and punched him in the throat, and I received polite applause as I was escorted from the classroom. Later on, when I reread a section of Ulysses near the middle, I discovered that he was completely right. But you know what? That's life. And that sense of living pours off Joyce's pages and through his eccentric mouldings of the English language like a waterfall. It's almost too much to bear at times. We eat, we drink, we urinate, we defecate, we sneeze, we fart, we stink and we have sex, and after a few decades we die. No hidden wisdom. No great awakening. No grand nobility. No spiritual nirvana.

Brought out inprint in a time when the banning of books was common practice in the war against &quot;obscenity,&quot; Mr. Joyce's work was championed by all liberals everywhere--not so much on its artistic merits, but, rather, due to what it symbolized for them: The struggle of the artist against the State. As for the book itself,the writing was almost secondary. In fact, it was not just derided by philistines; many noteworthy authors--among whom number Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein--questioned its originality and its effectiveness. (For certainly, most of its now-thought &quot;original techniques&quot; had been used before by other writers to far better effect!) That is to say, &quot;Ulysses&quot; became more important for what it was SUPPOSED to represent than for what it actually was. As time passed and young people of a more liberal turn acceded to positions of social authority, &quot;Ulysses&quot; began to be, almost defiantly, hyped as a modernist masterpiece. This, of course, to tweek the nose of the older generation more than to herald a legitimate work of Art. As a result, whole generations of subsequent Americans have had imposed on them the the ready-made opinion that &quot;Ulysses&quot; holds an unassaible position in the Letters of the World; for, certainly, they fear to have attached to themselves the tag &quot;Vulgarian&quot; if they dare to express their own thoughts on this grossly over-rated book. No, truly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a triumph of propoganda that, when taken out of its historical context and judged squarely, falls flat, resuming its true proportions on an artistic level given it by great writers of the time: A dry, pedantic and boring farrago."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Nest-stirring Hi[s]story at 10am in the school of cat-schism[This essay is a reflection on the second episode in Joycean Ulysses titled: \`Nestor']Ire's (land) is the anomie conscientious of \`Trans-mythos' in affectation, floating in a sunken lemuria.

It occurred to me that Ulysses is the greatest hoax of the century, ranking with Conan Doyle's Piltdown Man. Surely, Joyce must have realized that Ulysses was the inevitable &amp; fitting conclusion to the Romantic Age. Art, cut loose from the mooring of God, had steadily drifted away from the universal &amp; towards the personal. Ulysses is the culmination of this trend--a novel that could only be read, understood or enjoyed by its author.

Hardly. A babbling, senseless tome upheld by &quot;literary luminaries&quot; who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent? Yes, that's the gist. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L. Renner, who claims that Joyce's dull (if bedlam) world parallels our own - that &quot;we are all Leopold Bloom&quot;: I deny that I am so uncouth that I would exhibit such behavior on a public beach - in the midst of a fireworks display, to beat all!

It clearly explained the structure of the novel, the personality of the characters - Leopold Bloom ans Stephen Dedalus -, as well as the outline of the plot - a day in the life of these people.The review is very positive. It mentions that it is a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot; and that it is the greatest expression of realism in literature. Furthermore, it is said that the novel tells a &quot;funny, sorrowful and suspenseful&quot; story where &quot;everything happens&quot;.Since I am not an expert in literature I wonder what a masterpiece is? I cannot convince myself this is the best literature can get.Nevertheless, other characteristics mentioned are impossible to grasp. It is obvious that I wrongly assumed that Amazon and I shared the definition of basic concepts such as &quot;funny&quot;.Therefore, I discovered that the novel was not what I though it would be.

I actually did manage to more or less read it all the way through, in one long twelve hour night, which I can never have back now. And I don't know about all the nuances and subtleties that it supposedly contains, but the basic thrust of it was clear enough.Ulysses is basically an unbridled attack on the very ideas of heroism, romantic love and sexual fulfillment, and objective literary expression. This is made especially clear by the title's reference to The Odyssey of Homer (Ulysses being the Latin name for the Greek Odysseus)---and the unmistakably unbridgeable contrast between the two books, both in terms of the content of the stories, and their modes of expression.Odysseus is a great man, King of Ithaca, husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and a hero of the Trojan war. The Odyssey chronicles his heroic ten-year voyage to return home from the war to his wife and son. Ulysses, on the other hand, is about an ordinary day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a bumbling buffoon, impotent both in life and in bed. In Homer's view, man is a heroic, even God-like, being---and woman is more than a match for him. In Joyce's, man is metaphysically ridiculous, especially in matters of sex, and woman is his equal in patheticalness.And then there is the literary style Joyce employs to spew forth this sewage. While Homer's epic poem takes the form of strictly-metered verse, Joyce switches literary mode, from straight prose to dialogue to stream of consciousness (among other things), almost at random throughout the work, though it seems to degenerate more and more toward the end.If the point of Ulysses were to break free of outmoded and arbitrary restrictions of classicism, it would be admirable. But that's not what Joyce is doing. He doesn't offer a positive alternative to replace the Homeric values (which I think are genuine values) upon which he's pissing. He's pissing on them just to piss on them. It's pure nihilism, and it's disgusting.Ulysses is obscene, not because of any language it uses or its obsession with sex, but because of its thematic content---the ideas it conveys. The book expresses nothing less than an all-consuming hatred of man and any positive values to which he aspires. And that is why I think Ulysses is one of the most vile and evil books ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce had sometimes been called a writers writer. One reviewer even suggested we should give Ulysses the benefit of a doubt, for the same reason we uneducated lay-folk use to accept on sight modern physics or Einsteins Relativity theory. Now I can think of all sorts of definitions for the meaning and purpose of imaginative literature -- to serve as the arcane Cabala for the initiates of a secretive cult is not one of them. If a novel lacks what it takes to reach every conceivable kind of reader, regardless whether it is to be received as a pleasure or a nuisance, than it is a failure, plain and simple. I may detest what I read -- even successful novels dont come with a gun held to your head -- but Ulysses is simply an empty shell, nothing left to form an opinion or taste either way. A bad writer is just bad, because he cant cope adequately with his task. But there is also a possibility that I may detest a good writer for the waste of skill and talent on something I deem to be an unworthy or badly misguided effort. So even if I may not like what he has to say, I can still be impressed by the beauty and cogency of his delivery. I dont like it, but the man has something to say, and he says it well. But this here is different: can anybody tell me what else it possibly could be than the vain demonstration of stylistic skills from the portfolio of a great talent -- with absolutely nothing to say? God knows, I am all for a reader who pays to a good authors work the respect it deserves and pitches in a bit of his own effort. This should entitle a good reader to carry home something worthwhile. However it is not just the Ulysses, I got the same impression from the entire work of James Joyce, even from his early poems. Except for a precious few luminous moments (the travel of young Steven in the train compartment, the damp and creeping cold atmosphere on the rugby pitch in the Portrait) it really amounts to little more than an exercise in the rhetorics of imaginative writing. It must be me, but I cant help feeling something amateurish in all this contrived effort. Call Joyce a genius, if you like, we all know he was determined to be remembered as the outstanding writer of the 20th century. And we do! We remember his legend the same way we remember Cervantes or Kafka before we open their books. An aura surrounds Ulysses, and this awe may even carry us through a few passages and purple patches, but thats where the comparison ends. Take away the halo from Cervantes and Kafka and you still enjoy a robust read -- I doubt the same can be said of Joyce. He had the gift, and he knew it, but even his consummate admiration for Ibsen didnt help him to find for himself a story worth telling, that is a story which would make his talent shine and captivate the reader. Technically, Ulysses is a superb piece of narrative engineering. A myriad of leitmotifs and themes entwine, separate and meet again each delivered in a variety of different voices and styles. So, ok, a letter torn to tiny shreds into the river carries to a corresponding theme five chapters later, a piece of soap bought in the morning becomes an important item in late afternoon, a galaxy of town-folks revolve around each other and do their daily chores, though mostly in pubs, hospital-canteens and hostelries -- a tat one-sided should it ever become necessary to reconstruct Dublin from scratch. So our Mr. Bloom masturbates over the sight of a crippled girl -- the joke to write parts of this particular passage in the pseudo-elegant journalese of a turn of the century fashion magazine is lost on me: is it supposed to poke fun on the clich beset thoughts in the poor girls mind? In fact Joyce ventriloquizes a lot; all over the book the English language is taken through her paces like a dressage horse, nobody can deny the authors brilliance, and sometimes he even presents a superb artistic flash, like the gold coins the principle is handing out to Stephen. Yet even here I see the author glancing sideways under his eyelids: are we really looking? Do we catch the moment? (Kafka did such things in his sleep.) So what does all this amount to, on some 800 pages, except to small change? Yes, Ulysses has style, a whole museum of styles to be exact, and nothing but style. After you finish it, if you make it through, you will leave it behind like a confused dream, and forget it just as soon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading &quot;great literature&quot; over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I requested Ulises, Spanish version, which was advertised.Instead, I got an old English version for the price of the Spanish one.I contacted the seller and s/he never had the courtesy of getting back to me. I will never buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those classic novels that gives classic novels a bad name. Modern readers equate the word \\"classic\\" with \\"boring and hard to read.\\" But most classics have risen to that status because they are timeless, powerful and entertaining - Heart of Darkness, War and Peace, and Red Badge of Courage come to mind (all highly readable, by the way). Then there are the novels that have been made famous because of the academic community's inability to distinguish between obscure genius and obscure pretentious pap. Ulysses falls into the latter category.This work has its moments, no question. I actually enjoyed the final hundred pages. Too bad I had to read 900 pages (hardcover version) of intellectual onanism to get to them. Joyce was a talented writer, but trying so stridently to prove that to his readers is just plain arrogant. His prose makes Faulkner look like Crichton. I was able to follow the narrative less than half of the time. Lest you think that has more to do with my intellect (or lack thereof) than bad writing, you should know that I am a well-read, educated person who makes his living as a professional editor. The point is, if a literate audience can't make (any) sense of your work without referring to a 500 page reference book every two minutes, your novel is a failure.Ulysses is a book for people who think a blank white canvas hanging in an art gallery is genius. Fans of Joyce need to read Tom Wolfe's Painted Word before they can have any credibility defending Joyce's &quot;masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book, it is masterfully written and there is not a word that cannot be explained. The negative reviews for this book are written by people who lack the patience or education to understand it. There are stacks of books written just for these people; The New Bloomsday Book being the best one. This is not an Oprah's Book Club book, it is Serious Literature, and it is unapologetic about it. It's fine to say that you didn't get it or you don't understand it; but to make these silly \\"Emperor's new clothes\\" remarks is a display of ugly ignorance.Ulysses demands something of its reader. You need a real education--not a job-training college degree, but the experience of having engaged the works of history's greatest writers for your own benefit and on your own terms. You need to have read a great breadth of authors in real depth, and you need to have understood them. You need to know what happened in the Odyssey, you need to know a fair bit of history, and you need to have read a wide variety of authors from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens. You need to be well-read enough that you can understand what's going on without flipping back and forth to Cliff Notes.It blows me away that one of the negative reviews mentioned that someone was made to read this book in high school: I don't think you can possibly be well-read enough for it in high school. If you're not a voracious reader, someone who reads quality classic literature for the fun of it, you are not in Joyce's target audience. There's nothing here to entertain you if you can't keep up; Joyce isn't Mark Twain, giving you an entertaining adventure story to divert you if his larger social points go over your head. He wants to push literature into new directions, and he is very demanding.But if you are capable of approaching this book, the rewards are astounding. This book is incredibly great; the language will floor you, the characters are interesting and engaging (to whoever said that the characters aren't developed, what more could you ask for than Leopold Bloom?), and the book is very funny in parts. If you can read it, you'll be glad you read it.And if you can't read it, don't sweat it. Most people can't. There's nothing wrong with that--plenty of great authors are very approachable to less well-read people, and it's just that Joyce isn't one of them. Joyce wasn't trying to be mean, he was just trying to use ALL of his education to try some things that hadn't been done before. Try Dubliners, which is much more straightforward and readable, or even Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce and his readers are not \\"overeducated\\"--and what a silly, ignorant, impossible concept that is anyway!Just don't take this attitude that Ulysses is for boring intellectuals. With this attitude, you are the one being snotty, not the Ulysses readers. This book is capable of getting some people really excited and engaged; respect it for what it is, don't deride it for what it isn't. This is a great book for people who have read most of the other great books; it may not be the great book for you. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A good version of Ulysses, no doubt, but it is still better to go with the Gabler edition. The first edition of Joyce's text and many subsequent editions averaged about 7 errors a page. In a book this long, those add up rather quickly. The Gabler edition was researched by a team of literary analysts, and pulled together from the various printed versions of the text as well as Joyce's notes. It is the most accurate version of the text, and I highly recommend reading it over any other version:Ulysses (Gabler Edition)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I see that the Euros love to trash modernism. Because they lack the brains to come up with anything better. This here book is the end of you, and it came from a blind Irishman.

Strangely, there are some people who think it is the best one. that's what the latin phrase (above) means"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of all the editions of Joyce's fattest book available, this is perhaps the best edition. The elegant silver spine shows sophistication at a glance, and the image on the cover is both artistic (black & white photo of a tower) & shows that it is literary (there are words imposed over it). The overall impression that having this book in one's sitting room gives is of intelligence and taste. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am not commenting on the work, just this audiobook version.Poor production and dynamic range. I have the abridged version of this audiobook and sometimes the narrator speaks so softly that I have to turn the volume up and then a moment later he speaks so loud it hurts my ears. I have never had this happen with a Recorded Books audio book. Inexcusable.Also they put in some singing/opera clips. Hey, I came to hear the book not some other stuff the producer decided to put in."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This \\"Reader's Edition\\" of Ulysses cannot be defended on any grounds, not even those of the editor. Mr. Rose claims to have brought the beauty of Joyce's most famous work closer to being appreciated en masse. He strips the work of many techniques that Joyce is admired for, that set him apart as an artist and that he surely intended. Gone are many (there are thousands of revisions) of Joyce's omissions of puctuation, capitalization and other conventions of grammar. There are documented mistakes that Joyce attempted to correct during his lifetime, and three existing editions are far truer to Ulysses as it was intended. There is no reason to subjugate the techniques of James Joyce so people with short attention spans and speciously pedantic (why correct Joyce's purposeful misuse of grammar) leanings can appreciate. If you simply want to know the story buy the Cliff's notes or ask someone who read the book. If you want to find out all the reason's for Joyce's renown read the true \\"reader's editions\\" from the 20's and thirties or ,of course, the 1961 text. I am obviously very angry. Even if I sat and thought for weeks I couldn't put any of my points in a technical manner. If you have read previous editions and enjoy seething, buy this one. Then you too can ask the question: Why would anyone do what Mr. Rose has done?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not a novel in my view, more an artist using all his materials in a vast experiment, with the secondary agenda of shocking the establishment and sensibilities of his time. Constantly changing style and using a truly massive vocabulary, often seemingly at random, he seems to be using his powers to toy with the reader. There is no real story, no exploration of the human condition and yet it is truly amazing. Like watching a world class gymnast who has total mastery of their body you are left feeling Joyce can do anything with our language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jorge Luis Borges once thanked Joyce and Picasso in the introduction of one of his books. It was a joke. Borges obviously felt both names had been evoked so many times as to make the mere mention of either of them seem ponderous. I kind of agree with that assessment.Joyce certainly has received top billing by the academy and if your impression of him is, well, reverent, you are in good company. I read Ulysses first because I wanted to know this huge book which everyone talked about with such admiration and then I read it again in college in a Joyce seminar. I have to say the seminar was enjoyable but not altogether because of the author chosen. I think we students and teacher felt like we were conquering a mountain and were proud of ourselves every step of the way. In memory the actual book does not loom very large in the way other great works do nor do I feel much affection for it. The characters and plot are implanted in my brain but rarely do they move about nor do scenes get replayed in my imagination. Perhaps Joyce's work was so complete that it didn't leave much room for any other imagination to go to work on it so Ulysses never became one of my favorites. I don't suppose I can wholeheartedly recommend the book given my less than enthusiastic feeling about it. In fact I think I learned a lot more from other books by less revered authors. Joyce had talent to spare but I think for me he just loads Ulysses with too many apparently ordinary though symbolic so very literary things and the result is that I am not inspired by his art but rather put off by the excessive weight and meaning the work aquires as one works ones way through. So much has been said about the work that it almost comes to the reader with a feeling of having been pre-interpreted for you. Joyce I think contributes to this reaction because he left little room for &quot;interpretations&quot; of his work, its all layed out for you and there really is no latitude for an individual encounter with it. You either submit to its spell or you don't. Perhaps the net result is that in this case more turns out to be less. It can't be penalized for being too much of a good thing so five stars despite all just said.Some have mentioned that this book benefits from being read out loud. Perhaps that is the Catholic interpretation of this very Catholic author. Ulysses as incantation. That approach does have its advantages with this book. There is available a recording of Joyce himself reading excerpts from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake(Anna Plurabelle). I've heard it and it is like hearing a fairy tale written by the unconscious for adults. His voice is musical and he reads like he is summoning the spirit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel. A true MUST READ for anyone serious about English literature or looking to grow a few new brain cells. Easily one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you didn't read Ulysses, you would never know what the English language is capable of expressing. Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness. So don't give up easy, and you will enjoy it once you start realizing the intricacies of of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, James Joyce's seminal work,has had a profound effect on millions of readers. Ulysses is both crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. It shows the reader a glimpse of one man's struggle to define himself amidst the chaos of modern experience. Ulysses is, perhaps, the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature of the 20th century.Also recommended: REDEFINING THE SELF: SELECTED ESSAYS ON SWIFT, POE, PINTER, AND JOYCE by John Condon Murray"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Simply put, this is the ultimate novel. While it may appear dry in the get-go, you are quickly addicted. Ulysses has tons of fascinating psycho-babble with plenty of believable storyline aspects and character developments to back it up. This one of the rare few books that you must own."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"...there are two kinds, not species of people. The kind who can like or dislike a book and articulate why; and those who can't articulate anything and resort to name-calling and insults.I enjoyed Ulysses. Wasn't an easy read, and I don't like the idea that you have to buy a guide to appreciate all the nuances; but all in all it's worthy of the veneration we heap on it as a truly modern novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The granddaddy of shock-jock and dadaist literature, \\"Ulysses\\" can feel a little dated at times, its brilliant turns of phrases often sounding only rather archly cute and its various \\"voices\\" forced. Well, a great pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it wouldn't be the work that it is. But suffice to say, when it all comes together properly it can blow you away. My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw intellectual and psychic power. Like the epic upon which it is based, \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the nature of the marital relationship. The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\" the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation. Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy. But this is one book that will truly haunt you no matter how you approach it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I hadn't read the book, I think I would simply on the basis of the controversy within this review listing. I think the people who gave it one star should forgive the book it's difficulty and direct their hostility away from it's five-star constituency. Personally, I find the difficulty of the work to be one of its many rewards. But its difficulty really starts to fade after a couple hundred pages as you get used to Joyce's protean style, and settle into Leopold Bloom's head. For those who deride the book's fans as pseudo-intellectual sycophants, I just want to say that most of the pleasures I derived from the book were not intellectual at all. I found it a very moving and uplifting story of the heroism inherent in the simple affirmation of going through an ordinary day. That Joyce implements the whole cultural arsenal of Western Civilization to conduct such a simple story is the evidence of his genius, and if that is too intellectual, I still feel richer for wading in the depths of his book. For it really contains all, or at least it seems to--the epic scope of the book dwarfs the reader coming into it. I certainly wouldn't read this book in order to feel intellectually superior to anyone. I imagine those who enjoy it rather feel humbled from the process. At any rate, I loved it. It is a treasure, the most amazing and titanic example of literature moving forward ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am on the last 100 pages of - what is in all liklihood - the hardest book I have ever read. How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work &quot;Portrait of the Artist...&quot; far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the &quot;unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ulises, es un libro maravillosamente disenado, esta bien de que el autor sea tildado de pedante por haber puesto en el libro cada cosa que se le viniera a la cabeza y hacerlo un poco duro de seguir, pero el libro tiene su valor y no en vano ha siso alabado desde que salio. su complicada estructura se presta a analisis de diferentes esferas de la mente humana. se puede ver como una asociacion de ideas y se necesita de una gran memoria o de una libreta para poder encontrar las referencias o leitmotiv del libro que estan donde menos las pienses. cada capitulo de ulises representa un estilo de narracion y cada uno es una pequena obra en si independiente de las demas. que no encontremos el significado inmediato no significa que sea malo, sino que el autor no estaba pensando en dar a su obra un significado,ese surge mientras lees la obra. los capitulos parecen no tener secuencia logica y los personajes parece que hablan disparates pero si miras bien y lees con calma puedes ver que hay un hilo conductor de la historia, linda parodia de un clasico. cada capitulo es una referencia a la odisea, aunque en algunos de ellos no esta claro a que se refiere hasta el final. es una obra para gente que quiera aprender que las mejores obras estan escritas para satisfacer no a un publico sino a uno mismo y cuando el escribia quien mas disfrutaba era JOYCE LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book.

If you are having problems I highly recommend buying a copy of the audio version and reading along with it. This is probably the only book for which I would recommend the audio edition, Ulysses was meant to be read aloud. Other usefull books to have handy are Gilbert's book and Gifford's book. Gilbert is the standard, basic interpretation of Ulysses, and Gifford's Annotated lets you in on all of the obscure references in the novel. Gifford elucidates references to other literature and the more obscure references to Irish &quot;current events&quot; and such. Finally, I would stay away from the Gabler edition of Ulysses. The general consensus is that for every 4 errors Gabler fixed, he introduced 6 more. The 1961 edition (published by Vintage) is more standard."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical \\"Days in the Life\\" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else!

I would also easily have to say that I have never read a book that was as incomprehensible as Ulysses. I really do not believe that one has to have cliffnotes or any type of 'helpers' to read and understand a book. Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot. I would not recommend it to anyone and I feel sorry for English majors who are forced to read it.

Ulysses is the most beautiful book I have ever encountered and I would urge everyone to become familiar with it and add to their familiarity for as long as they live. That being said, the magnum opus of scholarly works this book has (and will continue to have) added is such that much of it constitutes a forever living and growing part of Ulysses itself. As such, some consistency in pagination is crucial as there is a long established convention of referring to specific lines, words etc ... that is employed by any and every Joyce scholar on the planet. Past reprints and revisions of Ulysses have either maintained the original pagination or indicated in marginalia a mapping to the original. Why Penguin would completely obliterate this (and by extension make the cannon of Joyce scholarship almost unusable) is beyond me. If you want to read Ulysses and have no opportunity to benefit from the insight of others (including those that Joyce worked with on this) then get this book and try to enjoy it in a bubble. Otherwise, it would behoove you to get a printing that respects this book and the reader for what they are."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the British were right to repress the Irish: give them a little freedom, and this is what they do. Every redblooded fellow, of course, has appreciated an analogous phenomenon in Catholic coeds, but here, we had hoped, the subject might be literature, and more than rampant effusiveness might be expected.Don't get me wrong; I don't despise length or density. My favorite book as a kid was _Moby Dick_. I have read _Anatomy of Melancholy_ cover to cover (once: phew). My favorite novel now is _Magic Mountain_. And every several years I reread Boswell. Neither do I mind a little murk: my favorite McCarthy is _Sutree_ in preference to the one about the pretty ponies. I don't mind a degree of exigetical tussle in my reading either. I have been a English teacher for thirty years, so I have ruined more literature by careful analysis than any other cowpoke in the saloon, I reckon.Some here - preening with professorial preciosity, I think - have opined that those who do not appreciate this work, crippled by an unsophisticated need for plot, cling and suckle, eyes closed, to silly old books telling tales suited to their larval sensibilities. Well, plot or not, dull is dull, I say. Plot may be many things - a string for beads, and armature for papier-mache, a rational basis for irrational digression - or it may be absent; but the notion that playing around with plot is so terribly nouveau, and therefore so incumbent on those who would be literarily hip, is preposterous. Think of Sterne, Rabelais, Melville.Some fool even asserted that it is brilliant for a book to be tedious, for life is so, and thus a book as militantly tedious as this is true to life in a way that an interesting book could never be. What desperate rationalization is this?The first time - age 19 - that I tried to read this book, I failed to finish it. I made the attempt because it is a book \\"one\\" reads. I was \\"one\\" back then, had not yet become myself. In the end, such motivation did not sustain me. I slipped beneath the waves, drowning in a welter of Anglo-Saxon phonemes.The second time, I was a teacher, and was thinking of teaching it. I had just finished reading Will and Ariel Durant's _Story of Civilization_, so my reading muscles were unusually fit, and so I prevailed.This book is clever, sure, but that is just not enough. I love games with words, but such delightful shenanigans work best in shorter forms - in poems - or as divertissements or instruments of nuance in longer works, in the service of some literary enterprise worthy unto itself, such as telling a story.

I own several editions of ULYSSES includingother first edition facsimile editions but this one is by far the most comfortable and readable. While it isn't as visually impressive as the Easton Press edition of the 1922 Paris text, which retained the design and Mattise illustrations of the 1935 Limited Editions Club version, it is rather more practical. The binding is incredible. This book will open flat and stay open on any page, making it an absolute pleasure to read effortlessly. The page size is the same as the first edition and retains the wonderful generous margin size. This edition is remarkable for the understated elegance of its appearance. The cover is bound in beautiful blue buckram that reproduces the look of the original paper wraps of the Shakespeare and Company edition. It contains the original title page/colophon as well as the charming message from Sylvia Beech. Signiture numbers are also present. All of the wonderful and odd typos (including a few upside down letters, a result of the original typesetting process) are present and the feeling is like going back in time and experiencing the greatest novel ever written just as those first readers in 1922 did. When I first took the book out of the box my initial reaction was that it was overpriced but once I started reading it, the magnificent, exceptional quality of the book became quickly apparent. I started reading and finished it in three days, the quickest I've ever gotten through ULYSSES. Reading this edition is such a pleasure that I really didn't want to put it down. The price of the book may seem a little high but I assure you, if you love ULYSSES then you are certain to treasure this spectacular edition. I will never need to buy another reading copy of ULYSSES again. The book is so strong and sturdy that it shows virtually NO sign of wear after the first reading. The binding is strong and tight and superior to just about anything else I have seen in this price range. I am so grateful to Orchisis Press for producing this incredible edition. I love it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course \\"Joyce's Ulysses\\" taught by James A.W.

The reviews apply to Ulysses rather than the 1922 edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce's Ulysses closely parallels the events of Homer's The Odyssey, but this journey is far more surreal than Homer could have ever dreamt. The story is set in one day, and mostly follows the principal character Leopold Bloom going through the day.Ulysses does not follow typical conventions of literature, and therein lies its beauty and its freedom. The text is littered with puns and seemingly nonsensical and comical language, one of the highlights being the section written as a play in which all manner of chaos takes place. This text may at first appear to be senseless but perseverence will reward those who would spend time examining its language, which is often made up of multiple words, each constituent part of which relates to a wider topic. This is, in a sense, a scholalry text, as it is so much more than a story, and you need to have the willingness to at least attempt to understand the broader referential context, much of which I am also working on. If that seems like too much hard work, then I doubt Ulysses would provide much enjoyment to you, although that's not to say it can't be read without additional knowledge. It does help to know some of the things going on in Joyce's mind and the history/culture of his beloved Ireland.The version being reviewed here is by Orchises Press, which is a fantastic reproduction of the very first edition of Ulysses printed by Shakespeare and Company. The binding is quite tight and the print quality superb. There is also plenty of space for literary scholars to scribble notes. As it is a sturdy edition, this is built to last. There is no introduction to the text or any essays, and some may prefer this. For first time readers, it can be better to read the text without any preconceptions, just like people who would have read it when it was first published. The cloth cover on this edition, as others have commented, appears a little greener than the original, but most surviving originals have aged to appear exactly like this anyway. As it so closely resembles a vintage copy, it is a very exciting prospect to read Ulysses in the same way its principal adoptors did in the early 1920s. As it is not a vintage copy, you do not need to worry about being ever so careful. Of course, it is still expensive and it is best to treat it with care, but if you had a 1922 copy, you would probably keep it in a cabinet, trying not to disturb its delicate state. For owners of the original who would love to read their vintage copy, but too afraid to, this may be a great solution. Ordering this from the UK from Amazon, it took about three weeks to arrive here from the US, and it was a really terrific moment when it arrived, removing the clingfilm and starting reading it. It is, as a side note, quite a shame that UK readers do not favour hardback editions of books. It is quite difficult to buy new editions of classic books on hardback, unless of course, you turn to the second hand market. It is just a shame that the UK does not seem to appreciate premeire hardback editions of classic texts. oh well...In many ways the Orchises Press version suits both collectors and serious readers. Of course, it is more expensive than the paperback version, and recommended only to real enthusiasts. For me, this is a definitive edition because literary essays, introductions and annotations mean very little to me, as I like to derive my own impressions by reading and do my own research on specific things. As an MA Comparative Literature student interested in Joyce, I feel this edition can be used for serious research without the supplementary scholarly material because it leaves you free to have just the text and your impressions.If this edition proves too dear, I believe the Modern Library (or was it Everyman's Luibrary) have an edition currently in print and should be available to order from most retail bookstores. I saw a copy in my local Borders for 13.99, and if you are considering getting a decent hardback edition, perhaps you could go for that edition, as the Modern Library has an excellent range of titles and deserves to be supported.To conclude, Joyce had an extraordinary imagination and wonderful command of the English language. He is a master of the English language and this is one of his most captivating work. Personally I prefer Finnegans Wake because if you persevere with it, past the first 100 pages, you find some side-splittingly humourous puns. In any case, I will leave my fondness for Finnegans Wake for another review. For now, grab a copy of Ulysses and enter the bizarre world of Joyce where the ordinary mundane things become surreal adventures, and language becomes so unfamiliar that it begins to start making sense again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is a book well worth reading in any form. It is a beautiful story that compounds an epic journey into the sights and sounds of one day. This edition is a good place to begin reading Ulysses because it is a reprint of the first text as it appeared in 1922. While this text has many errors, many noted by the author himself, it is still one of the best representations we have of Joyce's intentions. The editor Jeri Johnson also contributes commentary that is invaluable to those people like me who are first starting to read Joyce.

Enjoy it on your e-reader. Probably adults will be more inclined to enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, the way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not nearly as difficult as it is proclaimed to be, this book seems to have taken Nietzsche's advice to heart: A great writerwrites at such an elevated level that most people cannot understand him. This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader.Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"... The critics rave about Ulysses. Many readers who've slogged all the way through proclaim it to be the greatest book of the 20th Century. Put me in the camp of those who thinks it's a pile of gibberish.It's the only book I've ever read that still had me scratching my head after three chapters. Is it a novel? A series of unrelated short stories? A poem? Apparently, only intellectuals can tell.I was taught that writing is the process of communicating with readers. This book fails miserably at that. I honestly can't summarize the plot. I didn't understand it. Maybe I'm stupid, but I think the fact that Joyce repeatedly breaks into long stretches of French and Latin and his own made-up words--none of which I understand--has something to do with it.I give the book two stars because of Joyce's obvious mastery of vocabulary, and because maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too ignorant to comprehend the genius. But I doubt it. To me, reading enjoyment shouldn't be this hard. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book is simply wonderful, and there is nothing I can say that is more eloquent or unusual than the other many reviews before me.The only thing I would like to mention, is my thoughts on the end. That one, long, run-on sentence. To my mind at least, it felt like he understood perfectly the way a woman can think.Of course I'm generalizing, but I read a review written by a man who'd read the first 50 pages, then skipped to the end to find that flow of thought, and thought it was perfectly weird.I felt sorry when I read that, because the way the thoughts swirl in and out and round about and seem to build with 'fervorency'(is that a word? did I spell it right?), is exactly the way my thoughts wander on occasion, and I marvelled at the way Joyce seemed to be privy to that sort of, what I consider to be, 'female' thought.It was beautiful. I enjoyed it more than I can say. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple things: First off, everyone's heard of Ulysses, and everyone has their own notions of what they expect from a book, what they expect from Ulysses in particular, and how they feel about experimental literature in general (though by today's standards Ulysses appears vastly less experimental than, say, Finnegan's Wake). So basically, if you don't think you'll like Ulysses, you probably won't. And no, it's not a casual read. If you're willing to do some homework, though, which in my case included some Homer, Shakespeare, Freud, and Irish history (though I could go on), it just might be worth your time (lots of time) to slog through all 900+ pages of the thing. But that's just my two cents.The real reason I'm writing this review is to steer people away from the 'reader's edition' of Ulysses--that's the reason for the two stars. This is not the novel as Joyce intended--it is an adaptation by Danis Rose, and reflects what he (Rose) thought was 'accurate.' Though the changes he makes are minor--and, in all fairness, may correct oversights made by Joyce--I am offended by the idea that an editor has the ability to take an important and influential work and make changes as he sees fit. The fact that this edition was ever put to print debases the role of the artist (any artist), and reflects the increasing trend toward commercialization and dumbing-down of art in favor of turning a profit.So--is Ulysses the greatest artistic achievement in any medium, ever? I don't know, and whether I think so is irrelevant anyway. But if you want to find out for yourself, please, PLEASE, at least read Joyce's words, not Rose's."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book -- the physical object, that is, and not just the text. (Because if you're willing to pay this much for a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; you obviously take that for granted.) The volume is larger in size than typical hardcover books today, meaning that the type is a decent readable size and the margins are generous (for the note jotting fiends among us). Great care has clearly been taken in the choice of paper and the sewn binding, which allows the book to lay flat during reading and insures years of re-reading. Although there is no dustjacket the cover is made of very durable material; various cover protectors can be found to stand in or, for the really paranoid, a slipcase can be made or found. It should be added that the text is presented as originally published, so there are no notes or glosses to help the first-time or casual reader; neither are the episodes keyed to any of the line numberings found in other editions. However, those wishing to refer to notes would be best off buying one of the helpful readers' companions by Gifford or Blamires anyway. In relation to other available editions, this one occupies a vast middle ground between the throwaway mass-market paperbacks on the one hand and the out-of-reach collectors' editions on the other. The book's durability and elegant though understated presentation should prove most attractive to those readers who intend to read the text again and again, whether for pleasure or for study. In short, this volume is a keeper."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are a few things you need to understand Joyce. A willingness to set aside race hatred is one. The ability to follow a poet even though he uses a number of different writing styles and narrative techniques. The capacity to explore religious ideas which may not rigidly conform to your own fundamentalist views. And most of all a heart which can feel compassion for all humanity, not just your own myopic tribe, sect, or church. If you have just one of these qualities you will find an unforgettable, life-altering adventure in between the covers of this book. If there is any book out there that has the power to restore one's love for the human race it is Ulyssess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is a mistake to try to read this book along side the Gilbert &quot;skeleton key.&quot; It would be like simultaneously looking at a painting and reading a book on the details of the painting and why we should like the painting.It is not the easiest book to get through. It is not Mike Mulligan and the Steam Shovel or any of the Lord of the Rings books. This is heavy stuff because this book pushes the written word to where it becomes art. The uncreated conscience of someone's race, perhaps.I have read it a few times. I have read certain favorite chapters (like Lestrygonians) at least a dozen. I pick it up from time to time and it is a joy. Aeolus read aloud by someone who knows what they're doing is quite funny.Read the first chapter. Read the Burgess book. Relax. This isn't a book to be consumed like a can of Busch. It is meant to be sipped and appreciated.I can't think of what other book could top the century's greatest works. Some other people prefer Busch. Nothing against Busch, but this book is like none other."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a question that has come up many times. First of all, let me make it clear that I haven't finished Ulysses. I'm in the middle of it, but I feel that I can give a fair review with the amount of it I have read, and I want to review it with it fresh on my mind. Ulysses is not the best novel ever made. Since there is nothing else like it, you can't compare it to anything. It isn't revolutionary, and it doesn't teach the reader any valuable lessons in life, like the Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, or to Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is insanely enjoyable. The monologues of thought and conversations, as well as descriptions, are beautiful. I can't recommend Ulysses to anyone, however, because I'm sure alot of people hate it. It's difficult to understand (at parts), and contains many cultural references (to Ireland), which confuses the reader even more. Something similar to Cliff's Notes might help. If you have read books challenging on the philosophical level before, I can't imagine a better choice for your next novel than Ulysses. (unless, of course, you haven't read the Lord of the Rings or the Catcher in the Rye :oP)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To fully appreciate Ulysses, one has to be aware how truly far ahead of its time this novel was. We have been through Faulkner stream-of-consciousness in high school and college English classes, and we can turn on the computer for live webcams all over the world, and we have been treated to the minutae of the Osbournes and other reality TV series. All of these - whether you consider them high art or dubious social experiments - are attempts to understand the human condition and the interaction among individuals in the most mundane of settings: daily life and relationships and the wandering life of the mind. Just as modern dramatists all stand on the shoulders of Shakespeare, so do modern literary writers stand on the shoulders of James Joyce. It is quite a hoot, however, to read what was deemed so &quot;obscene&quot; - we have sure come a long way (or fallen a long way, however you choose to look at it) - but the sheer craft of this book cannot be denied. Literature turned a sharp corner with this work. Yes, some of the passages can become tedious - and the references obscure (but even if you don't look them up, the overall effect is not lost) - it is best to read those long musing rambles almost with soft-focus eyes and let your mind flow with the words as if they were your own interior monologue. Another useful approach is to read them like poetry. Some of the phrases are just delicious and could stand on their own, perhaps like free verse or haiku. On first try, I didn't make it through Ulysses - a couple of years later, I tried again and took the pressure off myself to understand every sentence or to follow the &quot;story.&quot; I just read, and became completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems, in this new century of total instant access to everything, that the accepted way of persuading people to read \\"Ulysses\\" is to say that it's a damn fine book but you need to be an experienced reader with a lot of time on your hands and plenty of patience...etc. Let's get a few things clear. This is not the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\". There is not some algorithm you have to work out in advance in order to enjoy this book. It's a novel. It's a good read. The other stuff, the background stuff, the structural cunning and the wide-ranging allusiveness, is there in case you want to read it again. Basically, this is an unusually intelligent novel, in a basically comic mode, that plays a few games with the ways that we (sometimes lazily) tend to read. The rest is just a bonus. Joyce is just so generous in his joking and his desire to give us more than we normally expect from a book that we can get a bit overwhelmed by the cornucopia of stuff that he lays at our feet.I first read Ulysses when I was about 17 - I was still in what Americans would call high school, I wasn't reading it because I had to, but because I had heard it was supposed to be one of the best books around and it was set in the city around which I had grown up. I found the first three chapters a bit tricky but I kept going, because it seemed to me that the guy knew what he was doing. Then I got to the fourth chapter, and it suddenly became much easier. It seemed to me that this was the kind of thing that most of the writers I liked were trying to do, but most often failed at, because they just weren't this good. Joyce is supremely good at conveying the physical sensations of being alive - what it's like to be hungry, sad, lustful, worrisome, tired, hopeful, nervous. As the book went on, I knew I wanted to trust this guy. In the later sections, Joyce seemed to be expecting what I wanted to happen, and seemed determined to persuade me that how I wanted the book to develop wasn't necessarily the best way for the book to go - and I believed him. Since I hadn't read many \\"great\\" novels, his changes in style seemed to me to be exactly the sort of thing that an adventurous writer should be doing. I thought then, and still think, that he can be a bit garrulous, but he's such a skilful writer that I don't wish he'd made the book any shorter than it is.By the end, Ulysses had come to represent my basic idea of a really great novel. I had no notion that most novels aren't anything like as daring or as enjoyable. The only other novels I've read since which are both as courageous and as entertaining as this one are Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". Which, I know now, will tell you a lot about my taste in fiction.You really don't need to be an expert reader to appreciate \\"Ulysses\\". If anything, it's better if you have either read everything, or next to nothing. The notes are handy, if you want to know all that's going on - and I don't see why that should hurt. But even without them, Joyce - as they used to say of a certain brand of beer - can reach parts that other writers (or for that matter, beers) can't reach. He is a truly wonderful writer, and I'm (foolishly) proud that the greatest of novelists in the English language was an Irishman.People are still writing great novels - Pynchon's last was a lovely late masterpiece, and Don DeLillo is as vigorous as ever. But my personal opinion is that Joyce kicked a flagging Victorian form into new life, and the impact of his scuffed tennis shoe is still raw and smarting. \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is still awaiting the readers it deserves. In the meantime, there's no reason why any curious reader shouldn't get something out of \\"Ulysses\\". It's my favourite novel. It's also the best Irish book so far. Mind you, I can't wait till Mairtin O Cadhain's \\"Cre na Cille\\" gets translated into English..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Ulysses&quot; is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding book that I have ever read. Its slow pacing and density frustrated me the first time through, although the book provided enough snippets of briliance that I kept reading. However, after putting it on the shelf for a year, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer and read the two side by side. This made the events in &quot;Ulysses&quot; much more understandable, as Joyce borrowed the structure of his book from &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; It also helped me glimpse the true brilliance of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By taking one of history's most epic tales and overlaying it onto a single day in the life of an average, unremarkable man, both books furthered my understanding of the common aims and desires of all people. If you buy &quot;Ulysses&quot;, pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as well; this, more than any &quot;Joyce 101&quot; guides, will help you understand thiss fascinating and multilayered book. If you give it time and don't concern yourself with how long it takes to read, this book will grow on you and you will realize how many insights it provides on the human condition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses (1922) breaks traditional conventions of fiction: like Finnegans Wake (1939) it can hardly be appreciated completely unless passages are read aloud; like Homer's Odyssey it chronicles a plot of epic proportions, with details so rich and colourful they virtually epitomize realism and the stream-of-consciousness technique; and like the short stories in Joyce's Dubliners (1914) or Classical Greek drama, it focuses on a very specific, particular situation: a day in the life of a Dublin canvasser, Leopold Bloom.Ulysses gained a favourable reputation among Modernist contemporaries like Ezra Pound. Its inclusion of the vulgar language of Dublin's people was offensive to many, leading to public book-burnings and prohibitions against its publication. By the 1960s, when such concerns over language had dissipated, Ulysses still remained the esoteric interest of a limited number of readers. This is due partly to the text's numerous obscure passages and its reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; text. However, a basic knowledge of the Odyssey and an acceptance of the stream-of-consciousness technique -- which had, we should note, been employed in limited measure by writers like Dickens -- allows the patient reader to revel in decoding the text's plot, its puns, and its symbolic levels of meaning. Indeed, many editions of the work feature outlines listing some of the main features of each passage -- the equivalent of the pithy chapter titles that usually accompany the text of more traditional novels.Ulysses chronicles a place and time (Edwardian Dublin) but also a site and an age (the city and the 20th century). It does so with language that reflects the irony and fragmentation associated with the Modern era and its problems, as related in the novel. It took many laborious years to write (arguably, only Finnegans Wake would be more challenging to its author). Nonetheless, both of Joyce's long works have been immense influences on fiction and poetry in this century: they have re-asserted and re-emphasized the non-linear, non-written aspects of language (e.g. the Wake begins by ending its last sentence); they have (in Derrida's estimation) overturned Western society's privileging of speech (logocentrism) over writing (since many of the words and puns can only be understood via reading them on the page); and yet they retain a simple, straightforward backbone of human experience, connectedness, and imagination as their primary themes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is an episode of the British TV series \\"Black Books\\" (a surreal comedy set in a second hand bookshop) where Manny says to his cruel employer Bernard: \\"I just sold that customer a copy of \\"Ulysses\\", \\"The Guide to Ulysses\\" and \\"A Handbook to the Ulysses Guide\\". Now surely that deserves a star.\\" This episode is even funnier now that I've read \\"Ulysses\\" for myself. Any reader who actually manages to get through \\"Ulysses\\" probably deserves a star as well.I read this book because it was reported to be controversial and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I knew Anthony Burgess (the author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") was an expert on James Joyce and I've read other books that are written in strange versions of English (\\"The Night Land\\" by William Hope Hodgson, \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban and the aforementioned \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). It was interesting to learn that James Joyce was the writer who invented the lingual style known as \\"stream of consciousness\\".Having already read a Penguin Classics edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man\\", I thought I'd give \\"Ulysses\\" a shot. The copy of \\"Ulysses\\" that I read was a hardcover 1966 edition, published by Bodley Head. At 933 pages, the book posed an additional challenge by having no introduction at the front and no explanatory notes at the back. The plain green cover had no illustration and no blurb. Nevertheless I persevered.So what is \\"Ulysses\\" actually about? The only way a reader can appreciate this book is to have a knowledge of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". That's what \\"Ulysses\\" is - a modern retelling of the Odyssey, taking place in Dublin on June 16 1904. There's no doubt that \\"Ulysses\\" caused a stir when it was first published (1922). People would have been more easily shocked back then. Even when the film adaptation was shown in New Zealand in the more liberated 1960s the audience was segregated by gender.If I have piqued a prospective reader's curiosity, all well and good. Although the book weighs 1 kilogram on the scales, \\"Ulysses\\" is definitely not light reading. As an experimental work, I would say that \\"Ulysses\\" does for literature what \\"Eraserhead\\" does for cinema. That's the best comparison I can think of.

Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps.

Simply: Don't read Ulysses because you feel like you have to or you should, read it because you want to and don't be too proud or afraid to seek out help.I was lucky enough to tackle this book in a classroom setting but it is not so utterly incomprehensible as to make that the only way to understand it. There are many guides (Stuart Gilbert's was the one we used but I suspect there are better. I even found sparknotes useful just for a chapter summary after reading.) to help people through the text and its deeper workings.The real question is, why choose this version of Ulysses over another, cheaper version? The text has been thoroughly reworked and many publishing mistakes directly interfering, misinterpreting, or outright disregarding Joyce's plan for his book have been fixed. The editors have nothing but the utmost respect for Joyce and for Ulysses and that care is evident throughout the book as the hands of the editors remain invisible behind Joyce's words.So rant and rave and rant and rave but I nearly gave this 4 stars just because of the product. The book itself, the binding and the cover, are absolutely terrible. My book was brand new and my cover fell off before I was halfway through it. By the end of the course more than half the books in our class were damaged and many of them had pages falling out as well. There's no excuse for any book, let alone the most important book of the 20th century, to fall apart while reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have never heard anything like this before. It is sure fire to increase one's aesthetic sensibility and broaden one's sense of being alive."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce describes the ways that Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus follow, from dawn 'til night, on June 16, 1904. What's special about this day? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Bloom fixes breakfast, goes to the bathroom, does business, attends his friend Paddy Dignam's funeral, goes back to work, strolls on the beach, gets drunk with some friends, follows the party at a brothel, gets Dedalus out of a problem, and then invites him home for more drinks. Then he goes to sleep. Dedalus wakes up in Buck Mulligan's place (a tower), goes to teach at a school, wanders around the beach after visiting some relatives, goes to the library, in the evening he goes to a bar with some friends, and finally he meets Bloom at the brothel.This immeasurable book is a desperate attempt at capturing the present, which is constantly escaping: the present on the inside and the outside of people. It is an absolute witness of what the characters see, hear, fell, smell, and speak to themselves. It is looking for utter simultaneousness, trying to be an absolut record of everything that goes thorugh the bodies and minds of the main characters. Meanings? Symbols? Interpretations? Infinite. This book leaves, among many others, the sensation that it has passed and left us blank; that we didn't retain anything, that we hold nothing of it: exactly the same sensation that the present leaves on us.Every chapter parallels a chapter from Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and each is written in a different style. As a literary work of art, it is incomparable: it uses language, symbols, syntaxis, pronouns, time, everything, in a unique way, in order to depict for us what happens to a person in a normal day.A separate mention is deserved by the final chapter, the monologue of Molly Bloom. 50 pages without a period, a true masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness. A most faithful portrait of what goes through a woman's mind half awaken, half asleep, a summary of her life and her relationship with Leopold. It is necessary to read this passage in one single effort.When reading &quot;Ulysses&quot;, it is useful to keep in mind Marcel Proust's work. Proust seeks to recover the past long gone, while Joyce seeks to capture the present before it becomes past. This is an overwhelming book, irritating and, above all, admirable. It reaches unsuspected levels of creativity, experimentation and literary depth.Some people don't like it: that's their prerrogative. But to say this is a phony or bad book, is to acknowledge one's laziness as reader. They're losing a tour-de-force in literature.

Ulysses is James Joyce's Bible. What does one gain from reading this novel? Joyce has such a command of our language that it becomes putty in the hands of an artist. Each chapter has its own technique. Joyce wears a different mask for each section so that the reader sees the history of the English language unfold before him. Joyce remains the super-artist however, peering down from his overworld of the ulimate artist. Reading Ulysses will make all modern fiction seem to be the ineluctable flotsam in the path of the Joycean mothership. So who is Ulysses the character? What is Ulysses? Odysseus? Odysseus is the beloved Greek figure who appears in the form of Leopold Bloom. Ulysses was the despised, bloodthirsty, Roman rabblerowser who ended up in one of Dante's jivin' circles. Bloom is not Ulysses. Ulysses is something else. Everything else. A three in one of Bloom, Stephen, Molly; Father, son, mother(holy ghost); Scientist, artist, lover; the meeting place of lust and compassion: Word known to man: Love. Reader beware, Ulysses is not Ulysses, it is something else. It is the Bible of Modernism. or something like that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"An independent discovery of self and matter rarely comes in such obtuse and atmospheric prose as Ulysses does. The most spinalcrushingly dense text this side of the Marquis De Sade and Rabelais, Joyce evolves the subconscious greatness of Bloom by using thousands of references from 20th Century Industrial Europe and weaving them into million mile high levels of plot and thought. Joyce carries subtlety and grace with each poetic sentence and each step of character development; you don't just read, you experience, you live within this world. Immerse yourself in the essence that is Ulysses, whether your teacher assigns it to you or not"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the story of one day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an Irish jew. The novel follows his travels and ends with his meeting of Stephen Dedaulus. By reading the novel, the reader is able to see Bloom's character fleshed out before his eyes, as well as to tap into the personalities of the numerous other characters on the busy Dublin street. Symbolically, the novel parallels Homer's Odyssey, depicting the great &quot;journey&quot; that Bloom travels in one day.Although Ulysses is difficult to read, it is not impossible to complete. However, before even attempting to read this novel, it is best to have previously read several other pieces of literature to aid in the comprehension of the story. You should first already be familiar with Joyce's writings; read both Dubliners to get a feel of Joyce's style, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young to fully understand the maturation of Stephan Dedaulus' character. Next, read the Odyssey, preferrable a verse translation. I'd recommend Robert Fagles version. Finally, it is also helpful to have read Hamlet, be familiar with both the Old and New Testament of The Bible, and know a little about early 19th century Irish history.Even if you are a literary scholar, you will probably still find some parts--probably even whole chapters--confusing or even incomprehensible. One unique characteristic of Ulysses is its style. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not completely written in the stream of consciousness style. Instead, each of the novel's chapters has a characteristic style, ranging from straigt narration to an almost 200 page long play. This can be a bit aggravating for the reader. Another confusion of the chapters is there exact parrallel to the Odyssey. Each chapter does have a parrallel chapter in the Odyssey but while some similiarities can easily be distinguished in the plot, other parrallels are only apparent in symbolism and style. Because of these difficulties it is best to read the CliffsNotes on this book while reading the novel.Overall, I can tell you that Ulysses is quite interesting in some parts and very very dull in others. If you are a fan of literature, I would recomend reading it sometime. Truefully, Ulysses was good but not as great as it thought it would be. My favorite parts of the book were simply the ones that helped to reveal Bloom's character. I got annoyed by the fact that too many other characters appeared and were characterized but actually had very little to do with the story's plot. The plot itself is a bit weak and Joyce is a bit too over-indulgent and is purposefully confusing in describing some of the action of the story (its 783 pages!). Also, in order to understand all of the novel's symbols you would have to read several literary references and this would take forever. I also think that Joyce sort of went a bit too far with literary styles. Some were good but others not so much. I liked the narrative and stream of consciousness chapters, but personally thought that the play chapter failed to convey its message and was meandering. And why wasn't there a chapter in epic format (as was the Odyssey) or other form of poem (Stephen was supposed to be a poet). Finally, I do not believe that Ulysses was universal enough to be considered a masterpiece. One of the great aspects of world literature is that it is supposed to let reader from other countries understand what it is like to live in the country in which the novel takes place. Joyce did try to achieve this goal, but he presented many viewpoints about Irish politics and facts about political figures (Parnell) with even trying to allow the non-Irish reader to understand these people or concepts.Dispite its problems, I would recommend reading Ulysses but if there is any other book you would like to read, read it first because Ulysess does seem to drag on forever. Don't expect to understand all of Ulysses or be excited about unraveling its symbolism. In order to understand most of the symbolism you have to read the CliffsNotes and this kind of ruins the fun of self discovery. The book is not as contreversial as I thought it would be--really the only parts that would warrant censorship are contained in the last chapter (Molly's monologue) but these are rather provactive. Overall, the plot of Ulysses does not neccesarily always make the best story nor could I actually call it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but the book is interesting if you are a fan of Joyce and have the time to spend on it. It took me just short of three weeks to finish it. If you are just reading the book for fun (not for a class) I'd recommend reading it over summer or a holiday because it is definately not a light or short read by any means."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them.

It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel.

Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is one of the most widely discussed, debated, and disputed literary masterpieces of all time, yet surprisingly few of those who discuss it have actually read the book. Reasons range from sloth to intimidation to a flat-out lack of interest. It is important to have some basic knowledge of the premise of ULYSSES prior to reading it; two things are particularly critical to be aware of:1. ULYSSES is an allegory for Homer's ODYSSEY. The whole thing.2. All of the events of the novel span fewer than 24 hours.Trust me, knowing those two things makes ULYSSES make a whole lot more sense.Since ULYSSES is a notoriously difficult read, its readers have come up with various means by which to approach the novel. Different things work for different people, but what follows is my version of a \\"Reader's guide to ULYSSES\\":1. This one is critical: read James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN before ULYSSES. Not only does the former serve as a sort of primer for the latter, but A PORTRAIT introduces Stephen Dedalus, a key character in ULYSSES. Many of the events and circumstances of A PORTRAIT are referred to in ULYSSES, and Joyce will by no means spoon-feed you the connections.Supplemental pre-ULYSSES reading includes Homer's THE ODYSSEY and Joyce's DUBLINERS.2. Remember: this is supposed to be a funny book. If events seem absurd, disgusting, or nonsensical, there's certainly a reason.3. Take... your... time. I spent six weeks reading ULYSSES, and sometimes would spend up to five minutes on one page if I was confused or spacing out. This novel is, frankly, dense enough to sink in a pool of mercury. You aren't going to understand every pun, cultural allusion, or plot point even. Accept it: spend as long as you need, infer whatever you can, try your best, don't get frustrated.4. Do NOT give up! I read this as a 17-year-old; this is NOT an unreadable book! It is a very tough read, but not impossible. If you don't ever abandon ULYSSES, you're bound to finish it. Chapters are long; if you're burning out in the middle of one, just finish the next paragraph, stick your bookmark between the pages, and put ULYSSES on your nightstand for a while.All told, this is one of the greatest and most rewarding novels ever written. Give it a chance, prepare as suits you best, and have a nice read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the more complete edition to which I refer in my review of the free Kindle version of Ulysses.

Still, this has the internal poetry, doggerel, etc. that the the free edition has excised.Update: This is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses at the end of my junior year in high school with absolutely no knowledge of how difficult or \`great' it was reputed to be. I just bought a used copy and started reading after an essay about it struck my fancy on the SATs. There will be people who tell you that Ulysses is a work of art that can be appreciated only by someone of great intelligence and a high level of education. There will be people who tell you that the book is comprised of pretentious dribble that no one actually understands; designed to make \`intellectuals' feel good about themselves for pretending to \`get' it. Both are wrong. Ulysses is just a book. There will be people who love it and people who hate it, regardless of their intelligence. If you hate it, it doesn't mean that you're stupid or that you don't \`get' it; it just means that it's not your cup o' tea. So why not give it a chance?Personally, I'm no genius, and I adored Ulysses. I didn't have to read it with a map, a dictionary, and a book of Irish proverbs at my side, either. Yes, to get every possible thing that you can get out of it, you'll need these things, but you don't need them to fall in love with the characters, laugh at their awkward conversations, or marvel at Joyce's use of language. Chances are, if you can make it through the book out of liking it- and not just out of a sense of duty- then you'll want to go back and read it again anyways (well, perhaps after a short break) so you don't need to understand every little detail your first time through.Because of its reputation, Ulysses does tend to attract either the snobs who quote the most difficult parts of the book as the \`greatest,' or the snobs who can't get over the fact that they don't enjoy one of the most famous books of all time and quote the most difficult parts of the book as a reason not to read it. This makes it seem more dense than it really is. If you're patient and willing to pay attention, Ulysses isn't nearly as difficult as it's reputed to be. Just use the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on this site and take a look at the first chapter. The language itself isn't too difficult, it's the fact that the language and technique do take some time to get used to- so by the time you get into the rhythm, a new chapter starts and the style of the prose changes altogether. You just need to read slowly and patiently- and for the love of God don't skip passages. Yes, there are maybe one or two chapters that are pretty tough (Oxen of the Sun, probably, is the most notable) but the vast majority of the book is perfectly easy to understand to the patient reader.If you do opt out of Ulysses, you'll miss out on some of the most awesome, well-developed, and loveable characters in all of literature. Because Joyce chronicles the stream of consiousness of the main characters in a few of the chapters, we not only get to see what they think, but how they think it. It's hard to explain but very cool. The brilliant, modest, and socially awkward Leopold Bloom takes the role of the 'hero' or 'Odysseus' of the story. There is no possible way for me to describe how deep, hilarious, tragic, and downright likeable he is. Sadly, no one in the book really enjoys his presence, and a cloud of awkward silence seems to follow him wherever he goes. Pretentious, moody, and selfish, Stephen Dedalus takes the role of Telemachus. He's angsty, introverted, sarcastic and incredibly funny. The more minor characters are just as important, notably Buck Mulligan, Stephen's obnoxious, smug, life-of-the-party type roommate (think of your typical frat-boy) is very funny (if incredibly annoying to Stephen,) as is Molly, Leopold's (somewhat understandably) unfaithful wife, whose inner thoughts make up the entirety of the book's completely unpunctuated final chapter. The jingoistic anti-Semite \\"The Citizen\\" and Stephen's clueless, annoying boss are also both amazing.The book doesn't follow The Odyssey religiously, but I did find myself thankful that I had read the Greek epic before approaching Ulysses. This edition doesn't have the names of the chapters, (I don't know if any edition does) and I would suggest finding out what they are and writing them in. They give a good idea of the general theme of each chapter, and the contrast between the ancient heroes (Odysseus and Telemachus) and the modern day heroes (Leopold and Stephen) is a huge point of interest. It's also good to have a decent knowledge of the history of Ireland. I did find myself wishing that I knew more about Shakespeare (Stephen's obsessed with Shakespeare and prattles on about him constantly), other famous authors and philosophers, different languages, and Irish culture and history, but the book taught me more than it stumped me.I am only eighteen, and even though I could talk about Ulysses all day, I know that I don't yet have the ability to even scratch the surface of its' complexity and depth. I certainly plan on reading and re-reading it as I become more educated, but the reason that I want to is because it is, in essence, a good, funny, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining read unto itself. Please, try not to pass up on it just because of its reputation."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you haven't read Ulysses yet, and feel daunted by the wildly different, extremely strident reviews of it, read on and I'll try to explain why this novel is worth your while.First, a brief summary. Ulysses attempts to capture what life was like in Dublin, Ireland, at the start of the twentieth century. It doesn't do this like a history book, solely in terms of political events and noteworthy individuals; rather, it attempts to convey the nature of the day-to-day lives of ordinary people by following its protagonist, an inoffensive fellow named Leopold Bloom, around the city. (It occasionally switches to following a young man named Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom meets eventually, but Bloom is the main character.) It describes the things that transpire in the world around Bloom, as well as the thoughts that go on inside his head.Ulysses contains many disparate literary styles, but none are gratuitous; all are used in the service of the novel's themes. Joyce wanted to show how poetry, history, heroism, romanticism, and indeed all of human civilization, can be found slumbering in each individual, no matter how mundane his life might be. This comes to the fore in chapter 14, in which Bloom goes to a maternity ward to convey his best wishes to a woman in labour. When he arrives, he meets a bunch of drunk medical students who make callous remarks that make him uncomfortable; after some time, the nurse comes in and announces that the woman successfully gave birth, which relieves Bloom's anxiety. In addition to these simple events, the chapter tells the entire history of England. That is, the first paragraph is written in monosyllabic Druidic calls, the second approximates the style of ancient Latin historians, the third glides into early Anglo-Saxon poetry (\\"before born babe bliss had\\"), then it switches to Chaucer and medieval prose, and so on, the style of each paragraph moving a little bit forward in history, until it collapses into a mix of modern slang in the end.Thus, in numerous prose styles, the chapter recreates the birth and life of the English language itself, without warning the reader that it's doing this. In essence, it shows the history of a whole civilization in an original way. But the important part is, it never stops making sense; the plot and the dialogue keep progressing along with the style. Thus, the birth of a child is shown alongside the birth of the whole English language, indicating that civilization is born anew with every new human being. An ordinary birth is made to look like the culmination of all of English history, thanks entirely to this method of describing it. You don't have to have read Chaucer and Shakespeare and Gibbon to appreciate this chapter; Joyce read them for you, so all you have to do is watch the language change.This happens all the time throughout the book. For instance, chapter 13 finds Bloom wandering around on a beach, where some teenage girls are hanging out and talking. Without further ado, the book inserts itself into the mind of one of these girls. Her thoughts aren't anything amazing: basically, she just wants to fall in love with a handsome man, be loved in return, and be happy. However, in describing these thoughts, Joyce adopts the style of a dime-store romantic novel of the sort that are marketed to teenage girls: it's rife with sentimental, flowery prose like \\"the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.\\" The thing is, this style accurately reflects what folks go through during their teenage years: it's got the same heightened emotion, the same vague yearning, the same feeling one gets when falling in love for the first time, that this has never before happened to anyone else and will never happen again, the same romanticism and idealism. Thus, it's remarkably easy to sympathize with the girl, again solely due to Joyce's technique.That's probably the biggest reason to read Ulysses: all these styles and epic analogies are founded on a powerful emotional centre. Some folks like to say that this book is a \\"celebration of life,\\" or something to that effect. Well, in my opinion, it's a book about loneliness more than anything else. A large part of the book consists of Bloom's internal monologues, creating the impression that he's constantly hounded by unwelcome thoughts. When he's not running into hostile nationalists or petty gossips, he thinks about his adulterous wife. Then, in chapter 14, he meets Stephen Dedalus, decides to follow him out of the maternity ward and into the red light district, and then brings him home. Bloom, whose own son died eleven days after being born, feels fatherly affection toward Stephen; yet, Bloom and Stephen have nothing to say to each other. They engage in some small talk, but Stephen clearly doesn't take Bloom seriously, and Bloom doesn't really know how to approach Stephen. Then, Stephen, who is the closest thing to a friend that Bloom has met all day, leaves. Bloom goes upstairs and goes to sleep next to his wife; the final chapter is told from his wife's point of view, and it becomes abundantly obvious that her perception of her own husband is often wrong, and always strangely detached, as if he's not close to her at all despite living under the same roof. The style is breathtaking, rhythmic stream-of-consciousness, highlighting the sadness of this emotional distance between the characters.So, don't feel threatened by the style. Ulysses is very readable; true, each chapter has its own style, but most of the styles are perfectly accessible, and make the plot more engaging. All the \\"difficult\\" parts don't happen until the second half, giving you time to get accustomed to Joyce's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't tell you when he's moving from objective description to internal monologue, but after a while, you can usually tell). Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought this to supplement the 1961 Random House edition (balance of textual corrections and respect for the original, matches most annotations), Modern Library edition (most portable, attractive package as all ML editions, typography a tad hard on my 40-something eyes) and '80s \\"Gabler edition\\" (hotly contested, worth keeping as a collector's item as it's been largely withdrawn).The original Shakespeare & Co. printings are out of my league, although I've seen several.

I doubt my stimulus check is that big.This is a textual facsimile - a photo reproduction of the original, 1000-copy first edition - copy #784, to be exact. It also reproduces the cover typography and the Shakespeare and Co. title page, with an added, Orchises title page to keep the record clear. It contains the original colophon. It doesn't contain the forward, letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf or Judge Woolsey opinion you're probably used to seeing in American editions.In a physical sense, it's hard to say how this is a facsimile, other than Orchises has reproduced the full size of the original. Of course, the paper and binding material are different.Most S. & Co. editions came unbound in blue-green wrappers, and could be bound as desired. This is why you see original printings in such disparate bindings. Orchises has reproduced the color of the original wrappers, although their binding looks a little more green than the original wrappers (maybe the color has shifted on those?). In any case, it's a solid cloth binding, comparable to, say, a better-than-average library binding. Bound size given as 9.6 x 7.5 x 1.7 inches, I measure it a hair taller. I daresay it will hold up to extended use.In addition to giving the slight tingle of pleasure that comes from knowing you're reading the text as originally sold at 12, Rue de l'Odeon, this edition is much more comfortable on my eyes than the others. I like the typeface used by original printer Maurice Darantiere for readability, but haven't gotten a definitive answer as to what it is - does anyone know? Somehow, it just feels right.Orchises says the paper is 50-pound, ph-balanced (aka acid-free) paper, and that seems about right. It's really good paper, with a slight, almost visually undetectable textured finish that feels good to the fingers. Excellent paper-to-ink contrast. I can, and will, read this all day.For the average reader, there's no earthly reason to spend this amount on a novel, and the ML edition will be both more convenient and, with its front material, more informative. For someone who rereads Ulysses for pleasure, it's a joy. The 1922 text has been analyzed to death, and is not without errors (2,000? 3,000? 5,000? the number gets larger each time it's mentioned). It was perhaps inevitable in a book with no clear reference manuscript - even the extant manuscripts were to some degree created by Joyce after the fact for sale. Part of one manuscript was burned by the angry husband of a typist, who found its content objectionable. An appreciable percentage of the text was written as corrections on the original proofs.Hence the charming apology from Sylvia Beach reproduced in this facsimile: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances. S.B.\\"But each effort to correct the errors added more errors, as well as layers of contention. See the well-documented battle over the Gabler edition. Or the disastrous 1998 \\"Reader's edition\\" by Danis Rose. The original is as good as any for reading, and if you care enough to buy a facsimile, you will have other editions for comparison anyway.For scholarly use, this isn't the best edition, since most standard annotations match the Random House or Modern Library editions. Unless you're beyond Ulysses 101 and want to compare editions.This is one of three first-edition facsimiles that have been published. I can't speak to the others, but I can recommend this one. Kudos to Orchises, and I hope they keep it in print. Or not, so my copy will become a minor-league collector's item.Ulysses has become an obsession and and a world in and of itself for its partisans, of whom I am one. The Ulysses obsession is much like the Higher Criticism surrounding the Sherlock Holmes canon. Many people find it bizarre, and I can hardly disagree. If, like me, you've got the bug, I don't have to explain it to you. This is an edition for you.If you don't, I paraphrase Louis Armstrong: \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let's not mince words: Ulysses is one of the highest achievements of literary modernism. But it is also a book that must be read again and again (and again) if it is to be understood and enjoyed. Why buy a pulpy and cheaply made edition that falls to pieces on the second read? The Orchises edition, as a physical artefact, is not only aesthetically worthy of the text it presents (including the generous white space framing the text itself)--it also has the durability and weight you'd normally expect from a Bible.Other reviewers have detailed how this book is a faithful facsimile of the 1922 editions. The only other thing I would add is that this is the edition whose colour scheme Joyce himself oversaw: The white text and blue background of the cover symbolise the pentelic marble of Greece and the greenblue of the Mediterranean respectively (which are also the colours of the Greek flag).I thoroughly recommend this beautiful book for anyone who is serious about Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"June 16th, 1904 in Dublin - a city under British rule and starting to try and shrug off the weight of the colonial oppression. On this day Joyce sets his &quot;heroes&quot; (heroes that only Joyce could create), Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), on their own odysseys through Dublin's streets. Along the way we get a catalog of minor disappointments and victories, major literary experiments and a reading experience to truly last a lifeline.Stephen Dedalus, the hero from Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, is the young student, the educated, literary and artistic individual somewhat based on Joyce himself. Leopold Bloom is the older, cynical 20th century everyman, in search of a son (where Stephen is, to some extents, missing a father). They make their individual journeys around Dublin that day, finally coming together in a chance meeting and then becoming friends.If you are after a riveting story, you won't find it here - the previous paragraph somes it up! What we get is to walk in these (and other people's) shoes for a day. We experience their small successes - an idle flirtation perhaps; we are with them as they realize some minor disappointment. Joyce termed these experiences ephiphanies and, to some extent, that's what Ulysses is - many, many iter-related and multi-layered ephiphanies.We also feel part of Dublin the city and Ireland the country. It's difficult looking back now after 80 years of home rule, with its successes and failures, what it must have looked like then unsure of what the future would bring. Joyce gives us a divided picture - we see the &quot;citizen&quot;, the nationalistic and stubborn individual who desires freedom at any cost; we see those who are staunchly royalist and who support (flirt with in the case of some of the women) the British soldiers. Joyce's picture is no one-dimensioned protestant-Catholic division either. This element of the book has great interest in it's own right.Ulysses has parallels from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The correspondence from chapter to chapter is highly selective. Some chapters use purely literary techniques to make a parallel (in particular &quot;The Sirens&quot;) where others have more pointed comparisons. You do not need to be familiar with The Odyssey to get something out of this book. Familiarity with Joyce's earlier works - Dubliners and Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man - is very useful, as is an understanding of Shakespeare's Hamlet. References to all of these abound.What you will probably also need is a guide. I used Harry Blamires's &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot; and I would seriously recommend using it or something similar on a first reading. Joyce's writing in this book is wonderful but it can be very very difficult. Having someone hold your hand on the journey helps you get much more out of it.The style of writing changes throughout the book; Joyce was experimenting with literary techniques to help tell the tale and give us insight into his character. Some of these are very successful - some are rather inpenetrable. In particular the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter is very hard-going in parts!However, unlike some other literary works, Ulysses is always fun. You might find you get the most out of some of it if you read it aloud (or imagine yourself doing so) because much of the work is highly poetical. For the final chapter - the only one told from a female perspective - the heavy stream of consciousness deserves to be read in a gallop, letting the words flow over you.Joyce wrote this seminal work over a period of seven years and, at times, it felt it would take me that long to finish it. It's certainly not something to embark upon if you won't be able to devote considerable time to it. With so many great books to be read, you may wonder why you should devote this amount of time and energy on a single book. In this case the answer is because it is a unique, wonderful and life-enhancing experience."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily the most exciting book ever written. I'd give it 6 stars (or 10) if i could. Yes, i needed the Cliff notes to help me through it, and yes, i was on disability at the time, recovering from 4 knee surgeries, and it took more than 6 weeks, but it was all worth it. It's an amazing thing, a polyglotting amalgamation of languages (i counted more than 30, and am sure i missed a lot more), internal and external dialogue, brilliantly rendered characters and even dirty jokes.Perhaps i was ignorant beforehand, but i'd always thought that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; referred to only the WRITER'S mental wanderings, the way beats like William Burroughs (e.g., Naked Lunch) and Allen Ginsburg (Howl, America, etc.) would later do it, or Marcel Proust (a\` la recherche du temps perdu--let's face it, the translations just don't cut it) during Joyce's time. But Joyce, progenitor of the beats and contemporary of Proust, did it for DIFFERENT PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESSES, moving from spoken word to internal thought states of several of his vividly drawn characters, and back again. It's almost impossible to convey the wonder of discovering this beauty, the way Joyce represented such a quantum leap in literature from Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Kafka before him, as Einstein did from 19th century physics.And to those who say &quot;anyone who says they've [sic] read this book is a liar,&quot; i promise you i read EVERY WORD, from &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan&quot; to &quot;Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun&quot; to &quot;and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes I will Yes,&quot; the final words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy. And &quot;Frisco Beach&quot; too. (I'm NOT an English literature professor, just a physician--please don't hold that against me!)Challenging? yes. Worth it? oh my, yes. Your eyes (and &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;) will be opened forever, never to approach writing the same way. WOW!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought the edition with the Despite it being on the expensive side, I do not think this is a good edition to buy.

The major obscenity, which should never have been permitted by the USA legal system, the marketplace for literature, or the fawning academic community, was the publication of this duplicitous enigma. Many scholars have devoted their careers to explaining its content, but its raison d'tre and current status are still a complete mystery to me.Psychological Profiling: Joyce/BloomFrom \\"stately, plump\\" Buck Mulligan's entrance on the first page to Molly Bloom's memories of her first lover 20+ hours and 600+ pages later, the unifying constancy is: This is not a \\"reader-friendly\\" work. For example, check out Wikipedia's content descriptors for major sections:* (Episode 3, Proteus) \\"Stephen reminisces and ponders ... This chapter is characterized by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode.\\" [NB: When Stephen thinks or talks, it is often in Latin, French, or Italian - with no translation for the reader.]* (Episode 7, Aeolus) \\"This episode ... is characterized by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\\"* (Episode 12, Cycolops) \\"This chapter is marked by extended tangents made outside the voice of the unnamed narrator: hyperboles of legal jargon, Biblical passages, Irish mythology, etc.\\"* (Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun) \\"This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which seems to recapitulate the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.\\"* (Episode 15, Circe) \\"The plot is frequently interrupted by \`hallucinations' experienced by Stephen and Bloom - fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.\\"* (Episode 16, Eumaeus) \\"The rambling and labored style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.)* (Episode 17, Ithaca) \\"The style is that of a scientific inquiry ... The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.\\"* Episode 18, Penelope) \\"The final episode ... also uses the stream of consciousness technique ... consists of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy: ... she recalls ... wishes ... imagines ... wonders ... senses ... fantasizes ... remembers ...\\"So what's the take-away from this painful experience? For me it was the state of James Joyce's mental health as he wrote Ulysses.ConsubstantialityHere I treat James Joyce and Leopold (Poly) Bloom as one. I will let Stephen Dedalus, a central character, make the argument for me. Early on Stephen makes the argument that Christ and God the Father are one:* \\"... the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ... Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.\\" (p. 22)* \\"... the son consubstantial with the father. ... He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and Others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\\" (pp. 179-180)Having made the spiritual argument, Stephen then extrapolates to the relationship between Shakespeare (\\"After God Shakespeare has created most.\\" p. 193) and Hamlet contending that (a) Shakespeare begot Hamlet, and (b) Shakespeare and Hamlet are one.So here I accept the Joyce/Dedalus argument that the Father and Son are one and that Shakespeare and Hamlet are one and conclude that he is telling us that he and Bloom are one.Psychological Profile: Bloom/JoyceGiven the manner in which Ulysses is written, it is difficult to identify passages representing bona fide hallucinations. I do not accept the \\"fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters\\" (Wikipedia, Episode 15) as hallucinations primarily due to their transient nature. Bloom easily discards his hallucinatory behavior when Stephen is in need of protection, guidance, and mentoring. True hallucinations are not easily discarded when reality dictates the need for lucidity. Rather than hallucinations, Bloom's expressed fears and passions appear to be dream content. I suspect James Joyce kept a dream diary and used the material from it many places in Ulysses. I also suspect many of his dreams were in the form of nightmares, perhaps induced by excessive use of absinthe, a highly alcoholic beverage quite popular at the time.Let's use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) to label Bloom's behavior:* Primary Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by recurrent pornographic sexual images, repeated doubts, the need to have things in a particular order, excessive counting, and word repetition.The entire book is a testimony to Bloom's OCD but two favorite examples come to mind here:* Bloom is asked by an unseen inquisitor what he admires about water. His extensive listing starts with its \\"universality\\" and ends with its \\"stagnant pools in the waning moon\\". (p. 528)* Later, he is asked to describe the content of two drawers which he goes through each evening seeking relaxation before attempting to go to sleep. The detailed listing (pp. 566-568) is apparently revisited each night before going to bed.He even presents a detailed list of men he believes have been his wife's lovers over the years and does so in the order in which she has been involved with them. (p. 575)And by his own declarations of consubstantiality, we have reason to think of Bloom and Joyce as one.In summary, if OCD is your thing, you will enjoy reading Ulysses over and over again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that I have thought about almost all my life. I read it first when I was a teenager, and have read it ten times since. Or more. It is a book meant to be re-read a few times.

I have many people from Dublin in my life. None of them ever bothered to read Ulysses. But by reading Ulysses, I knew much about Dublin by my reading experience. I met some members of a band JJ72 who had went to the same school as James Joyce. This is a great book. People who don't realize that are missing out. They just don't know to read.

I have long questioned Joyce's status as a great writer. Not that he failed to display a knack for the pen - indeed, his _Dubliners_ contains work of substantial depth and real stylistic artistry (particularly &quot;The Dead&quot;). My qualm is with his later works, especially the much-praised _Ulysses_. Here Joyce lapsed into experimentation for the sake of experimentation. The final result was a muddled mess, the underlying meaning of which can only be _constructed_ by general readers of exceptional creativity or professional critics with advanced degrees and an excess of spare time.And even if we give Joyce the benefit of the doubt, even if we believe that he was (like Thomas Wolfe, who had, after all, a very patient editor) writing to capture each and every moment of our lives, we must admit the difficulty of the task. Literature must follow some logical construct; it must sort our daily chaos with art. If we follow Joyce's example by stuffing a day's garbled thoughts into a book, we have created only a mirror - something that apes our futility. True literature, on the other hand, attacks our existence piecemeal. And though such literature may never reveal the meaning of each breath or cry &quot;fiat lux&quot; before God or the Void or whatever lies at the root of the universe, it is a symbol of our unquenchable willingness to kick against the pricks, to grasp at unknowable truth. The artist, in carefully crafting - in reaching for that elusive order and higher truth - breathes new and continual life into those words of William Faulkner:&quot;[Man] is immortal not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice . . . [must] help him endure and prevail.&quot;How can our &quot;puny inexhaustible voice&quot; ring defiantly when, like Joyce, we wallow in our daily morass?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am sure you will not find this worthwhile.

Is it difficult to read? Yup. Most parts you can at least figure out what's going on but some, like the play section toward the middle, at times makes absolutely no sense (and what is up with that, is it a dream or something), but some parts that you think would be impossible, like the massive sequence at the end with Molly not only is nearly compulsively readable but quite beautiful at the same time.

Ulysses is not a difficult work, but it's very funny and very,very human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is the leading literary light of the 20th century. His command of the language is masterful and like the truly great writers, the English language is better for his use of it. His experimentation with stream of consciousness in the opening of the century profoundly shaped the literature that followed. Joyce will be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever to have lived: his writing is true virtuosity in both form and substance. He ranks with Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy. It may help to read this work with guidance by a teacher or professor. If that's not possible, after reading it in college and more recently, I recommend that you read it chapter for chapter with Homer's Odyssey or with a guidebook like Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses: otherwise, the intricate structure of the work may be lost. Bloom is 20th century man: to understand him is to peer into the inner depths of one's own being. Ulysses is magnificent. I stand in awe of this work. I am humbled by it. A more gifted literary genius may never have walked the planet and may never inhabit it, again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me. Then again, I was reading it in a VERY dark room, and I didn't pause for lunch.

I use it as a travelogue of the times of the Irish in theearly 1900s in Dublin, with numerous references to characters of the times, patriots , authors,and issues of the day,,,Flashforward,,,, Joyce work can be very useful in understanding the layout and forces at work in the background of modern Irish artists, ie U2. The creative forces that inspired Joyce are still at work, and have evolved in the modern generations still growing and aspiring to right the wrongs , improve the social conditions , and achieve some aspect of honorglory and success . Ulysses is a tremendous historical documentof those muliple influences that create a Joyce or a Bono."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.&quot;James Joyce"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book took me two months of steady reading to finish. I understood about 30% of it. Was it worth it?Yes:1. The inner-monologue technique really opened up for me on a second reading, and you realise how close to reality Joyce's representation of inner thought is.2. The main character is kind of interesting. A bumbling middle-aged man with lots of curiosity for life and sensitivity to others who is subjected to a range of humiliations throughout the day, from the small (being ignored as he says hello) to the highly disturbing (his wife sleeping with another man in their bed). The interesting part is how Bloom deals with these humiliations. Not angry, and not self-consciously depressed - he just continues on with his day and his thoughts, but you sense that these experiences have changed him in some way.3. There is plenty of interesting commentary on Catholic theology, literary theory, and some of Ireland's history around 1900. If you don't find those subjects interesting, much of this book will bore you.No:1. There is no \\"story\\". No drama, no build up of suspense, no climax, no resolution. The focus is not on a plot, it is directly on the characters, and to a less interesting extent on the language. Entertainment is hard to come by, unless you are satisfied by faintly humourous banter.2. Quite a few of the episodes are very self-indulgent. Joyce was a Modernist, so he was trying to play with forms of representation. One of the episodes is written entirely in the form of a song. Good luck making sense of it.Overall:The book is not worth reading in toto. But parts of it are. If you want to read the best of the novel, just read the Calypso, Hades, Cyclops, Nausicaa and Penelope episodes. That's about 300 pages, and quite worth the effort. You can read summaries of the rest of the novel from one of the many sites on the net.P.S. I leave out the episodes featuring Stephen Dedalus because his character is just a regurgitation of all the philosophers he has read. Sounds like a genius at first, but goes nowhere."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"you have the attention span to tackle it.

Only James Joyce, I believe, could adequately review himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Modern Library (Random House) has ranked Ulysses by James Joyce to be the #1 fiction of the 20th century.Now the question is does it deserve to be called the best fiction of the century?The answer will depend on your background and tastes. If you enjoy philosophy, heavy symbolic imagery, psychology, analysis of religious corruption, drawing parallels between Greek Myths and everyday life, and learning new english words then you will undoubtedly get the most out of Ulysses.I personally think that Ulysses is a great choice as the best fiction of the century because it covers almost *all aspects* of life from romance to racism. And it is one of the first books that lets you really see how the mind works (i.e. &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; technique). But it is probably this psychological aspect of the novel that turns people off. If one can get past this barrier than it can be seen that Ulysses is truly worthy of its #1 ranking.Homer's Odyssey (from which &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the main character) is considered to be one of the greatest books of western literature of all time. It is only fitting that Ulysses fills this role in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot.

If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"That's a fact the pshycological tests don't use this kind of evaluation.

I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a \\"great\\" book and that they just \\"had\\" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First off, let me say that I did not complete this book. One of my English teachers once told me that if a book did not capture your imagination within the first 50 pages, it would be wise to put the book down. Well, I gave this book 225 pages, and I thought that it was once of the most boring and esoteric books I have ever come across. I first read -A Portriat of the Artist as a Young Man-, which I thought was quite good. I came in with high hopes for -Ulysses-, but was very let down. I found myself not only getting lost with the pages and pages of thoughts Joyce presents us with, but also with some of the dialogue, when all the characters rample on about someone speaking Irish. I have no doubt that Joyce was a genious, his books are filled with game show like trivia. However, I think for a book to be considered a \\"Classic,\\" or, \\"one that should be read by everyone,\\" then that book should not have to be refered to as a \\"Project,\\" nor should it take people a year to read, as some of the other on-line reviewers have said it took them. So to summarize, if you want to take a hefty load of your reading schedule just so you can say you've read -Ulysses- be my guest, your a better reader than I am, but for the time being, give me Steinbeck or Faulkner anyday."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its reputation, this book seems to be totally pretensious, written to impress, rather than to communicate.

I have read some great books and I have read some bad books. The worst of these books being Ulysses. Now, I know that the Modern Library has chosen it as the #1 book of the 20th century, but as a common man and not a smarter-than-thou literature expert, I recommend that unless you just want to say you read it, forget it. Read an entertaining author. No wonder Americans don't read more often, the trash that people &quot;in the know&quot; tell them is a classic is as boring as driving across Kansas at 10 mph!This book was deemed to obscene for the US when it was first written. The obscenity seems mild today but maybe they were just placating Joyce's ego by telling him it was too obscene instead of allowing unknowing Americans to waste many hours that they can never have back reading his rambling and self-glorifying pile of dung he considered his crowning achievement.Pass on this one! Read Fitzgerald or Hemingway. Enjoy reading. Life is too short to waste your time on this crap!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It only decries Joyce's Ulysses to know it is so overated as it is. The book is not so good, it is boring, it is a colection of words and a continuous experimentation of styles that, unhappily, do not mean anything to the meaning of the story; that is, the book's language is snobbish and useless.

In this book, they solve the problem by having page numbers from the first edition in the margins across from that page's original bottom line. Still, there are several editions of this book (and countless other books) where the pagination does not match up. This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says &quot;turn to page 37&quot;, and every page 37 is different. I think when the book publishers want to issue a new edition, they should copy the pages from an old edition using the photo-offset process. This is my personal pet peeve and probably has nothing at all to do with the actual novel by Joyce, but I can't really speak on that issue because I haven't read the book yet.

How many other great books could you read in the time it takes to get thru Ulysses (assuming a serious effort)? It's a huge chunk of your reading life. Still glad I got thru it and can now enjoy some familiarity with one of the legendary works of western fiction.I do think Joyce went overboard structurally. Some of the episodes struck me as too cryptic and obscure in their form, their structural basis too removed from anyything meaningful for me. Such a large portion of the book is entirely unconventional in form and it's so overwhelming and confusing. Of course, there is some spectacular writing, and a ton of great wit and laughs. And some of the stream of consciousness and interior monologue sections are so remarkable and compelling that you just have to read it.Some advise no reference materials on first reading. I disagree and say get the Gifford encyclopedia and try to use it only when needed and to try to resist looking up every reference, allusion, slang or colloquialism, etc. I also used SparkNotes just for basic episode summaries. A good dictionary is essential.

It provided just the necessary final incentive needed to throw all the \\"wait 'til a good time\\" aside and actually just read it, which of course is ultimately how it needs to be read.\\"Ulysses\\" is famous for being \\"impenetrable\\" and \\"unreadable\\", but is far from either. Just like other formal experiments in writing, like Beat era writing, Thomas Pynchon novels, and more recently novels by such authors as David Foster Wallace (may he rest in peace) and Mark Z. Danielewsky, it's not a matter so much of understanding everything and getting the plot as it is of letting the book take you along on its own terms. In the case of \\"Ulysses\\" specifically, each chapter is it's own new formal experiment, and it is of my humble opinion that you are allowed to like some parts better than others. Those who have a problem with it are those who go into the reading with their own expectations or demands informing their analysis. \\"Ulysses\\" is an experience, and one that I think most people should at least try to have to see if it's for them or not (just like skydiving or eating unfamiliar food in a foreign country).And like most media, the things that make it controversial are quite often beyond the point, and anybody who actually read the text finds that out quickly. This novel is about a lot of things, love, language, intertextuality, Shakespeare, Greek myth, Dublin (it does, after all, fall between the proto-neorealistic writing of \\"Dubliners\\" and the intense brooding of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"), humour, and life, and there are other repeated themes, allusions, motifs, and forms to give any critical reader much to play with and brood over, but it certainly is not difficult reading and it definitely isn't smut. Go figure.In conclusion, this was a great way to start actually following Amazon's recommendation system, and I'm very proud of myself for finally getting around to doing something I really wanted to do after putting it off needlessly for so long.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many others have written in more words than I care to think about concerning the tremendous effort that it takes to read Ulysses, the worth of this expenditure of your time, and of their almost universal admiration for it. There are a few detractors to be sure and Joyce would be ecstatic that his artfulness has indeed led to his \\"immortality\\" since he is quoted as saying as much.I wish to add what seems to be left out almost universally in the many reviews and recommendations. Everywhere you are told to accompany Ulysses by annotations, discussion/interpretation books but almost nowhere are you told to accompany Ulysses by the words Joyce wrote himself. One of the protagonists, Stephen Dedalus, as well as his father Simon, are not first introduced to us in Ulysses. They are introduced in great detail in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\". Simon's fall from prosperity to poverty and the impact it has on Stephen/Joyce is crucial background. Understanding that \\"A Portrait ...\\" is autobiographical in nature, reveals much about both Joyce and the characters. You are better prepared to meet Stephen with his superior intellect, education, and his feeling of separation from his countrymen and his behavior if you first read \\"A Portrait ...\\".Many of the characters in Ulysses are introduced to us first in the collection of short stories \\"Dubliners\\". Easily two dozen characters from the Ulysses, some mentioned only in passing, are much better developed in short stories in Dubliners.The milieu of Ulysses, as well as the many characters (all meanings intended) Bloom and Dedalus interact with in their meanderings, are better taken in with these two wonderful works helping to embolden you to tackle Ulysses. Both of them are wonderfully approachable, easily read, and are extremely entertaining, full of the wit and wisdom of Joyce. You are certainly more intimately involved with the evolution of Joyce as he proceeds towards Ulysses with these arrows in your quiver.The structure and basic timeline of the book are dictated by Homer's Odyssey. It is certainly easier to understand why Stephen is Telemachus, Bloom is Odysseus, and Molly is Penelope if you have actually read the Odyssey!The reviewer goes to Symphony Space on Broadway almost every year for Bloomsday (June 16). Find a similar event near you. Ulysses is a monster \\"play\\". It is meant to be enjoyed with others and is much more accessible when experienced aloud. Take the time to understand why people believe this to be the best novel of the 20th century. It will be my favorite forever I am sure.Lastly, I do not recommend Gabler. It is clearly marked by Amazon and other booksellers as by Joyce and Gabler. Be forewarned that there is much scholarship which seriously detracts from Gabler's additions, subtractions, and modifications as not intended by Joyce. That said, I am absolutely certain that Joyce would have enjoyed the controversy tremendously. Read Ulysses in whatever form you can get it but prepare yourself first with the words and experiences Joyce wanted you to have first."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't think its helpful to read Ulysses as a novel. If you expect a plot, or a tale or character arcs, or realism, or accessible prose, you will be frustrated. Would you read the Bible with those expectations? Or the Odyssey? And those books along with Hamlet are touchstones for Ulysses but also the caliber of the company Joyce's great book keeps. So how is Ulysses a novel? It has characters that we follow and whose psychology is revealed to us. It uses narrative to move along story elements through the eighteen episodes (though clearly not chapters so more evidence of it not being a novel). There is Bloom's letter to Martha, Boylan's date with Molly and Stephen's homeless fate. Ulysses uses the novel to both explode that form and to honor it as an artistic expression. This aspect of the book; its subverted novelistic qualities is what gives Ulysses its forbidding reputation as unreadable or as pointlessly obscure.The pleasure in reading Ulysses is not novelistic, it is humanistic, it is to ruminate on the existence of Western Civilization. It is to experience connections to our mythic past and our primal present. It is to ponder where our flawed, suffering, imaginative, humanity will take us as we move through the century beyond the Joyce's creation. More than that it's a chance to contemplate our own capacity for contradiction, ambiguity, creativity, perversity, cleverness and fantasy.Joyce isn't just showing off his genius. He is displaying the full range of it so that we can participate in it and take of it what we can, if we can and be not afraid of not making sense. There are deeper truths than simple comprehension and Joyce tantalizes us with glimpses of what they could be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Vintage Classics is a great version to get because it includes the Supreme Court ruling from Judge Woolsey lifting the ban on \\"Ulysses\\" which allowed it back into the United States. Besides, it also contains the corrected text.It's true that this book revolutionized and refined stream-of-conciousness and it's almost too easy to get caught up on that fact. Really, though, Joyce is doing nothing more in his writing than what people do every day in their lives. When I first started reading this book I re-read over passages but later realized it was better to go on, to follow the certain thought process the character had, just to help realize how complex and subtle some things really were. The book is dense but mimicks how a person thinks and feels within the context of every day life. With that said, the plot is only there as something running in the background so that there can be various thoughts provoked by the action. What makes it a difficult read (this is what the writer of preface to \\"Finnegans Wake\\" said as well) is the readers wanting to piece things together systematically so that it makes sense. Have you ever been having a discussion or been walking down the street when something random seems to remind you of something else completely unrelated? Often times a path may be traced to how or why something reminded you of something else and the same goes with this book. But I think the hardest part is accepting that everything fits together even though we don't understand it.As others have said, the last chapter is worth reading the book alone. The inward struggle Molly has with herself, along with her reconciliation at the end, is absolutely wonderful. Without the initial 740 (!) pages written in his difficult style I don't think I would have gotten as much out of this final chapter. I have to say, I was literally breathing heavily after I read this and felt as though I were feeling exactly as Molly. It's certainly a lot of pages to wade through but worth every minute and gives perfect reason for enjoying a second reading.This is by far the most enjoyable and rewarding book I've ever read. When I put it down I thought to myself, \\"What the hell just happened?!\\" and I wish every book could do the same."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems Ulysses touches on every theme experienced in human life. But it doesn't dwell on any of these subjects (or literary style) for long enough to pass judgement.Bloom is criticized for being a jew, but his critics are drunken commoners who are also simultaneously ridiculed and praised. Stephen mourns for his mother but dislikes and avoids his father. Bloom's wife truly loves her husband but she cheats on him.This novel is purposely vague because there are several ways of looking at any one thing and Joyce demonstrates this truth in the various narrators. Almost every character and line of dialogue is considered and reconsidered through the minds of the characters or other unnamed narrators. Joyce is telling us there is no one truth accesible to everyone, all we can do is appreciate the endlessly interactive and timeless quality of an ordinary day and strive to love our enemies."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"OK. It doesn't take a genius to realize that unless you're name is James Joyce you're not going to fully understand this book. There are too many obscure allusions and not even the very well read will get it all. So here's how I tackled the book. Skip the allusions. Yes, skip them. There's no point trying to figure them out because you won't. Just read the narrative, follow the story, trace the themes, and 'try' to appreciate Joyce's style. Then, if you really like the book that much go back and re-read it, only this time use one of the 'guides' to Ulysses that are out there to figure out the allusions.If you approach the book this way it become much easier to read. You'll still get the story, the structure, and the enough of the style."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book designed to make some people hate it, and make some people love it. That's what we all want to write - the seeds of a good debate.Does one need to understand something to appreciate it? I first approached this book like any other - steam through the pages, and try to remember what the story was all about. I found a book which didn't make sense, a book that was near incomprehensible, and I felt frustrated that I could not see what the fuss was all about.I could not hate a book I could not understand, however, except for the fact that it seriously dented my ego. A book I couldn't understand? Never! How dare it??But certain fragments stayed in my mind, and I returned to it again, six months after my first read through.Picked through the text, fell through the lyricism, and replaced the book back on the shelf, where it resided more as a symbol, a badge of courage than a book.And I returned. Again and again. Snippets, fragments, open the book at random, extract. Replace. Repeat.Bit by bit it began to fall into place, the characters and the ambition of the book began to emerge. Bit by bit I began to like it more. I had to stop judging it on its reputation, difficulty or intellectualism. There are sections I love, sections I find a chore to read, and sections I discover all the time. Bizarrely, previously tedious chapters began to come to life, and I began to appreciate them. Equally so, I began to dislike some I previously liked, and the whole balance is always changing. So, I can say that although I've read all the words at least thrice, I have not finished reading the book. And at my rate of a few pages a month, I never will. I hope I never will.Most will either focus on the ambition or the difficulty of the book. There is no need to justify, I think, just read it. There is no need to judge it against any criteria other than yourself; you are the only yardstick any book needs (unless you're an academic, in which case something else is needed). There is no need to redefine &quot;good&quot; over and over again, and justify it.Multifaceted, multilayered, and most of all, strangely human, this is a book I'm not done with yet, and I don't intend ever to be so.That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. It never has ceased to uncover something new each time. The only other book that I can look at time and time again and discover something new all the time is a very good atlas! Well, that's why I think I'll give it 5 stars today. Tomorrow, maybe 4. It changes all the time.Joyce won, didn't he? Everyone wants to write something which is near immortal, and by writing a book which would prompt endless debate, he achieved that goal."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets.

All the bits of doggerel and poetry that are in the text seem to be missing. I made it through 16% of the free edition, and just felt like something was not right. Not having a hard copy where I am, I checked out another Kindle edition that costs about $3.00. It in fact feels complete, at least so far. The poetry is in there, which really adds to the text. An example of what is missing: early in the book Stephen Dedalus is talking to his class, and they ask for a riddle. He gives them a riddle, which is missing in the free text. The ANSWER to the riddle is there, but the riddle itself is missing. Now some have argued here that this type of text is not necessarily integral to the book. However, let's be blunt. You are preparing to tackle one of the most challenging books in the English language. Don't you want the whole thing? To do less is to not do justice to your efforts as a reader.Unlike some here, I don't disparage Amazon's efforts to put these free books out there. I have read several on an extended tour outside the country, where my kindle is my constant companion, filled largely with free books. Some have had typos, some have had formatting issues. The common denominator is that they have all been free. BUT, to read Tarzan of the Apes for free, with some typos, is one thing; to tackle Ulysses without the benefit of the full text seems somewhat pointless, particularly when there is a low cost text available on Amazon which appears to be complete. One last note, though. The edition I am mentioning here is the Unabridged and Illustrated. When it first showed up on Amazon it said Unabridged (annotated). There were no annotations, and I have yet to see any illustrations. Still, this is the text you want, not the free version here.Update: Amazon keeps changing the name of this more complete edition.

Maybe it is, but I know there are more than a few of us who found this book to be a thrilling adventure without quite knowing why. On the surface, it appears to be the story of 18 uneventful hours in the lives of two Dubliners. We see them snark, teach, defecate, work (half-heartedly), worry, lust, and drink. Exciting right? Yes.Admittedly, this book can be exciting only to a lover of language and literature. The book is subdivided into 18 sections, each roughly an hour. Each section acts as its own writing experiment, some more obvious than others. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not written in stream-of-consciousness. It employs this technique, as it employs many others. True, the last section of the book consists of a 40-page stream-of-consciousness sentence, but another section presents itself as a play where the stage directions help move the reader into the subconscious desires/fears of the characters. I doubt Joyce was ignorant of Freud. And I can't forget to mention that the layers of symbolism and metaphor are absolutely dazzlying.But if Ulysses was nothing more than a writing experiment, it would be dull even to the most erudite of readers. Its true strength lies in its surprising humanity. By poking at the heads of the two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce offers up one of the most complete portraits of the human experience ever put into words. The sylistic experiments are not simply indulgent, but are woven into the fabric of this portrait.Everthing ties together in a phantasmagoric representation of the mundane, complete with a brilliant and frightening climax that seems to fuse every primal symbol of the universe into a single sentence....But I had help with this one. If I hadn't had the professor I had and a whole month to study the book, I may never have had the literary adventure I did. To anyone who wants to tackle this beast, I recomend picking up the EXCELLENT guide, The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses, by Harry Blamires.

ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.Much of this is true.But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think there is one sentence in Ulysses that sums up Joyce's intention perfectly: \\"Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\\"This really is a great book, full of humor and insight and what I can only describe as those little sparks of recognition you get when you see your own life in great literature. And I think it even has something akin to a real spiritual revelation we desperately need in the West (see the quote above). But there's no denying that Joyce was a sadist, linguistically speaking. Like all Irish writers I've ever read about, Joyce had mixed feelings about English. It was not his true native language and, while he loved it, he was always knew that it was a kind of shackle on his country. The issue comes up in A Portrait (when young Stephen bristles that he knows the language better than the English priest who's teaching it) and it reappears very early in Ulysses.At breakfast, Haines confounds the old milk woman with his speech in Irish (it's French, for all she knows). In his mind, Stephen associates the old woman with all of Ireland, and Haines' command of the Irish language is emblematic of his status as conqueror (he's conquered the land and assimilated the language, and now he's come to plunder the culture! Haines is in Ireland to collect folk tales). Joyce may not have embraced the Irish cause like many of his contemporaries, but he had his own more subtle form of revolt. He wanted to bind the English speaking world with one of it's own shackles. In Richard Ellman's biography, someone tells Joyce he demands too much of his readers. He flatly replies that his only demand was that his readers spend their whole lives reading him. He wanted to make us all slaves! Just read those two mind-bending sentences near the beginning of the Oxen of the Sun chapter and imagine what sadistic pleasure Joyce must have felt writing them. You can almost hear him shout, \\"take that!\\" And any time you come to a particularly difficult section of the book, just imagine Joyce there beside you saying, \\"Hey, don't look at me. It's YOUR language.\\"I'm sure what throws most people is the third chapter that begins \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\" Up to then, things have been pretty clear, except for the occasional shifts from dialogue to thought, which Joyce does without giving us those helpful little \`he said's and \`he thought's. He doesn't even give us quotation marks (he didn't use them because he thought they were ugly, by the way). We've seen-and \\"seen\\" is the key word...we have not been told by a narrator...it's as if we are there watching it all-we've seen Stephen have breakfast in the tower, walk with Mulligan and Haines to the bathing area, teach his class, and talk with Deasy. But suddenly we find ourselves inside his head along with Kant, Schopenhaur, Shakespeare, Milton, the Bible, the Catholic Mass, early Christian heresies, Irish mythology, on and on. It gets confusing to say the least.Do you have to know as much about all this stuff as Stephen to understand the book? It probably wouldn't hurt, but I certainly don't. The main thing is to understand that STEPHEN understands it all, and yet he is still struggling. His mother has died and he's asking a simple question, \\"what does it all mean?\\" This is the question of the book. What does life mean? How should one live? The answer the book gives is: life begins when you understand that we are all one. Stephen and Bloom, two completely different people, are one. Religion, myth, and all the great symbols that spring up across the globe are so similar because human life is essentially the same everywhere. Joyce told a friend that he chose The Odyssey as a model for his own book because Homer created the most complete character in all of literature: Odysseus is a father, a husband, a lover, a warrior, a politician. In short, he is Bloom: a completely ordinary man. Joyce showed us that ordinary life, \\"intensely regarded\\", is the stuff of myth.It's not always easy (although much of it is, if you read carefully...and compared to Finnegans Wake it's practically Dr. Seuss). But it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of the most well-known books of the 20th century. It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap 'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You may find you savor it then."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I not only read this book, I was taught it. It was the subject of my thesis at Berkeley. However, I would not presume to know a great deal about it. I think I will learn even more the next time I read it.Is it the greatest novel ever? Big question. I haven't read every novel, so I can't say. It's the best novel I have ever read.The novel is much deeper than most people believe. I would think to read it on the surface level only would be pretty boring, except for the lyrical style. But the real brilliance lies in his intertwining several allegorical levels with the action (if it can be called that). Too complicated to go into.Suffice it to say this book is about Everything! and Everyone! The universe contained in one ordinary man in one ordinary city on one ordinary day. We are all warriors and adventurers while at the same time stepped on by cowards and beat up by triviality. We are Leopold Bloom. Didn't you know?Apart from the mind bending, headache inducing allegory, what sets Joyce apart from other twentieth century novelists is the way he makes the English language into music. Joyce truly exhibits the shear beauty of words, creating nothing less than a symphony filled with harmony, dissonance, rythym and syncopation, noise, peace, passion, hopelessness, beauty, and terror that you can hear if you listen and if you let your mind let the words pierce that well disguised wall of cynicism.It's a romantic adventure about the best and the worst in all of us.Helps if you read it with the New Bloomsday Book. Hard to make it through it without it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was inspired to give ULYSSES another try after reading Bartholomew Gill'sDEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, a detective story whose plot is closely tied to Joyce's great novel. One of Gill's characters gives the advice to let the words flow like music, over you and through you, and not to get hung up in the details. Good advice, I found. If read quickly in this way, ULYSSES is more mesmerizing than it mystifies, and constantly exhilarating despite its occasional tendency to exasperate. I fully expect that a second reading will require a full summer rather than a mere week, and demand the use of a dictionary, a map, and a detailed reader's guide, but a first pass without any of these can still bring enormous pleasure.I did find it almost impossible, however, to read for plot. Although the events in ULYSSES are rather simple and are confined to a single day (Thursday, June 16, 1904), so much is told in flashback or in the imagination that it becomes hard to separate the various strands. I found it helpful to refer to the online Cliff Notes after reading each chapter just to confirm what I thought had happened. And, in real terms, nothing much does. Two men, the young intellectual Stephen Dedalus (Joyce's alter ego fromPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN) and the fortyish Jewish salesman Leopold Bloom, wake up, leave the house, wander around Dublin for most of the day, crossing paths occasionally, only to come together towards the end of the book and part again before the story ends in the small hours of the following morning. But the plot is only one of several threads that Joyce uses to organize a novel that contains as much of life as he can cram into it; among the other devices that shape the book are parallels with the ODYSSEY, the geography of Dublin, an almost Freudian penetration into the psyche of his characters, an ever-deepening humanity, and a large-scale structural organization akin to the movements and thematic connections within a piece of music.Joyce's language is musical too, and should probably be heard rather than read. His set-pieces -- such as Molly Bloom's famous erotic soliloquy in the Penelope chapter [18] that closes the book, Leopold Bloom's parallel fantasy at the end of Nausicaa [13], the Viceregal procession at the end of Wandering Rocks [10], or the numerous passages of Homeric invocation that punctuate Cyclops [12] -- show his magical ability to weave a spell with words and his exuberant delight in doing so. But there is no single Joycean style; one of the joys of ULYSSES is that each chapter introduces a distinct style of its own. The classical passages in Cyclops [12] are answered by long early-British sections in Oxen of the Sun [14] in which no latinate words are used whatsoever. The intellectual legerdemain of some of the Stephen Dedalus chapters is balanced by the down-to-earth barroom conversations of Leopold Bloom's friends. At different times, Joyce uses the language of magazine stories, the Catholic Church, political rhetoric, or scholastic debate. He includes densely-argued prose, free verse, snippets in six or seven languages (ULYSSES is not merely Irish but cosmopolitan), quotations from opera and street songs, and even two pages of musical notation! Wandering Rocks [10] is composed of brief fragments, like verbal snapshots of Dublin at a particular moment. Ithaca [17] is cast in the form of a catechism that addresses subjective emotional issues with the detailed objectivity of scientific analysis. Circe [15], the longest chapter of all, is a masochistic nightmare written in the form of a play script, or rather a movie scenario years ahead of its time.More than anything else, I found myself reading ULYSSES for the sheer delight of its many styles, and hugely enjoying even those parts that I didn't understand. There are many more treasures to be found in the book, I am sure, but this was more than enough for a start!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The reader of Ulysses is forced to continually reassert his perspective and understanding of point of view when reading the text. The narrative frequently shifts in perspective between Stephen, Bloom, the citizens of Dublin and a faceless narrator operating on levels internal and external. Language is used directly in speech and substantiation, as well as symbolically in mental thought and acquires transcendental meaning in grammatical and spelling reconfiguration.Stephen's typological character is self-defined in Telemachus as that of a servant. As he explains to Haines, \\"I am the servant of two masters... the imperial British state... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\\" Whether this servitude is literal or self-inflicted, we do not know. We know from Mulligan's remonstrations of Stephen's actions at his dying mother's bedside that Stephen has struggled with the Catholic faith. We know from Haines' knowledge of Gaelic over the milkwoman's that there is a level of intellectual and political dominance in place. We also know this from Haines' self admission, \\"We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\\" This is exactly a point where a reading of Ulysses accompanied by a fair knowledge of the political relationship of England to Ireland and an understanding of the rise of Nationalism during the time in which the novel was placed could add a good deal of understanding to the depths of the characters relations. This will continue to be the case throughout the novel as there are countless allusions to the history of the church and Ireland. There are frequent references by Stephen of historical heroes such as Pyrrhhus, Moses and Parnell who were frustrated while trying to lead a certain people out of bondage. The purpose of these references culminates in the important discussion between Stephen and Bloom toward the end of Ithica about Moses Maimonides and the chanting of the 113th psalm which celebrates the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. These historic and theological references are important counterpoints to Stephen who in Telemachus declares himself not to be a hero. Though the narrative of the first few chapters can be followed fairly consistently without historic knowledge of this kind, in the later chapters the narrative will cease to make much sense when references are cited and counterpoised to create specific intellectual and sociological meanings in the lives of the characters. Once a fact or idea is raised it will surely resurface at a later time in the thoughts of a character and will be mulled over ad infinitum. It is the discourse of the narrative that gives the best illumination into the classification of characters.Not only does Joyce span the forms of narrative from dialogue to subconscious hallucination, but also he twists the structure of language and words themselves to reassign meaning to language tools whose original purpose was to have a definitive meaning. Consider the final functional unit of the novel. Molly begins her soliloquy with the internal declaration, \\"Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed.\\" The entire soliloquy could be labeled as the indicial knowledge which feeds into the question: will Molly bring Bloom's breakfast to their bed in the morning? However, in the course of this long final narrative the question is eclipsed by the question: will Molly continue to be unfaithful to Bloom? Directly after this is established, it is tempting to speculate about the meaning of the narrative rather than cling to the rules of understanding its structure. Before this point in the narrative we have only had a very short encounter with Molly. The most we have gathered about her character is that of an object of desire. This image is both reinforced and destroyed by her final soliloquy. The answer concerning the original question of breakfast appears to be in the positive as Molly has expressed disappointment in her lover and a remembered passion of her vow to Bloom. This speculation gives a more refined meaning to the narrative as a whole implying a cyclical nature to Dublin life. Molly will bring Bloom his breakfast and he will leave on another journey throughout Dublin leaving her to remain in the bedchamber as an image in the lascivious imagination of the world. This seems to be the consensus of overall criticism of Ulysses. But, as it seems the day of Ulysses was the first day Molly had an affair, this suggests daily life isn't as static as it might first appear and people have the propensity to break from their assigned roles. This is especially true as with Stephen, whose role was to find a father figure or a \\"home\\" in the novel, but Stephen leaves him/it when the discovery is made. Creating final and definitive answers to Ulysses meaning is impossible and we should remain aware of this in conjunction with our methods of reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the second time I've read &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier works are quite approachable.Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot, especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed rhetoritician.He muses on the wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe of Man.&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic, absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.Unfortunately, what he's mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable.I give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However, don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do! The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our chaotic, jumble of the modern world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is five or six times the length of most novels, has an army of minor characters to keep up with, and contains a vocabulary that makes prudent keeping handy a good, unabridged English dictionary. (Never mind the German, Italian, French, Gaelic, Yiddish, etc., or the allusions to classical or Irish mythology.) A damned difficult book, it's true. But it captivated me. ULYSSES is by turns crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. During Bloomsday, the people of Joyce's universe eat, ogle women, defecate, bet on horses, worry, work, make love, lift their petticoats and wiggle their behinds, attend funerals, beg, give alms, pray, blaspheme and discuss every subject worth breath from the disposition of Shakespeare's second-best bed to God being a shout in the street to sex in all its manifestations. Yes! O yes! I have never seen anything so rich with the texture and feel and vivid details of life. Add to that Joyce's use of stream of consciousness and interior monologue to draw the reader into the tale with the characters (something no novelist before Joyce, not even Henry James, could pull off) as well as blindingly beautiful stretches of sheer poetry and you are looking at magic. Read this. Truly beautiful things can be as difficult as they are rare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Definitely buy this Jim Norton version. Do not get the Donal Donnelly version that one reviewer recommends -- I followed his advice and it was a huge mistake, now I am purchasing the Norton version. The Donal version is haltingly slow with disruptive pauses between each word, even in dialogue. It's so bothersome -- the reading is like a 3rd grader would read. This Jim Norton version runs over 27 hours, but the Donal Donnelly version runs over 40 hours -- the extra time? It's spent in awkward pauses that break the flow of the language and the dialogue -- you totally lose the beauty of Joyce. Don't make the costly mistake that I made -- buy the right one the first time. Now that I have this Norton version, I can happily sail through Ulysses and appreciate Joyce's supreme writing.

I think the key to enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely comprehensible inner dialogue. I recommend decoding these selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like, the sound soup without total comprehension. In addition to Joyce's mastery and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity. Criticized by some as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy). (All of these available at Amazon.) While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity. In fact, appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets. Just embrace and enjoy &quot;Ulysses&quot;; it is one of the funniest and wisest books you'll read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, this is clearly the most thought out book I have ever read.

If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think it is a novel, though). This can be annoying, but it is amazing.

After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly a great book, and not just my opinion. Having been born in Dublin, lived there for 25+ years, I knew the city well. The speech sounds and vocabulary are so familiar and recall specially my father, who knew 'Buck Mulligan' very well.Apart from this, the writing and the structure are amazing. If a reader does not really know Ireland, some work of commentary would be a wise accompaniment. Otherwise one can miss a great deal of the implications and innuendos, and, in particular, some of the classic Irish humor."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Purchased\\" because I've never read it, and felt that at the age of 58, it was time.

What I can offer is the viewpoint of an 'average' reader.My edition was the 1922 text, and it was prefaced by the original publisher with a simple disclaimer: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances.\\" And it certainly is understandable and necessary: the text is rife with punctuation, spelling and word issues - but it is nearly impossible to tell which are deliberate and which came courtesy of the type setter.The structure itself is almost more of a literary experiment than a novel. It switches presentations, from interior monologue to grandiose play to question and answers to stream of consciousness. At least that happens in sections, so the reader has some chance of keeping within the structure presented.I read that Joyce wanted someone to be able to recreate Dublin from the text of this book - that's probably a good way to describe the essence of it. While not every street is named, the character of the city through its inhabitants comes through (often more clearly than what the event does that he is writing about).It was a struggle to get through this book on my own, and I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if read as part of a class or discussion group, particularly if there were participants with knowledge of Irish history and specifically Joyce's background. The failings however are more my own versus the text itself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm not sure if I would have been able to get into this book so much if I hadn't been taught by an amazing Joyce scholar in a Ulysses seminar, but please, buy a couple of Ulysses supplements if you are unable to take an accompanying class. It is well worth it. This book has marked my life indelibly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"At the end of one of \\"Ulysses\\" most unpleasantly challenging chapters, \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" Joyce throws out an offhand comment which might read as a sort of gauntlet to anyone who fancies him or herself as a capable reader: \\"Just you try it on.\\"People have been \\"trying on\\" \\"Ulysses\\" ever since, and if my experience is any indication, the result is an infuriating and intoxicating read, not always both at once however. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is not a book out there that is more frustrating than James Joyce's Ulysses...unless, of course, it is Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. The problem lies in the fact that this novel is such an amazing piece of art that the reader can feel like Joyce forgot all about him. It is almost impossible to read by oneself with it's seemingly garbled maze of words and phrases and madness. However, this is what makes it such a joy to read. Imagine that an author decided to do away with any and all rules concerning fiction and to write a book that was it's own entity, showing you what it wanted to show you, telling you what it wanted to tell you and acting like its own character. This is what Joyce has accomplished with Ulysses. I was fortunate enough to read this book in a class, four months of nothing but Ulysses, and I have to warn would be readers that I don't think I would have made it through without expert guidance. I would advise anyone wishing to tackle this literary giant to gather some book loving friends, and a guidebook or two for Ulysses, and to take it very slowly. Read a chapter a week and then meet up with you group to discuss and puzzle out what you have just read. I am willing to bet that your weekly conversations will be a greater work of art than any book out there, and I think that Joyce would have liked that, would have enjoyed sparking debates and conversation, its probably the main reason why anyone creates anything; for it to be enjoyed and shared. The story line is simple, you have two main characters, Stephen Dedalus, the brilliant but alienated loner. You have Leopold Bloom, a simple man who is as alienated as Stephen, but not for his mind, for his cultural background and meek manner. The entire book takes place over the course of one day in Dublin, and after the first three chapters the entire book simply follows Bloom around during a day when he knows that his wife is having a romantic meeting with her lover. It is hard to sum up such a giant book in a few sentences like this, but basically Bloom is trying to set his life back on track, trying to reconcile himself with his wife's betrayal, and trying to reach out to Stephen who he feels could use a loving family. Of course, you could read this book and not find any of what I am saying in there, but the beauty of Ulysses is that I would love to hear what it is that you found in this novel as much as I would love sharing what I found."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There's probably not much about Ulysses that hasn't already been said, but having just spent well over a month of my free time struggling through this book I thought I would put my two cents in.In my opinion, Judge John M. Woolsey's synopsis in his 1933 ruling on the work's obscenity charge sums up the book almost perfectly. It is indeed an astonishing achievement and a literary tour de force. It is, as he says, by turns brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure. And of course it is unprecedented in its exceptionally honest treatment of sexuality.I really can't agree with his contention, however, that every word of the book is purposeful in its contribution to the whole. In some ways, particularly the incredible realism of its characters' interior monologues and its ability to make a particular place and time come alive for the reader, Ulysses is perhaps the most well-written novel I've ever read. In other ways, namely Joyce's frequent inability to resist showing off his erudition and mastery of language, it is one of the worst and often cries out for editing. While there's not a word of Hades, Wandering Rocks or Penelope I would change, some other chapters (e.g., Cyclops, Oxen of the Sun, and Ithaca) become downright tedious despite their conceptual ingenuity and flashes of brilliance. Additionally, the book is sometimes cloyingly self-referential, plausibility too often bows to symbolism, and many of Joyce's allusions are so esoteric or ambiguous that they can only serve to distract the reader. While it has faults (and despite the book's deification in literary circles, I can't see any other way to characterize many of its quirks and stylistic excesses), Ulysses is nonetheless well worth the exceptional effort required to read it due to its penetrating and poignant illumination of human desires, delusions and relationships. As an added plus, at many points it is nothing less than hilarious.Personally I found it very helpful to listen to a recording of the text on audio to get through the book (the version narrated by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie published by Classics on Cassette is extremely well done), as twice previously I had attempted to read it without such support and couldn't get beyond six or seven chapters. I would also suggest having at hand an unabridged dictionary, a book of scholarly annotations, and especially Harry Brimes' Bloomsday book for those passages where, despite your best efforts, you still can't figure out what the heck is going on (occasionally Brimes can't either).Four stars may seem niggardly for a masterpiece, but I'm comparing it with King Lear and The Brothers Karamazov. If you're an Irish Catholic literary scholar with doctorates in western religion and etymology and an upcoming sabbatical, by all means add half a star."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"On June 16th, 1904, a young James Joyce met his future wife for the first time. Ten years later, in 1914, he began what would become one of the greatest epics of modern language, Ulysses, setting the entirety of the events within that one special day shared by him and his wife, offering it to the world in an alternately joyous and tragic, comical and dense tribute to life and to living.The story cannot be summarised without reciting the book itself, an exercise that goes beyond the scope of this review. Suffice to say that the novel follows Leopold Bloom as he makes his way about Dublin, and Stephen Dedalus as he wanders from place to place. The two eventually meet, and the book finishes. Then again, that description is like saying Moby Dick is about a whale and Gravity's Rainbow is about a rocket. Technically true, but how much detail and texture do you miss with such a soul-less description?Ulysses has since grown beyond itself, garnering a reputation that scares away most readers. Considered an 'ivory tower' book, a 'professor's dream', it should be admitted that there are very difficult sections. Whole chapters - most of which are quite long - can be extremely tedious to read, becoming bogged down in medical or legal terms which serve mostly to confuse and distract the reader. But then there are chapters of amazing insight, clarity, wisdom and skill - thankfully more than there are difficult. The Cyclops chapter is sheer genius, a 120-page play that moves from bizarre to hilarious to sublime and back again. By itself, it is almost worth the price of admission, but there are many more that are just as amazing. The question and answer chapter of Ithaca is sheer genius, and Molly's monologue, right at the end, while texturally dense, flows and runs like a river.The language used ranges from flowery to technical to simplistic to overly complicated to deliberately obscure to beautiful. 'Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide' is beautiful, whereas 'What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?' is difficult. Of course, there is always the famous 'The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit', quite possibly one of the most gorgeous sentences written by man.Another interesting technique Joyce uses is his willingness to deny the luxury of perfect sentence structure or grammar to better convey the mood of the characters, or to greater achieve those wonderful sentences. He merges words, removes words, adds words, mirrors sentences within themselves, juxtaposes letters, words, paragraphs, all in an effort to create passages of absolute delight. Tens of pages will fly by, each one filled with wit, insight, beauty, depth. At times, it is safer to simply let go and trust that Joyce knows what he is doing, that you will be taken where you should go.However. This book can be very difficult, as I said above. Fifty pages of dense, verbose prose with little to no indication of what is happening, who it is happening to, or what sort of reference can be applied so as to make sense of it in the greater scheme of the novel, is common. These parts can be tricky to get through, but I strongly advise you to continue. Happily, the first few chapters are very easy, and very beautiful. It is only around the 210 page mark that Joyce ramps up the difficulty, which culminates in the Wandering Rocks and Siren chapters. But bear with it, and enjoy it for what it is.In the end - and I hope I have made this clear - the novel is a difficult one, requiring a lengthy time commitment, but in the end, the efforts are more than rewarded. Having just turned the last page, closed the book and put it aside, I am itching to take it up again, to follow Bloom and Dedalus once more through their beautiful, wonderful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought theUlysses (Gabler Edition)edition of this book recently as we were reading Ulysses as part of an online book club. The advantage of that edition is that it is popular edition and also has line numberings so that as part of a group you can immediately locate a piece of text.Then I discovered that you could get a free Kindle edition, so I downloaded the free Kindle for computer app from Amazon, and got this edition. Later I bought a Kindle.I am somewhat surprised at the one star reviews of a free product, the leading one of which is based on a flawed premise, lack of comparison to an actual published text.This reviewer does not compare the Kindle text with an actual book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, finding inconsistencies and saysUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] is different. Ulysses annotated is not Ulysses the book, it is a reference book about Ulysse, and if you imagine it, it operates like a phrase dictionary and explains the references and allusions in the book, but it is not the book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, not a direct comparison with an actual copy of the book, and comparison with an entirely different book. Really?I have compared this with the Gabler and picked 20 lines at random from the book, and then searched the Kindle edition, and read the surrounding passages. Except for one case in the Gabler edition which has musical notation and lyrics to a song the text was 100% the same.Obviously, there will be inconsistencies between versions of a book that has many editions. That does not mean that just because this edition is free and has minor inconsistencies it is worse than other editions. Nor does it mean that large amounts of text have been deleted because it's free. No, it's based on an actual text. In fact Joyce edited and added bits and pieces to the text over the years much to the chagrin and frustration of his publishers, so you can expect minor variations between editions, yet they may be 95-99% similar.In fact, there are certain advantages to having the Kindle edition. If you have ever read a book and you are trying to remember something about a character, you can type in the characters name, and you will immediately get all the references in the book. If there is a word you do not understand fully, by pressing a button you can immediately get the full meaning of the word. You can check for popular highlights, and it willl tell you how many people have highlighted which passage. For example \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\\"There are certain passages that no dictionary will help you with, and that is why you may need a companion book, such as Ulysses annotated, which explains the many allusions, whether to Latin, parallels with the Bible, with the Odyssey which this story loosely parallels, to Latin, British Rule, historical context, local maps, Hamlet, mythical search for the missing father, Shakespeare and the Bible.The further you get into this book the better it gets.At once this book is inpiring yet challenging, sometimes perplexing yet ultimately rewarding. Full of inventive wordplay that sometimes defies instant comprehension. I have read entire pages that turn out to be word salad at first. Every chapter has a different narrative style, such as inner monologue, narcissistic, catechism, stream of consciousness. Sometimes this book is brutal to read, sometimes a joy. I can understand why this book is so influential, and the words nibble at the edge of your consciousness forcing your mind to expand itself. This book has changed the way I think about writing, as I have never seen som many different narrative devices used in a single book before. The final chapter with Molly Bloom in bed, with its runon sentences is simply hilarious.I encourage you to get this edition. Why not? It's free. Free to buy. Free to read. Free to enjoy. The Kindle format gives you advantages over people who have read it in the past, and offers interesting, new, and quicker ways of navigating the text.And you can go get free online chapter summaries of chapters to speed your comprehension.I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after \\"and chanted:\\").

But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact. Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot; But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. A few people... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot; While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks.

Very well produced, even to the extent of reversing the audio in Circe where 'The Voice Of All the Damned' proclaims the mighty: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella!Music tracks introduce each section, with songs appropriately chosen for the episode.

Heartly recommended from this shout in the street."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses can be a tough read, but is very rewarding for those who plough through it. James Joyce writes, in this book in particular, in what I would call the literary equivalent of the impressionist style of painting. By this I mean he sometimes he uses words as if they're broad brush strokes meant to give you an impression of the events taking place as opposed to describing them in a literal sense. Once you get the hang of his writing style the book really takes off, describing, in a surreal way, the world that the main character lives in. There were some portions of the book where I was lost and didn't know what was going on, but I persevered and this ended up being a good read.If you're ready for a challenge, pick this up. If you're just looking for some casual reading you might want to find something more straightforward."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Read it a long time ago, bult now I love having at hand, wherever I go, it takes a lifetime to really appreciate this classic"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Overall, better written than Portrait of an Artist, but nowhere near as entertaining. Basically, consider this as a brilliantly conceived book but with the most wholly unimaginative of plots. It's as intelligent as anything produced since Shakespeare, in other words -- but without all the life-giving drama. What it is is magnificent, in my opinion; but what it contains is insipid. Few people will actually enjoy reading this book, although it does have its moments. But mostly it's an impressive tower that in reality contains nothing much of importance. The most amazing construction possible in the center of which resides a pot of total rot.The narrative mainly follows two protagonists: Stephen Dedalus (from Portrait of the Artist, loosely based on Joyce himself) and \\"Leopold Bloom,\\" presented as Stephen's somewhat more reasonable counterpart, as they meander throughout the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland, shortly after the first World War, although that fact has almost no bearing on the story.The \\"plot\\" (which is also much beside the point) centers around death: the recent death of Stephen's mother and the not-so-recent death of Bloom's infant son, Rudy. In the end, the two personalities come together in Bloom's home and a kind of a reconciliation is formed -- but again, this is all beside the point.The book appears to be James Joyce's attempt to completely reconstruct what the novelistic form can accomplish, and it reads as such. Terribly thin on plot, but thick on construction, like a house whose rooms are empty. The writing is interesting, particularly to individuals interested in the art of writing -- but the story of the day is quite simply boring as hell.The few good moments include Stephen's theories about what many consider to be Shakespeare's finest play -- Hamlet -- and Bloom's somewhat psycho-sexual encounter with a young girl later on in the evening.Distasteful passages frequently occur, where Joyce appears to take great pains toportray man as a whole as a sick, sadistic, filthy, and secretive animal; again, not really a joy to read through.The real problem here is story, not form. The form is magnificent. It can't be improved upon. But where is the story? What is particularly interesting here? That ultimately Stephen and Bloom forge a kind of friendship? That ultimately provided meaning, but I did not care. Will you?Portrait of the Artist has a developing character changing over time; Ulysses just has a single day, no matter how well written about it is. And so one is drama and the other exercise, and so one worth your time and the other not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Well, Ernest Hemingway thought that Ulysses was a \\"Goddam wonderful book\\" so who am I to disagree.

Now I realize that the problem with Amazon's description of books with multiple editions (like Ulysses) goes far deeper than I initially realized, as my review seems to have been attached by Amazon to all sorts of different versions of Ulysses, rather than just the page for the specific edition I had set out to review. In fact, you really cannot tell from the Amazon page for a book like Ulysses which version is being discussed. So, be warned that Amazon's modus operandi can create sheer confusion for works that are published in multiple (varying) editions!My original review of Modern Library edition:Amazon's current webpage description creates the misleading impression that this (Modern Library hardcover) is the text as \\"corrected' by Gabler in the 1980s. However, the cover of the book seems to be clear that this is in fact the 1961 verson of the text. Gabler's edition has some supporters but also some vehement critics. I would just suggest that those planning to invest in a copy of the book take at least a brief look at accounts of the controversy to decide which edition they might prefer. In any case, let's at least try to be clear about which is which!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit that I dont understand every little word of ulysses but the lyricsm of the novel of enough to warrant five stars. The way the novel goes back and forth between joyce reality and the stream of thoughts are simply increable. Increable in both how he conviced it and who effect it is. There are also just prse of pure emtion that anyone can instanitly understand . As for the charaters, all are intresting and distinct. Each word has to be read very carefully to understand what is happening but the end resut is both and intresting and intensen novel.Any one who truly enjoys ulysses should also check out Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Doblin, which is also a large urban story useing the stream of concessness"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Strange as it may seem, many people do read and re-read this novel simply because they love it!It would be impossible to summarize a work such as this in a few lines, but what I love most about this work is its humanity. Joyce is not satirizing Homer: in invoking \\"The Odyssey\\", he is not so much deflating the heroic as elevating the everyday. The mundane day-to-day events which constitute life for the vast majority of us are given a heroic dimension - and, indeed, why should they not? A good, decent man like Bloom is as worthy of praise as was Ulysses.This is one of the great affirmative novels in a century where literature has, by and large, been dominated by darkness."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One cannot stress the importance of Ulysses. As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I must say, Ulysses is perhaps the most difficult to understand book ever written (aside from Finnegan's wake) yet it is pure genius. I decided to read it as my independent book for a highschool english course. I stumbled through it, with lots of assistance from my teacher and found it to be the most rewarding literary experience. Joyce's characters are so complex and three dimensional that one can hardly believe they are not actual humans. It is the most enlightening experience to feel that you are in someone else's mind. Although this book is very challenging, it is something every person should experience before they die. Make a point to read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Ulysses, as well as dissecting it's labrynthe and numerous metaphorical qualities, far too many to go into in a maximum of a thousand words, I can say with all confidence and utmost rightousness that Joyces masterpiece belongs in the league of reverence given to Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. It is without a doubt the single most awesome display of genius in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough! To those unmanned by the maze: you are not stupid by default if you despise every scrabble Joyce scribbled. Many intelligent people, including Virginia Woolf, saw nothing in Ulysses and less in the Wake. To others Ulysses is the liveliest and funniest book ever. To the academics who comb Ulysses--agile horse--for the nits of criticism (thereby insuring Joyce's immoraltality), please leave alone we who would enjoy without inheriting the immense debtorship of things better left undone. To those who would deny that Ulysses is the most important (not necessarily the best) novel ever written, the very fact that so many are compelled to constantly trash it is the ultimate tribute to its place. Finally, let it be known that Joyce swore on Ulysses, on the honor of a gentleman, which admittedly he was not: --There is not one serious word in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only two things that matter in any type of writing are What Is Written (Substance) and How It Is Written (Style). Ulysses is an amazing book when it comes to style. I can not think of a book that compares; in fact, Ulysses is many books, with each chapter written in a style that is best suited for it. I first read Ulysses when I was in graduate school, and was simply blown away by the sheer breadth and depth of Joyce's writing ability. The book influenced me dramatically: it freed me from the chains of accepted modes of written expression. I love the last chapter: not a SINGLE mark of punctuation. Maybe that's nothing new but back in the beginning of the century it was Totally Radical! But with this said, the story itself is very boring, the philosophic allusions inpenetrable and the supposedly comic elements totally unfunny.But for its stylistic brilliance and Joyce's courage/genius, I give it 10 of 10."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster. Why else would he subject the word to such a hard to read novel called &quot;Ulysses&quot; One could more easily understand passages from the book of Revelations in the Bible than some of the rantings of L. Bloom, Stephen Dedelus and especially Mrs. Bloom. Albeit that the book is about 700-800 pages long, depending what edition you read, you cannot put it down. I went through this novel in 3 days. I was literally glued to the pages."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I first read Ulysses, my friends got tired of hearing about it. Sure it's difficult. Sometimes I literally had to read the book backwards in search of a missing or forgotten thread. One small section is so fiendishly composed that I had to write it out by hand to untangle it. Other parts are as obscure to me now as they were when I first read them.That being said, when you lock onto Ulysses--when you can hold onto the thread--the words, the pages, everything vanishes. Pure thought, like music or cocaine, insinuates itself into your mind and clings to the pleasure centers.That you may never totally unravel Ulysses is unimportant. The pleasure comes from experiencing not completing it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Wow. I have started this book three times, at about two-year intervals, also reading small parts of it separately at various times, but I finally finished it straight through and I can't believe how great it is, I never expected this, though I've been half-obsessed with Joyce since I bought Finnegans Wake with perfect serendipity in seventh grade because I thought it had &quot;words I don't know.&quot; [Back to Ulysses] I've always loved the beginning, but it really gets a lot better past the halfway point, with Nighttown and the Ithaca chapter especially, and the thing that struck me most was the absolute loveliness of the ending. It's bloody famous and often quoted, but you don't get a sense until you've read the whole thing that where other books leave you begging for more or hoping them to come to an end more quickly, this ending is *perfectly* satisfying. [You can find more rigorous criticism elsewhere. This is my emotional response.]"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"That &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a great novel and a (not the) turning point in the history of modern imaginative prose is, I think, proven beyond reasonable doubt. But, after having read it twice, a nagging doubt remains: is it a life-enhancing achievement ? Like the best of Shakespeare or Tolstoy. Does it achieve universality beyond obvious plodder-type references harking back to Homer ? Which are pros and cons ? Among pros, I'd say that most important are exuberant playfulness of language and gorgeously hilarious stampedo of comic banal incidents. Joyce is truly great comic writer. As for his status of the progenitor of experimental prose, I'm more sceptical. The stream of consciousness technique remained confined mostly to English-language literatures; what's more objectionable, it doesn't seem to possess potency of meditative-reflective approach of a Conrad or Proust, nor direct prophetic insight of a Dostoevsky or Lawrence. There is something arid and self-defeating in the very nature of Joyce's endeavor. Among cons two come to mind immediately: a scholastic network of cross-references that serves as the underpinning of the entire structure-something that impresses a naive innocent reader as an erudition beyond, beyond...but, actually is an exercise in a dated and dead world view ( and even this is far from being impeccable-Joyce's reading in philosophy is superficial; he confuses Duns Scotus and Johanes Scotus Erigena ); the other con is the all-pervading banality of virtually everything. As if a double perspective is achieved simultaneously: Joyce's work is as detached as possible, yet, its all-devouring meaninglessness betrays the author's mindset. And this mindset I would call as subjective and life defeating as any imaginable. Conclusion: Joyce's inventiveness and humor produced a great book. At the same time, his aesthetic pseudoreligion and something I could call only a soulless Weltanschauung prevented him to create a summit like &quot;A la recherche&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Devils&quot;. A great novel. Among the most influential. Not among the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Although I enjoy using Anthony Burgess', &quot;Joyce Prick,&quot; as a walking guide through Ulysses, it's not a difficult read. However, the best part about Ulysses is that no matter your view, no one will ever agree with it!Ulysses is best understood, in my opinion, by the male aged 35 to 50. It is the story of Bloom's passage into middle age. His last bit of memory, physical or mental, of his youth. He is passing on to new memories, but allows for one final mental seduction.In the meantime, his wife, Molly, is also passing. She has allowed herself, in her own final touch with youth gone, to be physically seduced.In the end, Molly and Bloom rejoin.

If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When one looks at Ulysses by James Joyce without prior knowledge, one comes in with pre-conceptions of what should be expected. They find it difficult and confusing and without purpose. Some say it is an exercise in intellectually masturbatory narrative, some say it is just a terrible work completely without merit. To those I say, look at Picasso, van gogh or any other artist for that matter and you will gain an appreciation for the work. Let me explain myself.Joyce was quoted as saying something to the effect of \\"If Dublin disappeared off the face of the earth, this book would be able to recreate it down to the last detail\\" now while that is a tad hyperbolic, he illustrates the main point of the novel. To paint a picture of dublin. Imagine a landscape painting be it an urban, idyll, or what have you. You don't necessarily approach it with a plot in mind, you simply enjoy the sites as they are. That is what this book is. Joyce's methods of achieving it are what separate this from the other works of any literary genre.It is a painting in the truest sense of the word. Each chapter forms a kaleidoscope of narrative, point of view and immersive yet alienating sensory details. This hodgepodge of narrative styles can infuriate or delight as it paints with immense detail a single day in the life of one Leopold Bloom.To be sure there are chapters that are extremely opaque and less sensory based than others, but this is a way of enhancing the narrative differences of each chapter. Every chapter is a microcosm of narrative which ultimately creates the macrocosm of the work as a whole. Take for example chapter 15: Circe, this is written as a script. Chapter 17: Ithaca a catechism, Chapter 18: penelope is the purest stream of consciousness ever written.And to those detractors who argue that plot is important, keep in mind not all literature has the intention of telling a story.So I leave you with this. This book is difficult, I'm not going to lie, the first read will be infuriating as almost a guarantee, but with a mindset of Painting over story you may perhaps enjoy it as such and find this review at least somewhat helpful"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses. Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story.

The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \\"item under review.\\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \\"I am the boy...invisibility\\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough good things have been said about Ulysses, and most of them are true. You should benefit greatly from reading such a wondrous masterpiece. But if you are serious you should shy away from the Gabler Edition. It is widely considered among Joyce scholars, and even some of Gabler's original advisers, that he took way too many liberties when producing this edition. He made many noted blunders and errors. In essense, Gabler damaged the script with his misguided sense of editing.I have read the Gabler Edition, and really didn't know better at the time. It was still brilliant and I loved it, but I defer to the experts. I now own the Random House edition, and have skipped around to reread parts of it. Supposedly the Penguin and Everyman's Library editions are worthy reprints of the 1960 edit. There is a forthcoming edit from Norton that is anticipated as becoming the new definitive edit, but they have been delayed in getting it out. Be careful about which edition you get. Some are reprints of the original edition, which contains many errors. Go with Penguin, Everyman's or Random House for now.Also, this Vintage edition is horribly made. The book binding frayed and the book fell apart after a year; the pages all fell out (some individually, but mostly in clumps of 10 to 100 pages)and I was desperately and pathetically trying to keep them together and in order (I was only trying to hold on to the book because of my extensive margin notes). After, a while I just gave up and vowed never to buy Vintage again.I plan on rereading Ulysses, but in a different edition than Vintage. I read it along with The New Bloomsday Book by Harry Blamires. It is an extremely helpful and well regarded commentary/guide."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Don't read \\"Ulysses\\" because of what other people say about it or how highly it's usually ranked among great 20th-c. novels; if you don't like it, move on to something else. But if Joyce intrigues you, well, you've got a lifetime to sort it all out. I've read the book several times and it's never the same experience--Joyce is always many steps ahead of me. When I first read \\"Ulysses\\" as an insufferable young man of 19, I kept thinking, \\"Why does he write this way?\\" (Along with, \\"Why am I not 'getting' it?\\") (Because I was only 19, I guess, and I tried to plow through it quickly so I could tell everyone that I \\"read 'Ulysses'!\\". Ouch.) And talk about slow reading! Let your eyes melt into a paragraph or a sentence. Let it sink in! Perhaps the ideal reader of Joyce is the one who memorizes the entire thing. Let me explain: Everything in \\"Ulysses\\" is interrelated. I'll bet there aren't 20 facts in the book that don't relate somehow to other aspects of the book. He'll mention something in chapter 3, and by chapter 10 he'll mention something else about it. \\"Oh, right; chapter 3.\\" You know, sort of like in real life. Joyce could have written the book normally, but I'm glad he didn't. Like asking Bach to make his fugues simpler. What's the point? and who has the right. Joyce is not deliberately obscure; to me, he's one of the least obscure writers ever. Paging Aristotle! To me, he had the most control over his words of any author who ever lived. (Again, it's all interrelated.) So yes, the book is not going to come alive on the first reading. Poor baby. Takes more than that to peel this onion. If you were to look up all of the allusions etc. in this book, you'd have a solid liberal-arts education. But you don't have to, of course. It's just that the more you know, the more you'll get out of this book. Would that I were raised in Dublin. Oh well; we don't fault Homer for being Greek now do we. And I'm taken aback by some of the Woolf-ian critiques here. Like Voltaire on that \\"barbarian\\" Shakespeare. Like Shaw, Wyndham Lewis weren't jealous; they just hated him because he was so darn good. And even Jung was puzzled; what, hadn't he been studying myth his whole life? Maybe the book seemed more radical in the 1920s. But Joyce wasn't trying to be \\"modern\\" or \\"avant-garde.\\" He couldn't care less about that surreal stuff either. So, \\"Ulysses\\" is perhaps the final book of a long tradition, the fullstop of the West. (Scan the Internet for some articles and join some chat-groups if you don't believe me.) Now, wait; what about \\"Finnegans Wake\\"? Arrrrrrrghhhh!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is without question the most difficult book I have ever read. It is also the most interesting, descriptive, imaginative, funny, poignant, life-affirming, and learned book I have ever read. As someone nearing 50 who has read broadly, I consider the experience of reading Joyce's masterpiece an achievement that was well worth the effort. And it was an effort.The Naxos audiobook was essential for me (I have the CD version, which I downloaded to my Ipod; I have seen comments suggesting that the Kindle version has technical glitches). I am not a particular fan of audiobooks, but the Naxos version is very well put together, and Jim Norton - who reads 98% of the book, does a phenomenal job covering the countless voices that enter and exit (and often reenter) the text. Then Marcella Riordan reads the final monologue of Molly Bloom and her delivery is equally impressive. My approach was to follow along with the text while listening to the audiobook, and then refer to Don Gifford's annoted notes (a separate volume) that provides very helpful background to the often obscure references. For difficult chapters I would also relisten/read the chapter, which always provided added value. It sounds like a slog, and I guess it was, but I repeat: I do not regret a minute of it. Very rewarding."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes.

This led me to look further into his work. I then went on to read his poetry and some of the sort stories in Dubliners but I really wanted to read another book by him, yet many people told me that Ulysses was impossible to read or full of modernist randomness. I decided to read it ANYWAY.The book starts off quirky and interesting and (yay!) Stephen Dedalus is back. Each chapter is written in the style that is best for the content and that is one of the things that really impressed me. It is not \\"random\\" without a purpose and a lot of this \\"randomness\\" actually makes sense if you can recognize and pay attention to the literary/biblical/mythological allusions.

I am glad I did it for many reasons, not the least of which is that this book is so talked about and I now can say I at least read it. There were what clearly appeared to be entry errors (I believe this book is one of those where volunteers enter it into the system). This was not a serious problem. But with the language and phrasing and stream of conscience style that Joyce uses, there added to the difficulty of the read in a few spots.I also really wish Kindle would number the pages. I know this changes based upon the size type a reader may set his Kindle at. However, it would really enhance the reading experience. Even if the page broke in the middle of a \\"page\\" due to the size type that the reader selected, it would be most helpful. I think this is a standard complaint regarding the Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce flaunts and celebrates style in this book. There's a chapter written in the form of a play, a chapter imitating the development of English, a chapter written in question-and-answer form, a chapter without punctuation (the closing monologue, probably the most beautiful, life-affirming thing ever written), and a chapter written in the sentimental style of a girl's novel. There are countless other stylistic tricks, some of which an impatient reader will miss. Yes, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a difficult book to read...but just stick with it, pay close attention, and you'll do fine - and in the end, the rewards of having read it will be worth the struggle.

I took no literature class concerning it, nor do I plan to. My only other experience with literature that is vaguely similar to this is 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon, which I read about a year ago. And although I found the esotericism in GR interesting and comparably relevant to my personal work, I actually found U to be a slightly more entertaining read. However, if it's 'entertainment' your looking for, don't read this. Go read a Stephen King book, or something. In fact, don't read anything, just go see the new Tomb Raider movie....I didn't give this book 5 stars, because, as it's been mentioned in other reviews, there were too many points in the book that I was wanting more. More wordy experiments, more originality. Too often, some sort of brilliant style will surface and then go away and drone on for another 50 pages until some other new and interesting element occurs again. Some may say that I'm simply saying that the book wasn't 'entertaining' enough, contradicting my argument in the previous P. Well, to those I say, whatever. I can deal with being a hypocrit. I mean, when you really think about it, there are two conflicting elements of human nature at work here, 1. the sort-of Americanization of a culture to need constant entertainment, and 2. the instinctive craving to learn. Which is more powerful in you?I will say that if you just want an interesting snippet of this book to read, I'd read the last chapter. This really made the book worth reading IMO. It's done without hardly any punctuation and it's left to the reader to cipher where sentences begin and end, really the definitive stream of conscious technique, but more than that, it's the most emotionally powerful section of the book, right up to the last few words."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As I read Ulysses, I asked myself, what is the point of putting all these words next to each other? When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold.

The Bodley Head (London, 1984) edition of this name was edited by Hans Walter Gabler and has a preface and recommendation by Richard Ellmann, the foremost biographer of James Joyce. This edition is a significant contribution to Joycian publishing and a &quot;must&quot; addition to any complete library of Joyce's works, alongside any of the &quot;original&quot; text works. Joyce's manuscript as sent to the printers was difficult to read (it had many handwritten corrections of corrections and border notes which the original publisher could not decide whether he was supposed to use), and Gabler merely did a highly-regarded job of reconsidering original manuscript materials and other sources. The first- or second-time reader of Ulysses likely would not notice the differences in the text, but Joyce scholars and Ulysses fans regard this as an important reconsideration and an essential work. Most editions of Ulysses use an identical numbering system for sections and paragraphs so that comparisons between editions are easy to make."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can anybody short of a literary genius review this book? I am certainly not qualified. I will simply tell you whether I enjoyed what I read.There were sections of the book that I really enjoyed but there were parts that seemed to me just a long procession of gibberish.Do not attempt to attempt this book without some study aids to assist you; unless you are a genius."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was finally able to get into _Ulysses_ this past February after trying for ten years or so. I just finished it (it's June). Phew!! Yes, it's a hard nut to crack -- you can see why so many people give up in rage and frustration (and unfairly express their resentment at being unable to understand by writing vitriolic reviews). And yes, if you're going to climb Mount Everest (or maybe K2 -- _Finnegans Wake_ appears to be Everest) you need an oxygen mask and a team -- get _The Bloomsday Book_ and _Ulysses Annotated_. But to say it was well worth it would be a giant understatement.I'll try to say in a nutshell what's so great (for me) about it: _Ulysses_ is the incredibly poignant story of one ordinary man's attempts to reconcile himself to his failures as a father, a husband and a human being. At the same time, through its rich description of Dublin (which comes to stand for every human community, everywhere); through a staggeringly complex web of historical, metaphorical and philosophical associations; and through Joyce's use of words, in which the English language _itself_ becomes a character in the novel, _Ulysses_ becomes about much, much more than a day in the life of one man -- it becomes a hugely cosmic-comic and very personal oddyssey through the readers' soul, in which every pretension or fantasy one could possibly have is brought to light and then smashed. Does this sound dismal? It isn't -- it's hilarious; and for those who've made it through, the ending words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy and her final &quot;yes&quot; are the sparkling, intoxicating wine of possibility -- heartbreakingly bittersweet, moving and transcendent."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let me first start off by saying I love the book. Its language is of the likes I have never before seen. And, let me also say, that while people who hate this book will try to totally disparage it and, in my opinion, try to burn it, if they had the chance, you, the prospective reader of this book, should cast aside all preconceived notions, whether yours or others', about this book. Just as well: throw my comments about the book away, and decide for yourself (because that is just what I said). But keep the idea of deciding for yourself, and disregard all the ploys that people will try to get you to not read this book, and go read this book, you just might enjoy it.Besides, how do other people know what you will like? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is not a classic that one can pick up and immediately appreciate; you will absolutely need a book of annotation to accompany it; however, this is a piece of literature that any English major or self-claimed intellect should challenge themselves with at some point"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I read 'Ulysses' many years ago in boarding school.

There are two ways to approach this book: A. Find, study and theorize on every single referance in every single sentance in every single paragraph, etc. or B. Just let it glide over you and enjoy some fantasitc writing with a good helping of human wit and emotion. Either way this book will blow your mind if you let.

You have to be pretty well read to approach this novel. Most of the book is inner monologue style, and it is 99% full of obscure references. It helps to have at least some background in the Odyssey and the Bible to understand this novel. I personally do not like a \\"talking heads\\" novel, so I find that I am simply skimming the pages out of boredom. Most of the book's references are very dated so you'll find that most of the text goes \\"over your head.\\" I salute those who \\"get\\" this novel, because you must be quite a worldly individual to not need help with it. For the \\"joe everyman\\" like myself, there's no need to read this book unless it is being assigned to you. I love to read, but this book is honestly making me tiresome of it. You really need alot of patience, a huge dicitonary, a small library of other classic novels, and an understanding of Ireland's history to get through it. I will finish this book, but I will not have taken in a single word at the end. If you MUST read this book, I highly recommend the SPARKnotes to go with to even get an idea of what you just read. Without it, you will just give up. I only gave it 3 stars because if I understood what I read, I could honestly tell you whether I liked it or not, but since I don't understand 98% of the book, I'll just sit \\"middle of the fence.\\"Also as a side note, don't get this version of the novel because the binding is total [...]"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, I just gave only four stars to a book that is universally known as one of the greatest works of literature of all time. I left off the extra star just because I have to review it from my own perspective. I'm an older guy who never got around to reading Joyce back in my college days, and have always figured I should.I love complex books--books that require some effort on my part to get through and appreciate. Joyce plowed ground for such novels. But there are a lot of good ones by more modern authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster-Wallace, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. etc. etc. All of those books have a lot more action--Ulysses spends too much time with thought and reflection, without enough happening. Part of the challenge of reading Joyce is that he constantly refers to facts and customs and ideas from his time and place, so understanding requires some historical research, which is a diversion from the enjoyment of the literature. It's much more fun to read Pynchon (for example) because the challenges are ones that are supposed to be challenging. In short, I think it's great to catch up on historically important literature, but don't let it divert you from the many great works of more contemporary authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished!

The result is a novel that offers a most intimate study into the human method of thinking.Not for the faint of heart, however, because this is a text that requires dedication, as the games that Joyce plays with language and the thinking of his characters often obfuscates the meaning."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is &quot;a great many&quot; and the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Man, this was a long book! No, really I mean really long. I swear this was longer than any book I have ever even looked at.

Take my word for it - IT'S LONG!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One thousand years from now, when the acid will have long since dissolved the remembrance's from our tombstones and even the internet will have been forgotten, Joyce's works will still be read and loved. His works will outlive our language as Homer's have their greek.I sympathize with those of you who are puzzled, angered and allow yourselves to be defeated by the text. It is much easier to read an accessible classic like The Lord of the Rings (the peoples choice for novel of the century) or The Catcher in the Rye, though they are unrewarding and juvenile works in comparison with Ulysses.As to those of you who pretend to be intellectually superior to Ulysses or the Wake, stop kidding yourselves.

And it is a composition.Why should the reader work?So that he/she might learn something substantial; so that he/she will be able to view the world with a new mind's eye.Does it suffice to read the book only once and quickly?Nope.Diagnosis for anyone who assigns the book less than five stars:idler; incapable of intense intellectual effort; probably likes vonnegut."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It was Joyce's stated intention to keep the academics busy for years chasing down the innumerable and vague references buried in virtually every line of his over-long master work, and he succeeded. Why Joyce would set out to purposefully confuse and mislead critics and readers can only be explained by his overbearing, self-absorbed, pretentious nature. A thorough study of Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Portrait of the Artist - two foundations upon which Ulysses was constructed - will assist the reader in navigating Joyce's murky waters - but not nearly enough to make the effort enjoyable and worthwhile. Stuart Gilbert's famous study will bring the reader further into Joyce's stream of consciousness - but Gilbert chooses to be pretentious and occasionally obscure as well (no surprise since Gilbert and Joyce were collaborators). Joyce was a first rate literary artist - no mistake. Ulysses stands as a milestone in the art form - in many respects the first true &quot;modern&quot; novel (for better or worse). However, for the clerisy of readers, Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist are the limits for appreciating Joyce. Ulysses steps over the line, leading to Finnegan's Wake, which is completely out-of-bounds. Those who do make the effort necessary to understand Joyce's work in Ulysses will come to realize that, rather than celebrate and memorialize the Dublin he knew - as Homer did for the Hellenic world in The Odyssey (creating a lasting vision of the Greek world as the Greeks saw it) - Joyce lays his world in waste and ruin, leaving the landscape in desolation. Joyce's bottom line message can only be interpreted one of two ways: first, that the Heroic Age is so far removed (keeping in mind that Joyce considered the Irish to be Greek descendants) as to be unrelated (if not in opposition) to modern events; or second, that man is incapable of heroism in any form. An interesting interpretation of Joyce's Ulysses is its relationship to the science of chaos, in its complex formation. However, chaos (or more strictly speaking, non-linear dynamic systems) that exists in reality produces incredible complexity from surprisingly simple, non-linear feedback systems. Joyce constructed his work by merging too many source motifs with the intention of creating complexity. In the end, it is the overwhelming negativism that wins out in Joyce's Ulysses, without redemption. Ulysses is one of the great over-praised works. Over-praised because it is inherently flawed, as most great experiments are bound to be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The novel of the century! &quot;Time&quot; Magazine got it right! And &quot;Ulysses&quot; really is a comedy. A long comedy, albeit, but I find that opening the book at random and reading a page or two is an enriching experience. Read Joyce for the way in which he strings words together: beautiful. He often said that there was nothing that he couldn't do with language, and he was right.

So far it seems only a desire to render predictable, sophomoric on-line reviews in the Q&amp;A catechism style of the Ithaca episode....And for you who just doesn't feel the five-star bravado which so many others wield in touting Ulysses, it's OK- you're still a good person- and actually more the 'Everyman' for whom Joyce (supposedly) had sympathy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fantastic novel...it is really beyond a novel and beyond reproach.

All that expensive German philology and bibliographic science bound with bubble-gum and rubber cement. I don't pretend to be fully apprised of the respective merits of the various editions (although I do understand that the original 1934 U.S edition was a pirated and notoriously erroneous text) but you might do well to consider the revised 1961 Ulysses(i.e. The Vintage Books and Modern Library text), over this, the scholarly standard, cursed with a nickel-dime spine."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The binding on the Viking edition is absolutely miserable. Unless you are extremely ginger when handling your books, this Viking printing will fall apart within a few readings.Invest in the Modern Library hardcover edition, any other edition, and do not throw away your money on the consumable garbage Viking has made available."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THIS GREATEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE please skip to the twelfth episode, called Cyclops. YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What many consider to be Joyce's masterpiece is, to be frank, by no means his best work. &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes Joyce's use of realism and disjointed language to an extreme that causes most readers to lose interest in the story and the messages contained within. No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece. If one wants to understand Joyce's feelings on Dublin and its people (and consequently his feelings on the Universe in which we exist) should read a work such as &quot;The Dubliners.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I reviewed this book about a week ago.

There are many exciting stories in the book, and those stories are going to enlighten you for good!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Brilliant book, a web of words encompassing centuries of literature and philosophy and its impasse on the overeducated lower middle class, a perfect allusion to a work of great literature (The Odyssey) that this book has matched well. Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When read by those looking for prose, they go away disappointed. When read by those seeking poetry, they can't put it down. I gave up trying to figure out what was going on about four hours into the marathon reading I went to at the Irish Times in DC on Bloomsday 1991. The words, though. The words kept me there for many, many more hours (and just a few pints). Imagery started leaping out at me, I felt as if I was hallucinating. Not for the timid, weak, or close-minded, but worth the effort if you want to give yourself up to a good book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many have said that Ulysses is the greatest novel written in English in the 20th century. Technically speaking, it's certainly unimagineable that any author could have put more into a book in this or any other century. But it's not for all tastes. You should read Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist before attempting Ulysses, as the former are more accessible and will let you know whether you like Joyce. Read the World's Classics edition of Ulysses, the notes are very helpful. Be prepared to work at this book. It takes some getting used to. Having read it, I think the effort was worth it. Joyce is a genius (evident from his earlier works). His writing is almost lyrical at times and every word is chosen deliberately to achieve the overall impression he seeks to make. He was one of the Protean Modernists, though, and in Ulysses he takes Modernism, the novel and literature itself to their outer limits. At times, thoughts and actions, reality and imagination all get mixed up in this book and sometimes the narrative line just seems to disappear - but isn't this the way of the human psyche? Don't expect Dickens or a plot in its normal sense. Do expect, after all the hard work is done, to marvel at the author's abilities and to have a warm feeling for Leopold Bloom, to wonder at his humanity and to do this despite the character's weaker traits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can sum this book up in two words: \\"Ass Beating\\". It was the most painful reading experience of my life.Like many readers I was sucked in by the \\"Modern Library Top 100\\" list of which Ulysses is number 1. After getting about half way through this book, I realized that many of the so called \\"Top 100\\" were probably more important than they were, well, good. Ulysses has several passages of graphic sexual description and discussion of infidelity during a few of the author's more lucid moments which surely made it edgy for 1922. The Modern Library must have overlooked the long and frequent passages of rambling lists and nonsence that makes one seriously question if the author was getting paid by the word and needed to pay his rent. I was not surprised to find out that Ulysses was initially a serialization and Joyce was actually getting paid by the word!You can read some of this online, but I don't recommend reading it in any form.

Sure James Joyce was a writer of some talent as shown by his early short stories and his Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But this book?When he wrote it Joyce was in the hands of the European artistic progressives. They had rejected the notion of contest in favor of form. That is hypnotized by that arch braggart Wagner they accepted the delusion that art must continually progress and change form. When he wrote art generally was subject to continual change in style. Picassos went through his various periods, French Art struggled through Impressionism, Cubism and so on.James Joyce moving in those circles felt that he had to reject the form and grammar of his predecessors. That is he had to reject the way of writing which made Dickens, Eliot, Austin and Conrad the giants of literature that they were. What in fact is wrong with the use of grammar and the English Language. It has given us masterpieces such as Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth.With Ulysses you can see a novel peeking out from behind the obscure language. Joyce's talent was such that even he could not write something absolutely bad but what a tragedy that such a dud ideology could destroy the work of so potentially gifted a writer.You know its true."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the sorriest excuse for a novel I have ever come across; don't waste your time.

We also had noted that the book was on top 100 books of the century etc.. All of us decided the only reason this book could be recommended is because Joyce introduced a new form of writing called \\"stream of consisiousness\\". This style of writing basically goes into the character's mind and portray's his/her thoughts. This style at least in this book is very very had to follow, if no narrative is given in between characters thoughts by the author.

It is a work of its time rather than anything of lasting interest.We all know the background, at the turn of the century the art world was a kaleidoscope of new ideas and trends. In art there was C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, and Picasso. In music Scriabin was experimenting with the melding of music and light.Artists were experimenting with form rather than looking at content. Sometimes these experiments worked other times they led to a dead end and were forgotten.Ulysses is an experimental novel, one that uses the form of stream of consciousness. The form is at the expense of its readability and clarity. What happened with Joyce's experiment, it limped through Finegan's Wake which is so impenetrable it barely rates as a puzzle and died. Ulysses as an experimental art form is a dead end, and with good reason.The sorts of things that made and make literature great are the sorts of things that Joyce rejects with his experiments in form. Literature is related to the content rather than the empty vessel of form.This of course is not to say that Joyce was without talent.

Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit.

In fact, much like the splatter-painting of Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like. At least the more general reading public has never been swayed by such frauds, preferring mere entertainments like Lord of the Rings--which indeed have more going for them, on any level, than anything Joyce and his kind have ever done."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself.

So I found it wonderful as a written work, with all the fun, strange and brilliant techniques Joyce used; but as a novel, as a story about people's lives, I really didn't have much interest. I was kept at a distance from the characters by Joyce's telling of the story, so that even when the characters were deep in frenzied monologues, I only heard Joyce's writing, and not the characters' actual voices.

James Joyce just wrote a book for you to enjoy. If you want to make a big hairy deal out of some Irish guy writing a book, you probably have no life, or else a Master's thesis to write. James Joyce just stuffed a bunch of language into a book he thought he might like writing. He was just trying to write something worth reading, like Mark Twain, or William Faulkner would. Get over yourself. Joyce took language a little farther out on a limb. He was just another writer trying to make love to English. Why would any writer not try to love a language as lovely as English?

And Joyce's vocabulary isn't merely extensive, its obscure and often so archaic that most dictionaries weighing fewer than 20 lbs. don't contain the words he uses. Unless you're young, if you don't read a book sentence by sentence, understanding the meaning of most every word, you aren't really reading or absorbing it, and its a waste of time, which is sad, because Ulysses has been such an influential work. But ultimately who cares? I'm coming to the unfortunate conclusion that the work of almost every member of the Lost Generation is failing to stand the test of time. Its one thing to read these icons in your early 20s; its another when you're approaching 50. As you get older, you realize Fitzgerald's and Hemingway's novels are terribly dated; Gertrude Stein's theories about writing are infinitely more interesting than her writing itself; and guys like Dos Passos are irrelevant.

I am particularly concerned by the number of people who gave the book a poor review after admitting that that hadn't bothered reading past the first few pages. There's an adage in criticism that goes something like \\"Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's good\\" (AMEN to that)...a corallary could be \\"Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's a 'literary hoax.\\"Yes, as hard as it may be to believe in some circles, ULYSSES is not a hoax. It is, however, difficult, and not, I repeat NOT for everyone. The stream-of-consciousness, the language(s), the style(s), and the fact that Joyce brought in all sorts of obscure references make it just plain difficult sometimes.The travels of Leopold Bloom about Dublin on that fateful day of June 16, 1904, can be, for the right individual, a difficult, fun journey. What brings fans of this work, like myself, back to it again and again, is the fact that each time we read it we discover something we missed (or misunderstood) the last time (or last 10 times) around.With a little work on the reader's part, ULYSSES can be finished. Many of us have actually made it to the end, scratched our head, and started again a few weeks later (after full recovery).Give it a shot, and if it's not for you, don't even bother moving onto FINNEGANS WAKE...you won't make it past the third line!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of the classic texts of experimental psychology and a must-read for memory researchers.

Don't ignore these and other classic texts in your study of modern experimental psychology!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" is a deeply flawed work of genius that richly deserves both the bouquets and the brickbats that critics have hurled at it over the years. It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.\\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is, without a doubt, the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Although many great books have been written before and after its publication, nothing has equaled it, or even come close. It is, without a doubt, a true and lasting work of art.Ulysses is an immensely detailed, perfectly-crafted, often sordid account of the wanderings of certain Dubliners around their city on 16 June 1904, principally, Leopold Bloom, outwardly a Hungarian Jewish proprietor of a small business, but inwardly, a sensuous rags and tatters Hamlet, a man who has lost both his religion and his name; his adulterous wife, Molly; and Stephen Dadelus, a clever but pretentious young teacher, Joyce's alter ego. Joyce labored for years on Ulysses, amassing and checking facts and then, with a genius that has never been matched, drawing them all into various symbolic patterns that mirror the wanderings and ordeals of Homer's Odysseus, Joyce's own hero.In one episode, narrated by an anonymous Dubliner, Bloom enters a pub and politely declines a drink offered to him by a Nationalist, accepting a cigar instead. Despite numerous attempts to change the subject, the Nationalist rages on and on, grumbling about foreigners and strangers. Bloom eventually gets fed up; he defends himself and his race, jabbing his cigar for emphasis as he speaks. Eventually, though, Bloom is accused of true treachery against the Irish race--not standing everyone a drink when he is thought to have successfully backed an outsider in the Gold Cup horse race. The Nationalist explodes and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom as he quickly retreats.In Ulysses, this scene is funny, but it is also so much more. The Nationalist is the one-eyed giant Cyclops from whom Ulysses escaped by jabbing his eye with a burning stake. The tunnel vision and terrorism that are but a small part of the Irish race are fought by Ulysses/Bloom as he jabs his cigar at his tormentor. &quot;But it's no use,&quot; Bloom says. &quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life...Love.&quot;There are ironic devices used in Ulysses other than the Homeric one, including the one used so strikingly by Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (in which we were introduced to the character of Stephen Dadelus), matching the style of the narrative to the person occupying the foreground. As a Modernist, Joyce wanted this stylistic device to be &quot;visible&quot; rather than &quot;invisible;&quot; he wanted readers to develop an awareness of his technique, to identify, not only with the story but with the way in which he was telling it.Joyce had a message to deliver in Ulysses: he sought to tell the world of the people he had encountered; to describe their conduct and speech, to analyze their motive, to relate the effects the sordid, turbulent, disorderly &quot;world,&quot; replete with Irish whiskey and Irish ecclesiasticism, had upon him, an emotional and egocentric genius whose chief pleasure was self-analysis and whose chief preoccupation was in keeping a notebook filled with every incident he'd ever encountered and every speech heard, all recorded with a Boswellian fidelity.Although Ulysses is not impossible to understand, the book does test anyone's endurance as it is filled with fragments of songs, bits of other languages, lists, obscure references and Joyce's stream-of-consciousness style. Idiosyncrasies abound; from the early Dubliners, Joyce abjured &quot;perverted commas&quot; in favor of French-style punctuation.Reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one way to prepare for Ulysses. In that book we are introduced to Stephen Dadelus and we also have a chance to get used to Joyce's capacity to externalize his consciousness, to put down in words those things many of us would be ashamed to admit to thinking, even to ourselves.Unlike Odysseus, Joyce never returned home. He wandered around Europe, his eyesight failing, with his fiercely-loyal wife, Nora, at his side. It is Nora Joyce celebrates in the tremendous punctuationless passage that ends Ulysses.Although Stephen Dadelus, in his Parisian tranquility, would have pretended indifference to the praise heaped upon Ulysses, Joyce knew that he had created something special and lasting. &quot;O rocks,&quot; Molly says to Bloom, &quot;tell us in plain words.&quot; That is something Joyce never failed to do."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a brilliant novel. And it will find its salvation not because it is a triumph of form--which it is. Admittedly it packs intellectual poetry into every syllable, carefully constructed. But this means nothing today. Joyce was the only modernist who seemed to know that eventually the modernist form would fade and people would just wonder why The Wasteland is so damn hard to read. This book will find a salvation because it is more classical than any other book in the 20th century canon. And because it is a realist work before it is anything else.Anyone who doubts that Joyce is a realist writer needs to take a glance at Dubliners. It is, more than likely, the realist tint of Ulysses that made upper crust elitists like Woolf dislike it. In his failed poet Stephen, Joyce offers a critique of the aesthete lifestyle. His hero, Bloom, is an impotent Jew suffering in sexual silence for the sake of his wife. The spiritual motivation of the book is a near-illiterate woman. There's little for the oversexed anti-semites of 1930s Paris to appreciate here.Joyce wrote this book for his wife. It is his gift to her; fill in the details, ask yourself why that particular day, and you will see how Ulysses is perhaps the most profound love ode in the English language since &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; It abolishes identity, language, politics, ethnicity and class in favor of a simple love poem. Read and be moved, but never say it is without content."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a pity for so many out there that appreciating this remarkable novel requires a broad and good education. A grounding in the classics certainly helps - Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, as some reviewers have noted. But, in addition, if you've read widely and can catch the parodies of, say, Gibbon or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or of journalism around 1900, you'll enjoy it even more.Even then, 'Ulysses' is set in a time and place which have faded - Dublin in 1904 - and there are a lot of topical allusions to the politics (e.g. Parnell and his fall, Zionist publicity for immigration to Palestine), music (operas and lighter musical libretti) and much else to create a world, a whole set of intersecting lives, perspectives and meaning.Joyce was a true polyglot, so the bits of Italian, French, Latin, and rhyming underworld slang, for instance, can strike people as just showing off - but they make the book much more than a recounting of a banal day in a narrow setting.Precisely for both reasons - the allusions which have by now faded, and the breadth of the intellectual experience the book provides - even the most well-read connoisseur of literature would probably gain something by referring, at least occasionally, to the annotations of a book like Gifford's. But once this is done for a bit of the book, it gets much easier not to lean on the annotations, and 'Ulysses' can be read on its own, coming back to Gifford to see what more can be added to fill in the multiple meanings and subtleties.'Ulysses' has to be read slowly. Joyce took seven years to write it, so why not spend a year or two to absorb it? I'd suggest that the right discipline in approaching the book is to read no more than a page or two a day, and to break off and come back to it as often as needed.But then, exactly as some of the reviewers suggest, if you don't have either the background or the time, maybe you should read something else. After all, a top listing by Modern Library or the opinions of others who've thought 'Ulysses' a classic, or the fact that the book is a staple of English literature departments at universities, shouldn't force anyone to read it. And if people don't force themselves to read something they don't like, maybe they won't find a need to call the book or the author names.Yet, in spite of the difficulties of access which make 'Ulysses' somewhat esoteric, it has a lot of verbal pyrotechnics. If you enjoy the sheer mastery of language, there's little to compare unless you go back to Shakespeare. More than that, in the finest humanist style of the high renaissance (Montaigne, and, again, Shakespeare)the world of 'Ulysses' is in the measure of man. There's all of life to be experienced in reading it: tragedy (the death of Stephen's mother, from which he is still recovering, of Bloom's infant son, vividly remembered, the suicide of Bloom's father, Virag, which comes back in Bloom's reveries); comedy (mockery of \\"high society\\" in a hilarious catalogue of names, of \\"high art\\" in a sketch of a dog's barking as if it were reviewed in appreciation of its poetic qualities; sexuality in its many aspects - a quite touching portrait, through her letters to her father, of Bloom's budding young daughter who has just begun to work, but also a nightmarish and hallucinatory scene with Bloom and Stephen in a brothel.Joyce's vision is kindly and humane. He mocks established religion (the blasphemy is quite amusing if you're not easily shocked),or the 'gods' of \\"nationalism\\" ('patriotism' if you wish), and many other '-isms'. But his low-key message is of loving one another, affirming life for what it is, and doing the best one can, with no easy guides.In the end, reading 'Ulysses' is a unique experience. If this review helps even a few more readers have it, I'll be satisfied. All the others should just relax and just read what they enjoy better!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"1. When you tried it in college, it was a task, a challenge, an intellectual mountain to climb, a test of your literary mettle. Perhaps if you read it apart from any course, as I did, you felt you failed.2. In the intervening time you've read perhaps hundreds of Modernist and post-modernist novels by Joyce's acknowledged progeny, those whose numbers are legion: from William Faulkner to Beckett to Barth to Perec to Eggers to Coover to Calvino to Kundera, from \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" to \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew,\\" from Jeanette Winterson to Louis Paul Boon and Gilbert Sorrentino to Peter Handke. These you have relished and enjoyed tremendously. Why, then, not tackle their progenitor, the master himself, again?3. A book is no longer in any way a notch in your belt; you read for enjoyment, enlightenment, enrichment, a sense of connectedness, all the right reasons and some that aren't.3. You can start with your old paperback, and if Ulysses again proves too difficult, you can toss it aside, no harm done.4. If the old paperback falls apart and you find you're still reading, you can buy a new copy.5. You're not in such an all-fired hurry any more. You have the sense to adapt to Joyce's demands and slow down your reading speed, recognizing that this is like a prose poem. Take five minutes on one given page, what's the rush? The writing is finely tooled enough to deserve it.5. Your maturity allows you to see beyond the Masterpiece Syndrome and the Scholar's Paradise that Ulysses became to enjoy what a romp it is. This is fun! for God's sake. Joyce is forty different kinds of comedian, veering from irony to black comedy to sly humor to sheer buffoonery.6. Each section being in a different style is itself royally entertaining, and Joyce is masterly in all of them. This is a buffet prepared by a virtuoso chef, and if you hang onto your hat, it's exhilarating as all get out.7. The unexpected effect of all this variety is that the three main characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom are more vivid and real than they could possibly be otherwise. Various sections familiarize us with their intimate habits, personal effects, private thoughts, and the way others see them; and by regarding them through different stylistic lenses, Joyce effects unusual familiarity and allows these fictional entities to assume the palpability of real people.8. We feel great affection for these characters, and Joyce achieves this while depicting them not as highly exceptional, heroic souls but rather average, idiosyncratic and unremarkable people. Even the highly intelligent, poetic Stephen is a typically self-dramatizing, youthful romantic. And yes, though the novel is rife with comic turns, there is poignancy, great and generous humanity.9. The novel is a sensuous feast, the words chosen always with an ear for sound in the reciprocal service of memorable, ultravivid images. You can dog-ear a dictionary (to many disappointments, considering Joyce's flamboyant taste for arcana and neologisms) or not; your workable vocabulary will suffice for much, if not most, of the glorious language. In this regard Joyce is a wizard, a magician unsurpassed by any poet in memory.10. As another reviewer here noted, you will have the urge, once you've come to the last line, to immediately begin again. Keep your new copy handy. This is such a kaleidoscope, a ride of a book, that you'll want to read it a third time, soon enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Very pleased with the condition and price of the book.

The dialogue comes through loud and the right after dialogue the reader's words are so soft that it's difficult to hear. This audio book is not easily listened to even in a quiet car."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This whoel review began as a comment, and tehn I realizedi had soemthign to say for myself on the topic, so here it is:I took a Course on Joyce at NUI Galway and I am thankful that I did because otherwise I would not appreciate Ulysses. Many of the points made by detractors of Joyce and Ulysses are valid, in fact most of them are. Even Yeats who praised the book confessed that he never finished it. But that is indicative of some peculiar choices by Joyce, for instance, the Third Chapter is intentionally unreadable. Joyce apparently did this to make a point about the mentality of the educated Irishmen, such as himself, who had the tendency to make themselves irrelevant to their countrymen. He did this by filling the entirety of the chapter with verbiage so obtuse and obscure that even educated people would have trouble telling you what's actually happen, which isn't much, they guy just sits there on the beach and feels sorry for himself. If I had not been in a Module whereby the Lecturer explained that this is essentially unreadable I surely would have put down the book forever.There are many points of interest for me in the book, I highly suggest reading the last chapter by itself as its prose is quite enjoyable and really provides of portrait of a time and a place and a people. It's not really necessary to read the book stait through, as my good friend and classmate (though he never took this course) explained it to me: \\"Ulysses is a book which is never intended to be finished, you just pick it up and open it up anywhere and start reading and when you can't take it anymore, you put it back down.\\"In regards to this book, if it can help provide the insight I needed to help me understand Ulysses I would say it is worthwhile, but my experience is that these books never do that, they just tell you what they think it is you should know about the famous book, banking on the name-recognition of the book and the author, knowing full well that most people has never read enough of the book to refute them.It was a strange thing for Joyce to do in his effort to \\"write the greatest book in the English language\\" where the result was really much more (and then again sometimes less) then a book at all. The volumous \\"story\\" - we'll call it that for lack of a better word, really became an entity within itself because he hi-jacked the English language to make statements by the use of the text itself rather than within it, and within the hundreds of pages he hid what was considered pornographic imagery, knowing full well that those who would take exception to it would be hard pressed to actually read it for themselves. The result was so un-approachable that he actually had to tell people that it was a parallel to the Odyssey (despite the name) and provide notes on how to interpret it. If this was any other book this would signal the utter worthlessness of the book, but what Joyce did, and which has never been recreated, is the exception, if you are ready to accept it for what it is, and what it isn't: a good story.The story itself, is rather boring and uninteresting, this was part of Joyce's design though. He was making a statement about Ireland by making this incredibly uneventful and uninteresting story and then contrasting it with the heroic tales of Odysseus. There-by making the Joyce-equivalent all the worse by comparison. Like I said, it makes the story itself boring, but it's interesting if you know that going in, thank goodness Joyce provided the author of the first literary analysis of Ulysses with his notes!Even though I whole-heartily agree with many of these points on their own, I believe that Ulysses is an import book to peruse, if not read. And it should not be dismissed in its entirety. However for an enjoyable work by Joyce I highly suggest something else, such as Dubliners, where the short story form restricts Joyce from getting to ostentatious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time.

But, how to acomplish yhis ambition, when Romeo and Juliet and Anna Karenina is allready written? Joyce's solution is to redefine what the concept of a Great Love novel is all about. Instead of regarding the reader as someone to ammuse and seduce - someone that has the passive role of observing the story, Joyce combats the reader and makes the readers experience of reading the book as a crusial part of his story.Even the 16th of May 1904 was a long time ago and happend far away as Joyce wrote Ulysses in Trieste, Zurich and Paris from 1914 to 1921, Joyce describes virtually every detail that happened in Dublin that special day, long ago, far away. Even the fact that James Joyce wasn't much of a husband, drinking heavily when he had money, often was out of work and in conflict with his family because of his drinking, spending and unemployment, working on Ulysses - against his doctors strict orders as it would make him blind - when he was in a state of working, his wife hanged on to him all this time. In the same way the book appears difficult to read, and goes on \\"forever\\" in the sense of pages, places and number and level of hidden meanings you can dedicate alife to, Ulysses simply gets too much for many of its readers, making them give in, regarding it to complicated, difficult to understand, simply not worth the effort. In the same manner, the most obvious conclusion to draw from a marriage with James Joyce, might be that it was not worth the effort. As soon as I understood that this probably was exactly the point Joice was trying to make though, it was like I would not and could not let him prove that he was right and unlike my previous attemts to finnish the novel, I succeded. Blessing or curse - I guess this feeling of denying to give in, is excactly what can make a relatationship like this go on.As far as I know, Joyce is the first writer to introduce this projective way of writing - integrate the readers feelings and reactions to what he reads as a vital part of the story. After though, this projective writing is used by several writers - for instance when Bret Easton Ellis writes in a manner that makes the reader of American Psycho feel as bored as his main character Patrick Bateman feels - illustrating that he has more in common with you and me than we care about, or when Jerome David Sallinger in A Perfect day for Bananafish at the last line of the shortstory makes you realize that he has wrapped you arond his little finger all the time, manipulated you to think what he wants you to think, feel what he wants you to feel, leaving you with the predjustises that he wanted you to have , in order not to make you see the fatal conclution.It is obviously other ways to read Ulysses. You find a lot of them in the other customers review. It can be a good advice to put a copy of the so called Ulysses schema in the book when you try to read it, to make it easier to orient in time, space and theme. Make an internet search and you will find it.I hope you will finnish Ulysses with a sense of having read something that made it worth-while:)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I never read any of his other books, this one alone would make Joyce my favorite author. It isn't a book for everyone, but if you're patient with it, it's a very rewarding read. This book is one of a handful that gets consistently better with each reading. The first go is the hardest, but I encourage you to finish it. Joyce said that he wanted to paint a portrait of Dublin so complete that if it were to disappear, it could be recreated from what was described in his book. I don't know how true that statement is, but I have never read a more complete description of human nature as that presented in this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great edition for your first time through Ulysses. The notes and introduction are immensely helpful. Schemata, Odyssey parallels, a decent amount (for a novel edition) of allusions are all glossed.Buy from overseas. Really worth it.

No notes there so be warned!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Most parts of the book were difficult to understand. That means I didn't understand them.I started out thinking it would be a great journey to read the whole 700+ pages of great writing. As I went along, I found that I couldn't understand one-tenth of what was going on. Well, I had to finish the book because I wanted to experience what many people say is the greatest novel ever written.One thing I learned from reading this book is that when you are faced with something you don't understand, it is okay to get the hell out. Otherwise, you'd just be wasting 4 weeks of your life.Needless to say, I will never forget the four weeks I spent reading this book. I'd remember it as one of the darkest periods of my life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you intend to read ULYSSES here are a few suggestions.First off, read or reread Homer's The Odyssey, from which Joyce's seminal work is based. Aside from the Dedalus/Telemachus, Bloom/Odysseus, and Molly/Penelope parallels, each book in Joyce's novel reinvents equivalent parts of the Greek epic. You will gain a much greater appreciation of Joyce's achievement in transposing and reinterpreting a 10 year mythic and epic journey in ancient Greece to a 1 day journey in early 20th century Dublin.Secondly, don't come in expecting to understand everything. Many have tried and quit after reading a few parts, daunted by the strange syntax, the disjointed time frames, the shifts from waking to dream states, and the lack of traditional narrative replaced for the most part by stream of consciousness (internal monologue) to develop the plot. Joyce plays around a lot in ULYSSES, changing narrative styles, dialects, inventing words. You can't breeze through it. It requires a lot of patience to get through ULYSSES..to appreciate what Joyce has accomplished. It's always tricky categorizing a great work, but being that it's a novel about thought processes I guess you can say it's beyond realism..call it super realism. This is literature as a ground breaking art form. Joyce broke rules, but so did Picasso, and ULYSSES is kind of a literary Cubist masterpiece.Finally, after getting through ULYSSES (if you can), read the voluminous critiques on it. Read about the author. Do further exploration. Then read ULYSSES again. Multiple readings certainly enhance the experience, and bear fruit which are hidden or unripe enough to initially enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I recently returned from Dublin where I met many Irish people and native \\"Dubs,\\" as they call themselves.

I followed along as he read and began to understand the rythm of the text. \\"Ulysses\\" became exciting instead of imposing.Jim Norton is truly gifted: Great voice and wonderful imagination."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite what the reviewer from MA had to say about this novel, it is readable and it should be approached by anyone who is interested in it. It is not an easy read, but then again, really innovative and engaging works never are. Joyce does something in this novel that few authors have the courage to do--trust the reader's intelligence.Yes, this is a retelling of The Odyssey, but even without that framework, the novel stands by itself. The story picks up about a year after Joyce's novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man leaves off with some of the same characters, notably Stephen Dedalus. But the protagonist of the work, Leopold Bloom, is the real stroke of genius. It might help to read Portrait before approaching Ulysses just to get an introduction to Stephen and his family. Anyone who really wants to get as many allusions as possible should probably use Gifford's annotations, which are available for both texts.As for our friend from MA...well, what can you say about someone who is reviewing the Cliff's Notes version of the text? Is that what Poly Sci majors read in order to try and feel intelligent as English majors?Do not be afraid; you can read this book. If you are afraid of starting a book that is so long by yourself then get some friends or family involved and read the book out loud to each other. It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Due to the recent explosion of fame of this novel, many literature lovers have gone out to buy the book (or get it from a library,) to at least see what the hype is all about, if not to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, many of these literature lovers enjoy not just reading, but the atmosphere of reading--curling up in bed or in a plush recliner after work and shutting off the outside world to live with the characters for a few hours. These readers generally throw Ulysses away before getting past the third chapter because they realize that no such reading atmosphere is possible with such a complex novel. To those interested in reading the novel, I offer two suggestions: first study a little Irish history, particularly about Charles Stewart Parnell, Daniel O'Connell, Arthur Griffin and Sinn Fein, the Fenian movement, etc. even if you just peruse encyclopedia articles. Second, read the Don Gifford notes for the novel along with Ulysses itself. This will constantly interrupt your reading of the novel, but it will help your understanding. If you are completely unwilling to put in this effort, buying this book will be a waste of money. But even if you don't think you would be willing to read a novel that requires so much initial research for basic comprehension, consider this: If Ulysses is really as good as its fans claim, you will want to go back and read it a second time, and then you will be able to enjoy it without constantly referring to notes, history texts or foreign language dictionaries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition corrected hundreds or thousands of mistakes that were in the 1961 edition. When Ulysses was originally published, it had to be typeset in france because english printers could be prosecuted for \\"pornography\\". These typesetters didn't know english and made a lot of mistakes. Joyce's corrections (he often worked backwards to develop certain themes) were scrawled onto (at least) two sets of galleys and many of them were never included. In addition to that he was going blind and missed a lot of typos which thus came to seem intentional. Ulysses is (IMHO) the greatest book of the 20th century and demands careful and close reading. With the 1961 edition, which I read through several times before this one came out, I was left with many obscurities (such as Bloom having a watch in one chapter and needing to ask someone the time in a later chapter) to ponder which, it turns out, Joyce never intended, as well as struggling through passages than made no sense at all. This is still a very difficult book to read, but there's far less that's inexplicable in this edition. The difference is analogous to hearing cleaned-up CDs (of, say, Robert Johnson) as opposed to tapes made from shellac records with all the pops, scratches, and hisses on them."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is Leopold Bloom - husband of Molly, father of Milly, advertising canvasser, lover of \\"the inner organs of beasts and fowls,\\" Jew, atheist, untutored but curious and sympathetic observer of the world around him. On June 16, 1904, Bloom has breakfast, defecates, attends a funeral, goes sporadically about his work, has lunch, visits the library, has a heated discussion with some Dublin barflies, masturbates discreetly while enjoying the view afforded by a conveniently reclining shop-girl, falls in with some drunken medical students, visits a brothel, and tends to an obnoxious young hipster-intellectual, whom he brings home for a cup of coffee and a chat.That's what \\"happens,\\" but over the course of Bloomsday we are invited into the life and times of the most fully and brilliantly realized character in world literature. As Bloom strolls around Dublin, and the novel records fragments from his endlessly fascinating internal monologue, his life slowly comes into focus: he is of half-Jewish descent; he is married to a voluptuous beauty named Molly who, Bloom knows, will spend the afternoon getting a thorough seeing-to by a well-hung local playboy; he has a daughter, but his only son was still-born, since which time his marriage has been largely dysfunctional; his father committed suicide; he is carrying on a clandestine correspondence with a married woman; but at the core of his uxorious being remains Molly, his mind returning time and again to their courtship and the happy early years of their marriage.We learn much, too, from his interactions with his fellow Dubliners. Throughout the day Bloom endures a steady stream of anti-Semitic bigotry, ranging from the casual to the (comically) violent. Bloom is an outsider, a humane and free-thinking man in a city of parochial bores. He is also, in Joyce's words, \\"a good man,\\" a man who takes it upon himself to collect funds for a recently widowed woman and spontaneously helps a blind man cross the road. Most endearing of all, however, is his boundless curiosity, his wonderful (if often ill-informed) observations of people and things. When he looks at his cat he ponders: \\"Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower. No, she can jump me.\\" \\"Good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,\\" he muses later. Or: \\"Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife.\\" Or: \\"Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.\\" Or: \\" Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.\\" And so on.Bloom, his mind and his life, - like the city he lives in - comes into focus bit by bit, like tiny pieces of a dazzling mosaic slowly coming together before your eyes. With unnerving prescience, Joyce has created a genuinely modern Everyman (he works in advertising!): deracinated, middle-class, tolerant, suburban, he's a little bit like you and me, making a go of his modest existence with a redeeming dignity.The final chapter belongs to Bloom's wife Molly, who lies in bed next to her husband and reflects - in eight astonishing unpunctuated sentences - upon the events of her day and her past, throwing new light upon what we think we know about Bloom and his marriage. Big-bosomed, generously-bottomed Molly is Woman with a capital \\"W\\". Where Bloom is intellectual, reflective and logical, Molly is impulsive, florid, instinctive, sensual. The faithless Molly is an improbable Penelope, but as she concludes with the ecstatic recollection of her courtship with Bloom atop a hill overlooking Dublin bay, and with her climactic Yes - to her husband, to life - it all makes perfect, glorious sense.Next to Joyce's latter day Ulysses - and his Penelope - the stylistic fireworks of the novel are of secondary interest, a brilliant means to an end rather than a legitimate pretext for anorak-like fixation. You'll get more out of Ulysses the more familiar you are with Homer, with the western literary and intellectual tradition, with the geography of Edwardian Dublin, and with Irish culture and history, but in truth you don't need any of those things. Here is a rich, nourishing, generous feast of a book: all you need is an open mind and a sympathetic interest in the world and the creatures that inhabit it.Finnegan's Wake is strictly for comfortably tenured scholars and tragic seekers of hermetic wisdom. Ulysses is for the rest of us. Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First, please disregard the star rating. I had to choose something, but in this case, it's meaningless.I read Portrait of the Artist in college and found it absolutely wonderful. It influenced me to change my major and, to a degree, my life. I was sure then, as I am now, that Joyce is one of the greatest writers I have ever read. I therefore tried to read Ulysses several times, including just recently, and each time hit a wall after a few dozen pages. My most recent attempt was assisted by an extrinsic aid that summarized the chapters and elucidated some of the obscure references. I was determined to make a go of it; I pictured myself wallowing in a warm bath of self-satisfaction at having completed the book, and being able to mention to others (casually, of course) that I'd read it.I failed.I have read my share of stylistically difficult novels, and consider myself reasonably well educated. I could doubtless plow through the book with gritted teeth, determined not to let it get the better of me, but life's too short. I surely can't say it isn't a great work of literature (particularly since I've made barely a dent in it), but I would venture to say that you should not even try it unless you are prepared either to devote a few months of close study, with reference materials, or to miss eighty percent of what the author was trying to say and do. I can also say that I think it unlikely that you will genuinely enjoy the book unless you derive inherent satisfaction from conquering a difficult task, or are a scholar of literature of this genre.Not a beach book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Plot? There is no plot? Hath life a plot? I think not. Life is a continual process, ebb and flow, rising and falling, like plate tectonics, like the ocean:constant movement, sometimes building to grand, pulsing, God-quaking climaxes before receding back into everyday lifes slowly humming grey. But sometimes not. Don't approach Ulysses looking for a coherent arc of plot, you're going to be disappointed(again, it hasn't one). Approach it more like Lolita, less concerned with the subject matter than with the beauty of its language; each word is a live, crawling jeweled beetle gnawing and burrowing through the dung of a day in the life of ad salesman Leopold Bloom, flittering their wings, busszing and forminng new patters, cresting and swirling into a cone, a tetracylone around an ordinary day in the life of an essentially ordinary Man. It works like a silhouette:each word, like a wort, pimple, hair or other blemish on a face defines its shape, as does ulyesses a life in the context of a single day(cf Finnegans Wake), through long sonorous sentences and chapters brimming like a cistern full of noisy pink coffee, out of which meaning blooms like a bloody Liebestod-singing rose, grabbing you. Even still, there is no meaning-ordering modern life? There is no order.&quot;Der Inhalt ist in den Augen einer Eule&quot;. Using The Odyssey to parallel Blooms avoidance of Molly is but a simple ploy, an act of acceptance and defeat, a concession of escape and resignation-much like those little pimply puke potsmoke fourteen year olds who compare their lives to popular songs. Don't hide. The pure organic beauty-tragic, erotic, hilarious, pathetic, and ulimtately affirmative runs through this novel like a vein of gold ore. Pick it up. Enjoy it at length. Enjoy it many times over-the more you read it the more you get. Don't seek God in Ulysses-Joyce's brilliance could certainly back up his notoriously mammoth arrogance but he was no seer, no mystic, but a human, flawed just like any other-instead, enjoy its beauty, and in it(eventually, but with time you will)recognize yourself, and every other human being on Earth-for am Ende we are all Leopold Bloom(nee Virag)--therein."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"whoever gives this book less that six stars out of five is ver likely to be just not mature enough to handle serious literature"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Everyone seems to agree that this is a great novel, except for a few, and I don't have time to read all the reviews, but I would say one thing: you don't have to completely understand Ulysses to appreciate it. Most people who tell you that they understand the book are lying. Joyce was a genius--not in a way that he was a &quot;really good&quot; writer, but in a way that he simply had more brain power than almost all of us. He pushed himself for years and years to write this book, and he is a genius, so why should we be able to understand this book in one or two readings? You might get the gist of it after a few readings, a good professor to guide you through, and a strong literary background. But it doesn't matter if you have your MA in English or not, Joyce's intricacies will, for most of us, remain elusive. Not understanding Ulysses doesn't mean you're stupid it means you are human. I don't know why people are suprised that they don't &quot;get it&quot; when they read it. Most of us will probably never be able to grasp the brilliance of Mozart's music or Einstein's theories either, we have to kind of trust people that know how good they are. After a while we may be able to see why they are so good too. It's curious that people would hold literature to a lower bar than those disciplines.

The fact that so many has been written about it makes one shy to add one's own humble opinion, while the fact that it has recently (although somewhat controversially) been chosen as the best book of the last century makes one want to give it the benefit of the doubt with respect to every critical remark.And most of all, Ulysses is simply a brilliant book. The reader finds herself immersed in a dull day, which nevertheless reflects all aspects of life in Dublin around 1900. And this realist, evocative aspect of the book is balanced by its success in mirroring large parts of the literary heritage with which every book must come to terms. Loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, and riddled with references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, it shows both a tremendous respect for man's wish to put his life into words and an ironic distance from every specific attempt to do so. There were indeed many times I found myself thinking that I was reading the perfect book, the &quot;novel to end all novels&quot;.Nonetheless, in the end I concluded - albeit hesitantly - that Ulysses is a flawed gem. There are two aspects of the book that make it so. First, there are the constant allusions to Irish folk music. Indeed, large parts of Ulysses (and not only the Sirens chapter) read as though they should be sung. While this certainly adds a layer of meaning to the book for everyone who knows these tunes, it makes for frustration with everyone who does not. Moreover, with the inclusion of this fickle and all too transitory form of art, Joyce has strongly connected his novel to the early 1900's. While this might have been his intention, it detracts from the novel's universality and its ability to transcend the boundaries of its time. Even now, 75 years after its publication, I often felt like I was gazing at a world which is both completely lost and partly incomprehensible. The second major flaw is the apparent lack of structure between the episodes. While every episode itself is highly structured, and one of the main joys in reading the book is to gradually discover these structures, I could not help but wonder why certain structures were chosen, and how they relate to each other. The prime example of this is the Ithaca episode, in which Joyce has turned some rather mundane events into an elaborate catechism of questions and answers. While hilarious at times, this structure seemed highly arbitrary to me. I am quite sure that many interpretations of this aspect of Ulysses have been given in the secondary literature, but the essence of structure - as in poems - seems to me that it should invite the reader to understand it: the reader should see glimpses of a larger whole in order to start looking for it. Unfortunately, in Ulysses I did not find myself invited, but more often the subject of some incomprehensible joke of the author.I am well aware that both flaws are only so on the basis of some (probably outmoded) theory of literature, and that they can both be turned into major beauties of the book. Nonetheless, I think that Ulysses is the prime example of a book who wishes to be perfect, but which, unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Like everyone who've read the book, i saw ulysses very complicated and hard to read. It's a huge book; about 1000 pages and the hardnesses in them makes readers have difficulties while reading. The confusing writing style, too many characters and names of places, conflict between thoughts and speeches, many words/sentences in many different languages, a great cultural background with many colors, unordinary writing skill.. All these and other causes make the book ununderstandable and complex. But, beyond this, you can feel the genius writer among the pages. Joyce, hides himself, his prodigy, all of the people, thoughts and happenings of 16th July's Dublin. The most important impact of the book is, to me, the prodigy you read in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"this is one of the briliant book i have ever read there is a lot of information on it on historical things and its very interesting to read those details its a hard book but it worht it its a smart and funny i suggest that the reader try to engoy the book this book is a peace of art and not fight whith it"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, while seemingly understood (by literary professionals anyway) as a masterpiece of literature, is a very hard narrative and one that turns off alot of people. I think part of the reason that many readers have difficulty with the novel, though, is that they approach it similarly to other reads. Personally, I think this is a mistake.Ulysses is, in my opinion, the literary equivalent of improvisational jazz. Improvisational jazz is considered by many musical professionals as the purest of music. Jazz performers find it thrilling, joyful, and simply without comparison to other musical forms. Yet, many others consider it boring and difficult to understand. I think at least part of the reason for this is that it lacks the musical structure to which we are all programmed to respond to. Many people have no frame of reference to place it in.In a literary sense, I think Ulysses shares these aspects in many ways. Many passages are difficult to understand, especially if one seeks a familiar literary structure within which to place it. And yet, if one steps out of the box a little and takes the time to appreciate its poetic lyricism, to allow the words to flow without necessarily seeking to place them within that familiar structure, some otherwise difficult passages can be reached at level different from other novels. The normal reader's desire to understand the passage in its purely contextual form is lessened. The end result is that the novel becomes a less daunting read.Ultimately, though, I give it only four stars. Irrespective of a reader's approach, too many brain cells have to fire for too long to get through it (its over 1000 pages long). I don't think most people want to work that hard to read a book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is complex, evocative, and displays an incredible mastery of language. The landscape of Dublin 1904 is still as stunning - in a dark sort of way - as it was when Joyce was composing this great book.Certainly, it is hard to read in places. Chapters fourteen and eighteen are especially trying. There are spots where it seems that Joyce gave too much information, or not enough. But for the most part, Ulysses is very readable, with exquisite prose.This is not a book to shy away from. It is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course the novel is brilliant. I don't really need to go into that. What everyone tends to forget is that Ulysses is damn funny. Most people don't really read this book: they spend all their time thinking about how stupid it is (i.e., how they don't understand it) or how magnificent it is (i.e., how they don't understand it). Screw the hype, read the book. You don't need any guides; you're in the hands of a master."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me three years to actually read this book, having stopped a few times. I think it's a great book and I would have given it five stars if it did not require such a committment to read it. If you don't mind working, it's required reading. It's a unique book in that no book like this will ever be published again. I suppose that uniqueness (of form, style) is what makes it a great book, but it isn't &quot;entertaining.&quot; It hits you somewhere else."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Truly a monumental acheivement in the history of writing. Ulysses to me is a brilliant example of how our everyday actions gather significance simply because they are ours. This book should be read by readers who wish to appreciate life...not to understand details."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses begins where A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man left off. Stephen Dedalus has left Ireland only to return to his dying mother. Just because you've read and understood Portrait, don't expect Ulysses to come quite as easily. It's rough going in spots but well worth the effort of getting through. In the process you will be taken through 783 pages that encompass less than a twenty-four hour period in the life of Stephen, the Blooms and Dublin. And what a day it is. Everything you might imagine happens, and much more than you ever could imagine also occurs. From the uneasy start of Stehpen's day to his boring job as a teacher he plods through his mind as he tries to plod through his life. In the course of the day a man dies, a woman gives birth, Stephen finds himself at the library discussing his theories of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and that paternity may very well be legal fiction. Also during this same day Leopold Bloom is going about his routine business in Dublin and finally fatherless Stephen meetssonless Bloom. They venture off into the night world where the present and past hallucinate in a theatre of the mind living nightmare that culminates with Bloom taking Stephen under his wing. And while all this was going on, Mrs. Bloom, Molly has had her own sort of day. The Blooms have an odd relationship yet manage to maintain a bond through their thoughts that neither of them does well in putting into words to one another. Whatever they do, they do with full thought and awareness of the other. What makes this book so terrific is the wide ranges in style that Joyce uses. Each episode is like a novel in itself. There is no boredom or tediousness to get through, the main thing that makes it difficult are the constant allusions and references that Joyce makes that may have you wondering at times just what is going on. There are a number of good books to refer to while reading Ulysses and they can make it easier, but even without them, it's worth plunging forward and reading it all. The novel covers everypart of human existance from the banal to the sublime. You will not be in doubt as to what these people are feeling or thinking, their stream of inner consciousness takes up most of the book. And what's great about that is in finding out what these people are about you can learn something about yourself that you were not previously aware of."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I want you to decide for yourself. Ulysses, to some the masterpiece of all 20th century works, a glorious, sun-ravaged inspiring that is open to all nooks and encompasses all passion. Others call it ludicrious, pompous and dull; overlong; a frustrating exercise in pieceing together symbols. I want you to look over some of the other reviews and see for yourself the division between the pros and the cons; the academic justifications and the confused, ennerverated whining. The fans overpraise with unspeakable delight: believing themselves in the know--a fan of another person's excellence, a seer of all there is to know. You can scan the pages and glean all sorts of terminology, from the label of 'modernism' to the execution of 'stream-of-consciousness' (two indescribible approaches that cannot be so singularly defined as to explain just what, exactly, is going on). There are references to other experts' reviews, and the almost outraged frustration with which it is bespoken tells the person who couldn't get into it that somebody else out there has written about all the things you didn't like in the book and therefore it must be brilliance. The haters are less uniform in their scorn, although most of them summarize 'it didn't make any sense' in one form or another. There are rat-tat-tats of 'boring(s)' and machine gun slogans writing off this unquestionably influencial opus as something not even worthy of remembering.Me? I fall less in the middle and more to the side of scorn. It is a techically dazzlingly display--a rip-roar of English-Latin-Gallic with the cantor on fire and the rhythm in flames. Boom-boom-boom goes the glory of this lover of language who plays and who plays and who plays--trickling insight with the tickle of a feather and bringing the house down with a terse yet finely tuned phrase . . .The biggest problem is the story--a legitimate babble of voices talking over one another with a transformative center that can't keep anyone focused on what any of the characters is actually saying (the characters notice this too). The dialogue goes on for pages--twenty--fifty page stretches!--where no one seems to have the interest or attention span enough to keep things settled for a moment to even decide if any of them know what they're talking about. The topics shift abruptly--aloofly, it would seem--and the range of all of their interests is predictably limited. I can respect (and even admire) the effort to invoke this mindless clamor of Babel, and appreciate the consistancy that can redeem by none of them ever learning anything, but the end result is a story that no one can follow unless they had written it themselves.Ulysses is a book Joyce wrote for himself. No doubt it was joy--an endless experimentation from a frustrated (and rather pompous) author who finally felt justified at the publication of his previous two books. Ulysses, to me, reads as more of a show-off work. A man with great genius who wanted to prove to everyone just how great he could be. The problem is that he was boasting to himself. Here is a book about me me me! All passing to 'naturalism' or the 'realistic aspect' related in numerous grinding scences, are valid, certainly, but merely another label that cannot begin to describe the monster Joyce created here.In the end, an endlessly unpleasurable read that causes one to stop and think often, some of that time about setting the book aside and reading something better--"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What to make of Ulysses, that towering work of modernism that has been seen as both the hallmark of the age, and an impediment to later generations of writers trying to get out from beneath Joyce's long shadow?Ultimately, the worth of the novel can't be questioned, even if you do not \`like' the book. Perhaps no novel in the 20th century exerted (and continues to exert) so great an influence over the written arts. Lots of ink has been spilled about the novel. On this, my third reading of it after twenty years, I have this to say:Part of the challenge and thrill of the novel is Joyce's chameleon like ability to thrown on literary guises, while at the same time being intractably, even stubbornly, Joyce. He had few illusions about his genius, and wrote a work from that lofty standpoint. Although loaded with humor, dirty jokes, and common place incidents, Ulysses is an intellectual's novel, meant not to be read but re-read. It is nearly Talmudic in its dimensions. Dig deeper into a passage and you find multiple layers of meaning.Part of the challenge (and frustration for some) of this novel is its incredible restlessness. The first third of the novel features Joyce's famous stream of consciousness technique. Characters are minds in bodies, thinking a stream of thought, occasionally interrupted by some external datum.Here Joyce creates a kind of hyper-naturalism. It is as if he wishes to show readers that the naturalism of the preceding generations was nothing more than a fictive mask. Here is the closest we can get to the workings of the human mind in its social and psychological settings. He bends language get this. He coins new words. He leaves words dangling off and thoughts unfinished. In other words, he tries to reproduce how our halting minds actually think their thoughts.Once Joyce has accomplished this, he appears to repudiate it. We then get a variety of chapters written from certain literary standpoints (often mockingly so). It is as if Joyce is saying: this is literature too, a series of guises that we throw on and off at will. This is the lens through which people see the world. They are more than encapsulated minds. They also structure their worlds.So, Ulysses keeps the reader off kilter, and with a sense of sheer delight on the part of Joyce. We start over and over again, chewing on the same material and spiritual conditions of one day in Dublin over a hundred years ago.In the process much that is profound happens surrounded by a spectacle of mundane happenings. In other words, just another day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Is this the greatest novel of all time, or just a colossal waste of time? My experience is that reading Joyce's ULYSSES will indeed pay the reader great dividends for the time she put into it. However, I don't believe it's a novel that can be understood and appreciated without a great investment of repeated readings and consultation of outside texts. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a novel that requires that the reader consult at least a half dozen texts and repeated readings to not be totally bewildered by what the hell the author is trying to say.Here's why I say this. I read ULYSSES several times while in college. The first reading gave me absolutely nothing! However, because I was an English major, was deeply interested in Irish lit, and had the time, I gave the novel repeated readings and consulted dozens of secondary books and periodicals. Then I began to get somewhere. What before was a jumble of gibberish about Irish towers and bars and streets and a dog on a beach, before born baby boardman had bliss, shamefaced peaches clop clop clop introblio ad nauseam began to reveal the deeper currents underneath. And I feel it was all quite worth my time and trouble.So here's my advice for the new reader. The 1st reading should be accompanied by Cliff Notes (don't laugh) to get a basic idea of each chapter's theme. This will be a great help. Beyond that, the ANNOTATIONS book is a very good resource. Another secondary source on ULYSSES that I found very valuable and interesting was the many great pieces from THE JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY on the novel. I hope that by now someone has digitally compiled all that scholarship so that it's not lost and forgotten in college library basements!Here's what I found out: Joyce's astounding accomplishment with ULYSSES is that he successfully layered multiple literary, religious, psychological, philosophical biological and historical structures in a single work. The 1st chapter alone is worthy of a full semester's attention in order to unravel and reveal the myriad references and their cross-associations. What we have here is modern scripture, and the largest literary puzzle ever. If intricate literary structure interests you, this is the magnum opus. I'm not risking overstatement to declare that ULYSSES could be called The Book of Life, as a key reason why so many scholars have lauded it as the greatest of novels is that it's the most voluminous and eloquent tale of living that's ever been written.But again, to share these scholars' opinion of this novel WILL require MORE work from the reader than she has given to probably anything else she's tried to read and really appreciate. Know this before you begin reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel. It appears as if a print on demand (POD) publisher hastily assembled the book from Project Gutenburg or some other public domain source. There are inexplicable spaces between lines and paragraphs, the dialogue is bulleted and has no quotation marks, the page numbers are all on the bottom left of the page, etc. Overall an amateurish attempt.

It is unrivalled in style (who could rival it?) or in character. And who is not moved by the pathos and humor of the book, the sorrows and triumphs of L Boom? This lovely edition befits the novel itself. You may want to read and re-read and take notes in \\"corrected\\" editions. This is the one to stare at lovingly, longingly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THIS GREATEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE please skip to the twelfth episode, called Cyclops. YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark.

The truth is that the difficulty is overstated and the down-to-earthness is what really comes through in the end.Give yourself to this book and it will reward you endlessly.

The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking \`stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: \\"He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship\\" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the \`meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ullysses is an Alice in Wonderland of writing styles. This doesn't make it unreadable, it can however prove to be a challenge to casual reader. This point does not distract however from the books marvelous apeal.Ullysses is a book about the comon ordinary man trying to make it though the day. The main character in the book Mr. Bloom wonders around dublin encountering a vast variety of people and events. All of which anyone might encounter, from the visit to the funeral to the one eyed bigot in the bar. We all could encounter the same obsticles that mr. bloom encounter thoughout the book.After reading the above one might think \\"so what, don,t most novels do that anyway.\\" This point is true, but many books do not elaberate on events, thoughts, and conversations of various characters the way Joyce does. This aspects makers Joyce one the top tear of all writers throughout the ages.This book also showcases parellels to the adventers in the oddyssy hence the name of the book. this my be a little hard to grasp at first, but as one moves along and perhaps rereads a chapter or two. the reader should be able to see the parellaels in front of him. It is then the reader begins to realize that our own lives can be a bit like Homers epic adventure to."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a challenge. But it is also worth the challenge if you want to think about marriage, identity, love, and society in serious ways. If you put the book down half-way you are undoubtedly going to walk away disliking it-the final chapters really tie everything together and the Penelope chapter is vital to understanding the ideosyncratic bits of the text that leave you asking, \\"What?\\"I would not suggest making a go of it without buying \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford. A lot of what he includes is superfluous unless you read the book for school, but it really gives such a greater idea of what Joyce is trying to do with this book, explaining the Odyssey stories for each chapter, stylistic intentions, and illuminating obscure references to Judiasm, Irish nationalism, character histories, food obsessions, etc. Without it the book will probably not have that much meaning for the reader, it's too complex.At first Stephen may seem annoyingly self-involved, Bloom a weak coward, and Molly a tart, but when you consider the themes Joyce is taking on-Irish nationalism, being an outsider, understanding another person in a way that allows you to accept their flaws, etc. their character \\"flaws\\" give way to another interpretation. Especially considering the novel takes place in a single day.The book definitely gets better as you read, so don't get frustrated, the end, while not idealistically upbeat as most novels tend to be, is really fitting and satisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I tried to read Ulysses when I was about 20. I couldn't get into it. The stream of consciousness put me off completely Now I'm over 60 and I greatly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down. The writing is beautiful. I just had to go out and get a gorgonzolia sandwitch with a glass of burgundy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had this book described to me by a friend as both the best and worst book she had ever read. I can truly understand and appreciate her sentiments. Parts of the book are sheer poetry, and the descriptions and language draw the reader into the mystical brilliance of James Joyce's non-narrative. Other parts are maddeningly obscure and leave the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. The surprising part of this is that these obscure moments actually add to the book, rather than detracting from it. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; were not so obscure in so many parts, then the sheer mundaneness of much of the day would make it as boring as its detractors claim it to be, but the obscurity forces the reader to read attentively throughout. This is not a challenge enjoyed by all. This is not a light read, and if you're looking for a summer book by the cottage then stick to John Grisham and no fault to it (the light reads serve their purpose and should not be denigrated). However, if you're looking for a book that will test your imagination &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the perfect book. You probably won't fully understand it (I estimate I fully understood about 2/3 of it) but you will have learned much about yourself and the world of early-20th century Dublin and also of the world we live in today. Also, another reviewer here as written that this is a book to be read aloud. I agree whole-heartedly with that appraisal. It will add to both your understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many people see Ulysses as perhaps a pretentious volume of over-rated nonsense which can only be appreciated by intellectuals and academics. This is not the case. By 'the consummation of all literature' I mean that it employs every style of language, every grand philosophical and theological theme. It unites styles of literature like playscript, monologue, soliloquoy, poetry, melodrama, fantasy, heroic, symbolism and makes use of all literary devices: bathos, puns, litotes, dramatic irony, hyperbole - fusing them not only into a story but into an Odyssey. It is the heroic storyteller's heroic story. It's context - modernism - is transcended and becomes what one would hesitatingly refer to now as Postmodern. By that rather glib statement I mean it uses all these disparate themes and unites them via the central character, Leopold Bloom. Leopold is the Modernist man - the manifold fragmented man who asserts a new identity by unification of his 'hundred thousand flaws'. Virginia Woolf tried to demostrate this in Mrs Dalloway by allowing no chapter breaks in her exploration of the semi-autobiographical heroine and thus totalising the sum of experiences. Where Joyce succeeds over Woolf is that he explores not only the totalisation but the totalisation of all relevant parallel events. Like a theorist of chaos, he explores the detail that affects the major life-forces and struggles. The parallel to Homer's Odyssey is emphasised by making the hero's journey so incredibly anodine on the one hand and so completely heroic on the other. Using the Homeric myth of Cyclops, Joyce explores the prevalence of anti-semitism, the Irish religious conflict, the pettiness of argument and theological truths in but one scene. Joyce's work is a classic, not in the way that Finnegan's Wake is - which explores the actuality of language, the song of words and music , but by taking a life in a day and writing about lives themselves and the world they inhabit. It sounds extremely pretentious to say it is the consummation of all literature, but no other book thus far, in my experience, comes even close nor attempts to tackle so much of what Joyce achieves. It is not only that Joyce sees a world in a grain of sand he sees, more importantly, the grains of sand in the world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I have a number of quibles about what Random House/Modern Libary put on their 100 best list, I had no problem at all with what they put first. If I had to pick one book as the best book of the century, it would by Joyce's Ulysses. It's a book I first read about 25 years ago and have returned to it every couple of years since.Ulysses is a rich, complex book that works on many levels. Most people tend to focus on its experimental prose, which Joyce used to both explore his characters and to widen the scope of his novel. But, beneath all of this, Ulysses is a novel of character, a profound look at the human condition. The book experimentation works because it is grounded on the story of Leopold Bloom, who is fundamentally a decent, likeable man. It's also the story of Stephen Daedalus, who, while somewhat of a prig, is a very intersting person, whose thoughts and ideas are exciting to follow.The more I think about it, the more I think that it'll soon be time to read Ulysses yet again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily one of the greatest English-language books ever written. It is certainly not &quot;about nothing&quot;--those that say so are talking about its lack of a standard plot. It's about the relationships people build with one another. Look at the relationships depicted: Bloom's love for Molly despite her infidelity, Molly's love for Bloom despite the infidelity she percieves, Molly's purely sexual love for Boylan, Bloom's fatherly love for Stephen, Stephen's constant searching for paternal influence, etc, etc. Joyce examines in minute detail each one of these and allows the reader to come to his own conclusions about the characters and their feelings.It _is_ a difficult book. Stick through it; it's worthwhile. For me, it really started to come together around &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; (chapter 14). After &quot;Ithaca&quot; (ch. 17) I felt like I'd known Bloom all my life. And &quot;Penelope&quot; (ch. 18) is remarkable not for what it reveals about Molly, but for what it reveals about Bloom.If you didn't get anything out of _Ulysses_, you didn't read it carefully enough. I suspect many people pick it up without knowning anything about it, and I further suspect that many people who read it for a university course are only skimming it for essay topics (of which there are plenty). Get something like &quot;The Bloomsday Book&quot; to help you through it, read something about the book before you start to read it, read it carefully, and read it more than once. That's the only way you can get everything out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, &quot;Ulysses,&quot; we are told, is a work of genius; yes, it is multi-faceted and pregnant with meaning; true, it may even be a compendium of all Western Culture since Homer. But, let's be honest: It's as fun as reading a telephone directory! One risks opening oneself up to the assaults of the junior college-educated parrot, who gleefully repeats what &quot;wisdom&quot; was imparted to him by his talentless and blustering English instructor. But for those of us not interested in posturing; that is to say, for those of us who actually read Mr. Joyce's work--yes, every last page! (and not at the behest of some school-drudge)--we can risk dispensing with the bombast and dogma to whisper our opinions in a voice sharpened with an edge of honesty. &quot;Ulysses,&quot; such as it is, is a bore. Few unread novels have enjoyed as much success. Such fame rests chiefly, however, on the fact that it is usually not touched . . . which, even if it were, it would reveal itself to be wholly incomprehensible--thus allowing any pseudo-intellectual halfwit to attach any meaning to it that he wishes. The truth, though? &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a satire--and a very tedious one--of Homer's wonderful Odyssey. But Homer's work is actually readable and entertaining! Sad, considering that the ancient Hellene is several thousand years removed from us and yet still has the power to spin a fascinating story. Joyce, however, has created--nothing! He borrows, he steals, he imitates . . . badly. For a true original; for a man of genius and an author who can actually write his own plots; one should look no further than Homer. Joyce? He's a pedant and an over-rated, long-winded bore."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say \\"I READ IT\\". I live in the boonies of SE Oklahoma where there's not a soul who has heard of Joyce much less care whether anyone has read him or not. So, reader of Amazon's reviews, you're my (un)lucky audience. Not only did I read it, but I have not moved it to my \\"Trade\\" shelf. I want it as a reminder of how damned goofy I can be.If you are reading this because you are wondering whether to read it or not, then the answer is that you probably won't \\"get it\\" any more than I did.

Danis Rose's decisions to normalize punctuation and spelling, to make intrusions into Joyce's prose on the basis of his own criteria of syntactic and semantic coherence rather than on textual evidence, and to re-insert apostrophes into Penelope (although he prints an alternate version of the chapter in an appendix) are only barely justifiable in terms of his own theory of editing -- and entirely alien to the &quot;normal&quot; practices of scholarly textual critics. This is quite a shame, because some of Rose's work on the manuscript evidence (as it is described in his introduction, quite interesting in itself) might potentially be of great importance to the textual study of *Ulysses*. Without an apparatus criticus, however, no one can tell for sure. Although (as Rose himself points out) there is and can be no absolutely &quot;definitive&quot; *Ulysses*, there are better places to start. Read Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition, keeping in mind its limitations (or, if you want a student's edition with good notes in the volume, use the reprint of the 1922 first edition, edited by Jeri Johnson for OUP, taking care to check out some of the more important alternate readings in Gabler's text). For those interested, a forthcoming issue of *James Joyce Quarterly* will include extensive discussion of Rose's edition and its merits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think Jonathan Franzen had it about right when he compared Ulysses to a great, Old World Cathedral packed full of iconography. Tourists wander in, snuffle about, pick up the odd snippet that they find aesthetically pleasing without ever coming close to comprehending the depth of the whole thing; then there are the fanatics who consult with the priestly critics who can comprehend its mysteries. On top of this the state certifies the thing as great art (Ulysses is a huge national institution in Ireland - it has spawned a great Joyce industry (even though he lived most of his life as an exile from Ireland) and the 100th anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set was marked by native Dubliners parading round the streets in stockings and boaters).Ulysses is a hugely difficult book (though not as bad as the impossible Finnegan's Wake), made doubly so by the fact that it is so reader unfriendly. I suspect most people read Ulysses because they have heard it is the ultimate literary challenge, plough through it with some difficulty, skimming large parts, picking up the odd stylistic triumph that keeps them going, then breathe a huge sigh of relief when they have finished it.If you still insist on reading Ulysses, I recommend 'The New Bloomsday Book' by Harry Blamires which offers a page by page readers guide to the book's contents. But really, unless you devote months of scholarship and read a multitude of supplementary texts, you won't fully grasp what is really going on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This version is NOT annotated, in spite of the claim. The book itself is of course a classic of literature in the English language...but do not expect any annotations (and this is a book which would be much helped by annotations)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is in the eyes of most literary critics the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and a major addition to the Western literary Tradition. So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environs"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I run these Donal Donnely disks continually just for the sheer joy of the language. This story, as any IRish tale, is from an oral tradition untamed by the printed word. It must be heard and sung, just as John Jameson and sons must be sniffed and savored, rather than read. Each sentence and paragraph (especially in the Cyclops section) requires a different narrative voice, which Donal does masterfully, even the \\"suppressed rancor\\" of the dog's poem requesting a dish of water!I find the disk nineteen the most important point for understanding the message and and meaning of this great misunderstand novel. Please supplement with Schwarz's Reading Joyce's Ulysses, Sicari's Joyce's Modernist Allegory, Joseph Campbell, and even the Annotated Ulysses for a too-real explanation of people and places. But by this disk set alone you know the novel.Continual rehearing drops pearls of comprehension and connection in the most unexpected ways and places.

The book itself is one of the most amazing literary achievments, but if you haven't read any Joyce before, I suggest you read A Portrait of The Artist As a Young Man first to get a feal for the style and Joyce's writting. This a very long book (933 pages-the introduction is around 50) but I can almost gaurentee you will find something you absolutley love in the book unless you didn't understand it at all. Well if you do finishing reading this and want more of the same style of book, try to read Gravity's rainbow, but take a pen and paper so you can take notes on the more then 400 characters so you'll remember them near the end of the book, and also try to pay attention to who is narrating because of the constant and occasionally abrupt changes from character to character.

As for the music, it is masterful and never intrusive or pretentious. Yes, even this oral rendition is enhanced by a gloss, whether the one included in the set or a separate rendition (the one I used was James Heffernan's lectures, also on CDs, from the Teaching Company).

That's right. All of them.First of all, the ones that accuse Ulysses of being a load of gibberish and a sluggish read. They're right. However, Ulysses is not meant to be a pure pleasure read. It's meant to be studied. I read a lot, and before Ulysses, the longest a book had ever taken me was two weeks. Ulysses took me two months. I did it as a part of my AP English project, and tackled it AFTER I had read Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and sections of Richard Ellmann's biography. Even then, I kept Ulysses and Annotated and the Cliffs Notes close by my side.There are many parts of Ulysses that don't make sense. But the parts that do are brilliant. Joyce was a true genius, and if you take the time to studdy his work, you will be blown alway by his mastery of the English language, and his understanding of human nature. I hope to become a writer someday, and reading Ulysses has totally changed my outlook in writing and life.I would be lying if I said I enjoyed Ulysses all the way through.

Scholars take note--Faulkner never read this book!Space prevents me from gushing the way I would like to, but look for the passage in which Stephen Dedalus and Poldy Bloom are getting blasted in Dublin as a baby is being born above them, and Joyce's language begins with the Angleish of Beowulf and travels through time, touching downe with Chaucer and Sir Thomas Browne, among others.

There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it.

In high school I purchased the volume because that is what readers did. Purchasing the book, however, is about all the good I got out of it back then. I don't think I even made it into Part II without giving up. So, naturally, a book likeJames Joyce's Ulysses: A Studyprofited my younger self infinitely more so than the novel it purported to study. That is because, without even having read the book, I could speak somewhat intelligently on the novel and also make ridiculously absurd remarks about its place in the \\"modernist project.\\" As you can imagine, I was invited to a lot of parties.Years passed, a Modern Library list of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century was issued, and Ulysses remained unread on my bookshelf. During my undergraduate studies, and I use the term \\"studies\\" in its most liberal application, I enrolled in a James Joyce course. I read it and I hated it. Now, in an attempt to read through the Modern Library's list, I have read it again. I am still convinced that it is not a great book.Ulysses is not a great book for many different reasons. First is its notorious and intentional difficulty. Joyce himself once commented on the book that he had \\"put so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.\\" And this is the problem. Joyce has forced so much meaning into the text so as to render it meaningless. Indeed, reading Ulysses is more academic exercise than pleasurable literary experience. Literature, at its core, is an attempt at human communication and what we have here is a failure to communicate. Few average readers are willing or able to invest the time and effort necessary to read and understand a novel whose explicit goal it is to confuse professional scholars.The difficulty of the book extends beyond the themes, symbols, and structure and into the very language employed to tell the story. If only Joyce had adopted - as Biddy the Clip describes Stephen Dedalus' language in the Circe chapter - a \\"marked refinement of phraseology,\\" then perhaps the novel wouldn't be so bad. Instead the book is strewn about with an infuriating amount of useless and obscure language. This opacity has spawned a cottage industry of explanatory texts. But this is a novel, not an excursion into unknown territory. We shouldn't need maps. In the end the language of Ulysses will limit it to a very select readership, namely those interested in convincing others of their sophistication and intellectual powers (you know, people like me). It will never enjoy popular readership. I am reminded here of the quaker librarian's warning from the Scylla and Charybdis chapter where he comments that, \\"the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\"I offer that the book fails in two more respects. First, it fails in its stylistic ambitions. The book is perhaps best known for its stream-of-consciousness innovations. This narrative technique is an effort to get inside the head of the characters and to replicate the character's thoughts. For the most part, Joyce fails miserably at this. No one thinks like the characters of Ulysses think. Their thoughts are simply too sporadic, befogged, and preposterously plentiful. These passages may very well be streams-of-unconsciousness, but no one ever had a conscious thought pattern as absurd as those found in Ulysses. The interior monologues of Stephen Dedalus are the worst. Most readers, I imagine, skip them entirely. Readers interested in a proper execution of the stream-of-consciousness technique need look no further than William Faulkner or Virginia Woolf.Secondly, the novel fails in its modernism. If the modern novel is meant to serve as a symbolic manifestation of the confusion and aggravation of modern life, then the book is a wild success. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more confusing and aggravating than reading Ulysses is readingFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin). If, on the other hand, we understand the project of literary modernism to be an articulation of the era's spiritual disillusionment, despair and alienation then we need look no further than the prose of Ernest Hemingway.There is a way to read Ulysses. Read it slowly. This works in two respects. First, part of the charm of the novel, if there is any, is its language. By reading slow you will be able to digest it all. Secondly, if you are polymath and polyglot enough to understand what is going on, you will not miss anything important. Finally, as my undergraduate professor suggested, it helps to recite the book in your mind with a deep Dublin Irish accent. Doing so makes the book at a least a little more entertaining.So why would I offer suggestions about how to read the book if I feel that it's not worth reading? Well, my limited appreciation of the novel is based on its at times brilliant wordplay, its humor and the beauty of the final chapter.Few books provoke authentic LOLs. Ulysses is one of them. The first glimpse of this humor comes from the Hades chapter when Leopold Bloom - the alienated Jew trapped on an island of rabidly anti-Semitic Irish Catholics - ponders the curious rituals of the Roman faith as he and his peers lay to rest poor Paddy Dignam. Mr. Bloom satirizes the ritual prayers over the dead body with his own intonation of, \\"hoping you're well and not in hell.\\" In terms of the book's funny punnery, none is as enjoyable as that found in the conversation between Alf and Joe during the Cyclops chapter when Alf asks who has been making character assassinating allegations against Bloom. Joe replies, \\"I am the alligator.\\" Stephen Dedalus provides the biggest gut buster when, drunk and conversing, he professes that his understanding of brotherly love is reducible to the maxim that, \\"greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\\" Unfortunately, finding such humorous literary gems in Ulysses is like searching for a needle in a pile of donkey poo.Despite my previous distaste for the majority of the novel's language, there are some very pretty sentences in Ulysses. For instance, the shade of a tree becomes \\"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves.\\" On a morning trip to the butcher, Leopold Bloom, relisher of the inner organs of beasts and fowls, watches as \\"the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.\\" Finally, instead of entering the carriage, a character pokes his \\"silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seats himself.\\"Finally, Ulysses endeared itself to me a bit more this time because the final episode, the Penelope chapter, is just so wonderful. This chapter documents the thoughts of a woman - Molly Bloom, wife of Leopold - as she falls asleep. Where elsewhere Joyce fails in composing a convincing stream-of-consciousness, here he is resoundingly successful. Molly Bloom's lazy, floating thoughts fall upon memories of her friends, her lovers (premarital and adulterous), her childhood, her dead son, her living daughter, her desire to blow Stephen Dedalus before finally and beautifully coming to rest upon (yes) her husband who has literally just kissed her ass. I realize that the prospect of reading a ponderous forty page run-on sentence may not sound like the most palatable literary endeavor. If there is anything that makes Ulysses worth reading, however, it is this chapter.Should you read Ulysses? I don't know. On one hand, it's the greatest novel ever written. Then again, it's certainly one of the worst. If anything, please do not read it on the Kindle. Get a print version. That way you can look really smart when people see you reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, this book is staggeringly difficult. Yes, Joyce was a pompous, self-absorbed, pretentious butthead. Yes, he was a cynic who indulged in bitter ironies. But at the same time Joyce was also a senitmentalist and an idealist, and this magnificient novel is a successful exercise in unadulterated nostalgia. It is humble. It is funny. It is sad. It is vexing. And it contains the most sublime sentences and passages written in the English language: \\"On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.\\" The \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" chapter alone is both dazzling and haunting.

The book, based on the Odyssey, follows a day in the life of the ordinary/extraordinary Leopold Bloom as he wanders through Dublin. There are many historical and literary descriptions and allusions that make that day come alive. Many of the supporting characters, especially Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, are fully realized. The final stream of consciousness passage ends with what I think is a triumphant line.If you want to tackle this book, take your time and think."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce (1882-1941) was a tormented Roman Catholic who forsook his faith, picked up his pen and wrote the great novel \\"Ulysses\\" based on the epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer. It is impossible to explain Ulysses or give it an adequate review in the short space alloted this reviewer. Howwver, I would offer the following thoughts for those brave souls eager to enter the labyrinthal complexities of a genius's mind:Joyce tells the story of one day in the life of the people of Dublin, Ireland on June 16, 1904 (the day he first met his wife Nora Baracle). As he does so in eighteen chapters linked with similar episodes in \\"The Odyssey.\\" During the day (about 900 pages) we follow the two chief characters on their peregrinations and adventures. Those characters are:Stephen Dedalus-Named for the Greek mytholgical figure Dedalus who builds wings to fly in the sky; his son Icarus flies too close to the sun and perishes while Dedalus lands in Sicily. Stephen was the chief character in Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" He is tormented by his failure to pray at his dying mother's bedside; tormented by the Roman Catholic Church's burden of guilt laid upon his soul. Stephen is an aspiring author. He is ambivalent in his feelings toward his native Ireland. As the novel begins he is living in the English built castleThe Martello Tower along with his friend Buck Mulligan and an Englishman named Haines. Stephen is a teacher who is supervised by the horrible Deasy a West Englishman who in an Orange Protestant. Deasy is a false Nestor to the callow Stephen. Stephen is an intellectual with biographical correspondence to the author James Joyce.Leopold Bloom-A 38 year old advertising man who is married to the sensuous Molly. Bloom is a middlebrow who roams the streets of Dublin plying his advertising career engaging in arguments, dreaming about a sexy young thing on the beach and saving Stephen from trouble in the famous Nighttime section of the book. Leopold does not practice his Judaism. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. The novel ends with Bloom returning home to his unfaithful wife Molly just as Odysseus returned home to his faithful wife Penelope in the Homeric epic. Bloomsday is celebrated worldwide on Feb. 2 each year (the date of Joyce's birth in 1882).c. Molly Bloom-Her nearly fifty pages of stream of consciousness prose was until recently the longest sentence in the English language. She is a coarse, bawdy, serially cheating wife to Bloom.I do not claim to understand everything going on in Ulysses. Joyce said it would take the professors and critics centuries to explore its rich minefield of literary allusions, jokes, and analysis of the human condition. Ulysses has been banned and blasted by literary critics as the same time it has been praised. You may find out yourself by giving it a close reading with a good commentary handy. Joyce plums the depths of the human mind. He is a great Irish genius whose work demands study."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The best edition of what's considered by many the apotheosis of English fiction. As mentioned in the front matter, \\"this book reproduces, as closely as offset printing will allow, Roger Lathbury's copy of the first edition of Ulysses published by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company in Paris in 1922. Broken type, signature numbers, and the colophon have been left as printed.\\" Editorial slip-ups are therefore obviously included, adding a quaint historical nuance.The perfect gift for any fan of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, this edition is elegant, a pleasure to hold and read, and ideal for anyone new to and wishing to appreciate Ulysses. (Most mass market editions, while well edited, are otherwise cheap products.)Two outstanding aids for appreciating Ulysses areWings of Art: Joseph Campbell on James Joyce, and Stuart Gilbert'sJames Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"i have been waiting for kidd to release his corrections to the 'corrected' editon of ulysses for nigh on 17 years now. amazon, god bless its heart (i guess corporations have hearts now that they're real people), gives kidd's future book a listing here and therefore a way for me to keep track of it. and if kidd ever actually gets it published i can preorder.professor kidd, i beg you, please put out your edition of this classic, and bury gabler once and for all."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Reading Ulysses is a different experience for everyone. One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and now Ulysses. One apparent source of the joy of reading these for me is that all of the characters are good, sympathetic people, even when they do petty things. It is a world full of light and air, humor and optimism. Stephen Dedalus, Buck Mulligan, Leopold and Molly Bloom and all the rest are more-or-less normal humans living normal lives even though somewhat oppressed by poverty, the Church, and the English, and of course themselves. Ulysses has none of the violence, darkness, ugliness, cynicism, villiany, and perversion that is found in so much of modern literature. The most dramatic and upsetting thing that happens is when Stephen gets his hand whacked in school (in Portrait). Even Stephen's alchoholic irresponsible father is painted somewhat empathetically.The events in Ulysses are so prosaic and quotidian that Joyce had to dress up his work with high-fallutin prose and verbal pyrotechnics. Otherwise the work would just be too bland. The reader can skate over most of the obscure rambling parts or go back and endlessly ponder them. I ignore most of the references, and I'm not too taken with the Homeric and Biblical symbolism. The book can be read on many different levels. I admit I loved it--but I would recommend reading Dubliners and Portrait first. I would also recommend visiting Dublin if you can swing it, and especially Howth, which figures prominently in Ulysses. Howth is a charming village and vast, dramatic, wild, high headland with sweeping views of the Irish Sea, Bailey Lighthouse way below, and Dublin city center in the distance--all within the city limits of Dublin. Last stop north on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, they way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why haven't you read this book? There are two types of people in the world: those who love _Ulysses_ and those who despise it. It always astonishes me the degree to which some people loathe this book. One of my very best friends cannot read past an early description of the sea as \\"snot-green.\\" Go figure. Joyce challeneges our notions about the ordinary. The ordinary is not always beautiful. It is not always remarkable. But seen through the life of one ordinary man, a single day is an epic, albeit an ordinary one. And what's so wrong with that?Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus are perhaps the most intriguing characters in 20th Century art. They are opposites of a sort. Bloom is an everyman, Daedelus wants to be the Ubermensch, but he is far too Gallic. Bloom (the Hungarian Jew - anything but Gallic) triumphs in his epic, this day in Dublin. Stephen, well, he doesn't quite triumph. There are lessons here that one can explore for eons. Why is Bloom successful in his odyssey? Why isn't Stephen? Stephen is trapped in emerging Gallic existentialism, dark, \\"sinister\\" as Buck Mulligan describes it. Bloom is, well...Bloom. He is the good kind of existential...the Teutonic rather than Gallic.Read this book, for God's sakes. Don't take my word for it. Love it, hate it, I don't care.

Here there is way too much information when all the reader wants is to solve the plot and find out what happens.

Compared with Finnegans Wake, for instance, it's a cake walk. The book's most frustrating part comes early on, after Stephen leaves his Uncle Richie's house. From here on out, a dictionary (preferably a comprehensive one) becomes invaluable. In my opinion, a good deal of the confusion surrounding Ulysses has arisen out of the fact that most people, upon encountering a word that they do not understand, choose to merely carry on in confusion, as opposed to looking the word up. You would be shocked at how instantly comprehensible this book becomes once a dictionary is employed. Since this book was written as a sort of mock-heroic counterpoint to the Homeric poems, a knowledge of those literary works is also very useful for any competent appreciation of Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All I can say after finally finishing Ulysses is that it deserves its reputation - both of them. Yes, it is a masterpiece - and, yes, it is a difficult, at times seemingly impenetratable read. When I finished reading this book and finally closed it, I felt I had accomplished a monumental deed. This is the only book I've ever read - and I've read many (difficult ones, too) - that was an actual physical chore to read. One reviewer mentioned that reading it is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest - many people start it, but few make it to the summit - and, ridicilous as that sounds, it is true, in a way. I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this book (that's arguably impossible, anyway), or summarize the plot, or anything like that - there is no plot. Small review forums limited to 1,000 words such as this one is not the place for a detailed dissertation on a book as profound, monumental, and important as Ulysses - doctoral thesises and 100,000 word essays have been written for that purpose by people far more qualified than I. It is not difficult, but impossible to summarize Ulysses: it must read in full. I have done so - it wasn't easy, but I did it. I read Joyce's A Portrait of The Artist As A Young Man first (which I highly reccommend you do also), although I didn't use any annotation or Cliff's Notes, or anything like that. I have no doubt that many of the book's complexities, metaphors, allusions, and ancedotes were lost on me, but I wanted to read the book on my own first. I don't claim total comprehension of his vast and difficult masterpiece; I fully admit that there are many parts of the book that I did not understand. This is no reason to slander the book, as many have ignorantly done. I did enjoy reading the book, however - and felt great joy and a sense of accomplishment upon on reading it - and yes, it IS a masterpiece, and for this reason: this is one of the few, if not the only book(s) ever written that accurately and realistically depicts real life. There is no plot, there is no \\"story\\" - there is certainly no moral. What this book (I believe) attempts to do - and does - is to portray life in a fictional setting - real life. This book takes two normal people, and describes their day. The cross paths at times - intersect, ramble, and collide - and this book, basically, just shows a normal day in the life of two normal people. This may not sound exciting - it isn't. It may sound boring - it often is. Imagine if you wrote down in a book every single event of your day in pain-staking detail (and there are parts in thsi book where Joyce goes into such detail as to border on mundanity, despite its ultra realism.) Still, it is a brilliant and ingenious literary device - surprisignly unattemped before - and carried off marvelously well here. This book addresses the normal, everyday things that other books always cease to mention: defecation, masturbation, rambling thoughts inside a person's head. Like Portrait, this book contains no quotation marks. All dialogue is written as it is personally experienced by the character; I know no other writer besides Joyce who writes - both dialogue and narraration - from INSIDE the character: you actually feel what it's like to walk around inside a person's head, rather than just witnessing his external actions, like every other book in the world. Ulysses, though a long and difficult read (especially if one chooses to study it), is ultimately rewarding, and I reccommend tackling it to anyone who reads with an open mind. It is a masterpiece, and it is, indeed, the true last word on realism."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A blasphemous, vulgar and sexual book about the lives of sots in Ireland written by a Shakespeare-variety wordsmith. At first glance, it sounds too good to be true. The catch...An extremely comprehensive plot summary for each chapter will only take about 25 words. That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that. I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading the dictionary, but have not heard in life. Finding those words in print is worth reading the 700+ pages.As a smattering of the jewels of perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the book. If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest. Enjoy!1. Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily News.2. Love loves to love love.3. Q. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner...? A. Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.4. Q. What in water did Bloom ... admire? A. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level ... [Insert 30 more things about water] ... the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Those who attack Joyce and this book today are like the people who attack Einstein and his theory of relativity simply because they're to addled to understand the chaos and unity behind the mathematical symbols. In my experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn to grow."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are no notes in this book.

I really appreciated it! Merry Christmas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A masterpiece? Yes, no doubt about it, yes, it is a masterpiece, yes!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" is endowed with Aristotelian unity of space: it all happens in Dublin, and God knows, it helps if you know your way around that city. Unity of time as well, it all happens in a 24-hour period starting on the morning of Thursday, June 16, 1904, and God knows it helps if you know the headlines of Dublin newspapers for that day. It even has unity of action, whatever there is of that ingredient in this novel. It all revolves around the current adulterous affair of Molly Bloom with the vulgar Blazes Boylan, and the preparation of her next adultery with intensely intellectual Stephen Dedalus, whose father Simon had also been her lover at some point. There seem to be three main characters: Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and the young \\"bard\\" Stephen Dedalus, alias Joyce himself. It is amusing that Joyce repeatedly keeps referring to Stephen Dedalus, his alter ego, as a bard, a title reserved these days for William Shakespeare. This seems to signal Joyce's conviction that he belongs to a very exclusive club with the bard of Stratford upon Avon as its only other member.Beyond these three \\"main\\" characters, there are literally hundreds of other characters whose names and even their Dublin addresses are mentioned and oft-repeated. You might think, I wrecked your whole pleasure in reading this book, by giving away these spoilers. You need not worry, as things are not what they seem to be. The true main character of the novel is none of the above, but rather the English language, of which Joyce has a command second to none, with the possible exception of the bard of Stratford upon Avon. I wouldn't be surprised if Joyce's vocabulary had weighed in at twice or maybe even thrice that of the typical educated reader, and not for a minute does he let you forget this fact. Why?Why? Well, the book has a clear anti-British slant, and Joyce is rubbing it in to the Brits, that it takes an Irish genius like himself, to show them what can be done with their language. He also feels free to distort the King's English, and by extremely clever alliterations, homophonies, misspellings and lists he manages to poke quite cruel fun at the tool he wields with such virtuosity. He casts Irish art in the role of \\"cracked lookingglass of a servant.\\"I just mentioned lists, and God knows, there are so many in this book, some of full-page length. The whole novel reads like a veritable prose-poem. Think but of the Joycean line \\"A veil awave upon the waves.\\" In many places Joyce lapses into actual poems, most marvelously that \\"Ballad of the Joking Jesus\\" (supposedly borrowed in an abridged and altered form from his estranged friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for the Buck Mulligan character in \\"Ulysses.\\") the first two lines of which I cannot resist writing down here,I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heardMy mother's a Jew, my father's a bird.In the next two lines he refers negatively to \\"Joseph the Joiner\\" and one cannot miss the sharing of James Joyce's own initials with both those of the Divine Joking Jesus and of His holy mother's sainted husband.Along Leopold Bloom's Dublin wanderings deep issues are addressed: the dynamics of anti-Semitism, the difference between male and female sexuality, the patterns of married life, among others. In the latter context, a whole chapter is devoted to an extremely original, if far from provably correct analysis of William Shakespeare's marriage to Ann Hathaway. What is remarkable is that this analysis manages to shed light also on the problems in the Bloom marriage, with Leopold Bloom taking a different and much more forgiving attitude toward his wife's adultery than the bard.When dealing with sexuality, Joyce, in a serious novel written a mere decade after the Victorian age, does not shy away from the use of four-letter words, the detailed description of masturbation and of passionate intercourse, and quite some space is devoted to bodily functions. Indeed a crucial scene in the penultimate (\\"Ithaca\\") chapter ends with Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus sealing their friendship by the quite homoerotic act of urinating together in the garden.Finally, maybe the most important influence this novel has had on modern literature is at the stylistic level. There can be little doubt that Vladimir Nabokov's exotic, if always so marvelously correct, word-choices owe a big debt to Joyce. The title character of one of Saul Bellow's famous novels shares the name of the minor character Moses Herzog in \\"Ulysses.\\" In \\"Ulysses\\" each chapter is written in a different style, here a romantic novel, there a tabloid newspaper, there a serious newspaper, now a play, then an unpunctuated stream of consciousness and so on. In \\"Herzog,\\" Bellow also mixes a basic narrative with the epistolary style of the letters despondent Herzog dispatches to all kinds of live and dead world leaders. The word \\"snot-green\\" invented by Buck Mulligan to describe the color of the Irish sea in the first chapter of \\"Ulysses\\" has made a comeback in twenty-first century novels, not to speak even of the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual scenes in serious modern fiction. To a certain extent, even the deeply moving poetic style of Tennessee Williams' marvelous plays seems indebted to a certain extent to Joyce.Above all, the stream of consciousness narration, which traces the free flow of the characters' thoughts rather than of their actions, has become a standard in modern fiction. Between the unexpected turns of these thoughts and the beauty of Joyce's use of the English language, one remains glued to \\"Ulysses\\" through its almost eight hundred pages, much as one would if he had spiced the story with all the trappings of a first rate thriller.As a practical piece of advice, use as I did a paperback edition, and tear it into some ten fascicles of seventy-eighty pages each. This way you can enjoy one of the major masterpieces of twentieth century literature without risking a hernia and/or a carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible.

Disintegration of experience,integration of form.The theme and structure borrowed from Homer's Odyssey are a metaphor for Joyce's dream of Ireland's journey from a 'priest-ridden' backwater to a country taking its rightful place in the European intellectual and philosophical tradition.Joyce is the most cosmopolitan modern writer. Joyce's poetry is minor if charming,his drama doesn't work,his poetry works best in the comic framework of the prose novel.Style ceases to be a relationship between author and reader,instead becoming a relationship of a magical kind between author and object.Experience is replaced by prose.Joyce was a Flaubertian realist infected by the bacillus of modernism, following The Dubliners,he wrote Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, calling his hero Stephen Dedalus,connecting the contemporary character with the mythical artificer:there are two movements,one outward from Ireland the other downward into myth. Superficially Stephen is dissociating himself,on a deeper level achieving an association with myth.This led onto the systematization of Ulysses,with the mystification that followed in its wake.Too systematized Joyce asked?All Joyce's works have a strong autobiographical element.Ulysses was preceded by the play Exiles.An Irish writer,Richard Rowan believes his wife is playing him false with a former friend/disciple.Rowan finds himself in a tragic position regarding his mother,a pious Catholic.The theme is autobiographical.A onetime friend in 1909 claimed that when Joyce was courting Nora,she had shared her favours with himself.Rowan reveals that he himself longs for his own deception,deliberately making himself a party to it.Rowan identifies with Christ and looks for Judases amongst his friends.Very Joycean.Nora thought he encouraged her to go with other men.This play is the real basis for Ulysses,with the part of Richard Rowan divided between Stephen Dedalus,haunted by his dead mother,and Bloom,haunted by the idea of his wife's infidelity.They are the same person and may be regarded as a man young and old or two aspects of the same man.The subject of the book is the attempt to reconcile them.They pass,they skirt one another all day,but it is only at night that they meet.Each chapter is written in a different style,the names given to these styles is metaphorical,each metaphor sustained by puns.For Joyce all thought arises from the unconscious and returns to it.We need to read Ulysses by a process of free association.The opening chapters of Ulysses are the highest development of Joyce's peculiar genius, for this lay with the habitual,the normal,the everyday,and his interest and observation were sustained by an elaborate system of analogy.But analogy will not permit of growth and development,these have to be foisted artificially onto the book,and as it approaches a crisis,it becomes bogged in tortuous technical devices,like the chapter of the lying -in hospital where the development of the embryo is illustrated by the development of English prose.The problem is it reduces man to dissociated metaphor.Humanity explodes like an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since this book contains no chapters, it's very hard to index; Buki editions did a great job putting it together and making navigation a breeze."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From start to finish, Mr. Joyce dazzles the reader with the use of symbolism, dark humor, semantic puzzles, riddles, irony, grace, and magic. A shaman of the modern age, Joyce imbues his massive tome with word-remedies for the chronically sick and desperate--the very people who inhabit his 'dear dirty Dublin'. With Ulysees, Joyce marked himself as one of the major writers of his age...of any age!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of my very favorite books. Even though I've read the novel many times, I'm not qualified to compare this new edition to its predecessors: I'm a commercial artist, not a literary scholar. I AM qualified, however, to complain about how badly produced this book is. Professor Rose refers in his intro to the important influence that editors, designers and printers have on a text. Careful analysis of those influences are the basis of the method he used to create this new edition. Well, too bad he wasn't able to influence the publisher. This edition of Ulysses is printed on very cheap paper -- the kind of dim gray brittle stuff that the cheapest of romance fiction is printed on. Fine for a book that will be read once, but terrible for a &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; of a classic that will be reread and annotated. These pages will be badly discolored in a few years. The typography is mediocre, too: the title page looks like the Bad Example in any design textbook. The newspaper-style headlines in the &quot;Aeolus&quot; chapter are barely readable -- of course the ink spread on that awful paper doesn't help. If you read this, Professor Rose, I'm sorry your efforts were presented so poorly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"(This was written in response to the Gabler edition of the text, but the website has it crossposted to all editions of _Ulysses_. So ignore this unless you're looking at the page for the Gabler \\"Corrected Text\\" edition.)This is a review not of Joyce's masterpiece but of the Gabler edition. Gabler's \\"corrected text\\" is an appalling defacement of a classic book; it should not be used. For an excellent account of Gabler's edition--of the legal reasons for its extensive modifications of the text, of the dubious textual methods employed, of the subsequent scholarly controversy--read Bruce Arnold's excellent little book _The Scandal of Ulysses_. Joyce's book has now twice in recent years been messed around with by dubiously-motivated editors--more recently, the \\"Reader's Edition\\" that was the subject of a wrangle in court to suppress it--which is an absurd indignity to be visited on one of the touchstones of 20th-century fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great genius, granted, but what he did with his genius is something that doesn't appeal to me. Dangling the snotgreen stuff at the beginning of the book is not what I would call an inviting beginning. Yes, it's a marvel of writing, but I do not like what it is being marvelous about, or at. It's like a beautiful women who farts a lot but doesn't give a damn, because she knows her bosoms are so fetching. Well, fetching bosoms can take a woman only so far, just as fetching writing-- even a genius's writing-- can take a book so far. (IMHO). So yes, I like Joyce's writing's beauty and I like its fetching sensations, but I do not like his artistic manners and I do not like the liberties he takes with my attention-- which he sure knows how to catch, but so what. So can Flaubert (a greater writer, imho), and so can Proust (almost ditto).With all that out of the way I'll not-grudgingly say you probably have to read Ulysses, because, first, it sits like a dead weight in the midst of modern writing, and, second (if you are a writer), so you could steal some of Joyce's marvelous writing technique. But I would not read him more than once.AM"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Probably every avid reader feels compelled at some time in life to read \\"Ulysses\\", especially as it was voted the best work of fiction of the 20th century at the turn of this millenium.The style of writing throughout the book is usually referred to as \\"stream of consciousness\\". This method has been subsequently employed in other works such as \\"To The Lighthouse\\" and \\"The sound and the Fury\\". However, in my opinion, these latter two works used the style much more succesfully than Joyce.If you are currently reading \\"Ulysses\\" at the moment, expect a very patchy book. The second half is , in general, better than the first half, with the two penultimate chapters \\"Cabman's shelter\\" and \\"Ithaca\\" standing out from the rest. After that, the description of birth in \\"Oxen in the sun\\" is also excellent , as is the part dsecribing Paddy Dignam's funeral early in the book. As to the rest of the book, I believe there is little to recommend it.Opinion tends to be polarized about \\"Ulysses\\" . Its severest critics suggest that it is only praised by those who are scared to be criticized for not understanding the book, a sort of \\"emperor's new clothes\\" scenario. There is, however, more than a grain of truth in this opinion. It does seem incredible that a book with so much \\"padding\\" could be so highly thought of. It might have made a very good book of around 200 pages, but one does have the sensation that Joyce is taking his readers for a ride in many parts. ( Of course, his ultimate send up of his readers was \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"! ). Furthermore, the much lauded sense of humour is overblown. At best, this is a mildly amusing book with one or two laugh out loud lines. To label it as \\"very funny\\" is pretentiousness itself. Most of the humour is also of the \\"toilet\\" variety.On the positive side, there are some interesting passages as mentioned above. However, the main interest lies in seeing this new attempt at a style of writing , and to try to fathom out why this book has become the \\"darling\\" of the ( maybe \\"so-called\\" ) intellectuals. If you want to see a better example of joyce's talents, try \\"Potrait Of The Artist As A Young Man\\", or even \\"The Dubliners\\"."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Neither of us was able to get through this tome. For me, it had nothing to do with it being a difficult read; I simply was not rewarded enough to continue.

Read Faulkner or Reinaldo Arenas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses will get you, if you give it enough of a chance. The first time you read it, it will be difficult - maybe even impossible. The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905. Then go to the beginning, or wherever you left off if you prefer, and start again. If not now, then someday - maybe years from now - but do it. And then do it again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"They list and in the porch of their ears I pour...I mean who writes lines like that?? So here's my explication/review:Ulysses : Political Commentary And SensualityJames Joyce was a famous contributor to the 18th century literary tradition. Nevertheless, Joyce's use of the supernatural is all too often mistaken for social commentary in Ulysses. Below, it will be proven that Ulysses's Surrealist overtones and views on hate are not evidence of Joyce's surrender to love. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Surrealist views of Ulysses's protagonist, Tom Joad, (2) Joyce's triumphant use of satire in the work, and (3) the author's employment of human nature, showing the influence of the the British Modernist school.First, Joyce's male sympathies are evident in Ulysses. To indicate that Ichabod Stephenson is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue simple. Ishmael Maxwell is a famous character for this very reason; it is also meaningful that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of Joyce's Minimalist views--have misinterpreted the character King Adams's role in the book.Furthermore, consider that Ulysses was not so much written by Joyce as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration. Ulysses's use of incest is in keeping with its Constructivist point-of-view. Captain Stephenson is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of Joyce's 18th century influences show through.Last, Ulysses cannot be fully understood without examination of the post Minimalist school of Roman literature. Many teens see the book's closing scene as the most enduring; I, however, do not. Nick Daniel is a witless character for this very reason; this is definitely why One-Eyed Caulfield is such a monumental character.It's easy to forget that Ulysses was the most brilliant work of its time. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found Joyce's use of dystopic future-vision ponderous, history will vindicate Ulysses. Q. E. D. -- Quite easily done.The End"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"So we all know that Ulysses is amazing, best novel of the 20th century. And the Gabler edition is the most accurate version out there.

While the product description indicates the edition is based on the 1984 Gabler edition, the Kindle edition includes a number of errors not present in that text. The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors. Also, in many cases numbers are rendered as letters and visa versa, particularly in the final episode.

Right, then.

I won't pretend to understand this book fully. I won't pretend that I caught all the nounces and themes. The fact is that quite a few chapters were incomprehensible to me, although that had not lessened my enjoyment of the book. I would have to say that the most difficult chapter was \\"Circe\\", which I struggled through like a sapper going through a mine field. Most enjoyable chapters, not to mention hilarious ones were \\"Hades\\" and \\"Cyclops\\". For these two chapters alone, this book is worth reading. Hey, I would read anything that would put me back in Dublin. Joyce's mastery of English language is unparalleled and I think he was an absolute genius with words ( a lot of them indecipherable, as it were, but that's okay).In conclusion, I liked the book quite a lot, and would read it again in ten years or so.

Take a year (or 10 years :-)), only this is a must for anyone who reads.The finest example of literature we have."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Incredibly to us, from our &quot;modern&quot; vantage point, &quot;Ulysses&quot;was at one point suppressed in most of the civilized worldfor its supposedly raunchy sex scenes. Today, we can seethat his fiction worked on much higher levels: his portrayalof sex (and other things) is more inventive than Miller's,more subversive than Mappelthorpe's. Joyce's intention is noless than to create an entire mental universe; his novel isa potent artistic answer to the philosophical question, &quot;Do we really exist?&quot;Leopold Bloom, the hero of the story, is a completelyordinary man; but Joyce's combination of words and theproliferation of cross-connections between the current word andthe next illustrate that there is often little connectionbetween *what* we think and the *words* we think. So Joyceis in effect trying to write a novel without words; he wantsto get into the stream of Bloom's thought directly, withoutpreface or interference.Though most would agree that this is a &quot;difficult&quot; novel --perhaps the first book to attempt to break the limits oflanguage -- it is a must-read. Bring the book on a picnic,along with your dictionary and a lot of time.

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\"So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it \\"gets better\\" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I received a copy of this for Christmas many years ago, but before that I used to have a copy of theUlysses (Gabler Edition)(which is the complete book the way that Joyce would have preferred were it not for censorious typesetters).

Believe it or not, this edition is the bowlderized one...and it still ended up being confiscated due to the Comstock Act! Strange, but true.As a historical document, the Forward is a wonderful reason to buy this version because it says so darned much about the times in which the obscenity trial took place. Just make sure you can get your hands on the Gabler edition as well to compare notes. You'll see what I mean about the difference between the two. But that's only because I'm a Lit nerd.

The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs \\"Mulholland Drive\\" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example \\"Wandering Rocks\\" or \\"Penelope\\". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the \\"Ulysses\\") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce \\"Dubliners\\" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the \\"Ulysses\\", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read \\"Portrait of the Artist\\", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Portrait\\" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and \\"Ulysses\\" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' \\"Miss Delloway\\" and John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of \\"stream of consciousness\\".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The best introduction to James Joyce is James Joyce. He did everything so well he only had to each thing once. One short story collection: Dubliners. And one great novel: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. On the basis of these two works alone Joyce would be legend. But he did not stop there, he went further than anyone had ever gone with literature and wrote a new kind of novel, Ulysses. And after that another new kind of novel, Finnegans Wake. Ulysses is a work which every reader must face once in his life. Or twice. No other novel so sums up the reason novels are written. Ulysses is an epoch about culture but told lyrically through two characters, the familiar Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Both will win you over. Dedalus for his scholars apprenticeship at life, and Bloom for his well versed walk through the very reaches of modern life. Irish this is in the very best sense. The language is real but the words are not coming from everyday talk but from the inside, the waking consciousness' dialogue with itself. That is the magic of this book. It is completely original born from nothing but inspiration. It is a great move to have Stephen, the character from his last novel, collide with Bloom, this new novels creation. Joyce has the teachers good will to introduce you to the new work via an old companion, brilliant stroke. The modern world really makes no sense is Stephens Tragedy and Blooms comedy. If you are a young man you will probably share Stephen's sentiments and if you are beyond youth you will share Bloom's. Or both which makes it all the more wonderful. No book is more insightful in leading to an understanding of the western predicament and no book has yet come close. Joyce writes in a sometimes hard to decipher prose but it is all worth it. In the end you will feel you have collided with the one who understood first what it was to be a modern life. Make it easy on yourself and read this after Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. For the best readers there is no other way. As for Finnegans Wake, I am still preparing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"My discussions about ULYSSES bring out a similar comment from others--no matter how many times we return to the novel, we find something new. This richly rendered piece proves that virtual reality existed long before computers; it required a rich imagination, a good eye for detail, and a finely tuned ear for the music of voices and everyday sound. We find these things in ULYSSES. It deserves the praise it has earned for these many decades."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that can't be ignored if you want to be considered by anyone to be a &quot;serious&quot; reader, but it shouldn't be ignored.

You'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Preface by stating difficulty of full appreciation and fair comment on Ulysses on first reading. One proceeds ungrounded in the various contexts exposed to the author's unique and various styles wherein apparently Joyce attempts creation of reality by limiting his writing to the thoughts and communications of his characters without the crutches of traditional literature. Unknown to me why Joyce chose this particular style, though I speculate he must have wanted to illustrate the irrational nature of the thought process, and perhaps to show off the workings of his own mind. Joyce combines this method with what seems a deliberate effort of obscurity rather than clarity, complexity rather than simplicity, often degenerating into incoherence. He flits about continuously over dozens of subjects within the same page, and most often seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to bring it all together causing frequent head scratchings for the skeptical reader. But in all this is an author so obviously brilliant that you chug on even when hopelessly lost, always expecting the bells to chime and lights to come on. There are many well done scenes, for me--the first chapter of young men bantering, the classroom in chapter 2, poignant expression of husband and wife relations with bloom and molly in the bedroom, and bloom back in bed after a night of carousing; an ending soliloquy that finally puts women in their place, and could that have been done more effectively--all rendered in writing flashing ability equivalent to the all time best. An imperfect book, but as many reviews note, it is a book on so many levels that generalization is impossible. I will appreciate Ulysses for what I believed it was, which is a lighthearted humorous thought provoking exposition in the style of the author of his own significant gifts."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A stylistically sprawling, richly symbolic, discursive fresco, &quot;Ulyssess&quot; remains the one book that has pushed the form of the novel to explorative extremes. Not to be perused at leisure, but to be studied with diligent effort, it will be regarded as a death sentence by the average reader, but for the genuine lover of literature it's a treat. &quot;Ulyssess&quot; is an elephantine, pedantic, sometimes self-indulgent novel. At first reading, one might feel intimidated by it, which is why student guides and annotated editions are so essential. In reality, it's a very touching and candid book and not as bullying as it seems at all, but an encounter with the most familiar and daily incidents, embedded in the intimacies of lived experience. For all his dense allusiveness and linguistic acrobatics, Joyce's message is so simple that it almost seems a commonplace: the human need to love and be loved. At the same time, though it has been proclaimed as possibly the most individual and innovative novel of the century, one will discover that it's neither individual (with its polyphonic multiple registers) nor innovative (with its reliance on mining pop culture, Celtic traditions, literary precedents -- which were already extant). The really innovative novel of this type was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I often compare Joyce to an epoch: The Ancient Greeks (collectively), Shakespeare, and Joyce. These are the masters that produce works whose breadth is overwhelming. It is a shame, on the one hand, that a mind such as Joyce's only surfaces every few hundred years. However, it is fortunate (especially for Literature majors and graduate students) that the frequency is so minimal. When I first read Ulysses, I had prepared myself with years of literary training and hours upon hours of reading. The first impression was numbing yet inspiring. In the aftermath of having read the work, I find myself reflecting back upon this work more than any other (this is saying quite a bit coming from a student of American literature). Be prepared with numerous secondary sources, including Ellmann's biography, and expect nothing short of extraordinary for this is one work a reader can never overestimate and one can never relive the first encounter with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, OK, it's always easy to say you don't like something (therefore, you are better than that particular work of art) Having recently arrive from Dublin, the Ulyses experience is understood different: now I can see why Life can happen in just one day.

It is an adventure for the mind. The reader is taken to a journey through the minds of three everyday individuals and discovers hidden thoughts, desires and guilts. It is not an easy journey though, as the reader is confronted with obstacles that challenges one's own intelligence and understanding of the story. The book is written in several different ways which will confuse the reader. I feel that when James Joyce wrote the book, he wanted to go beyond just writing a regular novel. He wanted to show us the true nature of the mind the way it really is in a variety of forms. I must say that is was very hard for me to get through the book at times and so I used the cliffs notes to help me. All the characters are excellent and some of them remind me of people I know. It is a book I will read over and over again with great pleasure. I have read many other books and this is one of my favorites. I found it funny how many people were complaining about how difficult it was and how Joyce was wrong in writing it the way he did. I don't see a problem with it. Ulysses wouldn't be great if it was written in any other form. I'm just a normal teenager who simply became interested in Joyce. If I could get through the book alive, anyone can. So for those of you who are complaining, quit crying and reread the book if you didn't understand it !. Its as simple as that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How does one attempt a review of this novel? As other people have expressed, adjectives like &quot;dense&quot;, &quot;complicated&quot;, or &quot;inscrutable&quot; do not begin to convey the experience of Ulysses. I read it for a Joyce course at school, with the assistance of Harry Blamires's Bloomsday (oh...*that's* what happened) book. Reading Ulysses is quite a challenge to the late twentieth century attention span, but if you can get through the maternity ward (recapitulation of the history of the english language) and circe/whorehouse (the abandonment of the rational) episodes, I think you're rewarded with the hilarious, exremely erudite yet still accessible catechism of the penultimate chapter, as well as Molly's freeflowing stream (of thought). On a bookmark I received with an order from Amazon, there is a quote by Elizabeth Drew positing that the &quot;test of literature&quot; is whether or not we live more intensely for reading it. And after my first reading of Ulysses, I'm not so sure...But then, I think I've learned the value of a day..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I read somewhere that this book has been termed the greatest book of 20th century in American History.

At the moment I don't find it nessesary to read it any furder.But here are the conclussions I have made.Why this book is interresting:-The stream of consience idea is great, really. I love it.-I also love the idea that he descided to write about some of the things no sensibele writter would have ever written about. Like how Bloom went to the toilet or mastrubated.Why this book is a load of crap:-Way to long (I have nothing against long books and I have read quite a lot of books and I love Homer, Dante, Shakespear, Milton, Orwell, Huxley, Poe, Bulgakov, Plato, Swift, Nietzsche, Dickens, Asimov and many more so I do know a bit about litterature) this book should have ended whit the third chapter.-It lacks a plot. I am not saying that there has to be a overlingly complicated story behind it but it should have some directionlines.-The languege. Joyce seems to want to point out the whole time how good he knows English and that is very irretating.-It has no real meaning. I know that people have looked for one but all they have come up whit where some things like it is an epic of the body (well describing how someone goes to the toilet could hardly be discrived as epic. The also spoke about the complex intriging monologs and the praise of the mind (well the just say a lot of things and never seem to be able to think in a straigt line for longer than 3 min. And finally the the so cold new light that Joyce shines on myths. The mostly bring up Odysseus whit this one. Well people seek for Odysseus in this book because Joyce told them to do so.-Almost anybody could have written this book.I would also like to point out that when it was released all the people who love this book now (writters and proffesors) hatted this book. If it had never ben forbidden it would have just been forgotten like it perhaps should.I would like also to say that I didn't stopt reading tis book because it was to difficult but because it was borring. For after all I have read Paradise lost in the orriginal and I do find it difficulter to read that this one.Perhaps it is just so difficult to read because it is borring has anyone thought about that?(Excuse me for my English.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth. It should also be mentioned that the story is not very well paced. The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is so boring and ridiculous in its pedantism!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This was a good book, one that took quire some time to read.

I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those books that \\"smart\\" people like to \\"read.\\" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out!

He was not a good writer. He was all show-off and gimmick. There is no substance to his writing. It is a waste of time. It is pompous. It is boring. Accept reality people."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It is a blasphemy that it ever was published. Its only function is to keep blinkered academics busy trying to wring another drop of meaning from a text already exhausted from analysis.A brief glance through it is enough to confirm that it is precisely the novel you would write if you wanted to become a celebrated author but hated writing, hated readers, and wanted to punish academics. This monstrosity of hideous prose confirms that Joyce had no style and certainly no class. The novel can rightly be blamed for being the originator of the misguided notion that the squalor-and-filth quotient of a story is directly proportional to its artistic merit.The very least one might ask of a book is that it be readable. With this is mind, Ulysses, ludicrously canonised as the greatest of all novels, is a failure in the most fundamental respect. It is the only book I can think of where the reader deserves more credit for finishing it than the author. In the words of a *real* writer (H. L. Mencken): it is rumble and dumble, it is flap and doodle, it is balder and dash."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the first \\"Stately,\\" with the first letter taking up the first page, to the last \\"S,\\" capping off SPOILER ALERT the word \\"Yes\\" in Molly's monologue, this is a masterpiece that is worth the price of admission. Joyce's words don't fit a standard narrative, but they are worth the time to puzzle and marvel over. Its fine if you put it aside and dip back in from time-to-time. There's no rush. He took eight years to write this book, and traipsed all over Europe re-imagining the Irish soul -- forged in the smithy of his soul for the thousandth time the uncreated conscious of his race. This is it, just ignore the next book; Joyce peaked here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"We're approaching the 100th anniversary of the action in Ulysses and I've taken my copy out and began to reread it. No other book I know of has more power to inspire or instill creative thought. His symbolism and skill is simply astounding. Anthony Burgess once said that many times he'd think of Ulysses and then think about his own work, &quot;Why bother?&quot; I know what he meant, but the power of the characters and style gives everday writers like myself something to strive for.

Usually after about a hundred pages I can sort of get the &quot;gist&quot; of a document, and I will admit to not having a degree in literature or Irish studies. From all the praise, I am wondering if I have a defect in my brain. But I will admit, I don't get it. If this is supposed to be some mental time capsule, a masterful expose of stream-of-consciousness, then fine. Must be an acquired taste. Back to the Archie comic books I guess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is nothing intellectually challenging about this book. Instead, it is a cruel insult to the intelligence of any thinking person who tries to read it. Even the people who don't &quot;get it,&quot; and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: &quot;my head aches after reading it,&quot; &quot;one will never be able to understand,&quot; &quot;a vast, complex book about nothing,&quot; &quot;when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,&quot; &quot;meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,&quot; &quot;Ulysses is not Ulysses,&quot; &quot;sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.&quot;Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this &quot;book about nothing&quot; and find a book about _something_ instead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the \\"spirit of the age\\", essentially a rampant nihilism. Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the \\"why\\" as above, then the \\"how\\". For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer. I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through. Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere). Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that \\"Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated\\".The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed. The trap is simply that one thinks the work is \\"going to say something\\", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue. It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it. The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of \\"Joyce for Dummies\\" approach that I followed: purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there). Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig). Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print). Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the \\"story\\" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature. If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As a devout modernist, I put off the pleasure of reading this book for years. I wanted to have the time and leisure to give it proper attention. I had taken a seminar with Anthony Burgess on ULYSSES at CCNY in the early seventies. We did a close reading of the Nighttown chapter and were supposed to read the rest of the novel on our own. I never did. But Burgess' enthusiasm was impressive and though I wasn't entirely convinced, I was certainly intrigued. In earlier years I had read DUBLINERS and PORTRAIT and even some of FINNEGANS WAKE and was especially impressed by Joyce's mastery of language and the poetic quality of his prose.An early retirement offer finally had me reading the \\"GREATEST NOVEL OF THE 20th CENTURY\\" last month in Riverside Park. Some nice cigars added to the mix.The first few chapters were stunning. The powers of description, the playfulness and musicality of language, the wit and intelligence of Stephen and Buck were a delight. I was obviously in the hands of a master. Shakespeare even came to mind.But then something happened. The humanity and poetry seemed to drain out of the thing as we were treated to yet another chapter of theoretical \\"experimentation in narrative technique\\". The idea of writing a novel, each chapter of which is written in a parodistic or borrowed style seems to me a doomed one (and more postmodernist than modernist). Apparently even Ezra Pound objected. I found myself asking, \\"Couldn't Joyce have found his own voice and style to narrate this section?\\" An entire narrative chapter in the question and answer form of a Catholic Catechism seems affected at first. After thirty pages it is deadly and even embarrassing. And then another in the style of a men's sporting magazine, and then another in the style of a women's magazine? What's the point (other than showing off)? And the Freudian/Surrealist kitsch of the endless Nighttown chapter was downright infantile. Talk about dated! This is novel writing from the outside in. First you have an \\"experimental\\" concept and then you fit in some narrative stuff. It's no wonder academics use this book as major fodder. It seems to be written with them in mind.Likewise the useless tie ins with Homer's ODYSSEY. One can't help thinking of them as a desperate attempt to add structure, incident and theme to a book fairly bereft of them. Not to mention adding a bit of literary pedigree to offset the \\"obscenity\\".Which brings me to my main point. The fancy smorgasbord of styles cannot disguise the fact that as a novel, ULYSSES is sorely lacking. Involving narrative, depth and development of characterization , thematic focus, depth of feeling etc. seem totally absent. Basically what we have here is a brief Balzacian \\"realist\\" sketch, padded out and styled-up beyond belief.Now this is really a minority opinion: not only is ULYSSES a failure, but the reason I think it is a failure is that it is a transitional work. Joyce was obviously bored with novelistic narrative but still felt obliged to accommodate. With FINNEGANS WAKE, he hit stride and finally found his m&eacute;tier - a book as a place to play with language and psyche for his own pleasure, without regard for traditional novelistics.A NOTE ON EDITIONS: The huge academic controversy about which edition of ULYSSES is \\"authentic\\" or \\"correct\\" is, as one might expect, much ado about very little. Serious textual issues are minimal. Most of the typos in the 1922 edition were corrected in 1960/1 by the editors of the Modern Library in consultation with Richard Ellmann. That text was also used for the Bodley Head and current Everyman editions. Gabler later went overboard, making some highly questionable decisions. His edition is also difficult to read due to small print, layout, line-numbering etc. Danis Rose's edition went even further and \\"corrected\\" Joyce's compound words etc. - a disgrace.I ended up reading an online version edited by Jorn Barger - a very sensible amalgam of the best work of previous editors. It took some time and expense to print out, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Who published this? There are no characters in the entire book who would look anything like the characters on this cover! Most of the action takes place in a newspaper office, in a bed room, in a Martello tower, and at a funeral. Most people are dressed in jackets and ties, not torn shirts, and certainly no one smiles as dumb as these jokers. The looks of this book are a disgrace to the author."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I decided, after listening to an NPR reading from \\"Dubliners\\" that it was finally time I read \\"Ulysses\\"--a book that was not legally available in the U. S. 60 years ago when I was in college. (I didn't even know anybody who owned a copy or would fess up to it!) James Joyce's prose and imagery are breathtaking, and I begin to understand his influence over those writers lucky enough to read him in their youth.However, at the risk of revealing myself as a crotchety old lady, I confess I gave up about a third of the way through the book. It wasn't that it was so much racier than, say, Saturday Night Live or some of the current GOP rhetoric: I just got exasperated with the eternally adolescent whining of the main characters! Been there, heard that, thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect.

I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The $[...] Old Landmark edition (ASIN: B000FCK4BS) has chapter breaks and a TOC but lacks italics and proper linebreaks in the verse."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those novels that in actuality heralded the end of the novel as it was known (and still is for those of us who still enjoy a story for story's sake, and by that I mean all the ingredients).I first attempted to read this during my days in the army since I'd heard so much about it. But it wasn't until college that I was able to read this book and make sense of it (spent a whole semester doing so in a course by a superb professor).But let's get back to the novel. Told a single day, the tale of Leopold Bloom is one that was unprecedented in its time. So much flap followed this book's publication in Europe that it took a ruling from our supreme court here in the states to allow the publication of Ulysses in America. The story, by Joyce's own admission, is modeled after Homer's Odyssey. Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \\"enigmas and puzzles\\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce's supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \\"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college). And if you can't do that it's best to hunker down withUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] otherwise you might get lost like I did.With that said, if you are looking for a beautifully written, compelling story I would look elsewhere.

As a student, you have to read it(like Shakespeare of course - but he's slightly better). And every book that you HAVE to read is already suspicious. Why is it a 'must'? Because if you would not be forced, you wouldn't read it?So true because this is a waste of space. How wonderful such space can be used, other longer books like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Dune' or 'Catch-22' prove. They aim for entertainment, for fun, for joy in reading and all the same, they deliver perfect writing and characterisation. Now what is wrong with entertainment? Nothing! Even the bible wants to entertain - but Joyce is of course above such unnoble things like 'fun' or 'entertainment'. He's into style. And that's what he delivers:Dry, boring and self-satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used 'Ulysses' as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story. There are passages where his style is fantastic - short, journalistic style, the one I always use, the one I like. But these are LINES in a book of hundreds of pages... now if that is not a waste, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I challenge any so-called critic to read Ulysses out loud, in an auditorum full of listeners and explain, page by page, without notes or the extensive annotations available, just what each and every sentence and word means. Those effetes who proclaim this the greatest novel of all time are kidding themselves and us. It isn't. The fact that JJ state, in writing, that he had loaded up his novel with so much foreign words, obtuse references and effermeral meanings to keep academics busy for years say it all. The fact that he had to provide a schema to his closest readers also says volumes. And HE CHANGED that schema more than once. So, obviously JJ himself didn't understand what he meant! Nice book for literature students and prof.s to OOO and AAAH about, but the fact is it is boring to the nth degree and simply not up or even close to anything by Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or any number of other competent writers. Some time in the future it will become one of the least read novels of all time...perhaps then folks will start to take a more realistic view of what JJ really achieved."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You can't understand this book without a study guide. That fact alone should be enough to scare you away. One reviewer asks why a reader should have to work so hard to understand a novel and it is a good question, in my opinion. I think that a work of art which is not self-explanatory but which demands an additional volume and commentators in order to comprehend it is a failure. I heard one professor suggest that we should all take three years out of our lives to go through this book and to appreciate it fully. Yeah, right. I have never been too keen about anyone who thinks they know what I &quot;should&quot; do with my life. There are far too many other great and rewarding pleasures available to me in my life which are more easily accessible for me to waste my time deciphering what looks like the work of a schizophrenic. The modernist conceit is that Joyce and other non-linear novelists have captured the actual mental processes of man's daily life. Perhaps if you need medication and are plagued by mania, yes. My mental processes are not a mad jumble and I do not see how anyone with a professional occupation could function if this were true. It simply isn't so. There is a famous sex scene in this book where the mental thoughts of the individual coming to climax fills many pages. I asked around and no one I know thinks about anything while climaxing except for a sexual fantasy. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives &quot;working&quot; to unveil the &quot;true meaning&quot; in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the &quot;commoners&quot; for not &quot;getting&quot; Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I &quot;get&quot; him just fine, thank you.

Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having gotten through \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and \\"Dubliners,\\" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland. It has no discernable central thought. No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing. But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes? Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see. In reality, there was nothing there at all. Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity. It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.\\"Press on,\\" the professors say, \\"Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities.\\"However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness. The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it. Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read. Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed. Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's. Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine. This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now. To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition? I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend. That is; to trust one's educated common sense. If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson. Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted. And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books.

The point which Monsieur Camus was trying to communicate, I think, is that we should be somewhat happy for the passing of our lives, for it is when we are engaged in the most miseable of chores that we are most aware of time's pasage.I must conclude that Camus never read Joyce, for I am certain that if he had, he would have substituted \\"reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" for \\"waiting in line for theatre tickets.\\" This incoherent, gratuitously allusive, over-long monster of a novel is what English majors have canonized to prove to Engineers that they're smart too (and I write that as a not-too-bright Poli Sci major myself). In the interests of full disclosure, I admit that I have a special hate of this book: a sadist Yallie-Ellmanite English teacher of mine forced me to read it the summer before my senior year of high school.Ulysses has two great strengths. First, it steals the plot of the Odyssey in its entirety--thus, you're not really missing anything by not understanding it. Second, unlike other books in English, it does not discriminate--it it is equally incomprehensible to English and non-English speakers alike--little wonder that the touchy-feelies who dominate ivy league English departments love it so.Lemon soap; masturbate on the beach; stately, plump Buck Whocares?Sadly, though Ulysses is awful, Joyce was not without talent. One can see the glimmer of greatness--great lyrical streches of words, wonderful cadences here and there, etc. This book, however, is the literary equivalent of a Mondrian painting, it is the smug mocking of art(and in certain circles, those who dare to point this out are treated like the boy who observes that the emperor is not wearing clothes).

It's not possible to be so. But I do believe that every novel should have one element that, when said, comes across to the intelligensia as superficial and silly.

A novel must be Fun!?!?Blasphemy, to be sure, but even the most heady topics must be entertaining to read, enjoyable to read, fun to read. If not, the author has failed. Failed. Failed. Yes, even Failed.If the great selling point of a novel is \\"I finally got through it,\\" the author has failed. Find me one person who has both: a) actually finished reading Ulysses, and b) enjoyed every moment, and I'll show you a liar.Ulysses is a failed novel because Joyce was a bad writer (shown by his other works). And all the illerati who insist (as did Time magazine) that it was the best novel of the 20th century are simply trying to cover up their own shortcomings of character by trying to appear as that which they are not: literate and respectable.Art is not something you have to \\"get through.\\" It is not something you have to convince yourself and others that it exists in the form you behold. It is evident. And it is evident that Ulysses is more an exercise in pretension. It is evidently not art."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not being an English Literature major, nor an avid reader, I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels. I would start with the top novel, Ulysses. In that fashion, of reading the best novel first, I could excite myself, that is to kickstart myself, into reading quality material. Prior to this adventure, I mostly focused on the books I could understand, like calculus or structural engineering. Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask: Did I finish the book? I must say yes, times one point five. And I accomplished the feat in under three years. After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites, I started over after being half finished. I was sure that I had missed something in the first half, so I wanted to return and see what I missed. I searched hard, taking time to savor every word, often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting, But to no avail. But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time, and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then, through the second chapter about Bloom, I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts. But survived, realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through, to the climax, and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel, reaching the last chapter, paragraph, or sentence, whatever it may be considered, being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages. Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman, in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping, half sleeping, dreaming, or other non-physical event.In conclusion, Don't read the book. Burn it hard. Do not let your children read the book---it will mutilate their brain cells. Run fast to the local library and check out a nice text about advanced vector calculus, and a nice bottle of wine.

More than anything, the author seems like someone you'd want to have at a dinner party."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I won't review the book in detail, other than to say that I did enjoy it very much, and there were places where I laughed out loud (particularly when Leopold Bloom wonders whether or not Gods and Goddesses have anuses, then decides to resolve the matter by closely inspecting a statue at the National Museum).Also, to first time readers: just ignore episode 3. Many people enjoy Episodes 1-2 just fine, then get to episode 3 and stop dead in their tracks. Just skim through it or even skip it altogether. Ulysses is a book to be re-read, not just read once, so don't concern yourself with Episode 3 the first time through. It will make more sense if/when you reread the novel later. (And you should reread it, because you will be amazed at how easy it becomes once you're familiar with the basic plot).The main reason I'm posting this is to let readers, especially first time readers, know about an essay, \\"Art and Life, Nature and Culture\\" by Cheryl Herr, published in \\"James Joyce's Ulysses: A Casebook.\\" Most articles about Ulysses assume that you agree with the author that Ulysses is a great book, without taking the time to explain WHY it is a great book. Herr's essay explains a few (though definitely not all) of the themes of the novel and why its point is ultimately elusive. Some people get frustrated (I did) thinking that Ulysses is just one big puzzle that can be easily solved if you have the right \\"key,\\" making it seem mechanical, systematic, and just not fun. This essay challenges that assumption, explaining the mysteries of the novel that can never be fully explained, leaving it open to multiple, even infinite, readings.Also, although it's necessary to read \\"A Portrait...\\" before you read Ulysses, if you don't like \\"A Portrait,\\" don't worry. I didn't like that novel very much at all (maybe because I'm not Catholic and couldn't appreciate all the passages about sin and hell, but it just didn't get to me) but I loved Ulysses. So don't let a bad experience with that novel dissuade you, either."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I first ready Ulysses when I was 20 and on summer break from college. I read it with the annotated version as a guide. It was work but it was fun work. Here are a few things people never talk about with Ulysses:1. It's a very, very funny book2. At it's heart, it's about a young man trying to recover from the death of his mother and a middle aged man trying to cope with his marital crisis and the buried sadness over his dead son and father. Nothing overly obscure or elitist or intellectual there, I don't think.3. The verbal pyrotechnics serve the story. Joyce wanted to describe one day and make it entertaining. All the literary references serve the purpose of adding richness, depth, timelessness and universality to a story about ordinary Dublin citizens wandering around on a warm early summer's day.4. Ultimately, this book is a love story--the least sentimental love story ever written but it's about Stephen's conflicted love for his mother, Molly and Poldy's conflicted love for each other, and Joyce's conflicted love for Ireland. The book is about, as Stephen says, \\"the affirmation of the human spirit\\". He's not being sarcastic when he says that.Ulysses is a novel in brilliant technicolor. I've read nearly all the major literary classics and they are all in black and white by comparison."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I started this book, I must admit it was slow going. I was never a big fan of Joyce. \\"Dubliners\\" was cold and a bit too precious for me. \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" was likewise nothing to crap your pants over. So it was solely with a sense of responsibility to literary tradition that I finally opened my age-old copy of \\"Ulysses\\" to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately I hated it as I've hated few books before. Dense and uncommunicative. Sure it had stream of consciousness and all that - but this really was perfected by Faulkner, etc. - or so I thought.I kept reading - and reading and reading and reading. There came a time about 150 pages into this almost 700 page monster that I seriously considered doing my book physical harm. I thought of throwing it or ripping it or even burning it. However, good sense prevailed and I just kept at it.Then, the epiphany!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" doesn't just mirror Homer's epic but the reader actually reenacts it in the very process of understanding the book. Sure, the text is hard and Joyce doesn't take you by the hand - but it's meant to be that way. In the very difficult process of making meaning out of the text we become an integral part of the text and its meaning. The book is about the experience of literature more than it's about Mr. Bloom or Stephan Dedalus. In effect, you become Ulysses, yourself, and your very difficulties in understanding parallel the hero's difficulties finding his way home.What emerges after such a discovery is still a difficult and - at times - frustrating book. However, it is unquestionably a work of genius. Moreover, it goes far beyond the generation of stream of consciousness. The modes of communication are so varied here that each chapter almost reads like a new book. View points are important as well as the parallel structures they build cumulatively, however, the very mode of communication, itself, is of the story. Moreover, the honesty of the character portrayals is shocking. These are real people to a degree we rarely if ever see portrayed. We see everything Bloom does - from pontificate to use the bathroom.To anyone having difficulty with this book, I advise you keep reading. Promise yourself that you'll finish this book. Then you can hate or love it - whatever you want. Just finish.Now that Joyce actually makes sense, I wonder if I should go back to his early work or on to \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" - that monster of textuality that goes even further than \\"Ulysses.\\" I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet - but I will be. I will be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce is the most talented user of the English language since Shakespeare. His use of language is dazzling in its inventiveness and sophistication, and the sonic qualities of his writing are the equal of any poet. 'Ulysses' is rich, beautiful, moving, and evocative; the cleverness of the novel is associated with a profoundly human and humane sensibility.Often, this 'modernist' novel is contrasted with 'realist' novels, as though Joyce was doing something strange and different, but I don't think that's true - on the contrary, if a realist novel is one that communicates reality, then the stream-of-consciousness passages of 'Ulysses' are the high-water mark of the realist prose tradition, because they do something that no-one else has ever really managed - persuasively communicate his characters' experiences and thoughts from within. And there's more about the reality of Dublin life in 1904 than you would get from a dozen other novels of the period. He's not writing something other than a realist novel - he's doing it bigger and better than anyone else.BUT - it's not an easy read. The density of the prose makes it like reading poetry, and it's hard work just as reading an 800-page poem would be hard work. Furthermore, it's not all equally good; some of Joyce's experiments with language are less successful than others - the surrealist chapter springs to mind as a weak bit. When you're half-way through one of the less successful chapters, and it's both hard work *and* rather boring, it can feel a little bit like banging your head against a brick wall.So - know what you're getting yourself into. This book isn't for everyone, and you're not going to finish it in the course of a a one-week beach holiday in Marbella. But if you think you're up to it - have a go. It may just really annoy you. Or it may be the most rewarding book you'll ever read.Harry"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am glad that I read \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce as part of a graduate level course so that I had a professor who could explain all the intricacies and idiosyncracies of Joyce's masterpiece. Had I tried to read this novel on my own, I'm sure I would've given up very early on. Its stream-of-consciousness style not only defies the laws of narratrion, but Joyce expected his readers to be as intelligent as he was, which is just not the average case in today's society. It is easy to see why this novel has been the center of such controversy and praise ever since it was published; it truly stands alone in the pantheon of modern literature. As challenging and frustrating as it can be, it is a rewarding and intriguing read.So how does one sum up a nearly 800 page novel that follows the seemingly mundance events of one day (June 16, 1904) in Dublin, Ireland? \\"Ulysses\\" is the tale primarily of two men, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, whose paths propitiously cross late within the book. Stephen, a young intellectual, is stuck in an unrewarding job as a teacher. Bloom, a half-Jewish worker, is stuck in an unhappy marriage and who finds joy in the smallest and oddest of places. His day's journey through Dublin takes him to a funeral, a bar where he very nearly gets into a fight, a maternity ward, and a house of ill repute before he returns home for the evening. Along the way, readers are introduced to a wide cast of supporting characters who flesh out Bloom's adventures and play symbolic roles based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\". Readers are also given a vast insight into the history of the English language as well as questions that concern the very essence of humanity. The novel finishes with the perspective of Bloom's wife, Molly, who sheds some interesting light on Bloom's fears and presentiments.There is truly no other work like \\"Ulysses\\" in the history of the English novel and there will likely never be another quite like it. Joyce's command of the English language was phenomenal and his powers are at full display in chapter after chapter, whether in parodies of various writing styles or mocking the vapid putrescence of romantic literature. Leopold Bloom springs to life and his journey, while challenging and difficult, is definitely worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Five stars for Joyce and Ulysses, but boos to Amazon and Kindle, because the Kindle link provided with the ad for the Gabler edition leads to a Kindle version of the older Random House edition, which has many textual differences. Amazon, is the Gabler edition of Ulysses not available on Kindle? If it is not, please stop misleading your customers into thinking that it is. If it is available on Kindle, please replace the present Kindle link with the proper one. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course it's difficult; it was meant to be so. However, Joyce's desire to keep critics writing about him by making Ulysses a dense read is not reason to disparage what he was capable of doing. Another reviewer states that the book has neither plot nor story; this is false and misleading.Ulysses is not for the faint-hearted nor for the prudish. Certainly it remains on college reading lists because of its multiple layers of meanings, which few readers, if any, can grasp at first reading. To understand everything probably requires multiple readings, secondary sources, and/or formal study. Also, reading the entirety of Homer's Odyssey is a great help, just for seeing the parallels Joyce was driving at. But many jokes and innuendoes can be understood immediately, and if you are truly reading the text, you can determine what is going on. But this is never a book that you can comprehend by merely skimming along, waiting for the narrative to clear everything up for you.The effort is worth it, but don't attempt it if your motive is simply to add another title to your \\"List of Important Books That I've Read.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses has got to be the most difficult thing I have ever read. Being as tough as it is to read, I can see why their is a lot of negative reviews about this book. Most people feel for a book to be good it has to be action packed and fastly paced with a bunch of characters that you like.Well Ulysses has really none of those things, unless you can identify with Bloom or Stephen then you'll probably like them. When you pick up Ulysses you need to get some help. I read the guide by Gilbert along with the text and it helped me a lot. Without a guide Ulysses can be even harder than than it normally is.You also should not expect any major or huge events to happen. Nobody dies or anything exciting like that.Lastly you need to get into a mindset that what your going to be reading is extremly hard, but with a little patience it can be extremly rewarding.Now, without further ado, I will review Ulysses. I gave the book five stars, but it is not an unqualified five star review. When reading Ulysses in it's entirety, some parts are classic while other parts just seem unneccesary. For example, the Hades episode is the best in the book and probably the best example of realistic writing in the english language. Most of the other episodes are also great, but a few are just a burden to read. The Oxen of the Sun episode in my opinion is pointless. Joyce seems to like the fact that he can write in middle english, so he does. I'm no expert on middle english, but it's damn hard to read and it disrupts any flow the book had. If you can sort out the slang at the end of Oxen of the Sun then I congragulate you, because it was totally lost on me. The Ithaca episode is another example. It is told with a series of questions and are answered in the most drawn out and scientific way possible. Maybe Joyce could have been best served using a diffrent style. Stephen's Shakespeare rant also seems unnecessary and the episode where Bloom is trying to sell an ad to the newspaper is hard to follow.Ever other episode is expertly written and is a delight to read. The pitfalls of a few episodes are more than made up for with the 14 or so episodes that are expertly written.What Joyce does with language in this book is amazing. He is a true master of the english language and a master of a multitude of diffrent styles. He writes magnificently but sometimes he can't seem to help but show off his skills.And to those who think this book is utterly impossible and if anyone says they finished this book is lying, well I swear to god in heaven that I read this book cover to cover. It was no easy task, it took me a long time, but I did finish it. I don't claim to come close to total comprehension but I did read it all the way through.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't analytically challenged, has an attention span of at least one hour, and won't be offended if a writer changes styles every chapter. I highly recommend it. If you get through it you can be a literary snob for the rest of your life. Did you finish Ulysses, I did."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose it is pretty hard to add anything to this monstrous string of reviews. But I will comment because (obviously like so many others) I found this book to be very important. The fact that so many reviews exist shows that this book has effected a lot of people (enough to expend their precious energies writing about it). As you can see, not many really ride the middle ground about it. People seem to love it passionately or they hate it passionately. This should be enough to recommend it to anyone. We all should be after books that are going to change us, challenge us, effect our lives and loves. This is a book that has done that for a great many people. If you have not read it, take the time. I do not think that you'll sit in your easy chair and say 'well, it was okay,' and flip on the television.Personally, I found the book to be lively and entertaining. It was also challenging and arduous. Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't pick it up. Sometimes I thought it was a stupid book and sometimes I thought it was the best work of fiction that I had read. Ulysses is overall 'real.' It discusses truth, it changes a lot, like life. All the characters can be seen as stable in their lives, yet metaphysically sort of lost and wandering. That is like Ulysses. It is also a lot like you and I. There are jarring events, changes of style, unexpected devices and layers and layers of erudition. There are also normal everyday joes going about life as usual, to which we can all relate. It was not easy, and that is like life, also. Like life, it has a lot to teach you. And you can come back to this book many times and still find it fresh. It probably will seem an entirely new beast when you return.Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't recommend annotations. Trust yourself and trust Joyce in undertaking the work. Perhaps you'll miss things here or there. That is okay. You'll still 'get it,' in the end, if you make it. Part of it is seeing if you can make it, so you sort of fail in your test of yourself if you immediately resort to consulting some sort of 'dictionary of Joyce.' For anyone that sees this book as too daunting, let me just say that I'm not an English major or in a literature related field. I'm a music student, just a plain old undergraduate joe that read this book. I read the book without annotations except for one period where I was stuck and thought I didn't understand. I checked the annotations out from the library and I found that I did understand (at least as well as the annotator) and that I just needed to keep going to figure it out, just like in finding out how a Dickens plot is going to unfold. I would recommend against taking that step. Leave the annotations on the shelf. I'd recommend that you, another plain old non - literature joe or jane, try it. Trust yourself and try it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster.

Joyce's masterpiece is largely unread beacuse it has been branded &quot;difficult&quot;, but people who make this claim are simply not able to take in serious literature. Anyone who thinks that Joyce has a rival as the greatest writer in history needs only to read this book to be convinced. To get the full satisfaction from this book I think the reader needs to have read the works of Homer frist to understand the greatness and true meaning of the greatest book ever. Forget Plexus, Nexus and all that, forget to kill a mocking bird and all other pretenders, this book is the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses stands as a mountain in the centre of the wasteland of 20th century fiction. It is the landmark that reaches into the pages of every novel written since, it is polymath.But it's a darned difficult read. Each chapter is written not just in a new form, but in a completely new style. It demands a shift in mindset as one progresses through the book. In some cases that shift is required from sentence to sentence, or indeed from word to word.It's not a novel for the casual reader. To get anything out of it, one must be experienced. The annotations do help, but a broad knowledge of international literature, and indeed international language would be a boon when working one's way through the time-honoured pages.Personally, I'd buy it just for the 'Ithaca' chapter. It's pure art (or science, in fact), and in my humble opinion an incredible achievement in anti-narrative that is unsurpassed.Enough sycophancy. Ulysses is glorious, and that is truth."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Only on my 3rd or 4th attempt did i settle down and finally read this book. I actually saw Joseph Strick's 1967 film recently and although only a fraction of the book makes it to the screen, i found it more informative than any 'guide' you care to buy to help you.The range of linguistic styles, the mindboggling clever plotting, the dazzling knowledge,the unbelievably human sexual passages and above all the spectacular humour are for me all the elements that make Ulysses the definitive vision of how words make up a story that can depict the our condition.All I can say is that I got to Ulysses having already worked my way through the later innovators of the century - Pynchon,Beckett, Gaddis,Coover,Burroughs etc etc and it turns out that almost everything they have said can be found in Ulysses, and Joyce is always more touching, more beautiful, and more anything-you-care-to-mention."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't know if I understood Ulysses as a 'classic' except in the sense that it is an exercise for 'erudition'. Nevertheless, with the assistance of a Cliff Notes edition I was able to go through the whole length of the book and actually understand what was going on. In all, it wasn't too bad. I know this is a seminal work and has influenced a lot of writers, as a novel itself it cannot get 5 stars though."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce turn a left turn from Tolstoy's idea of elegantly revealing the stream of consciousness, unto pouring it by the bucket on the reader's head. Unfortunately, thousand of less competent hacks have followed in his footsteps making the latter half of the 20th century the garbage dump of literature."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Symbolically, Ulysses follows Homer's the Odyssey; literally, it follows one-day in the life of a Jewish-born Irishman (an anomaly, to be sure), Leopold Bloom.First, whoever gives this book less than five stars does not respect the English language or English literature.Second, whoever picks-up this book expecting to enter the temple of profundity is in for a big shock: this book is, and was meant to be, very funny.Third, this book actually is profound, which is due to Joyce's genius and broad learning, not due to the book's intention, which was to recreate the novel and rival Shakespeare in word-play (both of which Ulysses does very well).This book treads from the extremely scatological (Joyce humorously describing masturbation as a &quot;honeymoon with the hand&quot;), to the very highest planes of human thought, for instance at the beginning of the Proteus episode: &quot;INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO more, thought through my eyes.

He has to pass through many dangers, including the cave of the giant one-eyed cyclops and the magical woman who turns men into pigs, before he can return home to his faithful wife and free her from her unwanted suitors.Well, not exactly, as the car rental commercials say. Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an Irish sexpot named Mollie. The evil cyclops awaiting Leo is a big one-eyed antisemite, and the cave is a bar. The woman who turns men into pigs is a dominatrix. The faithful wife is in bed right now with a man named Blazes Boylan. And our droll hero is avoiding home because he gets a perverse pleasure out of the whole situation.Then there's the language of James Joyce. Buss her, wap in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. isn't whether or not to get the Cliff Notes, the question is which to read first, one chapter at a time, the book or the explanation. If you read the book first, you're giving yourself the chance to get it yourself. If you read the notes first, you'll have a much better idea what you're reading.In a book that sometimes makes you dislike humanity, as when some stupid antisemite (there are many, in fact almost everyone) gives Leo a little dig, the single most beautiful moment comes in the 14th chapter. I'm not referring to Send us, bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit, or to Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa! The most beautiful writing in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!It makes you think that life might be worth living after all, and that maybe God will one day say the same to you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an undergraduate, I tried and failed to read James Joyce's Ulysses the conventional way - I think it took me six months to finish chapter 1. Having treated myself to the audiobook, I can say that it's a completely different experience - Jim Norton's and Marcella Riordan's masterful recording really brings the text to life. On a purely practical level, the lengthy stream-of-consciousness bits make a whole lot more sense when they're read with the intonations of natural speech, and the variation in vocal tone makes it much easier to stay engaged in sections that otherwise tend towards the soporific. Most impressive are the 'voices' Jim Norton does for all the different characters - Stephen Dedalus's 'thoughts' are all done in a low-pitched deadpan monotone that perfectly captures his personality, while Buck Mulligan is loud, brash and has a much stronger Irish accent (this difference in volume is large enough to be a potential problem for someone listening through headphones). Norton's skill is particularly noticeable in 'ensemble' scenes such as the library, where he has to switch voice every couple of lines. I've got the Oxford Classics edition of the book (1922 text) and it's almost identical to the recording - very occasionally there's a word or two that's different. This time round I'm actually really enjoying Ulysses - who would've thought."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the complaints. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing... I can't understand it... It's just a bunch of drivel...&quot; All are opinions that anyone who has read the book is certainly entitled to. As for all the scholars out there who say that there are hidden meanings in every sentence, well, that's your opinion too. And you're more than welcome to scour &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the rest of your natural life looking for pieces to Joyce's grand puzzle. But I'm going to offer something a little different - those who would scour the novel for such meanings are missing the point in almost the same way as those who toss it aside as incomprehensible.In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, we are given access to the inner-consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. They are normal people living ordinary lives in early 20th century Dublin. They go to work, go to the bathroom, walk the streets, greet people, and think about their lives. They mull over details of their own lives that are so personal to them that they could mean nothing to anyone else. And if you think about it, isn't that what we all do? If someone were to open up your head and read your thoughts, they might say the same thing - &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; But we also consider the things that affect us all; love, death, loss, and hate, among others. Those are the thoughts that would carry weight and meaning for anyone, and the characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; ponder these things as we all might. We cannont completely become them, and thus we cannot completely understand everything they think of. But they hit upon enough major truths so that there is meaning for anyone. Their adventures through Dublin would have made an interesting story on their own - being able to see inside their minds takes the novel to a completely different level."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why do people who don't like Ulysses always lambaste those who do? You have every right to like and dislike what you please, and so do I. Why the name calling? I wouldn't call myself an intellectual and I'm certainly no \\"literary luminary,\\" but I love the book. For me, it's not about mythic parallels or stylistic experimentation or esoteric theories of art-it's about the richness, the absolute miracle, of human experience. Whatever else you can say about Joyce's intent, he wanted to show us life. And every time, for example, Bloom wonders whether black reflects or refracts light, I see life-the sort of life (banal, uncertain, driven by the demands of the flesh, often a joy, sometimes thankfully relieved by humor) that I live. Joyce (I think) succeeded in giving us a very simple but profound truth: every moment of life is sacred. Eternity, heaven and hell, God, the whole shebang, are right here around and within us all the time. And we spend 99% of our time distracting ourselves in one way or other.Bring your sense of humor! (it's supposed to be a comedy), and a little patience. The more you read it, the more you get out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am writing this review on the 100th anniversary of the most famous day in the life of the wandering Jewish Dubliner Leopold Bloom, who was created by James Joyce and immortalized in Ulysses. \\"Bloomsday,\\" as this day is called in some circles, prompted me to once again revisit this vast, difficult, and important book.I should note that I have only read Ulysses from cover to cover once, and that was more than 15 years ago. But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is for people that have not read this novel and are frightened by it.Greatest novel of all time, blah blah blah. Forget the academic wankery that has encased this novel like a black, shiny coffin. Joyce never meant this novel to be read with reverential nods and oh so serious frowns. This is a novel that is bursting with atmosphere and life.In its essence, this novel attempts two major tasks: to inflate one utterly ordinary day in the life of a human being to epic proportions, and to do so by undertaking a different writing-experiment for each chapter.The \\"epic inflation\\" aspect is absolutely fascinating. Mr Leopold Bloom spends an entire day wandering around Dublin for a bit, then comes back home. Absolutely nothing \\"epic\\", in the usual sense, actually occurs here. He encounters a spiritual son in the form of the slightly malnourished, youthful, pseudo-intellectual Stephen Dedalus...but the encounter doesn't really lead anywhere.Rather, it is the point of the novel to inflate the simple things in life to something epic. Taking the Odyssey as its skeleton (and you really should be familiar with the Odyssey before attempting this book), Joyce turns each tiny incident during the day (in pretty much \\"real time\\") into an epic event with its own incredible atmosphere and drama. Even Bloom sitting on the toilet, going to the post-office, or drinking instant chocolate become massive epic events.To some degree this is slightly self-mocking. However, the novel makes you see your own life in a slightly different way. Maybe there are no \\"dull\\" days in our lives; from a certain point of view even the most mundane stuff, like dropping off something at the post office, or drinking Ovaltine, becomes miraculous.Secondly, there is the experimentation. The fact that each chapter is a totally different experiment gives you a real sense of curiosity about the novel. What is coming next? Stream of consciousness wackiness? A play? Random newspaper headlines? The division of the book into different experiments means that, even if you don't like one chapter, you can read on in the hopes that the next chapter will be more to your taste.Think of it as being like a concept album. Even if you don't dig Within You Without You, When You're Sixty-Four is just around the corner.Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the novel. Even if sometimes you don't totally get what's happening, you get a strong sense of Dublin c. 1904, with people lunching on gorgonzola sandwiches and sherry at pubs, people wandering along Sandymount Strand and buying sweets, people going to the turkish bath and buying scented soap.There is also the unmistakeable tang of the Homeric Aegean. Dublin is near the sea, like Troy, and you don't forget it. Whether wandering the sandy beach, eating headless sardines from a tin, or watching drunken soldiers wandering along the street at night, the sea is never far away.Don't be put off this book. Wallow away in something that is truly an epic \\"show about nothing\\". Speaking of which, what is this book comparable to in the modern world?\\"Seinfeld\\", with its excruciating minutiae about life in New York City being raised to the mock-epic level, whether it's George lying about his job or Elaine wondering if a rabbi is gossiping about her.\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with its exuberant, youthful experimentation with the very bedrock of music albeit with a playful unpretentiousnessmost oddly, \\"24\\", with real time coverage of events in such a way that every single hour has something epic happening in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is great fun. It takes a bit more work to read than most books, just as it takes a bit more work to play tennis than it does to play catch. You shouldn't feel compelled to put the work in, any more than you should feel compelled to learn an unusually difficult sport. But people who do put the work in and who have a good time doing it shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it either. It's a pleasure to follow the interweaving lines of the Sirens chapter, for instance, and anyone who does it will see that the chapter is alive in a way that almost nothing else is in literature. Joyce is a terrific comic writer and a terrific creator of vivid, complicated characters. But he requires the reader to put in some extra effort to enjoy how good he is, and I can't blame anyone who gives up after a few pages and refuses to go any further. On the other hand, I've noticed that people who don't like Joyce's approach seem to want to attack people who do. This is silly. Again, it's like hating people for playing basketball just because you prefer skateboarding. Both the Joyce lovers and the Joyce haters should lighten up a bit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A book deserving to be thoroughly studied and a milestone in development of English language currently known, but a common reader like me can afford but a hasty and superficial eagle eye, and most references and connections would have been lost to me without the diagram by Stuart Gilbert quoted in the introduction of Penguin edition.A full and unique mastership of language results in a wonderful balance between fictional and technical , at ease with each employed style besides the contrasts between the different narrative techniques employed in the various chapters, which depicts the wide variety of microcultures composing the fragmented Irish society during British occupation.Many years ago I read a book, whose title The Cardinal, by Henry Morton, about the career of a Catholic American priest with Irish origins. The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille).An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of those big, mad bellwethers of a book that X will tell you is the biggest, best, most important blah blah blah and Y will tell you is a load of badly written tripe. Neither X nor Y tend to notice that the book consciously encourages both responses...but, well, I'll get back to the academic riffing in a minute.I first tried to read Ulysses aged about 14 (I was an annoying little boy that way) and didn't get very far. The first three chapters are set in and around the mind of Stephen Dedalus, one of the most ridiculously clever and over-educated characters ever conceived, as he takes breakfast with some friends, teaches in a school some miles south of Dublin and walks along a beach. Along the way, his mind ruminates on subjects as diverse as 16th century underworld slang, his dead mother, and something he calls &quot;the ineluctable modality of the visible&quot; which I'm still struggling with. But he's a curiously ambiguous character, this Stephen; he fancies himself as a poet and rebel but when, on the beach, he picks his nose, he has a quick look around to see that nobody's watching before he smears the snot on a rock. (Joyce likes to poke fun at pretension this way - although he doesn't suggest that Stephen's ideas or rebel stance are completely hollow, either.)The 14-year-old me didn't get that far. I gave up. It wasn't until I was 19 or so that I got as far as chapter four and encountered a Mr. Bloom, pottering around the kitchen making breakfast, that I started to get a grip. Bloom is one of the most likeable characters in fiction. He's a quiet, rather shy, oddly intelligent advertising salesman married to a voluptuous siren of a wife, Molly. Either you're prepared to go the distance with Bloom, or else cast the book aside with a hollow oath, because he's about to spend the entire day walking around Dublin. Nothing will happen except that a man will be buried, a baby will get born, and Bloom will help Stephen when the latter gets into a drunken fracas with some British soldiers. (Ireland was still part of the Union in 1904, and Dublin was a garrison town. Many non-Irish readers concentrate on Joyce's innovation or wit or technical whatever, but Joyce is extremely historically aware, and Ulysses, like all his other books, is riddled with the traces of English domination. These add to the book, rather than diminish it.)Readers who like those clanky, tinpot contraptions known as &quot;plots&quot; may get a tad frustrated. Leaving aside Joyce's gifts for parody (a _tad_ too indulged, in my opinion), the, if you like, human interest in Ulysses is in the details of the to-ing and fro-ing between the characters. A quite banal conversation turns out to have all sorts of fascinating undercurrents; Bloom, who is Jewish and therefore even more of an outsider than Stephen, is extremely good at detecting the hints and shifts in the tones of the people he meets. He keeps running into two things that cause him particular discomfort: anti-Semitic remarks, and reminders that his wife is about to sleep with another man.Ulysses is about language, but that makes it sound like it's some godawful lumbering doorstop written by an English professor. (John Barth, come on down!) It doesn't feel abstract at all; it's full of sights (the band of old sweat inside Bloom's hat), smells (restaurants, horse urine, flowers) and especially sounds (cats, printing presses, trams). I can't think of any other book which transports you so completely to a different place and time. (It might've helped that I grew up in Dublin and knew most of the places that Joyce is writing about.) Borges described Joyce's prose style, at least in the earlier half of the book, as &quot;strong and delicate&quot; and that's a good description.As the day wears on, the book starts to rumble at the foundations and it lurches with increasing unpredictability from style to style. Joyce is making a point about language; that things are altered by the manner in which we describe them. This can get a bit wearisome after a while, but when it works well - as in the chapter where the doings of a young girl on a beach are narrated in the style of a girl's magazine story - it can be very funny and rather touching. The book closes with a mighty tour de force as Molly Bloom sits up and thinks about her life and her curious husband.Okay, that's the beginner's guide. My personal opinion? It's the best Irish book, a constant wonder, irritation and delight to read, and a stunning effort of imagination and intelligence by the most significant and most lavishly talented Irish writer. 20th and 21st century Irish culture is unthinkable without it. I'm grateful that it's there. What else is to be said?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I picked this up for a group read of Ulysses. I figured it would be convenient to have it on the computer so I could look up all the references I didn't understand, and the price was certainly right. Unfortunately, as I came to realize, this edition of the book is missing pieces of text. I probably wouldn't have noticed this, except that when I googled one of the references that I didn't get, I came up with a preview of a book called Ulysses Annotated, which describes in detail the meaning of all the references. As I read, I noticed that in several places there were references noted that I hadn't seen in the text. Finally, I got annoyed and googled the exact line that preceded an area of missing text, and found that some lines of verse had been omitted from my edition of the book. It's a shame, since I was enjoying the clear formatting and the ease of use that the Kindle edition was giving me, but since it's not really a book that I want to spend money on, I guess I'll be giving Project Gutenberg's version a try."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stuff you probably want to know:1. It's read by two people: one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.2. The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it. I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.3. He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters. Excellent French and Latin pronunciation. His Italian and Spanish are less successful. The woman is certifiably Irish.4. There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.5. If you're a Joyce scholar, you are doubtless using the Gabler edition of 1986, WHICH WASN'T THE EDITION USED FOR THIS. I think they're actually using the 1922 edition! Anyhow, this is a constant irritant for serious Joyce fanatics, as, since you are doubtless using Gabler, there'll be something in almost every paragraph that's just a whit different. It's a constant distraction, alas!6. He reads it a little fast for my taste (especially in Circe).7. Yes, it is totally unabridged.8. There are 22 CD's total.9. You should buy it. I had read Ulysses twice before I got it, and going through it with this CD set really opened up the book to me, in a way I couldn't have gotten with any other type of ancillary aid. It was like reading the book for the first time! Wasn't so incomprehensible after all!I should warn you that one thing you might find thoroughly infuriating is that the title tracks / id tags of the CD tracks are totally in chaos. It's so bizarre, it smacks of sabotage. (For example, the title track of the 1st track of the 2nd (!) CD is: \\"Time for lunch. 1 p.m. After Dignam's funeral . . .\\" While the actual content is the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible\\" passage. It's craaaaazy!Rest assured, this is just the names your computer sees: everything is there, and in the correct order. My point is that if you plan on porting everything over to your iPod, you're gonna have some tedious clerical work ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"O.k. to start with...for all of you out there who are interested in reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; but are intimidated by all of the rest of you out there who say it's unreadable, take my advice. Read this book. It's absolutely ridiculous to say this book can't be read. I can't say you're going to find it interesting or enjoyable, but you can read it.There are people who would have you believe you have to wage a massive campaign of pre-&quot;Ulysses&quot; study before delving into Joyce's novel. I've heard it's necessary to read biographies of Joyce, read all of his other literature, read about the history of Dublin, read Greek mythology...even study Dublin city maps!!! Don't you believe any of this. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is perfectly approachable having read none of the above. I admit that reading &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; first is helpful, and at least having some passing knowledge of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; won't hurt, but being familiar with these other works will only help you appreciate some of Joyce's nuances. Being unfamiliar with them will not prevent you from digesting &quot;Ulysses.&quot;Now, for the book itself. Is &quot;Ulysses&quot; good? That's become an almost irrelevant question to ask. Do you have to like &quot;Ulysses?&quot; No. Do you have to admit that it is the greatest novel ever written? No. Anyone denying that the book was influential in altering the course of literature would just be foolish. However, I don't think &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the be-all and end-all of 20th Century literature, and the new ground that Joyce broke would have been broken anyway had he not done it first. He was certainly an innovator, but other authors (Faulkner comes to mind) use Joyce's modernist approach to fiction and do it better.For ultimately, Joyce is a lousy storyteller. Notice I did not say he is a lousy writer. One can't deny the absolute mastery of language apparent in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; But Joyce is almost completely unable to connect with his reader. Parts of this novel come close to doing just that, but in between there are vast numbers of pages of dull, dull prose that set out to be as incomprehensible as possible. What was Joyce afraid of? Was he scared that what he actually had to say wasn't either particulary interesting or profound, so he had to bury it underneath layer after layer of obscure allusions and writing styles? I didn't understand every part of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and I don't believe all of these so-called Joyce experts do either, despite the massive amount of critical study done about it. However, understanding every single part of the novel and understanding the novel are two different things, and I believe I understood &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And what I found is that it's not the beast everyone's made it out to be, but neither is it particulary interesting or profound.In short, I would recommend that everyone read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; if for no other reason than that you can have an opinion on it. I won't be reading it again, so I guess I'll have to just live in ignorance of all the hidden delights Joyce offers his readers. I neither loved it or hated it---there are many books I've enjoyed reading less and many more books I've enjoyed reading much more. Before reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; I was reluctant to state that I didn't like Joyce's writing, feeling that any opinion about Joyce without having read his masterwork would be uneducated. Well, I've read the damn thing now, and I can state with a very educated opinion: &quot;I do not like Joyce's writing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have frequently heard Ulysses proclaimed the best book ever written, but I could never understand why. I purchased this edition of the novel three years ago, and since then it sat on my shelf, a mighty 900 page undertaking that I kept putting off. I was reluctant to read it, for I have often heard how difficult it was to get through. Finally, I have read it, and though I believe it presumptuous to call any one book \\"the best book of all time\\", I certainly believe that Ulysses could claim that title. First off, it is not a difficult read. If you could get through A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you can get through Ulysses. I heartily recommend this edition because of the brilliant introduction by Declan Kibard. Before I read Ulysses, I could not understand how this could be the best book of all time. According to my understanding, it was a novel detailing, in 900 pages, one day in the life of a Jewish Irishman, Leopold Bloom. A totally unremarkable day at that. After reading Kibard's introduction, I was fiercely eager to begin the novel. In his introduction, totally some 70 pages, Kibard answers the precise question I had: Why would this book be called the best of all time? This book is never boring, and is actually a quite enjoyable read. It is arranged in 18 chapters, and to me, the most astounding aspect of this piece of literature is the fact that every chapter is written in a different style. Joyce wanted to show that \\"originality\\" in terms of style was merely a new arrangement of previous styles, and so shows his brilliance as a writer by changing his technique and method completely in each chapter. It is indeed difficult to believe they were written by the same person. The styles are listed as: Narrative (Young), Catechism (Personal), Monologue (Male), Narrative (Mature), Narcissism, Incubism, Enthymemic, Peristaltic, Dialectic, Labyrinth, Fuga per canonem, Gigantism, Tumescence detumescence, Embryonic development, Hallucination, Narrative (Old), Catechism (Impersonal), Monologue (Female). Some chapters, such as the Cyclops, done in Gigantism, are deliciously satirical and overdone, while others, such as the Lotus-eaters, are sharp and direct. Though Joyce is often called a \\"stream of consciousness writer\\", only a few chapters are the truly chaotic stream of consciousness, such as the Oxen of the Sun, the Proteus, and the Sirens. The culmination of absurdity and abstraction occurs in the massive Circe chapter, a play styled as a hallucination in the brothels of Dublin. This novel is nearly impossible to take in with just one reading, and I will be reading it again shortly. On this note, I would say that I heartily recommend reading Ulysses straight through in its original form, rather than labouring under the weight of the hefty annotated edition. A true masterpiece, one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, quite possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The eBook is missing text. I also have a print edition, but I wanted a copy I could read on my phone when i had the time. The part I noticed is missing is the Ballad of Joking Jesus. It's probably missing other text as well."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had heard about Ulysses all through my literature-loving youth. When I was 16 or so, I tried to find Ulysses in the St. Cloud Technical High School Library. It was listed in the card catalog, but it was never on the shelves. Finally, I asked the prim-and-proper old biddy librarian where the book was. She fairly shuddered and asked me with a cockeyed combination of excitement and accusation &quot;why&quot; I wanted to read it. I told her I'd heard it was a great book and so please hand it over. Sure enough, it was in a back room and the old battleaxe crept forth with the book, jacketed in a beautiful red. At home I opened it and tried to make sense out of the first page. I dipped around in it and finally threw it hard as I could against the wall of my bedroom. &quot;This is gibberish junk!&quot; I said to myself. Later, I kept hearing more about the book and thought, &quot;well, maybe I'm just dumb,&quot; which really teed me off. One day I found a book called &quot;Re-Joyce&quot; by Anthony Burgess (of Clockwork Orange fame). He was a Joyce fanatic and wrote a book about how to read Ulysses. And so I read Re-Joyce as I read Ulysses and, wonder of wonders, what an experience! That was back in 1965. I still read Ulysses. It's the one book I re-read more than any other. Oh, and when I look back, way back to my high school library, I know now how Joyce would have roared with merriment at that biddy librarian. He would have been honored in his sly way to see his naughty book kept behind that bun-haired spinster's iron petticoats. Don't give up on Ulysses! Get the Burgess book as a guide, or the Gilbert guide. But don't give up. Riches, great riches, await you!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights. This new version is just so superb and so amazing in its vitality.While at times Ulysses is still a challenge to grasp, I can guarantee that the whole book is much more comprehensible, and wonderful, to hear it read so well. It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You ever hear that old adage about \\"what don't kill you, makes you stronger\\"? Well, struggling through Ulysses is kinda like that. If you haven't taken a bottle of pain relievers mid-point through the book or perhaps just sprained your wrists trying to hold aloft the 768 page tome, you might just start to understand the methods behind Joyce's madness. But understanding doesn't equal enjoyment.Ulysses, one of the most celebrated and challenging books in the English language has been reduced to one of two things: to the general public, a curiosity, a book of importance that no one would really read or: to Lit majors: the equivalent of a double-dog dare among the Lit-Crit crowd; a book professors assign in order to weed out the weak, who more than likely change majors to something less demanding, like quantum physics. Inevitably, in both circles it has become a book to be endured, not enjoyed.What is the book about? Joyce, a master of the written word *does* appear to have a lot to say about everything, including, but not limited to, religion, politics, sex, and literature. But if there is a flaw in the book (and indeed, it could be argued that the flaw lies with the reader, not the author), it's that Joyce seems more preoccupied with how his story is told, losing sight of the actual subjects. Ulysses is really about WRITING, it seems, and in particular, how well Joyce can do it. The skill involved in the writing often attains that genius status, but too often it feels strangely hollow, a series of breathlessly staged feats of writing skill. In other words, he's showboating.Still, despite Joyce's blatant shouts of \\"look at me!\\", many moments of passion do leak through. Particularly impressive is the final 40 pages or so which takes on a confessional tone that at last attempts to engage the reader emotionally, instead of keeping them at a distance.Reading Ulysses is difficult, to be sure. Joyce drops more obscure references than Dennis Miller after three highballs. Joyce assumes you've read The Odyssey, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Bible, Hamlet, and, of course the dictionary. He also assumes that you have a passing knowledge of about 6 or 7 languages. But, even if you do have prior knowledge of said works and you know Latin, it cannot help make Ulysses as a whole, an engaging, vital work. It is a towering achievement, yes, but much more of a textbook on writing, which just happens to use the characters of Stephen Daedalus and Leopold Bloom as examples of the styles that Joyce writes in.All said and done though, I would recommend this book as it is unique and it is one of those titles that, like childbirth, has to be experienced to be understood.I would also recommend Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as a superior work of art. It's just as inventive, it's moving and passionate, and it says what it has to say before wearing out it's welcome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Orchises Press edition stands out for three reasons. The first is that it reproduces--with impressive attention to detail--the first edition of Joyce's novel. The second reason is that the large, widemargined pages add the pleasure of reading to the pleasure of reading Ulysses (there is something missing, after all, in the insubstantial, tinytype levity of the paperback editions). Finally, the weight of the paper, the strength of the binding makes this edition one that will last (and you will not, as with the paperback editions, be forced to transcripe all your notes from a book that falls apart after three readings). For those who seek the &quot;authenticity&quot; of a first edition, who admire Joyce or who will be studying the novel for years to come, this is the edition to buy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and also Dubliners, I decided last summer to tackle his novel Ulysses, to which several literary associations have deemed the greatest twentieth century novel. Today's sophisticated younger reader may ponder the accolades professors and scholars have showered upon a novel that rambles for well over 700 pages, but there are significant reasons that I would like to briefly elucidate.First, as many have pointed out this is a book of language, and specifically one that attempts to import all of English lexicon in order to examine where its vocabulary leads us and where we ultimately run up against road blocks. This monumental task had never been accomplished in the English language since the likes of Shakespeare and Chaucer.Second, this is a novel of experimentation. A 19th century staple, the novel was overdue for an update that would capture the complexities and anxieties of the 20th century. For too long, the novel reflected a mathematical plot line divided evenly into clear physical events, which, frankly, failed to detail the organics of human thought and development. Ulysses does the unthinkable: Our thoughts and actions cannot be explained away by chronology;there is a real-time universal presence to them, as some would later read in Faulkner's works.Third, there is an authentic examination of the individual. Reading his biography and Ireland's history, Joyce repeatedly hammers home the colossal battle between individuality and social conformity. In Ulysses, outside forces such as the Catholic church, parents, ignorance, politics, and peers attempt to squelch the voice of the individual by attempting to dictate what happiness and contentment are. It is through allusions to the mythological story of the Odyssey that our most heroic feat today is learning how our voice can Bloom in a world that too often expects us to conform.Fourth, it is an honest, realistic story about life in general. Whether we want to admit it, much of life is spent within ourselves, as Joyce unearths through the three characters' streams of consciousness. We do talk to ourselves; our thoughts are random, not linear; we scrutinize ourselves hoping to make connections among scraps of thoughts that only we and God have access to. No novelist up to this point had created what amounted to a confessional that was unafraid of society's taboos and mores. Where else could a young modern reader, for example, read about a character's sexual acts in unadorned detail?Finally, contrary to what critics have stated--i.e. several novelists of Joyce's age called the work a mess--there is a compelling story. At the time of its publication, virulent anti-semitism consumed not only colonized Ireland but the rest of the world. So enters our modern day Ulysses, Bloom, a baptized Jew who exhibits the attributes of Christ but is condemned by his society for alleged ancestral sins. And then there is poor Stephen, whose triumphant announcement to the world that he is an artist contrasts sharply with his doldrum existence, refusing to pray for his dying mother, rejecting his largely absent father, and holding a teaching position that is less than inspiring.There's Molly, a singer by trade who is blazed into sleeping with a talent agent so that she can further her career and can also help provide for Bloom when money is tight. Molly and Bloom may be jovial in name, but underneath is the tragic loss of their infant son who managed to live only eleven days. To me, this is an unflinching look at real life. And yet, epiphanies still happen, and new friendships such as what Stephen and Bloom display provide us with what really matters most: love and acceptance. Bloom is the father who unconditionally accepts Stephen, and Stephen is the son Bloom has dreamed of since Stephen clearly needs guidance.Many readers have pointed out that the traditional literary community has hailed Ulysses as the seminal novel of the twentieth century, and, therefore, today's reader must adhere to its proclamation. If Joyce were alive, I think he would be appalled simply because freedom of expression was his guiding principle. Joyce's main point is that the path toward freedom is not merely a straight line or even a winding one; rather, it is a confluence of thoughts, feelings, and relationships that eventually crystallize into an overarching personal epiphany. Ulysses certainly is a challenge, but then again so is life. Each day is worth a seven hundred page book--Joyce's merit is that he actually proved it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many scenes stick in one's mind forever, for example when Leopold Bloom releases his bowels or when the coffin falls on the road. I finally came to understand the stream-of-consciousness technique and realized it's not Joyce's stream we're wading in but the carefully reproduced stream of the character's consciousness. I found this particularly effective and fun reading of Stephen Dedalus's morning at school. Other scenes like Molly Bloom's grand finale are simply beautiful and literally breathless, especially if you take punctuation as a breathing signal.And I'm especially glad to read it now that I live in Dublin. I've lived in Ringsend three months, I've visited a friend in Mullingar, and I've shopped at Buckley's butcher shop, all of which are mentioned in Ulysses. I even bought my copy of the book at the Martello tower featured at the start of the novel.But overall, one feels Ulysses is somewhat contrived. Crucify this humble critic if you will, but reproducing the structure of the Odyssey is a clever but artificial way of bringing epic grandeur to what is nothing more than a very ordinary day. Why go through all that trouble? I do agree with the lesson but find it rather long winded. In painting, a still life by Chardin is as realistic as an imperial coronation scene by David, but with much less fuss.And then there are the inside jokes. References to Walt Whitman and to Edgar Allen Poe (which I got only because I remembered Tom Hanks reciting Poe's \\"To Helen\\" in The Ladykillers) and other writers abound. Shouldn't a great work stand on its own, at least where its intended audience is concerned? Ulysses fails utterly in this respect unless we restrict the audience to academics.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can say without reservation that this is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. It sparkles with emotion and visceral force, thrusting you so deeply into the lives of its main characters that the medium between the reader and the protagonists is completely penetrated and we quite simply become the characters. Asking such questions as \\"well what would have happened if Bloom had decided to do this\\" is meaningless because we know Bloom so well that it is impossible to conceive him doing anything other than as he does it. We are privy to his innermost passions and longings: in the Circe episode we too forlornly cry out to the apparition of his dead son Rudy, his destroyed hope for the honor of his name, his heritage, and his love. In the Wandering Rocks we feel Steven's pain as he is approached by his rag-clad sister begging him for food:\\"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\\"While some see the parellels to Homer as unnecessary pretentious obscurity, by recreating the Odyssey in turn-of-the-century-Dublin Joyce shows us that all of the heroic epics and action movies in the world are as shallow and meaningless filth before the only true glorious quest, that presented to us in the living of our lives each day.The Homeric parallel also underlies another of Joyce's major aims in the work, that of preserving what has come before. Stephen, the book's other main character, is an autobiographical University student obsessed with the great works of Western literature. Both his thought-stream and his conversations with other characters are rife with allusions to great literature from the ancient Greeks through St. Augustine (the Catholic Church is also very important), Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Flaubert, and even Oscar Wilde. These many allusions are often seen as a reason not to read the book, but I can affirm that while one does lose something by missing them, the book reads quite well without them and often one can determine the significance of the allusion from the context without knowing its source.Essentially Joyce has taken everything that has come before and combined it into a stunning novel that I feel puts him solidly beside Shakespeare as a true master of the English language. Of course when we say the English language that is up to some debate because, like Shakespeare, Joyce in no way feels bound to correct grammar and is quite willing to sacrifice it whenever he feels it hampers his expression.Yes parts of it are difficult, but not so difficult that one shouldn't attempt the book because of them. I have a dirty suspicion that a lot of the reputed difficulty of this book stems from the exaggerations of those who have read it and want to look smart. You will have to do a little background research, and I strongly advise Reading Joyce's other two books, Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so that you know the setting and the people. But that said, go for it! It is more than worth the reward of a little patience at the beginning. Also Harry Blamires' New Bloomsday Book and Anthony Burgess's Re Joyce are wonderful supplements to help clear up some of the initial uncertainty.The book took me almost a year to get through, reading several of the episodes more than once, but coming away from it I absolutely confirm that it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Right. Ulysses. The intellectual field of Joycewrit contains more essays, papers, doctoral theses, and professional articles than most libraries contain books. So much has been written about this book that I usually have to step back and laugh when contemplating the enormity. It is like fathoming the universal end when you are a child of ten.With that said, I do believe I have something to contribute to *this* forum. I can tell you what this book is. It is perhaps the best and most complete example of written reality in existence. If the world exists in a grain of sand, then it exists in a day full of sand many times.What I mean is that the book works on any level. At a closely read level one can find absurdly esoteric references to minutiae that only has relevance for June 16, 1904. The esoterica works, though. By making something obscure that is in essence very simple, Joyce makes one think about it in a new way. Look at Chapter 17 remembering that Joyce's goal is to make the simple obscure. Then ask yourself what happens over the course of the chapter. Never has less accomplished more. Ithaca (ch. 17), by the way, was Joyce's favourite chapter.At a broader level Joyce's expressive mechanism becomes clear and truly rises above any intellectualization. Perhaps you should not worry too much about that passage of Italian shouted in the street, or the odd bit of vaudevillian obscurity. Instead look at the scope and breadth of a single day and the myriad thoughts that pass through your mind. Could someone decipher your day from your thoughts with ease? And as in a real day, as in reality, a man's life is not so simple to pick apart as a speech in a novel may lead you to believe. A simple bit of dialogue spoken to a boaster may reveal a great amount:&quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the opposite of that that is really life.-- What? Says Alf.-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.&quot;And that, I am glad to say, is all we get."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses has been called a lot of things, most of them not flattering. I think the reason most people don't like Ulysses is that is is unlike any other novel, and cannot be treated as 'ordinary.'This day in the life of Leopold Bloom holds everything from insights into the nature of existence, opinions ranging from useful to mundane, and observations on, well, everything. Joyce manages to write a book which leads us through the minds of several characters as they live an ordinary, utterly unspectacular day. This technique is certainly unique, and utterly defines the concept of literary realism.To appreciate this book is to take it on its own terms. To gloss over the passages in which Leopold is daydreaming about triffles (as he does, as we all do. And that is the point.) does not hurt the reader in terms of understanding the plot. You don't so much as read this novel, as much as experience it. The reader is intended to be bored when Leopold is bored, excited when he is, and vaguely aware in-between. As one reviewer pointed out, the book is best understood when read aloud. I'm not sure if this is by design or simply because of Joyce's lyrical prose, but it's a good strategy especially in the tough passages.In all respects a classic, even if difficult at times. Influenced nearly everything else after it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Some people like to go for a stroll on the beach. Others like to climb Mount Everest. Reading Ulysses is much more like the latter than the former.I have now read this book four times. I must really be a glutton for punishment.Actually, the rereading is quite rewarding. When I first read the book in my youth, the only edition available was the one with all the printer's errors in it. Those errors made a difficult novel, much more so. So I found that my understanding and appreciation rose substantially when I could read the original version.As I grew older, I realized that I had had more experiences, read more books, and thought more thoughts. That meant that I found new layers of meaning in Ulysses.I plan to keep rereading this book on a regular basis for the rest of my life. I hope you find it this engrossing as well.What initially attracted me to the book was Joyce's ability to capture the inner dialogue that we all have. We alternate between thinking like angels and the basest animals. Joyce not only unveiled and portrayed that quality, he also imbued it with an elegance of expression that certainly exceeds my wit. It is almost as though an intellectual, well-educated literary comedian is invited along to make witnessing the internal dialogue more interesting.Of even greater significance is the reaction that many have to the novel. They simply do not want to plumb into someone else's mind, unless perhaps it is the mind of a saint. But who knows what a saint really thinks?The title, of course, is a dead giveaway (that few will need) that there are a literary analogy and symbolism involved. Those implications are enough to keep several Ph.D.'s busy for a career.Mr. Joyce was a most learned and observant man. What remarkable things must have gone on inside of his mind!If you are interested in extending your own ability to understand what is going on around you, I recommend Ulysses as a way to fill in the backdrop of what is not said when you are with others.If you are more than satisfied with surface reality, then by all means skip this book. You'll wonder what all the fuss is about.Perhaps the only exception to the latter is someone who loves a musical turn of phrasing, something Joyce excels in.Enjoy your journey!If you are like me, you'll find that it makes sense to keep your copy on the night table. You never know when you'll be ready for another trip to 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All the above reviews involve one person reading Ulysses in private, sometimes with help from notes and critics. This was a wildly new way of writing a book, so perhaps it calls for a wildly new way of reading it? I'm in an amateur group in Seattle that reads it together and does a staged reading of chapter a year of Ulysses. Our performances are free so this isn't a promotion! Many of the difficult things about the book are avoided with this method.....for example, it often seems obvious that voices are changing, and that becomes much clearer when one can hear the voices change. This includes jumps between different types of internal thoughts, or different literary styles. Also, the characters seem more real and easier to like when you can hear their voices. Plus, if something seems incomprehensible, you can't stop and perseverate about it during the actual performance.We spend several months reading together and listening to Joyce's prose and thinking about the different voices we hear in it, and researching the bits we don't understand, including esoteric references and pronunciations and mysteries. Then, on Bloomsday each year, the annual celebration of Joyce, but especially Ulysses, we read that chapter in public. The program includes that chapter's key features, a synopsis of the action, the analogy with the Odyssey, the symbols in Joyce's schema and the three or four most important of the intertwining themes within the chapter, and how that chapter relates to the rest of the book. People can bring along their copy of the book and read along.This is why Bloomsday was invented and is the best way to begin to appreciate Ulysses. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Joyce meant us to struggle, as one other reviewer suggested, to recreate the travails of Odysseus and Bloom in our own minds as we try to understand this book with no help. BUT maybe he actually meant us to read it very slowly and thoughfully, relishing every turn of phrase, every comic and poignant moment and discussing all of the book's references, analogies and puzzles. Perhaps to overthrow the imperialism of English literature which includes telling us how a book should be read!?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I landed in Dublin a couple of years ago and the immigration officer at the airport asked me the purpose of my visit, I told him, \\"James Joyce pilgrimage.\\" He was bemused. \\"James Joyce?\\" he said. \\"You mean 'Ulysses'?

The Irish pronounce the title of Joyce's great novel with an emphasis on the first syllable: 'YOO-liseez') I answered his questions affirmatively; he examined my passport, studied my face and said, \\"That's a hard book. Have you read 'Ulysses'?\\" I raised my eyebrows in surprise at the question and asked, \\"Will you kick me out of the country if I say no?\\" The immigration officer, still holding my passport, replied, \\"That's a distinct possibility, sir.\\" \\"Then yes,\\" I said, \\"yes, I've read it many times, yes.\\" He returned the passport and waved me through, saying, \\"Enjoy it anyway.\\"I actually have read this book six or seven times by now.

The \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" and \\"Eumaeus\\" chapters are tedious (the former, in fact, is a failure), but the book's many high points greatly outweigh its faults.

Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant. Was it just me? Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list? Or was Joyce just playing around? A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more. To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with. Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904. I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses. Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book? I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece. Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book. I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read. I didn't find it with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Every time there's a verb of speaking and a colon, this kindle ebook simply omits what follows.

While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word \\"the\\" routinely appears as \\"die\\" or \\"lie\\". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number \\"3\\" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter \\"l\\" is frequently replaced by the number \\"1\\" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies.

This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the most astonishingly difficult work of fiction that I have ever read. It is also one of the most astonishingly beautiful books I have ever read. Certainly, reading this novel is not for the uninitiated or the faint of heart. But it's also not for those who believe they can understand everything in this book.Certainly a ton has been written on this site about the plot so I'll skip that and just give my suggestions about how to go about reading this behemoth. Find a website that gives you a chapter by chapter summary (wikipedia is not particularly good because the analysis is simply too short). Read the summary of every chapter before you read the chapter and once again after you finish reading the chapter. Also, keep a dictionary handy. James Joyce has the largest vocabulary of any writer I have ever read. I found that this method was sufficient for me to be able to understand a great portion of the book. If I had tried to use an annotated guide, I feel like I would have spent too much time looking at every reference and ultimately given up on the book out of sheer boredom. Literature is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, so unless you are planning on teaching the book to others, read the book without an annotated guide.For those that are willing to abandon all hope of complete understanding and enter Ulysses, I think the experience is actually quite rewarding. The writing is top-notch, the humor incredibly funny, and the drama incredibly moving. James Joyce said more with this book than I believe has even been said about the human condition in any other book (his only rival being William Shakespeare). It is a work of absolute genius, the kind of book that even the best writers can merely kowtow to in reverence. Its triumph will probably never be equalled and for that reason, it is worth the challenge."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would not recommend this audio version as a substitute to the text, but as a very valuable augmentation. To get the most out of the Ulysses experience, one must employ all senses. Joyce's masterpiece is filled with the music of his own unique language. Reading the text without hearing it is tantamount to reading an opera. Hearing Ulysses read aloud by Donal Donnelly is like hearing that same opera performed by Caruso. The Sirens episode, in particular, is incomplete until it is given a voice. The text of Ulysses is frequently challenging as it drifts, without warning, between styles, languages, and points of view, but Donnelly navigates through Joyce's maelstrom with a confident hand firmly on the tiller. I can listen to these discs over and over the way I would my favorite music, and each time I hear something I missed before or make sense out of something that I didn't understand earlier. An audio companion to the text of Ulysses is invaluable, and I very highly recommend this particular version."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm reading Ulysses and concurrently listening to audio CD's of a seminar on the novel by Professor James Hefferman produced by The Teaching Company.

There is no critical annotation or introduction, so you may consider buying a companion guide or annotation to accompany it (but be skeptical, many published books about Ulysses are misinformed or incomplete). All in all, if you're going to embark on reading Ulysses, you want this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce (1934) is a novel about the interaction of social responsibility and personal desires. It focuses primarily on three characters: Stephen Dedalus a self-absorbed scholar attempting to find his artistic voice, Leopold Bloom who tries to meet his social responsibilities in a culture that is not completely accepting of him, and Molly Bloom (Poldy's wife) who struggles with her feminine destiny.The novel parallels the structure of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" that chronicles the 10 year struggle of Odysseus to return from war in Troy to his home in Ithaca. Ulysses, the Latin translation of the Greek name Odysseus, is Leopold (Poldy) Bloom who travels the streets of Dublin one Thursday on June 16, 1904. His goal is to accomplish his daily task of meeting his family's economic needs, forming social alliances with Dubliners (including Stephen), and satisfying his own drives for understanding and fulfillment. Odysseus sought to reunite with his wife and assess her fidelity in his absence, and Bloom looks forward to the end of the day when he returns to his home at 7 Eccles Street, concerned about his wife's unfaithfulness.\\"Ulysses\\" is remarkable in its descriptive detail of the physical and psychological environments of Dublin and its characters. The feelings related to immersion in the living Irish city are so strong that there may be some irrational fear of being unable to return to current life. The entrance into the reality of the lives of Stephen, Molly, and Poldy is uncanny as readers become physically and psychically connected to characters. It is a matter of proximity. You lose your own personality as you accompany these people when they converse, walk the streets, visit stores, drink and philosophize, reveal themselves in stream of consciousness monologues, argue, pursue bacchanalian extremes, and have private battles with loss and melancholy.The reader \`sees' everything that day, the external locations and the inner worlds of the characters, with the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible.\\" This is the direct and complete experience of Joyce's art without the restriction of our own frame of reference, history, obligations, and wants. It is intimidating to realize that your own life is changing, that part of your personal history now contains a new day of your own existence - you have extended your life for a day. Many people throughout the world celebrate a second birthday on June 16 (Bloomsday).After publication of \\"Ulysses,\\" I believe that James Joyce (like a few other artists) spent the rest of his life amazed at his creation. As he lay dying in hospital waiting for his wife to return to his bedside, he had to wonder where his inspiration originated, where he summoned the ability to give the gift of another day of life to us all.The reader can benefit most from \\"Ulysses\\" by preparing to read it. Read (re-read) Homers \\"Odyssey.\\" Pay close attention to the structure, the symbolic content, and the psychology of Odysseus. Odysseus was a flawed hero, externally brave but also self-serving and blind to parts of his own personality (like Bloom). Use \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford to help guide you through the detail of theology, philosophy, psychology, history, rhetoric, and the physical layout of Dublin. This reference work is very good because it allows readers to have their own experiences by providing only supplementary content (facts) that help to understand the myriad allusions presented in the text. I suggest that you enjoy the many beautiful styles of prose presented in the 18 episodes pausing to quickly glance at the definitions in your opened copy of \\"Ulysses Annotated.\\" Then before reading the next episode, go back and read the complete explanatory entries in this reference book. Give yourself a couple of months to enjoy the novel and add this new day to your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's great fun to observe the rancorous--at times vicious--debate this book has engendered among and between its admirers and detractors. Whatever else might be said of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it's clear that everyone who has read it (and even those who have not) has an opinion about it. But for those who are leery of beginning a book of this size and complexity without some guarantee that it is as &quot;GREAT&quot; as its admirers proclaim it to be, I offer these words of advice: take it slowly, don't get overly bogged down by the unorthodox style, and make a diligent effort to understand what Joyce is trying to say. It's easy to treat his ramblings as the workings of a drunk or inscrutable genius, and to &quot;force&quot; one's way through the book without getting anything out of it. I read &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the first time last summer, without annotations and with only a brief on-line summary of each chapter as my guide, and I'm sure I missed an awful lot. But I loved &quot;Ulysses&quot; nonetheless. The inventive style, the devious puns, the poetic prose--all of it amounts to a reading experience that will reward the patient and persistent with a tremendous intellectual and aesthetic (if not emotional) payoff. While it is not my favorite book of all time, I agree with those who say it's the most important novel of the twentieth-century. It so completely altered the literary landscape of its day that, 80 years after its publication, its effects are still being felt (but not always acknowledged) in the works of contemporary writers.If you want to read this book only because you've been told it was &quot;great&quot; or to tell others you read it (and thus sound &quot;intelligent&quot;), pick up the Cliffs Notes and save yourself some time. If you honestly want to understand *why* this book is frequently cited as the best of the twentieth century, dig in. I plan to revisit &quot;Ulysses&quot; myself in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When you're dealing with a book as daunting to the casual reader (assuming there is such a thing as a casual reader of this particular book) as James Joyce's Ulysses, you're going to need every break you can get.For years I was put off by the Modern Library's 1961 edition of Ulysses, and with good reason. When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the Modern Library 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses). Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a mystery and a masterpiece. The first time I read it, it was almost a quest of sorts. I had to find something to pass the time during a particularly tedious job that required me to wait against my will every evening for at least one hour. Bit by bit, I proceeded through the text, and found myself entranced and lost in the language. I was a writer at the time, and the attention to detail fascinated me. It also showed me how much I had to learn about language and lyricism. I have reread the book again and again, some sections more than others, and still love it. Every bit. Profane? Hardly. But it has its moments, even by modern standards. Still, the idea of creating such a thing is a thing to be admired."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I informed a co-worker of my intention to read Ulysses, he replied that his grandmother had read it (as it used to be requisite reading) and pronounced it, \\"300,000 words about a man crossing the street\\". That is the sort of dismissal about classical literature that makes me doubly determined to dive in.Much to my dismay, Ulysses turned out to be 300,000 words about a man crossing the street. Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the classical allusions are thought-provoking and on-point. Yes, there is a good deal of lewd behavior and avarice to carry the reader along. Unfortunately Ulysses reminded me why no one writes classical literature any more; its unecessary and outdated verbosity went the way of the Dodo long ago.When I finally reached Molly's narrative I felt like I was a drowning man finally coming up for air, and when I completed the last line I felt I could finally breathe deep. It's not that Ulysses is unreadable; only that there is little reason to read it in its entirety. Find someone who has edited out everything but the dirty jokes and famously coined phrases in their context and read their edition instead. You'll save yourself 40+ hours."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was intimidated at the bulk of ULYSSES, I must admit. But i found myself shocked by it's radiating brilliance. The book is a labor to read, one often has to re-read a paragraph or (god forbid) a chapter to allow the work to truly flow and make sense. Joyce uses beautiful detailed writing of the human mind, all of our peculiar little idiosyncracies and actions that define us as human beings.The greatest feat I've had in my young life is reading the last page and closing the book. You sit back and for hours are confounded as to the brilliance and success of Joyce to write the actions of two characters in a day. Each thought, each subconscious connection and little bits of thinking and reacting are somehow branded into the pages of ULYSSES. I dont think i will ever read such a significant work again. It is bold, it is at times monotonous, at times incoherent, but there are some golden pages were you are sucked into the writing, for the words on the page are your thoughts, your fantasies, your raw human nature.It took me a month to read the book, i read it in the midst of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was able to lose myself in ULYSSES, i was able to walk the streets with Dedalus and Bloom. I was able to sit on the beach and watch the dog sniff around for something he had lost in a past life time. It is a masterpiece while being imperfect, which is an awful lot like being a human being."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't want to elaborate on how hard this book can be to read (I think the other 75 reviews have covered that), but I will say that with Joyce you get out of it what you put into it. Those who love this book rave about its groundbreaking techniques &amp; virtuosity of language. Those who hate this book complain that it is nothing but Joyce showing off &amp; taunting his readers with a book that has no unity or point. This book DOES have a point. All the style in it is only used as means to an end. There are characters. There is conflict (there are several, but I believe the basic conflict is each character struggling with the reality their lives as opposed to what they want their lives to be). There is a climax (and what a climax it is). There is a resolution. This is, at heart, a very sad and haunting book. I think the message in this novel is that we are at the mercy of our lives (i.e. circumstances control us, not vice versa), and that the only way we can deal with the fact that we have no control over our lives is by fooling ourselves. It is a study of the contrast between what we think we are and what we really are. It is saying that the only way people deal with their biggest problems is by running away from them (note the way Leopold Bloom constantly avoids confronting or even thinking about his wife's adultery, and note the way Stephen Dedalus reacts when confronted by his mother; I could cite plenty of other examples). This may be the ultimate truth of life, that we can never face the truth about ourselves. Joyce never states this directly; it is left up to the reader to find for himself. I would be doing this book injustice if I didn't mention that it fleshes out 2 of the most three-dimensional, complete characters in all of literature.This isn't a perfect book: the climax takes place about 200 pages before it ends. I also thought the last chapter, which is probably the most-praised chapter in the book, was disappointing. Joyce apparently tried to create a complete picture of a female character in about 50 pages, when it had taken him 700 pages to create 2 complete pictures of male characters. It threw off the pace of the novel to suddenly get inside the head of a completely different person. Ithaca could have easily been the last chapter, as it summed up all the day's events as opposed to going on to something totally different (which is what the last chapter did).Still, the characters, the themes, and the sheer scope of Ulysses make it as close to perfect as any book can be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I loved Don Quixote, still the greatest of novels. (6 stars!) I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived. (5 stars) For sheer reading pleasure Crime and Punishment beats anything I have ever come across.(5 stars) I enjoyed War and Peace, though to me it was a bit dated and didactic and not nearly as convincing and satisfying as DQ, BK or CP. (4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud. (I read Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man but didn't think it very enjoyable or profound.)Why is it that I can enjoy so many other classic novels yet find Ulysses so repulsive?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is limited to notes on formatting.There is a linked table of contents. All entries in the TOC are in all caps (which always bothers me). But you can jump to any point in the book just fine by following a link.The only other disturbing formatting feature is that there is a blank line between each paragraph in the body text. So with a space = (normal interline spacing + blank line + interline), there's quite a big gap between paragraphs.I think this is required because all the paragraphs are in block indent style (ie, they have 0 left indent on the first line). If you didn't have blank lines between paragraphs, you probably couldn't see the paragraph boundaries easily.Anyhow, there seems to be a LOT (ie, a bit too much) whitespace on each page. I wish they used a normal paragraph indent for the first line, and removed the blank lines between paragraphs."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As for translations of Ulysses, let me tell my Italian friends that Joyce is often hilarious; hope that comes through. (Nel questo libro, Joyce sta scherzando spesso. Spero che suo traduttore non ha tradito, non ha persolo. Alcune delle battute sono stilistica, ma alcuni sono larghi, divertente. Ero un assistente educativo in scuola di specializzazione, e ha contribuito a insegnare in una classe Jocye di Prof Chester Anderson.)I was fortunate to encounter this book after a full, excellent college English major*, so as I read it at leisure during grad school summer, I found it very amusing in the grandest sense. Funny, too. This is a book that benefits from the reader having read most anthology English lit before s/he readsUlysses. Otherwise, one must dive for the footnotes.When one has read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, Ellman's Joyce is also delicious. For example, Joyce received a better grade on his Italian exam than on his English, in official grades when he was qualifying to teach English in Italy (especially Rome and Trieste). He barely qualified in English, but was well qualified in Italian. This gives me pause in an era when we're told that Testing, Testing is the way to improve US Public Ed. This tidbit alone, from Joyce's life, makes one severely doubt it.*Such a major does not even exist now: for example, all of Shakespeare's plays was the standard sophomore English major course, a full year, nineteen plays per semester."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To hold a copy of the original production of ULYSSES is a pleasure.
