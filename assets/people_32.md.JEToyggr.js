All of V.C Andrews's characters seem to be so much alike, they're always beautiful, strong and determined and they usally always get hurt in so many ways. Also all of her books seem to have something in commmon, incest, forbidden loves, and family love.

I consider reading this book, its great!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"WOW! I love this series! Its great even though from what I have heard it has been written by the GW. I made the mistake of buying the books 1 by 1!! Becuase it was so good i kept bugging my mom to take me to buy the next one it kept me up all night reading! Great series! The GW really outdid themselves! I was begining to think that this was really by V.C. Andrews herself! A must read! One of the best series in my opinion"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn's life is turned upside down when she discovers her parents were keeping secrets and have been on the run (without spoiling things, these *parents* are candidates for the biggest pair of dumb*sses ever in a fictional novel). Now she's forced to live with people who resent her and treat her to cruelty piled upon cruelty. To add to the angst, she's also all mixed up inside sexually about the two boys' in her life. Jimmy was raised as her brother and Philip (her boyfriend with the groping paws) who she recently discovers *is* her brother. Ehhh, what a dilemma!I have to admit that I was absolutely riveted to this story while reading despite all of its over-the-top drama and other assorted flaws. Four stars for the keeping-my-attention factor."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After reading the Dollanganger and Casteel books, I pretty much knew what to expect from V. C. Andrews' third series (the Cutler family series). A lot of her stories deal with the rags-to-riches theme, and in \\"Dawn\\", the leading 14-year-old character (Dawn Longchamp) learns that her current impoverished family (which consists of an older brother, Jimmy, a baby sister, Fern, and parents) is not really her own. Dawn is really the daughter of a wealthy family in Richmond, Virginia, who own and operate a prestigious hotel on the coast named Cutler's Cove Hotel. As if that weren't shocking enough, Dawn soon discovers that two of her classmates (Clara Sue and Philip) at Emerson Peabody School are really her siblings--and Philip also happens to be Dawn's boyfriend. The chances of that actually happening are about a million to one, but the taboo of incest is in all of V. C. Andrews' books, whether it's plausible or not.Following the revealed secrets, comes the emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse. Dawn is returned to her \\"rightful\\" family, and she is immediately disliked by her sister Clara Sue, as well as her matriarchal grandmother. Philip, on the other hand, refuses to allow their relation to get in the way of his scoring with her. In the background are Dawn's biological parents, both of whom are pretty delinquent and submit under Grandmother Cutler's command. The only security Dawn has comes from her other \\"brother\\" Jimmy, who later expresses his years of restrained feelings for her, which she reciprocates. (Jeez, if it's not one brother, it's the next.)Even though this book (and series) is pretty good, it's not the most original storyline in the world, nor is Dawn Longchamp-Cutler the greatest heroine I've ever read in a V. C. Andrews book. The ghostwriter (Andrew Neiderman) relies too much on the redundant family drama Ms. Andrews outlined before she died; you can pretty much deduce the surprises laying ahead for the character. Nevertheless, I still find myself drawn to these books. No matter how bad your family life may be (speaking within reason), you can always read a V. C. Andrews book and say, \\"I'm glad I'm not in her shoes.\\"After \\"Dawn\\" comes \\"Secrets of the Morning\\", \\"Twilight's Child\\", \\"Midnight Whispers\\", and \\"Darkest Hour\\". Recommended for V. C. Andrews fans."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Once I read &quot;Dawn&quot; I thought this is the most amazing writer I have ever read from and when I realized the writer wrote the movie &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; that I loved for as long as I could remember I fell in love with anything else she wrote. Like Andrews' other books they usually dark sides them, but I think that's what drew me to them even more along with the mysteries, suspense, hoping that the main character survives whom ever is trying to destroy her, etc. Continuing on about &quot;Dawn&quot;, I read the entire series and a year and a half later I am craving to read it again so after &quot;Orphans&quot; comes out I am going to finish that series and read &quot;Dawn&quot; again. I would also like to add for V.C Andrews if she reads this is that I am hoping for her series to be made into audio tapes and/or miniseries eventhough movies rarely do the book justice, it would still be neat to watch my most loved books on screen."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I'm was so dissappointed in Dawn. I knew what was going to happen to Dawn from the first chapter on to the last. It was so predictable, i.e long lost rich family, incest, a grandmother who hates her, and a weak mother and father. Before it was &quot;revealed&quot; I knew she was dating her brother. I also knew her brother was going to still want to carry on their relationship. And the sister hating her, now that was a stretch of the imagination, NOT! This story was so predictable, maybe because the Andrews family won't let the writers stray to far V.C. Andrews original Flowers in the Attic series."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"DAWN(actually the whole Cutler series) was one of the weakest novels by the author, which I attribute to the ghost writer's &quot;settling into the original author's style&quot;. Many events that took place in the book were exactly the same as those in HEAVEN and FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. I would _not_ recommend DAWN to someone who has never read any of V.C. Andrews novels. However, the novel still had enough originality to keep die hard Andrews fans interested, as well as regular fans. Overall, DAWN had some disappointments, yet the book is still worth a good day's read."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have a few problems with the storytelling of \\"Dawn.\\" First, I've read this book a few times over the years, and I've never quite been able to become a Dawn/Jimmy fan. I just can't get over how quickly she forgot that he was her big brother her entire life until she found out the truth at age fifteen!! And then, she was able to get over Philip as soon as her feet landed on the polished wood floor of Cutler's Cove Hotel. Unbelievable. By the end of the book, she has convinced Jimmy that she can have real feeling of passion for him. I might have been able to climb on board, if it hadn't all happened so quickly. And why can't Philip, the most popular, handsome boy in school get over Dawn? I'm sure he's dated prettier girls before. Please. I gave this book 3 stars because I enjoy the story, I just cannot get into Dawn and Jimmy's romance. And not to mention the weirdness of Grandmother Cutler, who obviously hates Dawn...why does she insist that Dawn be renamed Eugenia, after her beloved little sister? And why was Dawn named that in the first place? It just doesn't make sense to me."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After VC Andrews died, it was left to Andrew Neiderman to finish the four books she had started but did not finish. After he did so, he wrote this book. It is supposed to have been based off notes and outlines left by VC before her untimely death. I know that some people were unhappy with Neiderman for this book and series, but I feel that the Cutler series reflected Neiderman's best efforts. It's clear that he put a lot of effort into this series as compared to his later works... which consist of pretty much anything he did after the Logan series especially Daughter of Darkness and the Gemini, Attic Secrets, April Shadows, Broken Flower, and Heavenstone series.This series was very decent, and I feel that VCA herself would have been pleased with this story though I am sure she would have tweaked it to add more of her personal, inimitable style. If you want to keep reading VCA and have read the Dollanganger and Casteel series, then read this, along with the Landry series. Together, these series make for a good reading experience whether it be from the original author or ghostwriter.Though this book itself leaves a lot of unanswered questions, it is but the first book of five, so you get to explore Dawn's story further (and the deal with Grandmother Cutler) The situations with her real and adopted brother bring a good touch of Gothic and incest to make the series thrilling enough."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book was important for me to read, because it followed Darkest Hour, but all that incest of made me sick!!! Also, Clara Sue isn't even showing her sexy self! Nothing wrong with a little chubbiness!!!!!I really thought that Lillian was going to be THAT sexy blonde MISS AMERICA? Instead she had gone soft... Well with those gorgeous blonde locks turning into a short curl, not the mention her girly ho blue eyes have gone grey, and her sex appeal has lef the building! I HATED GRANDMERE! I miss my GLAMer!Frankly I didn't know how Dawn -as I read on a little birdie told me that she was supposed to be madam of- would inherit the HO (I won't tel)?! Love this book, it left so much to be told?!!!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Every one in our household enjoys these wonderful books by V.C. Andrews. They are very interesting and always a thrill to read."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Let me say that this novel is what got me into reading V.C. Andrews in the first place, though the details of the Cutler series never stuck out in my mind like \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" or \\"Petals on the Wind\\", or the Casteel or Landry series. As for \\"My Sweet Audrina\\", though the story was refreshingly original, I just never connected with the characters like I connected with Catherine Leigh Dollanganger, my favorite V.C. heroine because of her strength and passion. I read the first three Dawn books in three days, I couldn't put them down, I was so drawn into the story, and that is worth a lot.However, what hurt this book is Dawn falling in love with Jimmy (and he with her), who she knew as her brother for the first fifteen years of her life, and the way she was able to just turn off her less than sisterly feelings for Philip just like that didn't make a whole lot of sense either. That kind of thing takes time and even then, especially if you've already been intimate (even if you haven't gone all the way), I don't know if those feelings ever really go away, even if you fall in love with someone else. Actually, I think Jimmy and Dawn getting together is actually weirder than her and Philip getting together, even if they were blood-related. Heaven's story was more believable, in that the boy, Tom, she had loved as her brother, she still loved as her brother, even after she found out they weren't blood-related; and her uncle Troy, with whom she had not only slept with, but already fallen in love with, she loved that way still, even if it is supposedly wrong (I am not sure if there is anything in the Bible about uncles not being able to marry nieces--I have heard it's only wrong if it's aunts marrying nephews, but I'm not sure). I agree with Corinne Foxworth Dollanganger (Cathy's mother from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\") that a lot of rules are man-made, for she and her half-uncle (really her half-brother, as you later find out) married in a church. But I digress.Yes, Jimmy having always wished that Dawn was too pretty to be his sister was much creepier to me than Philip's obsession with her.I've usually found the heroine's love interests in these novels attractive, and though Jimmy was a great guy (not to mention in uniform for awhile), I couldn't get past the stupid name of Jimmy Longchamp. I like James, but that last name needed to go.I think this story was set (at the beginning) in 1978, and were Southern aristocrats really this obsessed with going by first and middle names? I thought it was a bit over the top. They acted like Dawn No-Middle-Name was a weird name. Maybe the GW just had too much fun with names. Authors tend to go overboard with naming their characters sometimes.I did cringe at the description of Laura Sue (a pretty, useless thing, and Dawn's natural mother) as resembling a Dresden doll, and some of the metaphors to the themed titles sounded a bit silly (though I was so into the story, I don't have any examples).I think there are twins in the first five V.C. series (two in the Dollanganger saga and two in the Landry series: Ruby and Gisselle, and Ruby's sons, Jean and Pierre), save the Casteel (though don't quote me on that), which averages over a set of twins per series! I know the GW was trying to copy V.C.'s style, and there's nothing wrong with trying to emulate (for the sake of continuing her legacy, but don't copy!). There have already been two evil Grandmother Olivias, and whereas there was the grandmother Jillian in the Casteel series, there was Lillian in this one. I'm not really complaining about the similarities, as long as the GW gives each character their own voice and personality, but he didn't give Dawn much of a personality (he gave it all to Clara Sue). Now Cathy had a personality!Another similarity is that all the women (save Heaven), have an artistic talent. Out of all the series, the Dollanganger and the Casteel series were the most original and I think that's because they are probably the only two that were the original ideas of V.C. (even though I think she died before finishing the Casteel series).So, even though there are a lot of similarities (and Fern's character added nothing to this series), it is still well worth the time and money I spent on it."},{"Title":"Favorite Poems for Children Coloring Book (Dover Classic Stories Coloring Book)","review":"My little girl loves to color when I read, and I like the coloring page to be related to topic.

I did not know if this would be the best of places to start, as others had mentioned Mises \\"Human Action\\" as a great introduction to Austrian economics as well. If you are in the same situation as I was, let me tell you this is an excellent tome to begin with. Rothbard has added to, and improved upon many of Mises teachings with this work. Rothbard starts with absolute foundation for human action, and from here, builds up his theory piece by piece. Again, I thought I might be in over my head with this book, but the pace is excellent and never leaves the reader behind. Rothbard has taken the Austrian school of thought, reworked many of the ideas, and turned out a much more cohesive and solidified theory of economics based on praxeology. The authors references/annotations appear at the bottom of each page, which I find extremely convenient, as flipping to the back of a 1400 page book every time you wanted additional information would be quite bothersome.I have since completely reworked my views on production, interest, and monopoly theory. Really, this is a stellar piece of work, and I can't do it enough justice with the review here. Suffice it to say, if you have not had an opportunity to read Mises or Rothbard, their ideas will really challenge, and more likely than not, change your perspective on economics in dramatic fashion. I am just sorry that I did not have the opportunity to study the Austrian school more thoroughly in college.The construction of the book is also top notch. After reading, and re-reading, through the book's 1400 pages or so (and subjecting it to other abuses like spilled coffee), the bindings/covers are still holding strong. This is a book that you will want to have for quite some time and revisit often. The margins are also wide enough to add your own annotations, which I love to do with works of this nature."},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"I am a college graduate though not in economics. This book was a beast to read... all 1369 pages of it! The kicker though? I did it... and I actually got some (hopefully a good bit) of it. Rothbard gets the message across even to someone with no real background in economics and in a way that I actually was able to hang in for the entire 1369 pages. I couldn't do it with Mises, I was lost 60 pages into Human Action. This book is not for the faint of heart and you most likely are not going to finish it in an hour and a half, but if you do finish it... you'll come out with a much better understanding of the free market."},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"[This is a reposting, very slightly edited, of my review from six years ago of an earlier and now unavailable edition of this book.]Murray Newton Rothbard's development of economic theory from the axiom of human action is brilliant from start to finish.Building on Ludwig von Mises's masterwork _Human Action_, Rothbard in effect removes Mises's work from its neo-Kantian setting and places it on a foundation of Aristotelian realism (though this fact will not be obvious without study of Rothbard's later work, notably _The Ethics of Liberty_).Rothbard systematically and rigorously develops all of economic theory from the axiom that human beings act to achieve ends in a world in which specific and delimitable causes have specific and delimitable effects. In so doing, he has written a work that, over three decades after its publication, still serves as a comprehensive introduction to Austrian School economics.And no wonder: Rothbard viewed Austrian economics particularly and the 'science of liberty' generally as systematic philosophy, not as the mere collection of statistical facts and 'model-building'. The result is a highly readable volume that reads more like a philosophical treatise than a standard 'economics' textbook.Anyone who loves liberty and thinks _ideas_ are important will love this volume. Keynesians and econometricians need not apply.[Later note: _Human Action_, this book (this edition of which includes the portion originally shaved off and published separately as _Power and Market_), and George Reisman's _Capitalism_ are the twentieth century's Three Great Treatises on free-market economics. They don't always agree with each other, so if this subject is of interest to you, be sure to read all three.]"},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"I will echo what is said in the preface of this book- Since World War I, there have been very few treatises on Economics. Instead, we see lots of attempts to compartmentalize the discipline and obfuscate it beyond all comprehension, rather than extend core economic principles into other fields. The result is that the individuals who actually PARTICIPATE in the economy are discouraged from learning anything about it, and instead rely on economic \\"shamans\\" in government to steer the economy from the top down. If you don't revisit the basics now and then, you will find yourself running off a cliff after embracing a flawed interpretation of theories that nobody bothers to revisit.Just to note, this book has been released for free in electronic form at the mises.org website (epub, pdf, html) for general use.

In 1970, Rothbard's powerful critique of government intervention in the economy, POWER AND MARKET (P&amp;M) was published. However, P&amp;M was originally part of MES. For reasons of length and content (P&amp;M was seen as too radical) MES' original publisher decided not to publish the work as a unified whole.Over 40 years later, the Ludwig von Mises Institute has remedied this sad situation by publishing these works as a whole. Even if you own MES and P&amp;M, you need to get this &quot;scholar's edition.&quot; First, the new version is in hardcover. Second, the endnotes have been converted to footnotes. Third, the new edition contains an excellent introduction by Joseph Stromberg describing in detail the writing of the book, based on documents in Rothbard's papers.I've reviewed MES and P&amp;M on Amazon, so I won't repeat my comments here. Suffice it to say, this is one of the great works of economic scholarship of the twentieth century. No student of liberty will want to be without it."},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"Murray Rothbard's contribution to economic science cannot be overstated. Following the footsteps of Mises' _Human Action_, Rothbard's own treatise leaves no economic question untouched. _Man, Economy and State_ presents the entire corpus of economic law, deduced logically from the undeniable fact of human choice. Because of the Austrian methodology, Rothbard was a system-building rationalist, and so this book has little resemblance to mainstream economics. As a praxeologist, Rothbard builds economics not on models or mathematics, but using primordial logical principles to explore the formal implications of purposeful human behavior. Rothbard not only presented Austrian economics in a systematic, complete way -- he also advanced it considerably. Some examples of his contributions to the hardcore of Austrian economics: he refined the theory of utility, he greatly elaborated and developed theories of production, (although I believe his theory of interest was incorrect), reconstructed the approach to welfare-economics, demolished the illusory free-market monopoly problem, etc. Also crucial to his economic theory was his indepth exploration of violent intervention in the free market. That volume, _Power and Market_, is included here (as it was originally intended). Here, Rothbard drives the final nail in the coffin for virtually any argument that the government do anything positive for the economy. He also recognized that economic and ethical problems have the same, fundamental root: scarcity, without which neither discipline would be at all meaningful. This connection was critical for Rothbard as he developed his political philosophy, which was systematically presented later in _The Ethics of Liberty_ (1982). Considering Rothbard completed this treatise when he was only 36, his level of scholarship is nothing short of incredible. His footnotes are full of treasures.This is truly one of the most important works of economic theory ever written. Indeed, it covers _everything_, and Rothbard's clear, tempered prose is unrivaled in either philosophy or economics. Anyone who is alive should read this book. If you're dead and you can read, well...that's amazing, but still the book won't be much used to you."},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"The individual above who states that time preference is the dirty little secret of Austrian Economics is obviously confused. The example he uses in his review to refute it shows plainly that he misunderstands it. A more carefull reading paying attention to the previous section on means and ends (the definitions) will reveal the problem. This book is excellent! Rothbard was truly a genius. I'm not saying the book is perfect, but I could find no theoretical flaws. If you are interested at all in economics, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market, Scholar's Edition","review":"Murrays epic is not just for economics students and professionals but is written for the curious and mindful go getter as well. It's dry in spots but quite humorous in others and is absolutely authoritative in describing the humanness of market transactions.

Written as a textbook, Rothbard explains in plain words, how an economy functions. This is not a book trying to convince you of the superiority of a particular economic system. Although you will be. This is also an expose on the inconsistencies of Marxism, Keynsianism and the Friedmanites.There are many parts that will cause you pause, concepts you may have been taught or convinced of (monopolies especially) are reframed and given a new dimension.This is a long book (1431 pgs including the index and bibliography), but the writing is crisp and the explanations and examples are excellent.

In clear language Rothbard lays out the basic foundations of economics, such as understanding value scales, and advances to more complex concepts, such as the stages of production, and explains how a free-market would operate. In 'Power and Market' Rothbard explains that, despite what many so-called proponents of the free-market argue, in order to be a completely free-market even governments must be done away with, and explains the numerous ways governments distort and harm the market and all the people that make up that market.This is a very dense book and very intimidating, with it's 1369 pages (minus the bibliography and index), but it is well worth it.

Rothbard's treatise is written more in the style of an economics textbook. Most of the book is an expansion of the economic principles that Mises's expounded in \\"Human Action.\\" Rothbard's brilliant defense of a natural monopoly (as opposed to a government-created one) is alone worth the price of the book.

It developes it (although you don't need to read Human Action for understanding Man, Economy, and State) but adds Rothbard's own contribution.For those knowing the Austrian School, I think Rothbard's book is surprisingly more neoclassic in its analysis than, for example, Human Action. An example is the use of supply-demand graphics.In sum, the book has a lot of pages (1,441) but I think you'll find the basics of a sound economics science in any of them.

The author, Murray Rothbard, was a disciple of Ludwig von Mises, so it's no surprise that his book begins with an a priori analysis of human action and subjective valuation. With this groundwork in place, Rothbard guides the reader through \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" economics and the economics of barter, and then lays out the inner dynamics of an \\"evenly rotating economy,\\" where knowledge is perfect and tastes never change. Only then, equipped with insights from the operation of ideal, unchanging free markets, does Rothbard relax his unrealistic assumptions and analyze real free markets, including markets hampered by government regulation. For the most part, \\"Man, Economy, and State\\" restates and clarifies canonical Misean teachings on time and interest, capital structure, business cycles, monetary theory, entrepreneurship, methodology, and so forth. It also makes original contributions to Austrian thought, in particular, to competition theory. Every university library should have \\"Man, Economy and State.\\"That said, \\"Man, Economy and State\\" is a lousy read and an imperfect introduction to economics. Apart from being more than 1,000 pages long, the book is abstract, repetitive, and tedious. It dismisses economic history and empirical data with sneers and pseudo-logic worthy of a hack lawyer. Thousands of words are wasted explaining concepts that could be illustrated with a single graph; hundreds of pages could be cut without diminishing the book's pedagogical value. Even worse, the book fails to engage with rival schools of thought such as neo-classical or Marxist economics. Austrianism has a rich intellectual tradition, but, like all schools of thought, it has axes to grind, and a beginner would get a skewed view of economics if he relied on \\"Man, Economy and State\\" for his education. He would learn next to nothing about national income accounting, market failure, growth and development, or the behavioral psychology of markets. Austrians shy way from these subjects for various reasons (mostly dogmatic), but they are essential parts of any well-rounded economic education.The book is also undermined by Rothbard's bizarre riffs on law and politics. He believed that legal systems should not protect intellectual property or enforce promises to perform services in the future. (The modern technological economy could not exist in Rothbard's legal universe.) He would have criminalized the non-payment of debt, thus re-establishing debtors' prisons. (The impact on modern credit markets would have been interesting). Rothbard also had an absolutist, super-Lockean view of property rights. He claimed, for example, that the first fisherman to dip his net into the ocean would be entitled not just to own any fish he caught, but to own the ocean itself!Coming across these dicta is like finding astrology in a physics textbook. At first, I laughed, but as the weirdness piled up, I began to wonder about the book and its author. The sheer monomaniacal bulk of \\"Man, Economy and State\\" makes it easy to caricature Rothbard as a genius/crank, who scribbled away over the 1950s to write a mammoth book -- an Austrian Summa -- that would be the last word on economics. He submitted his masterwork to mainstream publishers and university presses, but none would publish it, for reasons that become obvious by, oh, page 750. In the end, the book was published by an obscure right-wing publisher who did not edit the text (beyond tossing out a 300-page postscript that was published as a separate book by a different right-wing publisher). After giving birth to \\"Man, Economy and State,\\" Rothbard was ignored by the economics profession. He taught at minor colleges, preached anarchism to the lunatic fringe of the libertarian movement, and published articles in journals edited by himself. He died in 1995. It's unfair to depict him as the Kilgore Trout of 20th century economics -- but since he believed that defamation laws violated free market metaphysics, he really couldn't complain.Bottomline: The Mises Institute would do Austrian economics (and Rothbard's reputation) a favor by publishing an abridged version of \\"Man, Economy and State.\\" Readers coming to economics for the first time should read an introductory mainstream text (Samuelson is still pretty good) and then sample modern Austrian authors like Israel Kirzner or Roger Garrison to see what the Austrian alternative is all about. After that, they can tackle old, quasi-philosophical Austrian texts like \\"Man, Economy and State\\" or works by Carl Menger or Ludwig von Mises."},{"Title":"My Journals and Sketchbooks","review":"This collection of diary entries and sketches records the industrious and ingenious day-to-day efforts of Crusoe's life on the island.

So I was intrigued when I heard the author this summer speak about his \\"energy grid\\" (which he calls it the Energy Internet). Granted his terminology seemed a little....1990s, but his point made sense: if we were all sharing off the same energy grid, the market would reward those who used less energy and extract from those who use more. And like the internet, the \\"energy internet\\" can reroute itself around a problem. (Take that, Ohio!)What I loved most about this book is that it's not aimed at granola crunchy people. It's also not aimed at the NPR / anti-SUV crowd. I think It's written for the \\"armchair skeptic\\" like myself. I'm not stupid enough to think that BP wants to save the world. But I think those ads are meant to influence how we think about energy providers.We all know that many of the real energy costs aren't being addressed in today's pump prices-- the environment, Enron, Iraq, etc. But the author explains that it's because the real market price ISN'T being represented that we're in such a sorry state. Well, lots of right-wing books contain the \\"market will solve all of our problems\\" premise and I would have expected as much from someone who writes for the Economist. But this book doesn't always give the answers that you'd expect. In fact, it was pretty harsh on a few companies who would have probably liked to use him as a poster boy.Granted, his book title makes it seem like Energy will solve many of the world's problems-- that's just the title. But i'm pretty impressed how well he supported his \\"save the planet\\" / environmental stance-- it seemed a bit far-fetched at first. But what he's really talking about is pollution credits and developed / developing world stuff. With India and China's rapid economic growth, the environment took a big hit and it affects all of us.If I have a small complaint about the book, it's that the author sometimes seems a little too \\"rah rah\\" about the \\"new revolution\\". (the book title alone makes me cringe a bit). I don't disagree that cheap and efficient hydrogen energy may change the world, I just think that real revolutions are fairly incremental intially and we only realize how incredible they are after we start to reap the benefits. Proclaiming the energy \\"revolution\\" and talking about the \\"energy internet\\" may have gotten people excited in the New Economy, but we're in the Old New Economy now.I give this book 5 stars because I'm not the kind of person who would read books on energy and I actually enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"For an overview of up-and-coming sources of energy for the new millennium you can't do much better than this book, but beware of its very optimistic and not always realistic examinations of the politics and economics of energy. As a policy expert, Vaitheeswaran certainly has keen insights into what is going on in energy today, from actual vs. perceived shortages in fossil fuels to the latest cutting-edge research into new technologies such as fuel cells. Here you will get great insights into how the current market works, with some in-depth debunking of popular assumptions concerning issues like the California crisis in 2000-01, or the true political machinations and motivations of OPEC. Vaitheeswaran ably documents how humans will continue to have access to reliable energy, in whatever form, and that world society is hardly on the brink of a major catastrophic shortage.However, this book loses steam significantly when Vaitheeswaran starts to analyze the possible political and economic tools that will be necessary to keep the future energy market healthy. Basically, he is dangerously close to the dogma of the free market and free trade as the cure for all ills. Yes, as Americans we know that intelligently managed markets are essential. However, after fruitfully explaining how current energy markets are distorted by cronyism, tax breaks, subsidies, corporate welfare, and other inequitable political shenanigans, the possibility of such distortions is strangely missing from Vaitheeswaran's analyses of future trends. It's as if the free market, once allowed to roll, would suddenly create a perfect world devoid of human corruption, and not just in market-savvy America. This is the unrealistic message overall - a corrupt present shall be replaced by an unrealistic free market utopia around the world. And generally, in attempting to cover all sides of these issues from the point of view of everyone from radical environmentalists to fossil fuel plutocrats, Vaitheeswaran ultimately fails to land squarely in any camp, which saps the power from many of his conclusions. While much of this book is quite useful in describing exciting new technologies, sunny optimism often blinds the reader from dirtier realities.

The good news is that his journalistic account of the energy problem is breezy and easy to read. The bad news is that it is not so much an objective overview of the topic as it is a religious tract from the Church of the Free Market. Vaitheeswaran really pulls you into his optimistic account at times, but regularly slips in sarcastic digs at environmentalists and ecologists that remind you of his ideological bias. What really caused me to question his analysis, though, was his total dismissal of the oil geologists. I personally put much more stock in the projections of the geologists, following Hubbert, than I do in the economists, who always bring to mind Richard Feynman's skeptical view that economics & other social sciences are all voodoo.I give this book a favorable review regardless, because it is a good introduction to a particular point of view. Without being a market dogmatist, I think Vaitheeswaran has sound points to make about the failure of energy deregulation in California, for instance. He reveals that Britain and Scandinavia (of all places!) have pursued energy deregulation with great success, and argues that it was not deregulation per se that failed, but rather a botched attempt. The first four chapters address \\"market forces.\\" Vaitheeswaran makes the case that global warming is real and calls for a shift away from carbon-based fossil fuels in the second three chapters. Here, he takes a strong position in favor of carbon taxes, which will not endear him to the anti-tax Republicans, and reveals that his view, while pro-market, is more sensible than most acceptable debate in the U.S. (I do wonder, though, whether he and his editors have read much by Herman Daly and the other ecological economists, who include basic physics in their equations?)When it comes to the last four chapters on energy technology, Vaitheeswaran has some very interesting things to say, based on his access to the corporate boardrooms. I am encouraged by the shift of Shell and BP (British Petroleum) toward renewable energy research, and no doubt the U.S. oil companies will reluctantly follow suit. The possibility of a decentralized power system, with inputs from local fuel cells, is quite astounding, and it carries some weight coming from the Economist.I am by no means convinced that the \\"magic of the market\\" will bring the world a happy ending to the problem of the finite reserves of oil and natural gas, which are approaching their global Hubbert's Peak. But if markets and far-sighted corporations can be part of the solution, that's great. If we could bring the European view of markets, incorporating carbon taxes, or green taxes, to the U.S. that would be a big step in the right direction!See my list THE CLEAN/RENEWABLE ENERGY REVOLUTION for more on the topics of oil and energy."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"I bought the book hoping to get a book filled with serious and reliable facts catered in a manner, which was portrayed by reviewers as highly entertaining and educational. Instead the book presents well-known facts and rehashes numerous assumptions, which were either proven wrong by other authors or caused other scientists to arrive at entirely different conclusion. The author should know better. I give the author credit of trying to convey an upbeat message that the human spirit and economic forces will prevail in \\"saving the planet\\".I appreciate the authors respect when speaking about our political leaders and his objection about ideological bashing of corporations and politicians. The author however turns around and ridicules groups of oil experts and calls them a \\"gang\\" which advocates that the undiminished availability of oil is a stake in the very foreseeable future. The author himself does not discuss the issue of oil depletion other than saying \\"if true\\" it would cause a very serious problem. With his background in engineering the author should have reviewed and discussed, in earnest, the work by the experts he ridicules and such experts as Hubbert, Simmons, Goodstein, etc.. The author should know that even respectable industry leaders and scientists with high credential present the oil depletion issue in a more rational way - instead he suggests only one source which comes from the same academic background as he does.There are a lot of books published at this time, which address the issue of the energy future in a better and more concise way. The reader who wants to be educated more than entertained might look for another book."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"This book is as excellent an introduction to the topic of the future of energy as any book on the market. This statement, however, is more a reflection of the lack of alternatives to Power to the People as it is of the book's own strengths. To be certain, it is a well-written and smartly researched book. One would expect nothing less from a writer from The Economist. It's strongest point is to so thoroughly make the case for why the energy sector must change in the next decades. The pollution and inefficiency that the modern subsidization of the carbon-based energy economy creates harms global welfare. However, its greatest weakness is to skimp on the details as to how the energy sector should transform itself. This book does not go into how solar energy works, or what government policies concerning wind energy should be. In fact in doesn't even survey the prospects for renewable energy, by say, arguing that solar cells are the future. Rather it puts forth a well reasoned case that the days of carbon-based fuels must end, and that governments must stop the carbon subsidy and research alternatives. End of story. In fact its most interesting chapters don't concern energy at all but have to do with reconciling the philosophies of capitalism with those of environmentalism, as task that the author does quite well. A good starting point for those interested in the future of energy, but if you're looking for more specific forecast of how global energy production will or should be composed in the future, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"I read this book because I wanted an introduction to energy issues and because Vaitheeswaran writes for The Economist, my favorite news periodical. I loved it. The author conducts a fact-filled tour of old energy (oil), new energy (hydrogen) and many of the characters, companies and countries working in the biggest industry of them all. If you like the journalistic style of The Economist, then you will surely enjoy this book. It is densely factual, tempered in presentation, and very credible. As a bonus, unlike the Economist (which doesn't seem to promote individual journalists), the author introduces himself into the story on precious few occasions and it's usually in a hilarious and self-deprecating way; e.g., one day while visiting Los Angeles, he keeps missing appointments because his electric vehicle can't keep a charge.The book is perceived as optimistic because the author hopes that liberalized markets (first section) combined with environmentalism (second section) will promote technologies (third section) that inexorably but gradually shift us from carbon-based fossil fuels to cleaner, more efficient fuels. And he's placing his bets on a portable hydrogen fuel cell that can plug into both your house and your car, and whose only byproduct is water vapor.But the author does not euphorically see this future as necessarily destiny; you just know the publisher slapped the marketing sub-title on the cover. If entrepreneurial technologists are the heroes of his drama, then governments are the closest thing to villains. In the case of markets, he shows that California's failed electricity experiment was the wrong kind of deregulation (because regulators unwisely capped retail rates and saddled consumers and new entrants with the cost of so-called stranded investments). He reminds us that competitive markets require a \\"vigilant regulator and proper price signals\\" (i.e., deregulation does not mean \\"no regulation\\"). In the case of environment, the author seems more worried. He makes a case that global warming is a real issue worthy of action. After he expertly presents the facts (e.g., concentrations of CO2 are increasing), he concludes with a historical parallel-concerning climate phenomenon that are not fully understood but potentially devastating-that is positively chilling: new scientific evidence now shows that we previously underestimated the effects of ozone layer depletion, and if not for the flexible Montreal protocol signed almost two decades ago, the effects would have been much deadlier. Here again, interestingly, he sees myopic politics as the culprit (as global warming is a reverse public good without current, individual constituents) and prefers to put his faith in market economics. He claims that truly free markets will somehow tend to promote more efficient, less polluting companies.The technology section is, believe it or not, entertaining. I doubt he can satisfy everybody here and I am not qualified to question his virtual neglect of solar power and his uncharacteristically decisive, cynical verdict concerning the future of nuclear power. His big theme for the future is \\"small is beautiful\\"-specifically, miniature fuel cells, small distributed power producers, and even he says, small hydro-projects instead of large destructive dams.I totally agree with someone's idea that he could have helped with some charts, but not because the book lacks quantitative data. It does not. But some of the data could have been rendered more memorable in chart form; e.g., oil reserves by country, fuel efficiency statistics. Also, he doesn't really cover the stalled Bush energy bill or the Clean Skies Initiative, which is disappointing but I guess he finished the book before these were introduced. Mere quibbles for an otherwise outstanding book."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"i'm not an energy junkie, but i LOVED this book!!! the author takes on a very important subject--the juice on which our society runs and the future of our planet, and creates a terrific and absorbing book. he takes a broad perspective, looking at energy in terms of markets and the environment and technology, and this is the only book that i know of that looks at all three. i liked the relish that he has he seems to enjoy poking holes in conventional wisdom coming from all parties, whether its old energy oil industry dinosaurs or environmentalist-sky-is-falling pessimists. i also liked the previews of what's coming down the pipe. like his columns in the Economist, he's sure to piss a lot of people off, but his arguments seem, to this general reader, to be well grounded. its a fun read, as he's a good writer, and i particularly enjoyed the fun stuff about the futuristic hydrogen economy. very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"Debates about the environment, more so than other topics, tend to be hijacked by political agendas and ideological entrenchments, leaving laymen with no clear understanding of where we are or where we are headed. \\"Power to the People\\" is an exception to that rule. Vijay Vaitheeswaran, a mechanical engineer and the energy and environment correspondent for The Economist, brings a sensible and interdisciplinary perspective and looks clearly into the future of energy.According to Mr. Vaitheeswaran, there are two trends that are transforming the energy world: the decentralization of supply and the liberalization of markets. The former signals the move away from the grid and other economies-of-scale type power generators that place a premium on big size. The future of energy will be towards micropower, which is flexible and produced as close to the point of consumption as possible.Even more important is the liberalization of the energy market. Carbon taxes, for example, are necessary to account for the environmental effects of carbon-based energy sources. But this liberalization cannot be half-hearted as it was in California, Mr. Vaitheeswaran warns; not only is it important to \\"get prices right,\\" but it is also vital to dispel the notion that energy is too important to be left to the markets.Once these two conditions are in place, it is very likely that we can reach some zero emissions utopia. Mr. Vaitheeswaran places his money on hydrogen and for good reason. But there is no hope, he cautions, of getting there unless we understand that the energy market behaves just like any other market, where correct pricing and innovation are the only way to provide people with the kind of energy they want."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"If you are looking for a relentlessly optimistic market-oriented analysis of the energy future, this is the book for you.

If, however, you are looking for a well-reasoned resonse to the arguments of Kenneth Deffeyes, Hubbert's Peak, David Goodstein's, Out of Gas, or Richard Heinberg's, The Party's Over, you will be disappointed. Vaitheeswaran never addresses their arguments. Rather, he dismisses them without so much as a by your leave. For example his analysis of the question as to whether we are facing an age of sharply increasing energy costs due ever decreassing rates of recovery of fossil fuels consists of a series of quotes from the optimists. His conclusion? Don't worry, be happy!

It is timely also because the book removes much of the woolly way of thinking that has clogged the roadway which the book vividly charts. The book has caught bull by the horn and reigned it in by suggesting how markets and technology can be combined to work well for providing power to people. Countries and communities looking for new and additional sources of power can benefit by following and adapting this roadway, more so if short of fossil fuels and yet desirous of bringing light to villages and promoting productivity, sustainable development and economic growth.At the Roman Forum, we ponder over the key messages of the book, especially after our President has read all its 358 pages -unusually without being bored. We find that the book deals with creative development by harnessing science and technology for harmony between humanity and the environment, as we profess in our mission. It demonstrates that better environment and more power are possible. The hydrogen fuel cell technology is one example. Another is that of market driven forces, which are banefully tamed in a manner that they work against the release of so much power that the planet has in its elements -polluter-pays-principle, CDM and half-baked Kyoto protocol notwithstanding. Instead, as the book points out, these forces can and should be liberated and drawn upon for providing energy in an efficient and affordable manner and yet avoiding costly subsidies that only sustain fossilized technologies and systems that have little merit on the basis of true costs and benefits -economic, environmental and social. So much cheating so far, but no more, if we heed the message about the beginning of change that should be fostered.The book is based on scientific analyses of the situation in an easily understandable manner in order to provide pragmatic solutions to the energy crisis, often aggravated by controversial concerns about carbon emissions, climate change and fossil fuel supplies. The book is objective and provocative, drawing upon extremes of opinion ranging from the Malthusian doom and gloom through to pro-activist must-oppose culture. Without dismissing anyone -neither Bjorn Lomborg nor Arundhati Roy and the likes that so many have done, he enlightens the entire arena of power paradigms, issues and conflicts of interest and yet ends up with logical solutions that can address both the problems of poverty and the environment by providing positive scenarios of power accessible to needy and all alike. CSOs as well as corporate, national and global governance can take several leaves out of the book.It is difficult to sum up this magnum opus of the year, starting from the bygone past, assessing the present on the anvil, and steering into the future energy. The vision offered by the book is one reason why this book is for all those interested in understanding and promoting policies and programs for the planet's power and prosperity in a harmoniously holistic manner. It is thus that we hereby offer a challenge to the author, the Mississauga Hydrogen cell pioneers and critics of current paradigms, among others, to pass by for a colloquium on the theme at the Roman Forum. We are prepared to have the book as a basis for disseminating our complex creative development message for reducing poverty by providing power to people in an environmentally appropriate and cost-effective manner. That could be a contribution towards achieving the most meaningful Millennium Development Goal, whether or not the UN and its UN Development Program are listening.Meanwhile, we recommend the book full five stars.Antonio Tamburrino and Maharaj Muthoo, Roman Forum, Rome (www.rforum.org) (romanforum2@virgilio.it; muthoo@rforum.org)"},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer.

Cleverly written, but perceptive. Some of the comments that stick in my mind may not be the most important points in the book. (Vaitheeswaran's account of when he met Cindy Crawford and she said \\"the three words men most want to hear\\" was pretty funny.) But the thoughts in the book as a whole all hang together. They persuade, if not necessarily convince.Contrast this with Internal Combustion, by Edwin Black, a book that I also read recently. His book draws on a wealth of research. And I agree with many of the principles he builds up from the facts. But Black's book ultimately does not hang together. Black draws basic conclusions from the facts that the facts do not support.

During the mid 70's, as a school kid, I remember the big campaign launched by oil companies in India -\\" Save that drop of oil, or walk to your destination 20 years from now\\". Thanks to the crisis in the middle-east, the rest of the world was starving for oil. Economies slowed down, inflation rose and unemployment hurt. One commodity that we rely on to drive down to our destinations, whose availability is unfortunately skewed could virtually halt the rest of the world. OPEC continues to control the valve through which most of the world's oil flows. This is a political issue that affects economies globally.If we assume that oil is abundantly available, then we are faced the problem of the resulting pollution and global warming that our machines create. We then need to think of an alternate energy source that is free from political and environmental sensitivities.This book is an excellent analysis of the global energy scene from the perspectives of deregulation, environmental issues and the research on new technologies that are capable of providing cheap, clean and reliable sources of energy.Vijay has brought to the table his extensive and in-depth knowledge of the subject and also the views of key people in the field. The book has been divided into logical chapters and each one is a topic of discussion by itself. His comparison of energy sources, consumption patterns and technology access across the developed and the developing worlds is superb. The rich nations have a role and an obligation to help the poorer nations to access nonpolluting technologies. At many places the book provides the latest figures on pollution rates, energy consumption and economic indicators that support the analysis.Hydrogen is the winner in the race and search for the fuel of the future. If the internet connects millions of computes that share information, soon we will have an energy internet that shares and trades clean energy. Maybe, energy might become even free. After all hydrogen is abundantly available on earth.Fuel cells seem to be emerging as a disruptive technology. Imagine devices like laptops, palmtops and mobile phones powered by small fuel cells that can be run on alcohol.

One gets an immediate taste of this point-of-view early on, when Vaitheeswaran spends an entire chapter debating whether it makes more sense to place one's trust in an Enron-type corporate model, or that of Exxon...And while many would dispute his characterization of the so-called past \`\`successes'' of electric deregulation, one cannot not but admire the enthusiam for which Vaitheeswaran expounds on its future potential.An example: Vaitheeswaran often cites the wonders of electric deregulation in Texas. In point of fact, one can easily argue that electric rates are demonstrably higher than they would otherwise have been under the old regulated system. It's also an undisputable fact that retail competition has only taken hold in two parts of Texas: around Dallas and around Houston. Statewide, only about 10 percent of residential consumers (as of 2004) have decided to jump to an electric competitor.Such low participation, a lack of real competition and higher prices -- one might argue -- do not equal ''success''. There have been other concerns raised about deregulation in Pennsylvania -- another of the so-called success stories cited by Vaitheeswaran.Nonetheless, Vaitheeswaran's identification of micropower and hydogen-based fuel cells as important energy sources of the future could likely be prescient. Such energy sources could help save the Dallas area from its current power crunch. Because of environmental rules and difficulty acquiring right-of-way, there are no easy ways to build new power plants around Dallas, nor easy ways to pump in extra power from the outside. Micro-power could very well be the answer...Overall, Power to the People is a provocative book. It's also a wonderfully fast and easy read. Vaitheeswaran's optimism for the future is infectious... Power to the People is a must-read for anybody interested in energy policy, the environment, and the liberalization of energy markets."},{"Title":"Power to the People : How the Coming Energy Revolution Will Transform an Industry, Change Our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet","review":"Vijay argues that economic growth and prospertiy does not have to always lead to more pollution and degradation of the environment, we are not running out of fossil fuels and Saudi Arabia's dominance over world transportation infrastructure cant be easily challenged.

Indeed, these may be the most interesting and candid texts ever written by Lenin, and also the least overtly ideological. The most sensational letters in this collection weren't published until 1956, when Khrushchev launched his \\"de-Stalinization\\". In his so-called Testament, Lenin explicitly wants Stalin to be removed from the post as Secretary General of the Communist Party. This document was too hot to handle, and was known only to the party leadership until Stalin's death made it possible to declassify it.However, the other classified letters are really just as sensational. Thus, Lenin seems to be suggesting that the USSR should become a much looser union, with Moscow only dealing with matters of foreign diplomacy and military defence, while internal matters should be taken care of by the Soviet republics (the republics were the Soviet equivalent to US states). True, his suggestion isn't very worked out, and he wants to keep a single Communist Party across the entire USSR. Since the party had most of the effective power, it's difficult to see how this would *really* lead to a looser union. Yet, it's nevertheless interesting that Lenin makes such a proposal, and here as well, his criticism is at least indirectly levelled at Stalin. The letter was prompted by The Georgian Affair, a conflict between Stalin and the Georgian Communists, who wanted a certain amount of autonomy from Moscow. However, the implications were much broader. Lenin explicitly and rather passionately condemns Greater Russian chauvinism and believes that non-Russians should get more extensive rights (including language rights). He also connects this to the need for revolutions in China, India and the Middle East, revolutions Lenin believed would be more or less nationalist. Therefore, a policy of concessions to the non-Russians even in the USSR was necessary.Another remarkable article, published already at the time, deals with co-operatives. It was written in 1923. Lenin proposes the gradual organization of the entire Russian peasantry on co-operative lines, and says that this is \\"all that is needed\\" to build socialism! The idea of a network of co-operative farms and shops in the countryside is clearly connected to the New Economic Policy (NEP). Lenin believes that the NEP must be extended to ten or twenty years. What makes the article interesting is that Lenin doesn't seem to be treating NEP as a retreat, but rather sees its extension into co-operative forms as a novel way of building socialism, i.e. an offensive strategy.Strictly speaking, none of these policies were implemented after Lenin's death. Bukharin was the foremost proponent of the NEP, but the new economy was dominated by kulaks and middlemen, rather than by co-operatives. Bukharin did extend language rights for non-Russians (sometimes with humorous results - for instance, the Russian-dominated labour unions in the Ukraine were expected to deliberate in Ukrainian), but overall, the Soviet Union stayed just as centralized as before. And, of course, Stalin was never removed from his position as Secretary General, with well known results.In other articles, Lenin admits that most of the Soviet state apparatus isn't particularly Communist or proletarian! Rather, the Communist regime has simply taken over the old Czarist bureaucracy. It's an apparatus dominated by \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"petty bourgeois\\" elements. But what should be done about it, then? At one point, Lenin proposes that the Central Committee and the Control Commission should select more working class members, real manual workers who haven't turned bureaucratic. Lenin also wants the state bureaucracy to become more efficient, more along West European or North American lines. If these measures would really have solved the problems is, of course, another matter entirely...The proposals in \\"The last letters and articles\\" turned out to be too little, too late."},{"Title":"Irresistible Prince (Royal Weddings) (Harlequin Silhouette Romance)","review":"The Irrestible Prince by Lisa Kaye Laurel~ Silhouette Romance #1293 ~ April 1998The Royal Weddings series ~ Book#3 of 3This is the final book in Ms. Laurel's Royal Wedding trilogy and I found it a very enjoyable read.

Camus.Despair and negation predominate in Georges Simenon's \\"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By\\", a book that I considered to be darker than noir.Simenon was nothing if not prolific in both his literary and public life. Born in Belgium in 1903, Simenon turned out hundreds of novels. Simenon's obsession with writing caused him to break off an affair (he was prolific in this area of his life as well) with the celebrated Josephine Baker in Paris when he could only write twelve novels in the twelve month period in which they were involved. Although perhaps best known for his Inspector Maigret detective novels, Simenon also wrote over a hundred novels that he referred to as \`romans durs' (literally \\"hard novels\\"). As with many of his contemporaries such as Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books were marketed and sold as popular, pulp fiction. Also like Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books have stood up well over time. The New York Review of Books publishing division has reissued much of Simenon's books. They are well worth reading and \\"The Man Who Watch Trains Go By\\" is an excellent place to start.The story's protagonist and narrator is Kees Poppinga. As the book opens Kees is seen and sees himself as a stolidly middle-class Dutch citizen living a life of relative comfort in the coastal town of Groningen. He is secure in his job as the manager of a ship's supply company. His sense of security is reflected in an attitude best described as smug and more than a bit conceited. On the surface, Kees' life seems well insulated from the harsher side of life. But Simenon shows us quickly that this appearance of security was really a thin veneer that could be washed away at a moment's notice. One night, Kees discovers that his company's owner has driven the company into bankruptcy. Kees will soon be out of the job and will likely lose everything he holds dear.The rest of the book focuses on Kees' decent from smug satisfaction to nihilism and despair. Stripped of his middle-class sense of security Kees finds that he is also stripped of all those societal restraints that most civilized members of society have. Kees embarks on a journey of death, deceit, and madness. The only character trait that remains is one of conceit and superiority as he travel to Paris and falls in with the Parisian underworld.The reader experience this journey through the narration of Kees and Simenon does an excellent job of allowing the reader to look out at the world through the eyes of a madman. It is something of an uncomfortable feeling but it made for compelling reason. I have already compared Simenon to Chandler and Hammett because they wrote in a similar genre and were contemporaries. As far as contemporary writers are concerned, the French-writer Michel Houellebecq (Elementary Particles) seems remarkably similar in both tone and style.I have now read two of Simenon's romans durs and three of his Inspector Maigret mysteries. They have all been worth reading and if you are interested in either the detective genre or the type of dark psychological novel described here, Simenon is well worth discovering. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"This book stands as evidence of the literary crime that has been perpetrated against the legacy of Georges Simenon over the last century. Written in 1938, 'The Man Who Watched Trains Go By' predates Camus' 'l'etranger' by eight years. Simenon's work is the study of what happens when a once uber-respectable bastion of bourgeois values watches as the very foundations of his existence crumble before his eyes. The pace at which the novel's central figure degenerates from an upstanding business leader obsessed with managing appearances to a bestial creature succumbing to every whim and fancy--all the while meticulously recording each step of his progress in his little red notebook--is dizzying. The questions raised by Simenon regarding man's confrontation with the ephemeral nature of meaning in existence are addressed at least as skillfully as Camus would nearly a decade later. This work--and many of Simenon's other romans durs--remain an essential link in the chain of existential novels ranging from Dostoevsky to Camus and Sartre. The fact that Simenon's works are not celebrated as such represents a significant injustice."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Kees Popinga, a conventional Dutch family man, learns that his employer has bankrupted the firm, thus depriving him of both income and savings. With all the underpinnings of his life gone, he suddenly takes one of those trains he had been watching for so long and goes to Paris, committing a more or less accidental murder along the way. The rest of the book shows him on the run, wanted by the police of two countries.Although Simenon is most famous as the author of the Inspector Maigret mysteries, and there is certainly a police investigation in this book, the story is told from the point of view of the criminal, not the detective. There is no mystery here; Popinga leaves more than enough evidence to be identified easily, and he soon starts writing letters to the papers and the police. Even the term \\"on the run\\" is wrong; \\"on the walk\\" would be more appropriate, for Popinga remains icily calm. Although the press describe him as a madman, he has never felt more in control; it was his previous bourgeois life that was the lie, not this one.Why does Simenon choose a Dutch protagonist and set the opening of his novel in the far North of Holland? As a French-speaking Belgian, it seems he despised the phlegmatic Flemish and Dutch temperament, and viewed their smug respectability as the death of the soul. For Kees Popinga, nearing 40, epitomizes the family values. He is a good provider, with a solid job; he has a good house in a good neighborhood, equipped with the most modern appliances; he has two perfectly-spaced children that he sends to good schools, and a wife who is so faceless that she is referred to from beginning to end as Mother. Yet, as Luc Sante describes it in his fine introduction to the NYRB edition (though NOT to be read before the novel itself), \\"whatever pin was holding Popinga together has been pulled out.\\" Like a grenade, he explodes.But unlike a grenade, he does so gradually, retaining traces of his bourgeois habits to the end. Clerklike, he keeps a meticulous notebook of his doings. Although described as a sex fiend, his relationships with the women he picks up are almost sexless. He approaches his life as a wanted man with the same care he might have used to organize an office. This is the second of Simenon's so-called \\"hard novels\\" (romans durs) that I have read, after his earlierTROPIC MOON. Both are relentless psychological studies of men who lose their hold on normal life. But whereas the earlier book was as hot as its African setting, the hardness here is that of ice; imagine a Balzac or a Dostoyevsky describing an inevitable degeneration, but in compressed form and without the passion. Chilling.All the same, I preferred TROPIC MOON, because of the wider sweep of its indictment of colonialism. There is social criticism here too, of a certain ideal of respectability; but that is less easily localized . . . and perhaps just a little too close to home."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"He was a quiet man. That's what they always say about the guy who one day picks up an axe and wipes out the whole family. Kees Popinga, the central character of Georges Simenon's The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, is just such a fellow. He's got everything dialed nice and tight. He's obsessed with having constructed a first rate life: a wife, a daughter, a stove, and a house all of the \\"highest quality.\\" And then in the course of one evening, as Popinga discovers that the company that helped provide this postcard-perfect life is now bankrupt, it all goes to pot. Kees Popinga snaps, kisses his whole life goodbye in one bold stroke, and embarks on a violent spree that leads him across three countries and makes him the killer du jour of the European press.Thus, Simenon rendered one of his best roman durs, or hard novels, so named because they involve uncomfortable situations. The pacing of the novel is impeccable; Simenon allows the reader no breathing room. Perhaps it was due to the fact that The Man Who Watched Trains Go By was Simenon's eleventh novel published in 1938. That's right, eleventh. Simenon's reputation for cranking out the prose is almost unparalleled. His record was 40 novels published in 1929 (all written under various pseudonyms according to Luc Sante's introduction). Once Popinga has made up his mind to leave his old life, we are dragged by the shirt collars along with this once simple man, as he drifts further and further into madness. The bodies start to pile up and in no time, Popinga has changed from an accidental madman to a cold-calculating psychopath.Popinga's psyche is at the heart of The Man Who Watched Trains Go By. While not told in first person, we are stuck in Popinga's brain throughout the novel. We see the reaction of Popinga's wife, as he suddenly starts to behave in un-husbandly ways, or the mocking laughter of the prostitute, Pamela, that drives Kees over the edge. As Popinga gets to the point of no return, choosing to engage in a game of cat and mouse with the French police, we are there in his skull, seeing Popinga's deranged motives and actions laid out before us. We see how we reacts to lies printed about him in the press (an especially sore sticking point that causes him to start addressing the French papers directly). We feel his mistrust of the underworld characters who cross his path (and him). We feel his rage at the lack of respect he feels from the police, especially Commissioner Lucas. All the while, we are feeling what Popinga feels, a credit to Simenon's ability to give the madman all-too-familiar psychological shortcomings.It is with wonderful irony that Popinga's rampage, deemed a product of madness by the press, becomes a game of chess between him, the authorities, and the underworld. An avid chess player, with a noted streak for being a sore loser, Popinga considers himself a superb tactician. We see him calculate scenarios, possible reactions, and end-game maneuvers, all the while convinced of his assured victory. And in the end, you become addicted to Popinga's madness, caught up in his scheme, greatly anticipating every turn of the page.Chalk it up to a highly skilled writer who knew his craft, and more importantly, his characters. As Sante, details in his introduction, Simenon had a somewhat unorthodox approach to concocting his stories:\\"On a large yellow envelope he would, over the course of a week or two, write the names of his characters and whatever else he knew about their lives and backgrounds: their ages, where they had gone to school, their parents' professions. The envelope might additionally contain street maps of the novel's setting, although it would never say a word about the book's eventual plot. Once he was satisfied with these notes, he would enter the hermitage of his study and knock off the book at the rate of a chapter every morning.\\"One can see how Simenon's writing routine infuses Popinga with so much life. We know this man. Most of us have worked with him at one time or another. The fellow who is perfectly content and sedentary in his quiet suburban existence. Simenon, having laid out his pedigree prior to the novel, wastes no time stripping him of the illusion of his worth as an adult and father, turning him into a cold-calculating human animal that bears no resemblance to the content, puffed-up Popinga we are introduced to at the beginning of the novel.Over the course of this short and punchy tale, Simenon leaves us with a very dark and disturbing exploration of a former sheep who attempts to change his entire existence, remaking himself as a the wolf. In the end, Popinga never turns out to be as smart or as ingenious as he hopes. He wants to love women, but can only kill them. He wants recognition as a criminal mastermind, but is only considered a psychotic madman. The punchline that Simenon delivers so superbly is that no matter how much Popinga's megalomania convinces him that he is up to the task, he's not the man he wishes to be."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Kees Popinga, Dutch factotum in Julius de Coster the Younger's shipping firm for 17 years, lives proudly in the nicest and cleanest development in Groningen with his wife he doesn't love and his two children he doesn't understand.

He discovers not only that his company has done nothing for the ship and so it will not sail, but his respectable boss is happily getting drunk in a disreputable little bar. Popinga then enters the bar and is on the receiving end of a long and incredible monologue from de Coster. The firm is bankrupt, Popinga, who has invested everything in the company, is now broke, de Coster is fleeing the country, and the Mr Popinga of the past 17 years is no more.In this romans durs (hard novel), his second in his amazing writing career, Simenon exhibits extraordinary insight into the stresses and strains of his character's psychological demons. Popinga sees the collapse of his outward life as a great opportunity to live out the urges and impulses of his repressed inner life at last. In no time at all, he is gone, walking away from his fake proper self, letting all of it go: family, home, responsibilities, inhibitions--or is he?In this time of failing businesses and psychological stress, one wonders how many Popingas are waiting to disappear from their current lives. What makes Simenon so interesting is how well he has captured the nihilism and repression that are intimately woven into our social networks. The pacing of this story also is exceptional, as we see Popinga slowly come undone even as, outwardly, he seems utterly in control.The blurbs on the cover of this important New York Review Books new translation (2005) actually are true, for a change: John Banville's comments: \\"...tough, bleak, offhandedly violent...redolent of place,\\" New York Times: \\"breath-taking, fast-paced, will hold you enthralled....\\" And the excellent introduction by Luc Sante (which MUST be read afterward, and not before) finely describes our discomfort and repulsion toward Popinga. Yet, even as we cringe, we recognize the truth of this creation. Perhaps it is our doorway into the inner workings of human beings such as David Berkowitz or Ted Bundy or (could it be?) even ourselves."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Firstly, I must complain about this book cover!!!! Do these people actually read the books they are trying to sell? Anyway, no use getting academic about this wonferful book by the beloved Inspector Maigret author. This novel makes you forget everything around you, and you simply become part of the protagonist's luggage on his way from Holland to Paris one cold evening. I am sure many of us wish we could just get up and leave everything behind like this family man and correct employee did. Only we hope it doesn't end like his spontaneous little outing. Oh it is a lovely WINTER book. ENDULGE under a cozy quilt."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Kees Popinga lives a solid bourgeois life. He has a pleasant wife and two good kids, a good job, an above-average house, and many desirable possessions. Then, the shocked Kees, on a conscientious mission for his employer, spots his boss drinking alone in a seedy bar. There, the boss admits he is an embezzler and philanderer and about to fake his suicide, which will give him a second chance in life. While it doesn't exactly make sense, the passive Kees actually helps with the sham suicide, even though the boss's shenanigans have bankrupted the company where Kees has invested all his savings. But then Kees goes home and becomes filled with rage at the bourgeois life that his boss represented. He decides he has lived the life of a fool. And he decides that, from now on, he will take whatever he desires. He will no longer watch the trains go by.Once Simenon establishes this premise, this novel becomes an interesting character study, with the foxy and megalomaniacal Kees locked in a game of wits with the police, who seek him for a single blundering act, which first expressed his newfound rapaciousness and rage.In my edition of THE MAN WHO WATCHED TRAINS GO BY, Luc Sante provides an interesting introduction, which is filled with both insight and spoilers. Read it after you've finished. Then, you'll find the amazing insight that this Simenon novel is actually a comedy, with the bourgeois Kees never getting too far from his comfy roots.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Kees Popinga is manager of the largest ship outfitter in Dutch Frisia. His house and furnishings are of the highest quality. His wife and two children are just what they should be.Then one evening he sees his boss, Julius de Coster, getting drunk in a bar. De Coster informs him that the company will be bankrupt the next day, and Popinga and family will be on the street.De Coster confesses to being a fraud and a libertine. He intends to fake his own suicide and disappear, and he gives Popinga 500 florins to flee as well.Popinga had always dreamed of being someone other than other than Kees Popinga. He takes the train to Paris. The conventional person he once was is gone with his position. He's now quite free to do whatever he pleases - and he accidentally commits a murder.Life on the run becomes a kind of chess game, and there's something rather appealing about the smug enthusiasm Popinga brings to his new occupation. Simenon, master of the quick character sketch, peoples the madman's world with a fascinating mix of small-time crooks, prostitutes and bourgeois types.You'll want to share this book with a friend, because it invites discussion. Is Popinga mad - or are the rest of us mad who imagine that we have solid ground beneath our feet? Was the liberated Popinga really free, or did he just assume a new character role with new rules? Are any of us ever free from our self-inventions?"},{"Title":"The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"A complex tale of a man who leads a normal life until one day everything changes.

My husband's tummy does not do chilis and such. The recipes were more involved than I would prefer but I overlooked it because it was being cooked in one day. But it would have been much more useful if the author had considered the fact that Antacids are a giant industry for a reason. Lots of people have problems here. Include substitutes!"},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"This book purports to help you save time and money in the kitchen while enjoying a variety of foods. You may save some time following the processes outlined here, but you definitely won't save money. It is definitely NOT for the home cook who is on a budget.The author gives several weeks worth of recipes for you to cook once and eat all week. Unfortunately, most of the weeks use the same ingredients over and over (and over). For example, there is fish week and out of the 5 menus given, salmon is the main dish in 3.This book will also NOT help you save money--there is steak week where you are supposed to purchase *13* rib-eye steaks. (Hey--if I could afford to buy 13 steaks at once, I could also probably afford to pay someone to cook for me!)Most of the other freeze-ahead cookbooks I have seen have practical advice on saving money and time at the grocery store. This book relies too heavily on expensive prepared ingredients (the author recommends buying pre-cooked chicken, for example, to save even more time). I can't recommend this for anyone trying to save money."},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"I have looked at a lot of cook-ahead cookbooks and chose this one because the recipes looked like something my family would actually eat. I was right - they are &quot;normal&quot; enough for my taco and hamburger loving children and tasty enough for my braised lamb shanks and grilled duck breast loving husband. I would agree with other reviewers, that if you are looking for budget do-ahead cooking, this is probably not the book for you. However, if you want to save time and have a realaxed dinner hour then I think this is a good choice. I have always balked at the once-a-month cookbooks because I can't imagine spending the 12 to 14 hours in the kitchen that kind of cooking would take, not to mention the kind of freezer space it would require. This seems like a great compromise and I have been pleased with the outcome."},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"Love this book! Tried the ground beef mix and all the recipes for Week One so far, and they're all winners. My husband is still raving about the Peaches and Cream Stuffed Pork Chops! It took about 5-6 hours to cook one week's worth the first time, but I think I'll get faster after I get the hang of marathon cooking. Since I still do \\"regular\\" cooking some nights, one week's worth of Joni's recipes will probably stretch over 2-3 weeks for our two-person household. What a luxury to have delicious, restaurant-quality meals ready in your freezer when you are short of time. Joni includes directions for reheating whether you remembered to thaw in advance or not - that's really handy when your plans change at the last minute. Joni, if you're reading this - hope you'll come out with another cookbook soon - I'll be looking for it!"},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"So far, I have been pleased with the poultry mix and seafood mix ideas. (The book also features a ground beef mix.) It is worth spending time on the weekend to set up 4 dinners/mix when time is scarce, and there is a nice variety of recipes for each mix.However, although we liked the seafood quiche, the directions produced much more volume than my pie pan could hold, and I stayed up late that night preparing macaroni to use the remaining mix. Oddly, my desperation macaroni with crab and tomato tasted better than the crab and tomato quiche. At least I had 3 meals from that experience.The poultry mix resembled chicken salad, but my husband was very impressed with the casserole he threw in the oven on a night with a tight schedule.The weekly menus in the rest of the book seemed less useful. I can't imagine planning a week of chicken every night."},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"Loved this book and have given it as a gift. My friends, a couple who are both engineers with their own firm, found it to be the answer. Too many times after a long day they would dine out because it was just too much trouble to go home and cook a good meal and they wanted to relax over dinner. They cook on the weekends now and they say the recipes are delicious and not a bite was wasted. They will freeze smaller portions now because recipes are large. This book fills the bill for people who love to cook but have busy lives and would like to eat delicious meals at home more often. It doesn't pretend to be a way to save money although the items are generally easy to find and grouping the menus as the author has does make efficient use of time and ingredients considering the terrific meals produced.

Most of her recipes are really delicious, although I have never made any of the fish dishes. Sometimes I follow her instructions exactly and cook a week's worth of dinners in foru hours, other days I'll just double a recipe and put the extra meal in the freezer for later. Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out the author does call for a lot of expensive meats like rib eye steak. But I've found that you never need as much meat as she specifies. Instead of buying 12 rib eye steaks for a weeks worth of meals for example, I'll just buy five. That amount suits my husband and I just fine. All in all, this cookbook offers tasty, creative recipes that move beyond the traditional chili, spaghetti sauce and casserole dishes that many freezer cooking programs rely on."},{"Title":"The Once-a-Week Cooking Plan: The Incredible Cooking Program That Will Save You 10 to 20 Hours a Week (and Have Your Family Begging for More!)","review":"You could break up the sessions in several parts to make it more manageable.

If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing.

However, if it's already in the freezer, leave it there for a week or two and leapfrog on to another section. You'll have a nice stock of quick meals with minimal prep when you need them and can break things up with your own repetoire when you have time.

When I come across a configuration option I haven't worked with before, this book does a great job of explaining it in a language I can understand.

To be honest, most of the books out there on Apache give a thorough and adequate run-through of the features and use of the Apache Server. What set this book apart for me was its careful attention to the configuration/installation process- one of the most frustrating aspects of running Apache, especially for Linux users. In particular, it explains in-depth the options and methods for adding modules to the Apache server, including fleshing out the different ways of implementing the modules. For example, the author shows how to compile Apache with statically linked modules, to do the same dynamically, and to do a combination of the two. This really hits home when you are trying to run Apache with third-party modules such as mod_perl, PHP, mySQL, and Jakarta, for example. Online documentation and even documentation from other books may describe how to implement these individually, but seldom take into account the scenario where one wants to run many or all of them. I strongly recommend this book, especially if you are a serious linux user who is tired of searching the internet for out-of-context messages on Apache configuration problems."},{"Title":"Professional Apache","review":"First off, don't confuse this with a web design book: this book will not show you ANY HTML coding whatsoever.

It's the tough stuff: virtual hosting, dynamic web sites, and the Apache modules, where this book really earns it's keep.In short, there's nothing you can do with Apache that this book can't show you, in my opinion. Quite obviously, it's not really aimed at the average Joe, but if you're running a medium sized web server or above, and you're running Apache, you'll probably benefit from reading this. Especially good is the content on dynamic sites and secure serving: this is, of course, the basis for modern e-commerce, which is probably what 90% of us buy this book for!

There's a good chapter on security which covers authentication as well as server security in good depth.The author makes little attempt to cover Apache running under Windows, though this is explained in the first chapter.

Second, the chapter on security and SSL support is, as far as I can say, the best documentation to get started with. Although, after having gain some confidence with it you should read the Apache docs and the OpenSSL docs for more precise configs Third, the chapters devoted to mod_perl, mod_jserv and XML are just perfect, giving us clear explanations of many configurations for each mod', this gives a choice of how we could work on a big variety of environments and solutionsOver all this is a great book, for beginers and for people who already has some working knowledge on Apache, a great reference book too!Happy New Year!

This chapter outlined many different approaches to this sort of task and carefully weighed the trade offs inherent in each.

Taxes, minimum wage laws, unions, monetary policy, welfare, subsidies, protectionism, the list goes on. Yet most people do not know square one about economics, which is a shame.

He has had so many books that were great, it is really hard to tell which one is his best. Anyways, this is a treastise on economics and a very good one at that. Once you get past the initial setting up of the economy, Rothbard guides you onto several other important issues related to the economy and economics. This book, however, is not going to be taken up by diehard Marxians or socialists. This book is written by an Austrian economist, he isn't Austrian just from that school of thought, which canonically oppose most state intervention. In the case of Rothbard, you will see this grow into fruition, as Rothbard is somewhat of an anarchist. Anyways, this book guides you through many areas of economics that deal with a wide variety of problems such as public policy stances, unemployment, and the like. It is truly a great read, if you have the time."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"Why not try this book? You may never finish it, but even a cursory glance through it reveals a beautifully elaborated economic system, built on von Mises's utilitarian base. An in-depth read will offer everything one needs to know about the modern Austrian School of economics and the system it promotes. Rothbard not only informs the reader of the system he believes in; he makes you become stimulated by every last word.

Ludwig Von Mises 'Human Action' comes close but it is too dense for a layman.This book: Man, Economy and State, written by Murray N. Rothbard can make an economist out of layman if he puts time and efforts into reading this book and understanding all its concepts. Murray Rothbard starts with the basic axiom that: Humans Act. He further states that Humans Act to relieve some sort of unease and approach a better state of satisfaction. Based on these two axioms he builds up the entire edifice of Economics using impeccable logic and superb reasoning.I had read Carl Menger's 'Principles of Economics' before this and thus had a basic understanding of economics. But EVEN if you do not have that, do not worry. This book starts with very basic terms and explains the concepts of Supply and Demand, Interest Rates, Profit/Loss, Production Structure etc. in a clear and thorough manner.Murray Rothbard furthermore refutes the Socialist, Keynesian(gradual socialist) and neo-classical schools of economics. His elucidation of fallacies of Interventionist economics is so logical that one cannot help but laugh out loud on the stupidity of fools like John Keynes, Karl Marx and their disciples.Also you will not see much mathematics in this book. Subjective valuations of goods/services by humans cannot be quantified. This seems pretty logical to most of us but many who call themselves &quot;economists&quot; simply miss this insight.Read this book and you will have a far better understanding of how the world works. You will also understand economics better than most economics college professors and government-employed economists."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"Man, Economy and State is more than a refined rehashing of Mises' Human Action. It includes thorough analyses of many topics Mises did not tackle, or did not tackle so well. Most notably, Rothbard exposes the logical absurdities embedded in Keynesian and monetarist theories.I found the work both more satisfying and more intellectually invigorating than I expected. Rothbard's clear, deductive prose, aided with just a touch of humor and sarcasm, makes for some wonderful reading. I know I will read this one many, many times before I feel I have really absorbed everything this book has to offer.I especially urge educated laymen and students of economics to give this book a good reading before mindlessly accepting the trendy mathematical scribbling that has become the code language of ivy-league economists. Purposive, motivated individual ACTION is the ultimate cause of all economic phenomena. Therefore, economics must be described in terms of cause and effect relationships originating in the attempts of individuals to employ scarce means to satisfy unlimited wants.Economics, when described through functional equations, can never contain any meaningful insights that could not be expressed more precisely through verbal logic, as functional relationships lack information on causality. In the social sciences they are likely to be the source of false deduction and inference. The result is a hopelessly confused pseudo-science that ignores most of what makes economics useful.Because Rothbard understands this from the get-go, he is able to give us 900 pages of meaningful logic.Thank you, Murray Rothbard!"},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"If you're at all interested in Austrian economics, Rothbard's _magnum opus_ is an essential reference.

Get used to it: Austrians don't like graphs.- Threateningly heavy."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"Murray Rothbard was one of the most prolific writers in the libertarian tradition in the 20th century. His published work covered political theory, social theory, history, and economics. I've read most of Rothbard's books and consider Man, Economy, and State to be his greatest achievement.As an introductory matter, Rothbard studied under Ludwig von Mises, this century's premier Austrian economist. Man, Economy, and State is a basic treatise on economics, drawing on the insights of the Austrian school. It starts with the fundamentals of human action, and then goes on to discuss prices, production, monopoly theory, money, and other matters. This work is lengthy and some parts are quite theoretical, but that shouldn't stop even the tyro in economics from reading it. Rothbard starts with \\"Crusoe economics,\\" that is with the individual actor. From this, he introduces the reader to the basics of economic reasoning. Only after this foundation is constructed does Rothbard discuss more complex issues. If you want to learn to \\"think like an economist\\" this book is a great place to start. I'm no economist -- and some of this work was a little beyond me (although I like to think I could have mastered it if I had enough free time) -- but even those chapters that are the most theoretical contain numerous insights into more \\"practical\\" matters.Unlike von Mises and most other Austrians, Rothbard was an anarchist. His opposition to government led to some unusual positions. For example, he viewed patents as contrary to the free market. [p. 652-60.] He also taught that blackmail would be legal in a free society. [p. 443 n. 49.] I'm not sure I agree with these conclusions, but they are always presented in a thought-provoking manner."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"This work is perhaps the most thorough and consistent exposition of capitalist economics in existence. Murray Rothbard built his work upon the epochal contributions of the Austrian school of economics, primarily the ideas of the great Ludwig von Mises. However, Rothbard did not merely rehash what they had taught him, he also ironed out their ambiguities and shortcomings in order to construct a mighty, rock solid edifice. Despite the size of this work, it is as well suited to the needs of nascent libertarians, as it is to those of more advanced students. Rothbard begins with the very foundations of human action, and builds upon them logically in order to explain in depth the complexities of the market economy. At the same time, he provides a powerful assault upon socialism and other forms of anti-market ideology by contrasting these systems to capitalism and refuting widely held anti-market myths. The only significant shortcoming that I can think of is the truncated form of Rothbard's brilliant critique of all government action. Apparently, the original publishers of this work were taken aback by his anarchistic conclusions, so, in order to comprehend the full weight of his analysis, it will be necessary to seek out his path-breaking work, &quot;Power and Market.&quot; Together, these works represent one of the greatest defenses of individual liberty and civilization ever to be produced."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"Murray Newton Rothbard's development of economic theory from the axiom of human action is brilliant from start to finish. Building on Ludwig von Mises's masterwork _Human Action_, Rothbard in effect removes Mises's work from its neo-Kantian setting and places it on a foundation of Aristotelian realism (though this fact will not be obvious without study of Rothbard's later work, notably _The Ethics of Liberty_). Rothbard systematically and rigorously develops all of economic theory from the axiom that human beings act to achieve ends in a world in which specific and delimitable causes have specific and delimitable effects. In so doing, he wrote a work that, almost three decades after its publication, still serves as a comprehensive introduction to Austrian School economics. And no wonder: Rothbard viewed Austrian economics particularly and the &quot;science of liberty&quot; generally as systematic philosophy, not as the mere collection of statistical facts and &quot;model-building.&quot; The result is a highly readable volume that reads more like a philosophical treatise than a standard &quot;economics&quot; textbook. Anyone who loves liberty and thinks _ideas_ are important will love this volume. Keynesians and econometricians need not apply."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"A classic is a work that rewards repeated re-reading. I am planning to repeat the graduate seminar I gave around this book not only because it is a revelation to students who have been schooled in standard economics but also because I myself realize I have more to gain from another run through it.Another thing that keeps it fresh nearly 50 years after publication is the almost complete lack of topical material that could go stale. A peculiarity of the original edition is that the projected third volume had to be shortened into a single chapter because its total condemnation of government was too controversial for the publisher. That third volume was later published as \\"Power and Market: Government and the Economy.\\" It is bound in with the original Man Economy & State in the Scholar's Edition, which somewhat confusingly still includes the original summary chapter.This book assumes no background in economics, and takes the reader straight through from the most basic aspects of human action through the whole of economics without the artificial break between micro and macro that corrodes present-day economic thinking. Rothbard spins out long chains of reasoning, which although they are clearly presented, do require sustained attention. If you are willing to give it that attention, the book will repay you handsomely. Rothbard leads us to the standard laws of supply and demand, but grounds them in a way that standard textbooks miss. His treatment of monopoly is unique, arguing that very concept of a monopoly price is illegitimate because one the \\"competitive price\\" with which it is to be contrasted cannot be identified, and therefore one cannot distinguish a movement along a demand curve from a sub-competitive price toward the alleged competitive price from a movement upward from that price.There is much more that is unique to Rothbard (and much that is consonant with standard economics), but I will just mention one more thing, a favorite of mine. That is his classification of violent behavior into (1) autistic intervention, e.g. forcing someone to salute a flag, (2) binary intervention, e.g. robbery or taxation, and (3) triangular intervention where the aggressor forces or prohibits exchanges between others, e.g. through price controls.In the course of 1,000 pages or so Rothbard does slip occasionally. And he runs into the ditch in his attempt to discredit the concept of velocity and the equation of exchange. Nonetheless this is a masterful, enjoyable, and highly rewarding book."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"This monumental follow-up to Ludwig Von Mises's &quot;Human Action&quot; continues the ground-breaking path set by Mises in that work. Rothbard's treatise is written more in the style of an economics textbook. Most of the book is an expansion of the economic principles that Mises's expounded in &quot;Human Action.&quot; Rothbard's brilliant defense of a natural monopoly (as opposed to a government-created one) is alone worth the price of the book. But neither work is for the beginner. It is best to read Carl Menger's &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; first, before attempting to tackle either book."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"If you want a systematic and sound grouding in economics, this is the book to read. Rothbard's treatise is a delight, an amazing intellectual achievement, and yet more than accessible to the intelligent layman. My degrees are in history, not economics, yet I read this book all the way through twice and got a tremendous amount out of it each time.Note well: if you're interested in a more lighthearted overview of free-market economics, you might consider some of Rothbard's other work: Making Economic Sense, What Has Government Done to Our Money, and the like. But to see a true genius at work, who begins with the simplest aspects of exchange and builds systematically to complex issues of money, banking, monopoly, and much more, the serious student needs this book."},{"Title":"Man Economy and State A Treatise on Economic Principles","review":"This is easily one of the three best defenses of the Free Market ever written.

It also does a good job of demolishing the concept interpersonal utility comparisons, which will be a great thorn in the side of those who advocate &quot;welfare&quot; spending. It also shows that, unlike most followers of Marx unquestioningly accept, the capitalist is productive."},{"Title":"Pediatric Board Certification Review: An Excellent Guide, An Essential Tool for Board Certification","review":"There are not many books or resources of this kind readily available; so I am thankful this author attempted to tackle the job. However, the CD-ROM is very difficult to use and read. I would probably prefer the hardcover copy. The information covers all systems important to pediatrics, but it does not follow any logical order. The subject matter appears in a list form under each body system. It is best used as a resource for important &quot;clinical pearls&quot; essential to success on the pediatric board exam. There are more than a few spelling errors as well. The introduction states that there are pictures and diagrams as well; however, my CD-ROM copy does not include any of what is described on the insert.

Yet I found many things about this book troubling. The use of the English language was poor at best and sometimes non-sensical. There was little or no organization to each section, making it difficult to conceptually organize the concepts. A few random points are repeated, but it appears to be due to a lack of editing rather than for emphasis. There are multiple typographic errors (e.g. Hemophilia B written as a factor XI deficiency rather than factor IX (table, pg. 80)) and major contradictions [e.g. in the respiratory section, #61: &quot;First restrictive then obstructive lung disease occurs in: (very very important) cystic fibrosis...&quot; &amp; #77: &quot;...in cystic fibrosis (CF): (very important)...first, obstructive...then, restrictive...lung disease...&quot;] Overall, while this book may contain a lot of useful information for the boards, extracting that information and deciding what facts are trustworthy or not makes this book not worth the high cost.

That fact alone is the sole reason that anyone should buy this book. The content is poorly organized. The author's command of the english language is evident in that I and my colleagues often found ourselves wondering what he was trying to say. The book is written in &quot;question and answer&quot; format, but it was difficult to use this format based on how the book was organized. For example, when the questions and answers are combined in one paragraph, it is very difficult to cover the answer while asking the question. The &quot;diagrams&quot; were useless and a completely inadequate preparation for the diagrams seen on the actual board exam. This book will be useful once the author hires a new editor. Incidentally, I DID pass the boards with flying colors, but that was due to my review of other sources (like Peds in Review) rather than this book."},{"Title":"The Impact of Television: A Natural Experiment in Three Communities","review":"The book is a research study looking at the impact of television on a town who had previously not had tv before.

The book has enlightened me in so many ways.It touches one's spirituality said in such a beautiful and revealing way. Such a complex subject matter was made so simple that even a teenager could relate and understand.At the time I read the book, that was 20 years ago, I was in the midst of confusion and turmoil - problems with in-laws, problems with adjusting to married life, etc.Even after 20 years, I still read on the pages and each time, it brings me new insights and reflections. In fact, I would attribute partly the success of my 22 years of married life to the book. I would say that it has changed my way of viewing things and life itself. Every time I feel down and low, I could not help but read and reread the pages. As I ponder on the message, I know, this book must be God's Answer to my call for help and enlightenment.The author seemed to be inspired by the Holy Spirit as he wrote the book. It is such a beautifully written manuscript that I would want to share it to the people I care most, to the people I owe gratitude, and to the people I love - my parents, my family, my close friends and relatives, specially those who are sick in mind and body. God has used this as a medium to communicate to me and show me his well-spring of graces to make me feel loved and cared for.I thank the author for having allowed himself to be used as an instrument.

This is certainly an insider's viewpoint - he is probably Bob Woodward of Pakistan. One may disagree with some of the conclusions of the book about the prospects of Talibanization of Pakistan but there is no doubt the work is authoritative and convincing in its approach. It's a must read for students of South Asian history and for those who want to learn about roots of Islamic radicalism in the region. Profiles of Pakistani extremist groups are very detailed and based on info that I believe is not available elsewhere.The writer is clearly sympathetic towards minority Muslim groups in Pakistan especially Ahmedis and Shias but provides specific and credible instances of crimes committed against these communities. Also explains how Blasphemy laws are biased against Christian minority. He also severely criticizes Pakistan army for its interference in politics and intelligence agencies for how they groomed and sponsored terrorist groups. In comparison he has been somewhat soft on Pakistani police which he remains associated with as per his bio in the book.The best part of the book is about General Musharraf and how he is handling Pakistan and the war on terror - he has mixed opinion about Musharraf's capability to make a real difference in the long run. He argues that moderate political parties and revival of real democracy is the only way things can be improved.Final remark - its an academic book I believe but is written like a thriller - its difficult to put it down once you start reading. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know how Pakistan is progressing (or digressing) and how intriguing is the history of Pakistan-US relations."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"Fabulous read. It artfully explains the challenges America face in the war on terror. Almost half of the book is pure historical narrative about Pakistan and India (though beautifully written) and the rest is analysis about the present day crisis in terms of capabilities of terrorist groups, impact of Musharraf's bold decisions to reform and policy prescriptions about how a constructive change is possible. For those interested in Muslim states and society this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"If you have to read just one book on Pakistan, this is it. Extremely well written and powerful - I have been teaching South Asian history for a decade but haven't come across a book on the country that is so clear in its perspective, so bold and most importantly written by someone who is not only a scholar but one who witnessed the scene firsthand. Its certainly a important contribution to the field.I have just one suggestion and one criticism for the writer - he could have given more detailed profiles of the Islamic parties that Pakistan inherited in 1947. Secondly, the book requires a chronology of important political events of Pakistan for the Western readers. But despite these limitations, the book is head and shoulders above other contemporary works on the subject."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"Very intriguing and bold work - exposes how religious bigots and fundamentalists have entrenched themselves in Pakistan. It doesn't spare anyone - Pakistan army and its intelligence, American foreign policy blunders, Indian intransigence and failure of Pakistan's political elite - a very balanced treatment. I read the book as a required text for a course on South Asia and conflict resolution and its best part is that its written in a story like fashion, so its actually fun to read the book."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"Good information on Pakistan from partition (and slightly before) up until 2004.Abbas has an entertaining, feisty writing style. His sympathies and condemnations are both spread liberally, which makes for less obvious bias than you will encounter most places. The work is very good in that respect.One of his main points, and the one most salient for my own interests, is that Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan has been allowed to thrive because of incompetent rulers and failing institutions. As presented, it seems credible.He deftly handles the Kashmiri issue and makes it perhaps the central motivating factor for Pakistani foreign policy.Overall it's a good read and short at around 235 pages.Also decent academic credentials."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"This novel is basically written as two different nonfictional thrillers in one. The first is the historical upbringing of a young nation and the events that led to the aggressions between Pakistan and India. In my opinion this part of the book is nicely written and is more of a historical outline rather than an opinionated article, even though the authors do put some witty comments explaining these past events. The second part of the novel is a little more opinionated, explaining the current drift of Pakistan with religious factors involved. This part of the book seems a bit one sided and doesn't put all the perspectives on the table. I have lived in Pakistan and the religious extremism is defiantly does not represent the majority of the country. This is a good reference book to read in order to understand the current situation with Pakistan and the American so called War on Terrorism but is defiantly not the only source on should use to understand such a deep topic."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"Hassan Abbas has written this book in a interesting way such that it is fun to read. However, the intended audience of this book is mostly the American scholars/students as they will find this book somewhat along the lines of what they hear on TV but not too radical, however there are other realities which are not mentioned in this book which are extremely important. It does provide a good picture of politics in Pakistan but not the complete picture.The book describes very clearly the threats, killings, rapes, abductions and lawless politicians but one finds no mention of the police. Army is shown as the interferer in every aspect of government. The real question is where is the law enforcement agency known as Police.Hassan Abbas should write his next book on this subject and reader will realize what lead Pakistan to this point. As a Pakistani I can tell you that Pakistani police is one of the most corrupt and dangerous dept in the world. Simply put, if you need to have someone murdered, you contact the police and they'll do it for you, of course for a price. The Pakistani police is not only involved in corruption, but also other crimes such as smuggling of arms and ammunitions, narcotics, torture & rape cells, cover ups, kidnapping , you name the crime and Pakistani police is the leader in it. And most important of all the crimes against women are so common because the criminal can easily pay the police and get away.I'd love to blame the army but its not army's job to enforce local law and order. Although a lot of blame goes to the army and the mullahs but the Pakistani police had an equal if not bigger hand in the plunder of the country and were the biggest protectors and collaborators of the local mullah's.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"I read a novel set in Portugal and realized that I knew very little about that country. I've visited Spain, I've read a history of the Spanish civil war, I know something of the part that Spain played in European history. But I know very little about Portugal.Portugal does not have large oil reserves, have paroxysms of mass killing or possess nuclear weapons. Portugal's colonial past is behind it and they no longer seem to threaten anyone. In the modern world, Portugal seems to just exist quietly in Spain's shadow. Perhaps the fact that I know so little about Portugal means that they are currently a relatively happy country.In contrast to Portugal's modern history, Pakistan has a history full of tumult. Pakistan was founded during India's independence from Britain in 1947. By some estimates, during the partition from India a million people died. Pakistan and violent Islamic Jihadism are intimately intertwined, starting with the support of the resistance to Soviet occupation in Afghanistan to the current time when Pakistan provides a haven for violent groups like Al-Qaeda. On top of all this, Pakistan is a nuclear power with an antagonistic relationship to its neighbor, India.Unlike Portugal, Pakistan is a country that people pay attention to. Many books and academic articles have been written about Pakistan. In Pakistan the educated elite are usually fluent in english and some of these books are written by Pakistani intellectuals. One of these books is Pakistan's Drift into Extremism: Allah, the Army, and America's War on Terror by Hassan Abbas.According to the brief biography in the book, Mr. Hassan served in the Pakistani government, in the police. He published this book while he was a graduate student in the United States.Pakistan's Drift into Extremism is a history of Pakistan from its founding in 1947. Mr. Abbas covers the various regimes that have ruled the country as it moved between military and civilian rule. Pakistan is a country with a tragic history of violence, turmoil and instability. Throughout Pakistani history the military has been a constant part of the government structure.The combination of Islamic fundamentalism, Jihadism and nuclear weapons have prompted some people to describe Pakistan as the most dangerous country in the world. In Mr. Abbas' account, Islamic factions have been a core part of Pakistani politics since the rule of General Zia. So far the rulers of Pakistan have not been Islamic fundamentalists, but they have used Islam as a political tool.The Afghan resistance to the Soviets and the huge influx of US money and arms gave birth to the Jihadists. Zia and the Pakistani intelligence service, the ISI, used these factions for a number of purposes. Some of the warriors who were trained in the Afghan resistance were turned loose in Kashmir after the Soviets left Afghanistan. Like Frankenstein's monster, the Jihadists have taken on a life of their own and have not always been controllable by their masters in the ISI. Some of these groups have turned on their masters and have attempted to assassinate President Musharraf, the military ruler of Pakistan.Hassan Abbas is an armature historian. Several reviewers have commented that this history of Pakistan is readable. Perhaps that begs the question: Compared to what? Compared to a historian like Adrian Goldsworth, who wrote the excellent Caesar: Life of a Collossus, Pakistan's Drift into Extremism can be a tedious read. I did not find the book terribly well written. The structure of the book follows the history of Pakistan, but its structure is somewhat idiosyncratic. There is a long section on a brief attempt under Musharraf to fight corruption in the government. There is another fairly long section that covers the death of General Zia in an airplane crash. This crash may not have been an accident and Mr. Abbas discusses who might have been responsible. Mr. Abbas covers the rise of the Islamic political factions. Only at the end of the book does he discuss the armed Islamic factions. The \\"War on Terror\\" may have been tacked onto the title to increase the sales of the book."},{"Title":"Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, then Army, and America's War Terror","review":"Surprise, Surprise: \\" Lal Krishna Advani, apologises for the destruction of the Babri mosque during a visit to Pakistan; Gohar Ayub Khan, son of Field Marshal Ayub Khan, pinches some of the headlines with the titillating claim that an Indian brigadier sold India's 1965 war plans.Who is this top spy?

Been a movie fan all my life. Amazon makes it possible to read more for less. T. Smith"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","review":"This volume parses the good guys from the bad guys, tells you whom you should love and why, and summarily dismisses the ones not worth taking seriously. In other words, for good or bad, it arms you, as will no other film book ever written, with a set of eloquently-stated prejudices that may seal off certain directors from your serious consideration for all time. (It would be too glib to say that this is the books best and worst point.) Suffice to say, it has taken years for me to tear down the wall Sarris built between me, as a budding cinephile, and William Wyler, Billy Wilder, John Huston and even John Frankenheimer, for that matter. (These are just a few of the ones I think he was, or may have been, wrong about.)But I love this book and always find it worth picking up to reread a few entries, for two or three reasons that never grow old:1) Sarris IS an absolutely remarkable writer. His prose bristles with alternately apt and acid phrases and insights. The parallel between Ambrose Bierce and Sarris has grown on me through the years. (I think it was Sarris who brought currency to the word \\"pretentious\\"-- possibly THE serious put-down word from the 70s to the 90s, possibly to the present-- by the way. He used it with unerring surgical delicacy, as a bludgeon.)2) He is hard to argue with in his negative evaluation of certain other respected directors. Thirty-five years ago, Sarris renounced Kubrick, noting, in typical form, that the very fact that he made one film every 5 years seemed to be all the proof his advocates needed of his integrity. Ouch! And he said that Kubrick is the director of the best coming attractions in the business.This last is highly prophetic of the present general situation, when Hollywood has made a sort of science of over-selling weak films with absurdly hyperbolic trailers that often have little to do with the tone or experience of the films they advertise. This comment indicates also how much of Sarris is audaciously arguable, and out of synch with conservative academia re Kubrick and just about everything else. --Not a bad thing, as far as I am concerned.) And I think he was also decades ahead of the curve in recognizing Keaton as Chaplin's better.3) He has been, for decades, an antidote to Pauline Kael. Period.If you know the directors covered well enough to take it all with a grain of salt where needed, this book is probably the best read on movies and their directors from the second and third quarters of the 20th Century that will ever be written. THE great mapping out of this seminal period by the auteur theorys chief surveyor-- and a fun and drolly amusing place to pick up your snazzy-looking anti-philistine, anti-pretentious attitude off-the-rack."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","review":"Since 1973, when I bought the book for a college course, the book is a permanent part of my library. I should have replaced the original by now, but I owe to it my appetite and appreciation for movies.

Each essay is preceded by a filmography, with the films Sarris judges to be the director's most important in italics.

I doubt it is as easy to fall under Sarris's spell with 40 years having passed since the book's publication, but perhaps I'm wrong, with TCM and Netflix providing fairly easy access to the films I sought out like a pilgrim based on Sarris's writing. I still can't imagine a better way to delve into film history than through this amazingly articulate work."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","review":"Auteur criticism is, in my opinion, a profoundly flawed theory of cinema that nonetheless was instrumental in emphasising the important role the director. Anyone not in the grip of a theory and aware of the myriad of factors that goes into the making of a good film has to realize that a vast array of factors goes into the final product. Only in rare instances can a film be said to be the expression of the will of the director and treated as such. Frequently a film can be carried not by the director, but by the cinematographer, the editor, the actors, or the screenwriter (anyone who has read the original screenplay of CITIZEN KANE can enjoy a graphic instance of the role a good screenplay can play in the production of a masterpiece).Having pointed that out, Sarris did help America take directors more seriously than they had ever been taken before, and for that he must be applauded. That took many took the director to be the only game in town doesn't undercut the value of this bookStepping off my soapbox, let me just say how much fun this book is. It is great fun to argue with Sarris about which directors he places in the Pantheon (the best of the best of the directors to have worked in the U.S.) and which he leaves out. It would be wonderful if he were to turn his attention to producing an updated version of the book, extending into the current decade. I would be interested to see to what extent he revised the Pantheon, to see where he placed Coppola, Scorsese, Sayles, and Spielberg.Recommended to anyone with a more-than-casual interest in American cinema."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","review":"If you don't know this book, buy it immediately. It takes American film criticism up to about 1970 and coincides with the time Sarris was involved with the (real) Village Voice, Jonas Mekas, American Cahiers,and the founding of the NY Film Festival and the national society of film critics. It took me about five years of reading his reviews until I finally got it - Sarris had understood that the most profound thoughts and themes were played out with style and panache by genre filmmakers with personal obsessions and ideas that did not require Western Union to spell it out.There's some things to quibble about (I never could see why he thought so highly of Blake Edwards, but I keep trying because I trust his insight. Even Sarris can change his mind as he did on Billy Wilder a few years back).If you are a film buff and have not discovered his work (also recommended:Confessions of a Cultist; The John Ford Mystery Book; You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet are among the best) start here. That goes double if you experience guilty pleasure and see things no one else does in people like Anthony Mann, Michael Powell, Sam Fuller, Max Ophuls, Budd Boetticher or James Whale. I have often given this book as a gift to film loving friends. It opens a world of discovery and rapport when a friends \\"gets it\\" and suddenly, you both have a shared sensibility and frame of reference.Also, check out his website for yearly top ten lists and also the work of his wife Molly Haskell (especially good on Howard Hawks)."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN CINEMA: Directors and Directions 1929-1968","review":"Sarris's book started a salvo the equivalent of the battle of Tushima Straits between those who bought the French idea of the director as \\"author\\" or auteur, and those who did not. Filmmakers bought the auteur theory whole hog, and why not, since it put directors into the same rank as poets, painters, composers and novelists. Sarris approached his analysis by ranking directors by his view of their worth. His ideas on certain directors will madden some, particularly in his \\"Less Than Meets the Eye,\\" category, but overall, Sarris presents us with a well-thought-out view of American film, arguably the most important cultural force since the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages. Some drawbacks, for which Sarris is not at fault: the work is dated, stopping in 1968, right before the massive burst of new directors who would change American film for a brief time, until blockbusters stifled them.

The book does deal with issues of whether the Long Beach Line was a good decision but, far more importantly, it is about the thought processes that led the project to be adopted: specifically, a theory of myth is developed to show the work of symbols, images, and metaphors at shaping political perceptions. I hope readers can learn from this analysis, whether or not they approve of rail transit projects.To answer the specific point, I do in fact present a great deal of data to show why investing in improved bus systems would have been more effective than investment in rail, and there have been civil rights lawsuits in Los Angeles over the failure to move forward with a basic system upon which transit dependent people must rely. I have, incidentally, worked as a transportation planner in Los Angeles.ps: I cannot submit this without a rating.

He argues that the process was inherently flawed and biased towards rail, while berating both the forecasting used for the project and travel demand modeling in general.Unfortunately, he failed to demonstrate whether an expanded express bus network on the I-710 freeway would do better over time than the rail line. This is because he doesn't have a alternative comprehensive analytical process of his own to prove his point! Maybe if he worked as a transportation planner for a major transportation agency or consulting firm for a few years, he would be able to offer a more thoughtful critique."},{"Title":"Emigrants from Fellbach (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany), 1735-1930.

It's clear that Sabra and Wally would both like to get away from their pushy families and be able to make the right decisions for themselves on their own, and the book misleads the reader into thinking that Sabra and Wally are going to maybe fall in love or do something nutty like try to run away together.

The main focus is not really Israel's Weapons of Mass Destruction, but Israel's nuclear policies, particularly vis a vis the United States. This is the story of Israel's responds to US pressure with two similar but distinct strategies, which Cohen designates &quot;Ambiguity&quot; and &quot;Opacity&quot;.In late 1960, the US government came to realize that Israel was constructing in Dimona a large scale nuclear reactor. The uncovering of that Israeli state secret led to various Israeli announcements that Israel had no intention of building Nuclear WMDs. On the 21st of December, 3 days after a New York Times front page story about Israel's Reactor in Dimona, David Ben Gurion made what is still the only Prime Ministerial speech in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) about its Nuclear Policies, stating that the Reactor is meant for peaceful uses only (p.128).The Eisenhower administration seemed initially unwilling to pressure Israel about its nuclear facilities, but following the exposure it did demand answers about Israel's plans. In a meeting with US Ambassador Ogden R Reid, David Ben Gurion stated that the Plutonium from the reactor will be returned to the manufacturing country, that Israel will allow visits of scientists from friendly countries in the reactor, but not international inspections, and that Israel did not plan to construct a third nuclear reactor. He also denied any intentions to construct a nuclear bomb (pp. 130-133).When John F. Kennedy became the 35th president of the United States, US policy became hostile to Nuclear Proliferation, and Kennedy started a drive that ended in the 1968 Non Proliferation Treaty. Therefore, his policies towards Israel were meant to assure that Israel was not constructing Nuclear weapons. Since Israel was doing just that, the clashes were all but inevitable.US Scientists started to inspect (the US's term; Israel preferred &quot;visit&quot;) Dimona in 1961. Despite the US demand for 2 such visits per year, Israel's duck-and-weave policy never allowed more then one single day visit per year.The US continued to pressure Israel, especially towards the end of Kennedy's administration. In April of 1963, Kennedy arranged an unplanned meeting with Shimon Peres, the architect of Israel's reactor in Dimona and then the deputy minister for defense, in which Peres first articulated (apparently spontaneously) Israel's formula about Nuclear weapons &quot;Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east&quot; (p. 159). Towards the end of Ben Gurion's prime ministry, and Kennedy's presidency, the ground rules for the &quot;ambiguity&quot; policy of Israel were set: Israel stated that it had no intentions to construct nuclear weapons, and it allowed US visitors, albeit in a lesser frequency then the US desired. Ben Gurion's resignation and the assassination of Kennedy meant that their predecessors would have to continue, and refine, &quot;ambiguity&quot; as Israel's policy and US's response.The main change in subsequent US-Israeli relationship was Israel's increased interest in purchasing conventional weapons from the US. Strangely, Israel and the US switched roles in these two dialogues. Regarding Nuclear weapons, the US kept pressuring Israel to allow more inspections, and to authorize the US to share its belief in Israel's peaceful intentions, while Israel evaded. In the weapons front, Israel kept asking to buy weapons, while the US tried to evade and delay. Neither side wanted to connect the subjects, because Israel was anxious not to disclose its intentions, while the US feared that pressuring Israel by withholding conventional weaponry would only further commit it to the nuclear option (p. 272). Unlike the Kennedy administration, Lyndon Johnson seems to have been willing to accept Israel's nuclear plans, as long as they were not public. Thus &quot;ambiguity&quot; started to give over to &quot;opacity&quot; (p. 276).Chiefly, &quot;Opacity&quot; meant the acknowledgement of Israel as a de-facto Nuclear power, provided that Israel made few outspoken references to its nuclear capacities. Late in the Johnson administration, the President was unwilling to tie the sale of Phantom jets to Israel to Israel's signing the Non-Proliferation Treatment. Israel's then ambassador to the US, Yitzhak Rabin, defined Israel agreement not to &quot;introduce&quot; nuclear weapons to the Middle East as an agreement not to test it (p. 409). By then Israel clearly possessed nuclear weapons. Under Nixon, the US effectively gave up contesting that definition, and gave up the increasingly embarrassing inspections of the Dimona reactor. On the 18th of July, 1970, the New York Times announced that Israel was a nuclear power, and although both Israel's official spokespersons and the State Department denounced the article as &quot;speculative&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot;, neither denied it (p. 434).Avner Cohen's book tells the story of the creation of the Israeli bomb, and the relations between Israel and the US is just one part of this story. Yet it was the Israeli-American relationship that above all defined Israel's continued policy of Opacity, still intact almost 35 years after that New York Times news story. In the afterwards, Cohen calls for a reconsideration of Israel's nuclear policy, and is encouraged by the new openness of public discourse about it. Yet even if Israel's policy was chiefly designed in response to US pressure, the bomb was build because of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In that conflict, it often seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"For me, as an Israeli, this book is formally contraband, but thanks to amazon.com, I was able to get it. Although it contains no classified material, the Israeli government banned its publication in Israel and the courts chose not to intervene. It is one of the few scholarly books that reads like a detective novel and as an Israeli who lived through the era up to 1970 depicted in the book, I found it fascinating. The description of the fandango danced by Israel, France and the US through the 1950's and 1960's including the original texts of the diplomatic correspondence provides insight into understanding today's configuration as well as that of the past. Cohen's recommendations for future Israeli nuclear policy and his critique of &quot;opacity&quot; should be considered seriously by Israel's policy makers. I think Cohen did us all a great service by writing it and also by showing up the idiocy of the political establishment and its &quot;security&quot; concerns. I also think that it should be translated into Hebrew and made required reading in Israeli civics classes."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"You don't have to be particularly interested in Israel to enjoy this book. What is interesting is that Israel's posture of &quot;nuclear opacity&quot; (as described by the author) is unique in the world. No where has Israel's nuclear policy been studied so extensively, and explained forthrightly. While the showing of arms was conducive to the ambitions of the &quot;great&quot; nuclear powers, Israel had no such ambitions, and thus developed a unique posture. Fascinating for those interested in nuclear policy (for whom I would suggest comparing with South Africa's nuclear program, which was eventually shut down), as well as for those interested in the emergence of Israel."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"Cohen has done an admirable job of putting together a history of the diplomacy regarding Israel's decsion to pursue a nuclear weapons capability. And herein lies the problem. This book should really be titled Israel, America, and the Bomb. Most of the book is dedicated to telling the story of Isreaeli/US diplomacy regarding Isreal's facilities at Dimona. Readers expecting to find any information on how Israel went about actually building the bomb, will be disappointed. Nonetheless in an age were most non-fiction reads like warmed over attempts at mimicing Tom Clancy, it was refreshing to read a well researched, well written, and most importantly well footnoted, work on a topic that is seldom written about. All in all, worth reading, but dont expect to find anything out about Israel's weapons capability or strategies for employment."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"Its the best book I have seen on this subject. It goes over Israel building of the bomb from the mid 50 to the 70's purely from a political level.The big problem is that the book goes off topic. To make the bomb Israel needed France. Their is very little in the book dealing with Israel and France regarding the bomb. Why did France help Israel we do not know? What promises were made? How much did it costs?Yet he goes on and on about Israel and USA. With stuff that are of minor importance as far as the bomb was concerned. As such their are large sections of the book you can just skip.I also found it fustrationg that their was little about the actual technical or construction problems they would have faced in making the bomb. The book sort of glosses over this. We do not know how much it costs, only a lot. How many people were involved. Was it technically a hard job? Was it scientifically hard? And so on."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"Interesting account of the secret development of the Israeli atomic bomb, starting in the fifties with the decision of Ben Gurion, and his persistence. One can hardly exempt Israel from the general charges against proliferation, but at least in this instance there is a certain discipline to the endeavor, and, so far, no mad bomber routines. To be sure, Israel is a special case, the factor of deterrence has surely been more than abstraction. And one can only cheer at the destruction of the Iraq reactor.But this work is interesting for the description of the insidious tactics of 'opacity' in the public discourse of Israel on the subject, that is, the engineered lack of discourse. We invade Iraq to nix the nukes, while Israel simply slipped into half-invisible mode. That is changing now, and the author ponders the future here.

This is important because that Establishment is responsible for the security and well- being of Israel. Cohen as a native Israeli might have had that as priority.On the other hand what he seems to believe is that an open- discussion of Israel's nuclear option is good for Israel. He also seems to believe that it would be better if Israel made it clear to the world , said openly that it has nuclear weapons.My own sense is that this position may well be mistaken.Israel after all is not making threats against its neighbors. It has never in all the years of its existence threatened to destroy anyone.Its adversaries however make threats against it day and night. Now Iran who either has, or is on the way to nuclear weapons is making such threats.Thus a nuclear capability may be invaluable for Israel as ' deterrent' Once however it ended opacity, ambiguity and declared that it has a weapon , other states in the region, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, would do even more than they are doing now to attain such weapons.Cohen believes that telling the story of the Israeli acquisition of the weapon is necessary and important. In telling the story he exposes evasive and not necessarily 'honorable' behavior of Israel vis- a - vis the United States.Is it wise to do this?Avner Cohen's career was undoubtedly greatly advanced by this book.But I doubt that the security of Israel's was."},{"Title":"Israel and the Bomb","review":"Cohen's book is EXCELLENT if you want to know why JFK was assassinated.

She is the fiction columnist for Writer's Digest (WD) magazine, and her short fiction frequently appears in Omni magazine. She also teaches fiction-writing classes for universities and writing conferences.I've been a fan of Kress's fiction column in WD for a long time now, and this book is an extended version of her clear, enlightening advice. The topics covered in Dynamic Characters include: (1) the definition and purpose of characters; (2) naming characters; (3) the influence of setting on characterization; (4) how dialogue reveals characters; (5) choosing telling details to describe characters; (6) basing characters on real people; (7) internal dialogue; (8) dreams; (9) villains; (10) unsympathetic protagonists; (11) how plot affects characterization; (12) secondary characters; (13) conflict leading to violence; (14) growth and transformation in characters; (15) basing plot on real-life events; (16) connections between characters, plot and theme; (17) biographical questionnaire for characters.All of these topics are thoroughly covered in a clear, helpful manner. My favorite section of the book is the 14-page character biography form Kress calls an &quot;Intelligence Dossier.&quot; I transcribed its questions into my computer and use it regularly to help me flesh out my characters when I am in the backstory phase.I highly recommend this book not only to brand new fiction writers, but to experienced ones as well. Kress provides an abundance of insights useful to authors of every level of accomplishment."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Kress is author of the widely read Beginnings, Middles & Ends of the Writers' Digest Elements of Fiction Writing Series. Those who have been inspired and taught by Kress' work in Writers' Digest Magazine will find this book filled with material from the \\"Fiction\\" column for which Kress writes. Kress has taken a systems approach to fiction, refusing to completely segment the different elements but rather bringing all elements together to dance and balance like one of John Bradshaw's mobiles.Dynamic Characters is divided into three parts -- covering \\"externals,\\" \\"internals,\\" and \\"plot.\\" \\"Externals\\" deals with the character's appearance, name, setting, employment, and dialogue. Kress also includes two chapters designed to harness unhelpful characterization. \\"Internals\\" deals with internal thought processes, dreams and responses to newscasts, and villains & other unsympathetic characters. The third part on \\"plot\\" covers conflict, point of view, secondary characters, character change, and theme. The plot section also includes two chapters on where plots can come from.Right from the start this is the type of book that you'll want to hold in one hand so the other can create characters as you read. It is infinitely more helpful than the variety of \\"characterization checklists\\" available on the internet. While such checklists can be helpful for triggering some ideas, usually they are too clinical and fail to adequately suggest life for your characters. Kress helps the reader to see the possibilities inherent in each choice made for the character. Not only does she ask us to decide what kind of vehicle the character drives, but she also prods the reader to consider how the choice of vehicle affects and is affected by the character's personality.Those who are expecting a book in which every word is directly related to the process of characterization are bound to be disappointed or confused. At least four chapters have very little to do with characterization directly. Two chapters cover technicalities of the craft of dialogue and one covers internal monologue -- seeming out-of-place from the earlier chapters more obviously about characterization. Later, in the \\"plot\\" section, Kress has given us chapters on conflict and basic plotting. In each of these chapters Kress takes a break from strict characterization to focus on other elements of fiction craft which impact characterization indirectly.Kress's new book does include a checklist with a good deal of the information from Dynamic Characters included. It offers almost as much suggestion as it requests response. Example:BEDTIMEDoes he/she usually go to bed at a consistent time? ___Yes ___NoWhat Time?____________________________With Whom?___________________________When does a bedtime occur at a different time?___________________________________Does he/she usually fall asleep right away? ___Yes ___NoIf no, what is s/he doing in the meantime--Reading, watching TV, sex, tossing and turning, etc.?This checklist can easily be photocopied by the book's owner and used for a variety of characters.Since Kress' new book does cover territory beyond mere characterization, however, it could be used by a beginning novelist still learning the elements of fiction craft. The final part of the book covering plot weaves together plot, characters, viewpoint, and structure in a unique and particularly helpful way. My favorite chapter is called \\"Also Featuring,\\" in which Kress shows us how secondary characters can help us solve a variety of plot problems: Characters which are unaccounted for at the end of the plot, undermotivated actions necessary to the climax, implausibility in the plot, a too-abrupt climax, \\"thin spots\\" in the plot, clich&eacute;'d scenes, and a distant subplot. For each of these problems Kress demonstrates ways in which secondary characters can step in and save the day.Kress has also done something particularly helpful, showing how plot itself can be about character change. We've all seen it done, but this is extraordinarily difficult to do without instruction or luck. Here's the instruction.At the end of each chapter is a short summary -- 5 or 6 sentences in which the basic gist of the chapter is outlined. This can help the reader narrow down his selection process when seeking inspiration or a solution to a problem.Still, Kress' writing is enjoyable enough to capture a reader's attention from cover to cover. Even if this is difficult to find, I recommend going the extra mile to get it. It doesn't belong closed up on your shelf, in belongs open -- in front of your eyes."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"I read Nancy Kress's fiction column in Writer's Digest Magazine every month and find it always has very practical suggestions. This book on characters is a wonderful compilation of all her wisdom on a topic of particular interest to writers of popular fiction. She does an outstanding job. So much so that I found myself taking extensive notes in an attempt to burn in my brain all the great advice she gives. One of the most wonderful parts of the book is the extensive outline she provides for creating a biography for each of your major characters. This is extremely helpful! I plan to use it for all my future stories."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"This book is a very valuable insight to the writer who has no idea how to work with characterization (would someone mail a copy of this to Robin Cook?). Kress covers all aspects of characterization--from what you need to know about your character, how to use it, character growth, and how character and plot work together. She also provides great examples to click home what she is trying to explain to you. Her examples come from a wide variety of literature (though my favorite was her example from Stephen King's Carrie). This is important to all learning writers."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"I look forward to reading Nancy Kress's column in WD Magazine. She knows how to get her information across in an interesting, thought-provoking way. Her book on character development is absolutely great.

Anyone who uses it will know their character(s) from the inside out. I can't wait to see what her next book will be about."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"If you are a writer who adores reading and writing stories that focus on the characters, you'll fall in love with Dynamic Characters. The author provides an excellent guide to developing characters plus great direction on how to create a meaningful plot based on who your characters are. She also includes one of the best chapters on dialogue I've ever read. Her examples are crystal clear as well as inspiring to the creative muse (hmm, how could I apply this to my story? Oh, yes, this way and that way and...) Because Ms. Kress covers everything that matters to characterization, this book goes far beyond merely how to create fictional characters. It is instead one of the best comprehensive how-to-write books available."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"First of all, don't let this book sit on your shelf! Nancy Kress is an amazing author. She has such a feel for words and makes the reader want to keep reading. It flows well from the first page.She has checklists for characterization that can be found on the internet! She divides the book in three parts: internal, external and plot.After having followed other articles and books by Ms. Kress in Writer's Digest, I knew I was a huge fan, but this book convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt.I'm focused right now on the \\"internal dialogue\\" chapters which someone else might skip over, but is vital to my thriller.I think that's what I like so much about this book. You can zero in on what you need and don' have to read the whole book, cover to cover. She isn't chatty, and is not boring.At the end of each chapter she summarizes what she covered, which is great for me. Sometimes, I go straight to the summary to see if I want to read that chapter.I feel like I have the benefit of Nancy herself telling me where the \\"thin spots\\" are and the \\"implausibilty in the plot\\" can be found. The lessons I've learned in the few short weeks since this book arrived are amazing.If you can only afford one book right now, I seriously recommend this one.(I also think you should get her book, \\"Beginnings, Middles and Ends\\")"},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"There are a certain number of people out there who object to the &quot;list method&quot; of creating a character. And on some points I agree with them. You cannot make a character just by figuring out what they like for breakfast and listing what they do all day. However, far too many beginning writers forget to think of their characters as people who do eat breakfast and pee and grew up somewhere and have fears that have nothing to do with the plot.This books encourages writers to think about all aspects of character and helps them to think about them in fuller, more realized ways.I use this book when teaching writing and my students really enjoy it. It helps not only before you begin writing a story or novel, but in the revision process as well."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Often I find reference books that skim a variety of topics, never giving enough focus to one particular topic. Dynamic Characters breaks down character creation and development into clear and concise segments, with detailed discussion for each topic. The techniques Kress shows have already helped in my writing attempts."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Nancy Kress believes that writing need not be a mysterious art employed only by a select few; it is something that in large part can be explained and taught and understood. She also has a great sense of irony and humor. These traits make this one of the most enjoyable and accessible writing books I've ever read.\\"Dynamic Characters\\" covers a lot of ground. I was surprised to find so much information on dialogue in here, for example. We can't chisel a character out of the work of fiction it's found in and deal with it as a separate entity; character is intimately tied to the rest of a story. Even while we're writing dialogue, setting, and and plot we should be thinking about how it impacts (and is impacted by) our characters. The author presents a million and one different ways to delve into, think about, and develop wonderful characters.Ms. Kress tells us what the pitfalls are of various techniques, what risks we're taking, why different things are considered trite or overused (and what we might try to make them fresh again), as well as why we still might want to try some methods in certain circumstances. She tells us how as well as why, so that we can make our own informed decisions.She's very good about putting her suggestions within the context of all sorts of types of writing: literary fiction, mysteries, romances, science fiction, fantasy, and so on. She uses numerous published examples from sources as disparate as Dickens and Stephen King. This book treats its subject matter extremely thoroughly, is inspiring and enjoyable, and could greatly improve your fiction. The only flaw I found is that it makes other writing books look so much less effective and interesting by comparison.What are you waiting for? If your fiction could use even the smallest boost, then read Dynamic Characters...."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"WOW is the first thing I thought of after I swiftly devoured Mr. Kress' material in this book. As a budding writer, I am very determined to make my characters the alsolute best they can be to reduce the initial onslaught of rejections once I start marketing my book. One of the other reviewers for this book noted writers should keep this book open while writing to get the most for your characters--I agree 110%.I have plowed through some reslly dull 'writer's how-to' books over the past year, and this one is the cherry of the crop. I would run, not walk, to your nearest book-seller (if you plan to write stories with realistic characters) and get this book immediately. I can't say enough good things about it."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Nancy Kress writes really informative books, bottom line. This one is so full of great information that it is hard to incorporate it all. Good characters drive good fiction and this book gets to the heart of the issues involved in creating those characters. I'm a beginning writer who has no formal classroom training, so I'm relying on books like these to help me hone my craft. This one, and other titles by this author, are among the most helpful books I have read."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Book ReviewDynamic Charactersby Nancy KressDynamic Characters is the fourth book on Characterization I've read. I have two to go. I've been beating my head against the wall of traditional publishing for almost forty years. Instead of taking creative writing classes at UCLA, and other universities, I should have been reading books like this one. I would have learned so much more. When I recently started on this quest to improve my craft for developing characters in the fiction I write, I thought that all the books I was going to read would echo and reinforce each other. I was wrong in my assumptions. So far, each book stands alone just like characters in a novel are unique individuals. Nancy Kress does an admirable job in showing the connection between character and plot. The book is divided into three parts. Part one focuses on creating strong and believable characters through such externals as choosing descriptive details, naming the character, how to use dialogue and the pitfalls of basing a character on real people. She actually answered a question I had in chapter eight. Part two of this book covers the internal workings of a character. Chapter thirteen was a learning experience for me, as I had never really considered it important to make your villain as real as your hero. Chapter fifteen provides a system for investigating your character in depth and Kress explains how such a system should be used. Part three focuses on character and plot and how both interact. I found chapter twenty-two specially rewarding when Kress addressed basing plots on real-life events--her advice was priceless. If I had read and studied this book decades ago, my writing would have been different and a lot of grief possibly avoided. Robert Frost wrote a poem about two paths in the woods and choosing which one to take. Forty years ago when I started to take creative writing classes instead of studying books like this one, I went the wrong way. I don't see how I can do justice in reviewing her book in such a way that it would convince all aspiring writers that you should buy this book and devour it, and then keep it on a shelf for support when needed. Once you have done that, don't stop there. Use [...] and the rating system it has to find other books that will teach and guide you to improve and polish your craft so the odds that the rejections slips that keep coming will stop and turn into acceptance. The books on the craft of writing I purchase were all highly rated and only one has disappointed me."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"I bought this copy over a year ago and it's already battered, dirty, and full of my side notes and highlighter markings. I'm a mediocre writer, so I thought I would give this book a try. It is really helpful. It's full of advice on developing your characters and that both experienced and inexperienced authors could use.One of the best things about this book (mind you, there are many), is it has an entire section called the \\"Intelligence Dossier\\" which can be used to keep track of all your character's past, personality, and mannerisms. It is really useful if you have many characters present and wish to make everyone developed completely. Some of the small things it keeps track of are grooming (how they take care of themselves), calm or fidgety, posture, where would she/he like to live, where do they live, how does this impact their decisions, how do they wake up, and fifteen more pages of important things to develop a character. The only downside to this is that you'll have to photocopy it out of the book which may be a bit difficult when considering the spine of the book.The author, Nancy Kress, also makes sure to include examples when describing something she believes needs elaborating. This is actually really helpful. For example, when discussing the importance of developing secondary characters as well as primary characters, she uses examples from The Great Gatsby.Even small facts that you wouldn't think of are included. Such as consistency in anti-heroes and unexpected villains, when it's okay to create characters out of living people, and using dialogue to develop characters further.This is a really helpful book. There is A LOT in here that I can't cover in a simple review. You're pretty much guaranteed to learn at least one fact from this book, and who knows, that one fact could change your career or improve your writing skills.

This book is filled with valuable information and instruction on characterization and how to keep a story moving. It explains how your characters can either make or kill a plot and how a character you love can still be a dud. I recommend purchasing this book as opposed to getting it from your local library. There are things in this book that you will refer to again and again. The Intelligent Dossier itself is worth the price of it.Although it took me a bit of time to get through it (because I was highlighting and re-reading things), it was written with humor and a vast amount of examples. You can put the things you learn to work today. You may not want to finish the book because of the ideas you get but do yourself a favor and finish it.

It's beyond charming and right into irresistable. Some of the material that is covered is also very educational (I'm an author without much higher education. Deal with it.) and it exposes you to some classic examples as well as original ones, broken down and clearly demonstrating the different ways in which an author can say the exact same thing. And that's important. It's all well and good to say \\"Don't ever ever EVER do this!!!\\" - then never telling us what \\"this\\" is.This book doesn't do that. It's clear and in plain english, which is also important.I found myself smiling my way through the entire book."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"Nancy Kress has done it again. She and Steven King has set me straight more than any others.A must read and a great reference book."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"This book expands on or pads out what all the other books say about characterization. Part of the padding is in the chatty conversational way the author presents the material. Part of it is in the numerous examples used. And here lies the danger. Kress assumes that if the author is famous, anything the author writes is an example of good writing. She also ignores any distinctions between so-called \\"literary\\" authors and popular authors and presents examples from both, so long as they are famous. But most readers are bored by so-called \\"literary\\" writing (and with good reason), so using these examples as models of how to do characterization is risky at best.Also, maybe because the passages are chosen as illustrations, most of the examples of characterization are descriptive passages or other \\"telling\\" passages-in other words, they are static. The story stops while this character is being introduced or is being given another coating of \\"characterization.\\" This is a poor way to do characterization. Some of the examples give you an impression of the character. The question is, would you want to stop your story to do it, or can you find an equally effective way that does not stop the story? And what is most important about characterization anyway? These questions Kress does not address. Instead, she surveys all the possibilities and lets you choose.Of course, like any book on writing, you can get ideas from this book. So, you might consider buying it, as long as you take care not to be seduced by the examples given and fall into the trap of using these techniques even though you're writing a popular novel."},{"Title":"Dynamic Characters","review":"I ending up finding this because I was looking for sequels to her Probability series.

Actual patterns would need to be obtained from another source.This book is a wonderful additon for any young lady who wishes to learn to sew the sacred linens and ecclesiastical vestments and study the reasons behind them."},{"Title":"The inquiring mind","review":"More than anything else, Dr. Houle has clearly written in a comfortable style about the two educations we all receive. As an Professor of Education, he knows well the difference between the learner in a compulsory system, and the learner who voluntarily and naturally chooses to go further. Houle leads off his work with a tremendous quote from Edward Gibbon, &quot;Everyman who rises above the common level has received two educations: the first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself.&quot; This little 96 page book is a great tool to introduce to anyone who may feel discouraged or unsucessful in public schools. Houle includes examples of people who have not had the opportunities, or who are intellectually endowed, but nevertheless who are as intelligent and learned as others. He describes a group of people who simply are hungry learners and who know there is more out there to explore. The book would also be great for anyone who needs encouragement to become self-educated ...like college students, housewives, businessmen, and retired people. It is never too late. The study reports some of the qualities and influences that people who continue to learn throughout their lives have. I was also surprized to read about the opposition that some people experience from family and fellow workers when they begin to get more education. As I think about my own experience,I would say that I would agree with him. Some people will not follow nor understand the same path of the explorer. Anyway, I found several great ideas in this book that I can use at work to keep myself stimulated and to stimulate others. I think the price of the book my be a bit high but since this book was one of the first books to influence the adult education movement (1961, revised 1988, 1993), I could justify the few extra dollars. I really enjoyed a section near the end of the book where Hould compares the adult learner with the young child who naturally explores the library on his own. It brought back many fond memories of me going to the library when I was a boy. I enjoyed the book as it was like a nice walk that qui etly strengthens the desire to keep on learning."},{"Title":"My Friend Hitler","review":"Imagine the final play in this book coming after a summary of the original tale in which an ancient imperial family has surpassed Freud in arranging family relationships:\\"Sutoku (1119-64)--officially the first son of Retired Emperor Toba (1103-56) but actually a son of Toba's father, Retired Emperor Shirakawa (1053-1129) because Shirakawa made Shoshi pregnant after he married her to his son--was installed as emperor when he was four, but was tricked into retirement by Toba in 1141, before ever having a chance to exercise real imperial power. His actual father, Shirakawa, had started the insei, a political arrangement in which the retired monarch wielded far greater power than the ruling one. . . .\\" (p. 242).There are a few footnotes in the play \`My Friend Hitler' which remind the reader that the translator is trying to capture the style of German political thought that has been staged in Japan. The footnote on page 133 actually begins with \\"Here, apparently with tongue in cheek, Mishima commits an improbable cross-cultural anachronism. What Hitler refers to . . .\\" I find it more ironic when Hitler is perplexed that his secret police are acting like secret police:HITLER: No, you had your own problems. What can you say about the disgusting things the SA did during the last two years? No wonder the Reichswehr was put off. You made hideouts in basements and warehouses; you tortured, kidnapped, demanded ransoms--I've even heard the story that in some districts troopers took their rivals in love affairs into basements, tied them up on the wall, and cut them up.ROEHM: That lasted only a while. It's just that the young men wanted to mimic what secret police do. I've kept them in check and there's been nothing like that since. (pp. 128-129).How likely is it that Hitler ever complained to a government official that \\"your men swagger about so obnoxiously that serious-minded citizens are completely put off, and as soon as they spot one of your men in the distance, they quickly hide their daughters.\\" ? (p. 129).There are only four characters in the play \`My Friend Hitler,' but it helps to have some knowledge of Goering and the rest of the upper echelon of the political hierarchy, including Defense Minister General von Blomberg, one that I do not recall myself, who are rivals of the main characters, half of whom will be liquidated by the final scene at midnight, June 30, 1934. Another thing I didn't know was about Hitler's \\"law I passed last February after you joined my cabinet, which would give storm troopers wounded during political campaigns the same pensions as soldiers wounded during the war\\" (p. 129). Things must have been pretty bad for the army to be begging to get into the fight to restore order, but that is what Hitler called \\"the Prussian National Army's tradition beginning to roar at last.\\" (p. 130).Surely the main point of \\"My Friend Hitler\\" is that being an old friend of young Adolf and a mouse that eats cheese left in a boot is not a perfect defense against imperfect legal proceedings, if you catch my drift.This book contains a Preface by Hiroaki Sato, five plays by Yukio Mishima, short Backstage Essays on the first production of his play \`The Rokumeikan,' including \\"The Psychology of a Walk-On Role on the Stage\\" (pp. 60-62) about playing a carpenter who keeps his back to the audience for three or four minutes, during which the play seems \\"like an invisible monster that moves blindly in a certain direction while sucking them into the maelstrom it has created,\\" (p. 61). There is a transcript of a speech Mishima gave to Kabuki trainees on July 3, 1970 with many footnotes added by Hiroaki Sato on pages 219-239, the explanation of the play on pages 241-245, and finally, \\"A Wonder Tale: The Moonbow, The Original Tale by Kyokutei Bakin\\" on pages 246-307. There is no index. The emphasis is on drama rather than history."},{"Title":"My Friend Hitler","review":"in pretty much each preface to each play and essay, translator sato openly comments on some linguistic flourish in the original he doubts can be reproduced in english. his attitude is mainly one of, \\"well, here goes nothing.\\" you are forced to take this book as a purely academic venture, an historical document, as opposed to any kind of endeavour worthy of the originals. this is bearable until the last two pieces, where the gist that still comes through is so powerful, so sublime, that the limitations of the translation become all the more irritating.they're literal translations, so the aesthetic flavour is diluted, sentances run on forever and sound jilted when spoken aloud. these are not performable plays, however compelling their subjects are. at least theres some vestige of mishima's 60-odd plays in english, and i appreciate that. they are however mostly from the last 3 years of his life. sato also translated the book silk and insight, which i am afraid i have now lost interest in reading.donald keene's trans of five modern noh plays, that's a quality piece. now ive got to head down to robarts library at university of toronto to look at his trans of madame de sade, which is regretably far harder to find, and far more expensive, than this book, having been published once in the late 60s."},{"Title":"ADHD in Adulthood: A Guide to Current Theory, Diagnosis, and Treatment","review":"Although written for the professional community involved in diagnosing and treating ADD, I found the book to be just as accessible and helpful to the lay reader. The authors are very credible in delivering the information from an objective point of view. A number of topics are discussed in detail concerning assessment of ADD in adults, its coexistence (comorbidity) with other disorders, current drug and behavioral interventions, the effects of ADD within the family and community, and the impact of ADD on individuals throughout their lives. As it is an \\"academic\\" text, each chapter is thoroughly referenced (which I like, because then I get to analyze their info sources). I found the guide to stimulant medications helpful --it was the most information I've uncovered thus far (next to Mosby's Drug reference guides)--as this form of treatment particularly concerns me. I was also moved by the personal stories of people interviewed who have been dealing with ADD, as some of the stories really hit home. OKAY, the book is NOT CHEAP, most books published by academic presses (John Hopkins in this case) are not. The writing is pretty straight-forward, perhaps even somewhat \\"reserved\\", but it is not geared for the self-help, everybody's-gotta-publish-their-opinion market. You will not see this book endorsed on Oprah. Decide for yourself if this book fits your budget, but do try to get a peak at its content through your local community or college library. You might even luck out, like I did, and find a first-printing hiding in the back shelves at a local bookstore for a reduced rate."},{"Title":"ADHD in Adulthood: A Guide to Current Theory, Diagnosis, and Treatment","review":"Volunteering in my community in the area of ADHD, I find the biggest mistake people make is trying to get help on the cheap. They go to therapists and physicians who don't understand ADHD -- and offer suffer severe consequences because of it. They might be treated with anti-depressants and, when that doesn't work, labeled as treatment-resistant. They might be told they are passive-aggressive or have other labels affixed, mostly labels for which there is no effective therapeutic treatment (because the behaviors are biologically based, but many therapists don't know that!).Even in cities with highly trained physicians and therapists, the level of knowledge about ADHD can be appalling.That's why it's critical, if you think you might have ADHD, that you get educated first as a mental health care consumer. And I cannot imagine a better source than this book, from three preeminent clinicians and researchers in this field.Read this book, and you will know more than 95% of therapists and physicians. Yes, I know that is a scary thought, but it is reality. And, this reality will help you immensely in your evaluation and treatment process.ADHD can be a costly disorder -- in jobs lost, marriages lost, bankruptcies, traffic violation fines, etc. It can also take up to five years for most people with ADHD to find care providers who offer effective treatment.By any standard, this book could save you not only money but years of frustration and suffering.

In Ed Mondich's first novel, I learned a lot. Mondich's super-original story line includes fascinating insight into the Air Force Academy, holograms, genetics, hurricanes, medieval Europe, the Shroud of Turin, and homicide investigations. He covers a lot of ground quickly. The reader is taken on a breakneck tour through history and the ragged edge of the most modern technology to experience one of the most original story lines in recent memory.David Jenkins is the hero who is the unwitting participant in a quest that searches for faith as well as scientific inquiry. The novel's concept, despite its original story line, is remarkably simple. What would a 3-D holographic image of the negative imprint left on the Shroud of Turin look like? Moreover, could genetic material left on the same shroud be cloned? An initial thought concerning those questions might conjure up the notion of blasphemy. Mondich, in what could be the novel's most significant challenge, handles the story line in a very respectful way that aids the hero's quest.Ultimately, the reader happily joins Jenkins on his quest. Mondich patiently and succinctly explains the history and technological possibilities of modern science as the quest progresses. The 208 pages of the novel practically fly from beginning to end with the reader receiving what could only be described as a blessing of faith and personal knowledge."},{"Title":"The Crystalline Rain","review":"I found writer E.H. Mondich's, &quot;The Crystaline Rain&quot; unique and interesting. His characters are well-developed and easy to relate to. The dialogue smooth and interesting. And, the plot a real page turner. A very appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc."},{"Title":"The Crystalline Rain","review":"Well-crafted prose, technological and biological breakthroughs, and military skullduggery all play a part in this first book by E.H. Mondich. I can't even imagine the weeks of research that made this premise work so well.David Jenkins is an Air Force Captain, Professor of Physics, and a brilliant scientist. His gift to the world is holographic memory. He's chosen by the U.S. government and the Pope to reveal long held secrets of the Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. David is agnostic, a non-believer, but as pure as any man can be where his work is concerned. When the lab catches fire during testing, and a Papal representative dies, David makes the perfect scapegoat. He creates a new life for himself outside the military, as a professor of physics at Rice University. Always simmering beneath the surface is his anger at a betraying God, a God he flat refuses to believe in.Mondich builds an intriguing tale of greedy politicians and military officers who are not above using anyone - including Jesus Christ - if that will suit their ends. Simpson Biotech International has supposedly cloned Christ from the Shroud. The CEO of S.B.I. is David Jenkin's ex Commanding Officer. Simpson's clone of Christ is dying, and nothing can save him except Jenkin's perfected holographic technology. Simpson has surrounded himself with a mix of civilian and military bad guys. Will Professor David Jenkins be a match for them?The climax of this story is explosive, part excitement and part mystery. Does David Jenkins survive it? Is Simpson's clone truly Christ come back to earth in human form? And what is the amazing phenomenon called The Crystalline Rain? I suggest you read the book to find out."},{"Title":"A Passionate Sisterhood: Women of the Wordsworth Circle","review":"In this book, Kathleen Jones provides excellent insight into the lives of the women involved with the early English Romantic poets (William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey). The reader is struck at the difficulty of these women's daily lives, allied as they were (through marriage or sisterhood) to men whose reputations were growing at such a rate that they often failed to provide their families with the emotional support one might have expected. Of course, such a comment may reflect this reader's contemporary expectations, but surely Coleridge's abandonment of his family, for example, is shocking in any era. Sara Coleridge and the two Dorothy Wordsworths (sister and daughter to the great poet), especially, come to life with great zest. It is a shame in such an otherwise interesting and readable biography that Jones does not provide more of a social context for these people's actions; had she done so, this biography would have approached the quality of, say, Amanda Foreman's _Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire_. Nevertheless, for anyone interested in women's history or the Romantic movement in England, this book should be most appealing."},{"Title":"A Passionate Sisterhood: Women of the Wordsworth Circle","review":"If you've ever wanted to know more about the women in the lives of some of England's greatest poets, then this is the book for you. Edith and Sarah Fricker were married to Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, along with William Wordsworth, wrote some of the best-loved poetry in the English language. However, this is not a book about the great men and their problems with the Muse. It's about the women in their lives, their wives, sisters and daughters, and how they coped with everyday life with poetry and genius as their everyday companions. The Lake poets were geniuses, and not always easy to live with. The women in their lives were often forced to live with incompatible people, run households on very little money, and cope with pregnancy, birth, death and illness. Often, the poet was too busy with his Muse to be of much practical help. The strength of Mary and Dorothy Wordsworth, Sarah Coleridge, their sisters and daughters was admirable under often difficult circumstances. &quot;A passionate sisterhood&quot; describes the other side of the Romantic ideal of the poet's genius. It shows us what it was like for the poet's family, and their struggles make for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"A Passionate Sisterhood: Women of the Wordsworth Circle","review":"The book is a treat for those interested in the history of everyday domestic life, especially female life. The readers learns a great deal about the normal events of courtship, marrying, friendship, birthing, raising children, educating them, keeping house, caring for the sick, and mortality, as well as the values and standards of conduct that existed in the past, some different from now, but some the same. It is all made more fascinating in that it is about the women of the famous poets: the wives Sarah Coleridge, Mary Wordsworth, and Edith Southey, and the sister Dorothy Wordsworth, and the daughters. The book has a lovely gossipy quality. We learn about the characters and relationships, what they thought of each other, what they liked and disliked. I am sure they never imagined that their lives would be the subject of a book."},{"Title":"Hit and Run Trading II: Capturing Explosive Short-Term Moves in Stocks","review":"I believe Cooper wrote this book in response to the huge demand of his first book.

I don't agree with all the theories, nor will I necessarily use these in my own trading. But, for someone new or looking for short swing type of trading methods .. this one is worth a look.Pricey, but consider it an investment."},{"Title":"Hit and Run Trading II: Capturing Explosive Short-Term Moves in Stocks","review":"Following up the original collection of successful strategies in Hit and Run Trading is Jeff Cooper's second and equally outstanding book on capturing explosive moves in stocks. I imagine the question on everyone's mind is, \\"Great, but will this improve my trading?\\" and the answer is - YES. The first book kick-started daytrading careers for thousands, and this one is bound to make you wonder how much further the author can break down the complexities of the markets and delineate methods for taking advantage of it.Hit and Run Trading II, like its predecessor, is all about taking advantage of strongly trending stocks. There are four parts of this book revealing 17 new strategies:1. Trend continuation patterns, holding for a few days2. Cooper's best strategies, including Stepping In Front of Size3. Reversal strategies4. Techniques to improve your trading, including 40 learning examples.Cooper provides solid groundwork for interpreting the dynamics of stocks and the market so traders can recognize the strategies for themselves. For example, the Intraday Relative Strength Trading Strategy (IRSTS), used to identify and exploit strength in big-cap Nasdaq stocks by comparing to the S&amp;P futures action, is clearly defined for makings risk-adverse decisions. After Jeff outlines his strategies with a set of rules and examples, a trader is practically given a map of what to look for. All of the strategies of the book are discussed and broken down to a specific set of rules to follow. Of course, every situation in the market is truly different from the next, but it's the basic pattern and trends that repeat themselves over and over that Jeff has identified and made obvious.A chapter of Q&amp;A's is another valuable resource of this book. Through the years Jeff has been interviewed by radio shows and newspapers, and this represents the best and most useful insights from that material. This is where the reader can really get a feel for the thought process of a trader. Trading isn't just about having some great strategies to apply to the market; to be successful requires lots of hard work and devotion. From being fully prepared each day by locking in hours of research, to having a good understanding of how your judgment may be flawed, this section is an important part of this book and alone makes it worthwhile.If you read the first Hit and Run book, you are aware of Jeff's style and well-thought-out strategies. This book is of the same spirit and quality. Having Jeff's strategies on your side would be a tremendous asset to any trader. Simply getting a glimpse of his perspective on the market would be beneficial to everyone from scalpers to intermediate-term traders. Jeff is a daytrader and a highly successful one. If given a chance, this book could take traders a long way, but as always, the decisions are always yours."},{"Title":"Hit and Run Trading II: Capturing Explosive Short-Term Moves in Stocks","review":"I've used the patterns from Hit and Run I to successfully capture short term moves in stocks over the past two years.

Although I had begun to disabuse myself of this notion in recent years, Hohne's book demonstrated how utterly false the whole idea is. Nazi Germany is shown to be a hive of political activity, with different organizations battling each other and even themselves for power and influence. The SS itself was not united, and its members often disagreed with Hitler over policy. This book paints a picture of bureacratic chaos, where real power existed only when directly blessed by Hitler, and where various underlings would rush to the Fuhrer to report on rival's activities, much like children tattling to the teacher.In this book we see just how central the role of Hitler really was to Nazi Germany. Many of the most evil and crazy policies of the Reich lasted only because of his orders. They would likely have been reversed or modified under any other Nazi leadership.Although I learned a lot from this book, it was not nearly as enjoyable or interesting as other books on the subject, like Shirer's classic.

The SS was far more heterogenous than people can possibly imagine, due to Himmler's drive to absorb anyone he couldn't destroy. This book details the rise of the SS from a handful of toughs to the most dreaded power organization concievable. It also reveals the creation and operations of the Einzetgruppen death squads in the east, how whole police battalions were simply turned into instruments of genocide, and accomplished men of education became mass murderers on an unimaginable scale. The most important aspect is the rise of the Nazi state from a democratic republic.

The SS was a criminal organization, but it was also uniquely German. The SS actually was everything we thought the KGB to be and everything the world thinks the CIA is.Hohne's tale is finely told and emninently readable. The structure, while it does jump around is brought together well for the conclusion. Hohne does not go into every detail, but his overview is thorough enough, either for the casual reader or the hardcore one. He provides us not with a intelligent and malevolent Heinrich Himmler, but an all too human one, not the madman people believe most Nazis to be, but as he was, a civil servant who believed in the fairy tales spun by his Fuhrer, a man who really did not come to grips with the power he actually had or as Hohne has titled one of his chapters:\\"The Impotence of Power\\". The SS could be most likened to a Crime Family gone wrong, pulling in too many different directions, and in some cases fighting itself. Hohne's book shatters the myth of SS perfection, they had no morality and humanity, and they didn't have a clue as it turns out.

Perhaps in the future, stranded on a desert island, I'll finish reading OTDH.But I can assure you of one thing: Hugh Trevor-Roper's endorsement, \\"His book is necessarily long, but never tedious,\\" should be regarded with the same sane skepticism that in 1983 greeted HTR's infamous vetting of \\"The Hitler Diaries\\" as the real thing."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"Written in the style of Shirer's &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,&quot; Hohne's book reports on the beginnings, rise, atrocities, and fall of the SS. Unfortunately it is very bare of the details that make profoundly understandable the SS as a fascinatingly evil and real organization. For example ranks are not explained or delved into, nor the structure of this paramilitary organization, and there is practically nothing of the way they lived and worked. For example I wanted a look into Prinz Albertstrasse where the Gestapo was based, but I got not a glimpse. Also there are important events in SS history that were quickly summarized and passed over, like Heydrich's assassination.

It is a little more obscure and even boring at times. The info on Ernst Roehm and the SD, I thought was very interesting.This book reads faster than The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and Albert Speer's Inside the Third Reich. I felt like with the other two Order of the Death's Head gives a nice picture of Nazi Germany.Because of the depressing subject manner in the eyes of most humans. I would suggest all three works with plenty of time to get the bad taste out of one's mouth between reading them.I also would argue that a focus on power is the best way to look at these people.

It posits a number of interesting theories/takes on the rise of the SS, and I particularly liked the details about the sometimes-overlooked Reinhard Heydrich, who - fortunately for him - was killed half-way through the war. The sheer mundaneness of butchers like Himmler and Eichmann is positively eery, and although we all have horrible visions of the atrocities and most of us have seen Schindler's List, the systematic cataloguing by the authors of the mathematical progression from pseudo-masonic movement (as the SS was) to mass-murder seems scarily logical - small-steps, softly-softly, they-won't notice...this is a book you can dip into whenever you want to feel really, really uncomfortable..."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"Heinz Hohne's study of Nazi Germany's SS, \\"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS\\" chronicles the dreaded organization brilliantly. Hohne's work, now over forty years old, remains one of the great works on the subject and an important tool in the study of Hitler's Third Reich.The book covers all of the major events, characters, and themes of the time including the all of the SS's subdivisions like the Gestapo, the SD, the Totenkampf, and the Waffen-SS. Hohne offers detailed and fascinating looks at Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Eichmann, and others. The formation of the SS as Hitler's personal security detail is covered exhaustively, as is its role in the Rohm purge of 1934. Hohne skillfully writes of the organization's expansion once the National Socialists came to power, and how its leaders exploited Hitler's divide and rule power structure to attain its aims.Hohne's consideration of the role of the SS in formulating and implementing Nazi racial policy is by turns enlightening and terrifying. Created as an organization for Germany's racial elite, it was charged with marginalizing and ultimately murdering those who didn't fit into the Reich's perceptions of acceptability.The SS certainly wasn't the only criminal organization within the Third Reich, nor was it solely responsible for Germany's police state, concentration camp system, or program of mass murder. But it had a major, if not leading role in all of them. This book, while occasionally offering a dated perspective on one or two minor points, is still the definitive study of Hitler's Praetorian Guard."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This book is quite long, and the print size small, but is so well done a researched that you cannot let it go, you just have to keep reading until your eyes hurt.

A monumental historical effort that ranks as the singular history of Hitler's SS by which any other would have to measured. It is nearly 600 pages and very dense. Perhaps at points you will get lost in the names, places or detail but the major figures and pivotal moments in the development of this terror machine are quite clear. The book is absolutely thorough, fastidiously researched and annotated.Hohne is adept at illuminating the forces, dynamics, motives, backgrounds and personalities that, albeit at turns accidental, bureaucratic and chaotic, created and led the SS. The SS was a killing machine, blindly loyal to the state as epitomized by Hitler. It was led by ruthless, despicable, ambitious, little men; calculating and cold. They weren't noble, intelligent, admirable or influential. In any other context they would have been comic and pathetic, with their bumbling, fawning ambition.While this work is not gory it is chilling and frightening because you can easily discern the same forces at work today in individuals, nation states, movements, idealogies and prejudices. Throw together another frustrated despot, add in a few technocrats and psychopathic criminals, along with a herd of vacuous citizens - and perhaps there is only six degrees of separation between us and them.Therein lies the residual value for posterity of Hohne's critical work."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This book is long but worth the time.

This book confuses the Waffen-SS and the SS-Totenkopfverb&auml;nde (Death's Head), two different groups. Proving the author has some unknown agenda, he does not discuss the pan-European nature of the SS. Even the British Freikorps are not discussed (English Waffen-SS volunteers). Also, for the record the Death's Head is not some sick satanic sign, it was a traditional memorial symbol originally used at the funeral for Freidrick the Great the first king of a united Germany.Most sadly however, the tremendous bravery of the Waffen-SS in the final few months of the war is not mentioned anywhere in this book.

There is nothing in the formation, administration, directing and eventual destruction of the SS that is not addressed, and much is covered here which is simply never dealt with elsewhere.From the start, Hitler had to contend with the various power blocs in his government. He had devised a system which his various paladins would have to jockey and maneuver for relative favor, which generally allowed Hitler greater room for maneuver and control, but which also at times forced unpleasant meetings and compromise. Himmler's SS was quite often at the center of these power struggles, as its grasp grew more and more ambitious and it conflicted with first the SA at home, then the foreign service abroad, and finally the Wehrmacht in the conduct of the war. The SS won some of these; they lost some, too. The bureaucratic struggles throughout Nazi Germany take up quite a large part of the book; they did not end until Nazi Germany itself did. Nazi rule was self-contradictory, anarchic and without structure; anything but the planned and directed political order it is usually alleged to have been.As late as 1932 Hitler's position in the party and the nation was often in doubt. The 1934 Roehm Putsch, in which Hitler of all the top Nazis looks least duplicitous and may well have been maneuvered into against his wishes, is presented almost minute by minute. It is one episode among many which are treated definitively by Hoehne; others include the evolution of the racial policy, of the death camps - their planning, design, implementation and abandonment - of the peace feelers made to the west by Schellenberg of the SD and others; it contains a wealth of fascinating information.Himmler's own grip on his institution was incomplete. Not only was he far from omnipotent even at the height of his power, his personal influence waned as the SS itself as a power center waxed. The smaller pre-war SS could be guided politically, seeded racially, and its leadership trained personally; as the organization expanded into eventually every single sphere of German life, Himmler's own control could not keep up. Much as Hitler was left as the broker of last resort in his circle, so Himmler spent more and more time keeping his competing SS police leaders, governors, recruiters, labor exploiters, camp commmanders, and death squad leaders from going at it amongst themselves.Finally, the bibliography though dated is excellent, and the index is very good and useful. For a one-volume detailed history of the rise and fall of the SS as an organization I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This recounts the history of one of the most evil organizations ever created. Founded in 1925 as a bodyguard for Hitler, the SS ultimately became a security, military and bureaucratic behemoth whose influence pervaded the entire Nazi empire. Contrary to both contemporary propaganda and subsequent popular belief, however, neither the SS nor the Nazi regime were monolithic organizations devoted to exercising their leaders' directives. Indeed, a suggestive metaphor for the Nazi state would be that of a cancerous tumour, in which a collection of aggressively growing and constantly mutating cells maintains just enough cohesion to carry out its expansionist aims. The government consisted of a variety of departments whose ill-defined and overlapping responsibilities resulted in a permanent state of fractious feudalism. This arrangement suited Hitler perfectly. By pitting his subordinates against each other he maintained his position as the supreme and final authority.The SS, for all its powers, was therefore still hemmed in by its rivals, of whom the most notable were the SA, the Party and the Wehrmacht. The rivalry with the SA was eventually settled in blood in the Roehm putsch of 1934, following which the SS gained primacy. But the rise of the SS would have been likely in any event by virtue of the Party's ascension to power. The SA had served its purpose: the regime no longer required an army of politicized street brawlers but rather a professional security apparatus.The rivalries with the Party and the army were not so neatly resolved. Party administrators frustrated SS designs in the occupied regions - for example in Poland under Hans Frank - while Martin Bormann controlled access to the Fuehrer. The SS ambition to create its own statelet outside of Greater Germany was never realised. The Wehrmacht, meanwhile, maintained a long-standing opposition to the arming of Party organizations - both SA and SS alike - and initially inhibited the development of the Waffen SS. In the field of intelligence the SS organizations the Sicherheitsdienst and the Gestapo were frequently in conflict with each other and the military intelligence service, the Abwehr. This is apparently why the Stauffenberg circle, which almost succeeded in assassinating Hitler in 1944, escaped SS notice: its members were mostly in the military.The Waffen SS eventually developed into a formidable fighting force. Based on storm trooper principles - which in fact had their origin in practices developed by front-line officers in the First World War - and which emphasized mobile, elite strike formations, and staffed by highly motivated and ideologically committed troops it was widely acknowledged as the best force on any side in the war. But its very success was self-limiting. Thrown into the harshest battles on the Eastern Front it took heavy casualties. At Rhzev in winter 1942, for instance, the SS regiment \\"Der Fuehrer\\" attacked and drove back a much larger Soviet force - reportedly in temperatures as low as minus 52 degrees Celsius. Of an original strength of 2,000, however, only 35 survived to claim the victory. The inability of the German population to provide enough manpower for a force which peaked at a strength of 900,000 led to the creation of what was in effect an SS foreign legion. While the earliest recruits came from sufficiently Nordic countries such as Holland and Norway, the numbers were eventually topped up by groups such as Soviet Muslims. Ultimately casualties, foreign recruitment and generally lowered levels of ideological fervour resulted in a dilution of Waffen SS strength.The one area of supreme and unquestioned SS sovereignty was the world of the concentration camps. Minor impediments notwithstanding the SS was ultimately able to round up the large part of the Jewish population of the conquered territories. They were wiped out in the camps. Perhaps the most striking juxtaposition of Nazi petty legality and raw brutality is the bizarre story of the SS crackdown on improper behaviour by its own staff in the camps, in which hundreds of charges of corruption and even of \\"unlawful\\" killing of inmates were laid. Since these cases had to be properly documented, investigators were put in the absurd position of having to examine the precise circumstances of the isolated deaths of a handful of inmates in an environment where thousands were being killed \\"legitimately\\" every day. In the end, two hundred camp staff were themselves executed before the investigations were concluded.Heinrich Himmler, the SS leader, was the stereotype of the Nazi functionary. A master bureaucrat, tenacious and obsessed with the minutiae of office politics, he was physically unprepossessing and far from the Aryan ideal. Nor did he approximate it any more closely in fighting spirit. He almost collapsed on one occasion when viewing the execution of Jewish prisoners. After a disastrous stint as a military commander in 1945 he feigned illness, reportedly cowering beneath the sheets when visited by General Guderian. As the inevitable outcome of the war became clear, he began to think increasingly about the prospects of surrender to the Western Allies. But such a plan would have entailed removing one major obstacle, namely Hitler, and this Himmler could not bring himself to do. In thrall to \\"the greatest brain of all times,\\" Himmler - who clicked his heels when the Fuehrer spoke to him by telephone - was still dithering in early 1945. Finally, despite an admonition by finance minister von Krosigk that the Reichsfuehrer SS could not go running around in a false beard but must surrender openly, Himmler attempted to sneak through British lines in disguise. When detained he bit on a cyanide capsule, a coward to the (literally) bitter end.The history of the SS is one of a fatal combination of arrogant brutality, overweening ideology and abysmal ignorance. Annihilated forever in 1945, it will continue to fascinate and appall readers for centuries to come.This account is well-written and comprehensively researched, but somewhat difficult to follow because of its non-chronological approach. Given the vast scope of the topic, however, even such a sizeable volume as this can provide no more than an overview."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"The central theme of Hoehne's thesis is that the SS, and Nazi Germany in general, was not quite the efficient all-for-one tight-knit apparatus everyone thinks it was. There was structure, however the structure of the state apparatus was mostly set up by Hitler to keep his subordinates too busy fighting amongst themselves, to threaten Hitler's position. (Contrast this to Stalin's method, which was to simply kill off all potential rivals.) The subordinate departments; the SS, SA, SD, Gestapo were quite independent of one another, and often were at odds with one another due to overlap in jurisdiction.There is a wealth of information in this book. A lot of things in here will surprise you; for example there is the case of Ernst Roehm, the leader of the SA, who went to court over a stolen suitcase. The thief was a male prostitute who testified in court that he left Roehm (without his suitcase) because Roehm wanted to \\"engage in a form of intercourse which he found abhorrent.\\" And Roehm wasn't the only Nazi homosexual. (A \\"distilled\\" account of Nazi homosexuality can be found in the books \\"Pink Swastika\\" by Lively and \\"Germany's National Vice\\" by Igra.)While not as comprehensive as Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" \\"Order of the Death's Head,\\" like Shirer's book, gives the reader a good picture of what times were like then, and it is certainly sufficient to read this book if you want to understand some basic things about Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"The \\"Order of the Death's Head\\" first published in 1965, was written while the dust had not yet settled on world war two and at 40 years of age Hoehne's work is a historical classic of the Nazi Period. As with Albert Speer's \\"Inside the Third Reich\\" and Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", this is one of those quintessential works of the period. Focusing on the rise and actions of the German SS, this book certainly does not glorify the SS or the Nazi party while providing a near exhaustive record. The work, while still very useful is still quite flawed in its organization and is by no means complete. The majority of the work focuses on the origins of the SS and the early Nazi party as well as later actions as a political entity and finally discusses the SS involvement with concentration camps. While discussed, the combat actions of the Waffen SS are but an aside to the greater focus of the work and many significant happenings within Nazi Germany are discussed quickly while others that may seem less significant are given substance. This book is an excellent though incomplete resource that is well written and receives both benefit and disadvantage from the period in which it was written.Building up the scene Hoehne discusses at great details the ideal and actions of the early Nazi Party and the formation of the Schutzstaffel (SS). Filled with interesting detail and anecdote this is perhaps the richest portion of the work. As the work progresses Hoehne discusses the interaction of the SS with the other part organizations including the SA the party itself and later the Wehrmacht, SD and Gestapo. Here we see a central theme of Hoehne's work: The Power of the Nazi Party rested solely in Hitler and all of the party organizations were dependent on Hitler and a few of his staff. Thus, the SS as pervasive as it had been, was always just one organization in an interdependent and often redundant network that comprised the political structure of Nazi Germany. The work goes on with continuing sporadic detail to discuss the \\"night of the Long Knives\\" the Gestapo, Kristallnacht, The Early War/occupation of Eastern Europe and the Concentration Camps. This last subject the author provides lucid descriptions and many grim and overwhelmingly bizarre instances.This work is certainly among the most influential and resourceful works on the Third Reich. Along with the other two books mentioned above, the average person can get a pretty good understanding of a most bizarre era of history. No one of these books is complete and certainly there are many things completely ignored in all three of these books. The fact remains that \\"Order of the Death's Head\\" is still one of the finest and most complete books written about the SS. It makes a great point of departure for studying the SS and will be a work that the historian will reference often. The book is also well researched and has a great bibliography. Overall, I would recommend this book to college students and above and may want to be prefaced by a little basic 20th century German history if needed. Otherwise this book is a good record however, casual readers be warned, the book may be confusing do to its lack of chronological ordering. Considering that this book was written before the dust settled on the era and an historical consensus was just beginning to form on the Nazi Period, this is a very worth work that all interested parties ought to read.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This book exploded some of the myths that I had come to accept as a given on the Nazi regime. I believed that the Nazi regime was a well oiled machine that ran more efficiently than any other in the world. Then I come to find out that the regime worked on nothing more than a cult of personality and that personality's ability to foster rivalries between competing forces on the lower rungs of power. It's amazing to me that in this chaotic atmosphere this regime was able to make the trains run on time let alone reconstitute the most powerful and technologically advanced army in the world.This was also the most comprehensive look at the SS I have read as of yet. The author goes through the organization with a fine tooth comb to really give one a good look into this eclectic organization. The author goes through the reasons why some would join the SS for the credibility and standing membership gives the individual within the Nazi regime. Many professionals joined this organization so that they would be able to advance in their careers within the framework of the regime even though they were philosophically opposed to the organization. This of course does not go for every member. Himmler also had philosophical and practical problems between keeping his organization \\"pure\\" and raising enlistment numbers within the SS so he could gain more power and influence.The book does a very good job describing what was happening during the regimes final days. Himmler's pipe dreams of leading the SS to the battlefield to save the German army to his belief that he could take over and negotiate terms with the allies and not be held to account for the horrible crimes committed under his authority. As the regime collapsed around its leading figures, they continued to exist in a world that was divorced from reality. Whether it was Goering's art and fine wine collections or his drug habit, Hitler's reliance on the miracle weapon or Himmler's unfounded belief in his military prowess, the leadership of the Third Reich was rarely in touch with reality. Even as Hitler's ability to actually command any part of Germany, Himmler could still not bring himself to act against the fuehrer.This book was such a great find for me that I hope others may read this work also. There are rather few reviews for this work even though I believe it should be an essential read for anyone who wants to understand this era history. It is big but don't let the size intimidate you because this is one book that rewards the effort put into it."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"One of the first things I realized as a history major undergrad was that a lot of history, even recent history, was open to interpretation. And even when it really wasn't open to interpretation, a lot of historians would interpret it anyway. Sometimes this works, sometimes it clouds the issues. This is a bit of both, but well worth the effort to wade through this doorstop of a book because of the unique perspectives it gives not just on the SS, but on all of Hitler's Germany. The most controversial thesis, but one I thinks he supports well, was that the third Reich was not a well-oiled machine and the SS was not all powerful. Rather it was a collection of modern day feudal bureaucracies, and Hitler built his power playing them off one another. Eventually the SS probably did emerge as one of the top two or three players, but by then it wasn't going to do Hitler or his top aides much good, since by then their time on earth was short.In addition to exploring the bureaucratic and personal wranglings of the various factions, the reader encounters a wealth of Gauleiters, Untergrueppfuehrers, and all manner of leaders and \\"chess pieces\\" that Himmler and Goering and Goebbels and others used to build their power. There are so many names, and the accompanying German ranks so rarely correspond to ranks the English or American reader is used to, that it can become very confusing. In addition the book does not build in logical, chronological fashion, and the reader can find himself lost in a third or fourth look at the Roehm Putsch, for example, suddenly jumping out at him. In other words, structure and segues were not the author's strong suit.Overall I found it a worthwhile read, and interesting enough for me to finish. It also didn't overdo it on the concentration camp aspect, and gave one a \\"nuanced\\" look at the SS that was still in no way an apology."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This was a good book overall, but it has a hard time telling you where you are as far as the timeline of the war is concerned. It constantly jumps back and forth and it is at times hard to understand. Yet you have to give the author credit for amassingthis much information on one of the most secret organizations of our century. Should have been a thousand pages long, then it might have covered a few things more in depth. Also would like to see more pictures of the central people involved."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"Hohne's book is quite an achievement. The footnotes and bibliography alone are worth the price of the book. Hohne's biographical profile indicates that he is a journalist, but his balance and scholarship, as exemplified in this book, are indicative of an historian of great talent.Hohne provides the patient reader with a picture that helps to explain a very complex subject. Why did Himmler try to stop the death marches as the Nazi regime collapsed? Why did the Waffen SS shift from an almost demonic vehemence in the early part of the war, to an organization much more like the Wehermacht at the end? What did Himmler really think of the effectiveness of the policy of extermination in the east? The answers to these and dozens of other questions are laid out in a way that makes Himmler less of an enigma, and more of a pathetic dupe of his Fuhrer.The book is not always easy to read because a strict chronology would not work well for an organization as multifaceted as the SS. By organizing the book by area rather than by strict chronology, however, Hohne makes the reader shift gears fairly often, and although all is well resolved by the end, there are times when one wonders if something was missed. The effort is worth it."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"Heinze H&ouml;hne spins a masterful tale of the organizational quagmire that was Nazi Germany's SS. In so doing, he punches a huge hole in the Hollywood-developed myth which usually portrayed them as evil, highly-organized and efficient automatons in films like The Eagle Has Landed. Even worse, whole generations have grown up believing such poppycock as \\"true history\\" and that Heinrich Himmler was the second, most powerful man in the regime.Well, evil they certainly were. But organized and efficient? Not hardly. Nor was \\"Reichheini\\" [the unflattering nickname pinned on Himmler by a host of Nazi Party members and SS leaders] as overwhelmingly powerful an individual as he appears in movies and novels.Not only was he and his \\"claptrap racial superiority theories\\" [the words of one highly-placed Nazi] more often than not ignored, but several senior SD [security branch] officers were either openly critical [\\"He had power but in practice he made no use of it in Germany; he and his power were a pricked balloon\\" - Otto Ohlendorf], or simply disobeyed his orders.One example of this was Dr. Werner Best, his man in occupied Denmark. Under orders to round up all of that country's 6,500 Jews for removal to the camps, he simply arrange for their escape to neighbouring, neutral Sweden. He then sent a note to Berlin which said \\"1. Anti-Jewish action in Denmark carried out without incident .... 2. As of today Denmark can be regarded as free of Jews.\\"Himmler had even less control over his vaunted, fighting arm, the Waffen-SS, as top generals like Sepp Dietrich, Paul Hausser, Wilhelm Bittrich, and \\"Panzer\\" Meyer paid him no attention whatsoever.Fully indexed with several photos of people like Dietrich, Heydrich, Himmler, and marching columns of SS, as well as the death camps, it also contains a detailed fold-out organizational chart of the structure of the SS in 1944.Fascinating insight, this book, first published in 1966 in Germany, is sure to raise more than a few eyebrows among those of you who grew up believing the Hollywood version."},{"Title":"The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS (Classic Military History)","review":"This is a splendid book! Hohne has really spent time delving into this bizarre Order, and the result is nothing short of impressive. The most fascinating thing to come out of this was how unorganized the Third Reich was. I grew up thinking the SS was the bastion of ruthless efficiency carried out by the Third Reich war machine, but the author shows us the truth behind it all. Of course the SS soldiers themselves were ruthless, efficient, and everything you've been brought up to believe - but the top brass and politicos of the Order were nothing more than petty, squabbling bureaucrats, looking for anything to get in good with the Fuhrer. The triumph of this book, as I see it, is the combination of the two. You are shown the SS of legend and the SS of reality.It is always fascinating, and although there are some dull pages dedicated to numbers, facts, figures, etc, the pace quickly picks up and you are never left wanting for interesting material. I read this as a college student because I wanted to know more about the SS and the Third Reich in general. It solved all my problems and dispelled a lot of rumors as well. (One such being how the SS used to work with the major Zionist movements in trying to EXPORT the Jews to Israel instead of killing them. Also fascinating is the Teutonic Knight element injected into the Order - they really thought they were the reincarnation of these old Knights! Lots more...)In short, the book is long but does not drag for more than a few pages at a time. It's very well written and fascinating - and if you have ever wondered about the SS as one of the most notorious groups in history you'll love this book. Pick it up, it's a great read."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"This is an exceptional book.

Peters' command of the English language is impressive. Her ability to portray life in 12th century England is also impressive. These stories are good period pieces. I have enjoyed all of the episodes I've read so far.On the other hand, this particular installment is not the most mysterious of Brother cadfael's mysteries that I have read. It is clear from early on who the ordinary ruffians are. It is also clear who is troubled and has questionable motives. It only remains to clarify the relationship between two troubled young men to sort out the mystery. Further, the mystery doesn't have much immediacy for the reader, having taken place a considerable distance away and before the story opens. This story is also a bit &quot;gushier&quot; than most. The romantic angle is played up with a bit too much intensity and there is a &quot;miraculous&quot; healing during the story that fills a whole chapter and does little to further the plot.I enjoyed this book. It was a pleasant and easy read. But, as a mystery, it was only mediocre. If you are a Cadfael fan, enjoy. But, if you're looking for a real whodunit, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"If you're interested in an audio edition, check that you're getting the unabridged recording narrated by Stephen Thorne.Ideally, read all the preceding books in the series, in order, before reading this one. At a minimum, first read #1 (A Morbid Taste for Bones, the story of how the monastery came to have St. Winifred as its patroness) and The Virgin in the Ice, to avoid the biggest spoilers.This June of 1141, the feast of the translation of St. Winifred dawns upon a time when the civil war between the Empress Maud and King Stephen for the throne of England may finally draw to a close: Stephen was captured at the battle of Lincoln, and even now Maud is negotiating with the city of London for her entry into Westminster for her coronation. The papal legate, Bishop Henry of Blois, brother to Stephen, has called a legatine council (including Abbot Radulfus from Shrewsbury) and is working on turning his allegiance to the empress, for the sake of peace. Hugh, sheriff of Shropshire for Stephen, broods on ways and means of getting a man into Bristol to free Stephen, and prays for a miracle, while using his friend Brother Cadfael as a sounding board.Cadfael, too, is praying for a miracle - any miracle - at this feast of St. Winifred. Not from a desire for the abbey's glory, or from any faltering of his own faith, but as a sign that the saint took no offense from the events of _A Morbid Taste for Bones_, when he accompanied a delegation from the abbey to the saint's grave in Wales to bring back her mortal remains as holy relics. (Since that was before Hugh's arrival in Shrewsbury, Cadfael summarizes the story for him, so it's possible to follow the plot of _Pilgrim_ without reading _Bones_. But be warned that Cadfael reveals the ending of _Bones_ to Hugh.)Abbot Radulfus returns in time for the festival, bearing word of a cowardly murder at the legatine council. The attempted murder of the envoy of Stephen's queen failed, but Ranulf Bossard, the brave man of the empress' party who foiled the attempt, was himself cut down in the street.All the brothers are busily preparing for the huge influx of pilgrims at this time of year, many of whom are ill and seeking miraculous healing. Brother Cadfael, as herbalist, sees some of the more noteworthy cases: Rhun, a devout half-Welsh boy with a twisted leg that might respond to treatment; his sister, Melangell; a young Welsh clark, Ciaran, traveling barefoot and wearing a large iron cross, on his way to Wales to die; Matthew, Ciaran's faithful shadow. There are less savory characters, as well, petty (and not so petty) career criminals who prey on the credulous and the frail. (Credulous, as in, people who trust a stranger's dice.) Some may even have fled from a city too hot to hold them.Into this festival atmosphere rides a young envoy of the empress' party, on a twofold mission: to sound out Hugh on the question of his fealty, and to seek Bossard's young heir, who disappeared in this direction after his lord's death. But even if he is among the pilgrims, how can he be identified by those who have never seen him? And was he involved in Bossard's death?"},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"In this, the tenth of the Brother Cadfael series, the year is 1141, and with King Stephen of England a prisoner in Bristol, the Empress Maud is negotiating with the people of London to be crowned at Westminster. Stephen's queen has sent an envoy to the bishop to plead her husband's cause when he is attacked in the street. One of Maud's own men, Rainald Brossard, is appalled at this unfair attack and goes to his rescue. In the ensueing melee, Rainald is himself stabbed amd killed. In the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul in Shrewsbury, the monks are preparing for the annual pilgrimage which is held to celebrate the anniversary of the day when the bones of St.Winifred, a Welsh, virgin saint, were brought to the Abbey. Cadfael is especially praying for a miracle to occur, as he has a slightly uneasy conscience about the actual retrieving of the bones which is explained in the first book of the series, A Morbid Taste for Bones.A strange pair of young men arrive at the Abbey guest house, one of whom is walking with bare, bloodied feet and bearing a very heavy iron cross around his neck on a thin cord. The other man never leaves his side for a minute, even during sleep. The mystery of the story is easy to work out but the whys and wherefores are more complex. It's another wonderful slice of mediaeval history brought to vivid life by Ellis Peters."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"The Pilgrim Of Hate is another Brother Cadfael mystery that takes place amid the intrigue and pageantry of medieval England. It's 1141 A.D. and the celebration of Saint Winifred has brought a flood of pilgrims to Shrewsbury. Cadfael carefully and cleverly unwinds a twisted tale of retribution, murder, and medieval evil. Stephen Thorne's superb narrative talents do full justice to Ellis Peters' celebrated Brother Cadfael that has become one of the most popular mystery series in the annals of the genre. This Audio Partners complete and unabridged, six cassette audiobook edition is flawlessly produced and will send the listener avidly seeking Peters' earlier Brother Cadfael tales."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"This is the tenth book in the Cadfael series. It differs quite a bit from the PBS TV version.There is a lot going on in this book. The (actual) Stephen-Maude struggle for the throne of England is in the background, but plays quite a role in the plot of the story. There is a murder, but it happens far from Shrewsbury Abbey where most of the story takes place. The story is set during the St. Winifred festival.The festival attracts a number of pilgrims, as well as some shady characters. There is one group, an aunt and her niece and crippled nephew, who owe a lot to good old St. Winifred by the end it seems. I enjoyed the character of the aunt, although she is not a major one. In addition to these, there are two men traveling together on a bizarre pilgrimage who stop for the festival. In a surprise turn, Cadfael's son, Olivier, makes an appearance.It is hard to see how all will turn out which makes for a good read waiting for the truth to be revealed. The title is a clue, but not a very big one. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"St. Winifred's festival at the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul draws many pilgrims, most of them expecting the saint to perform miracles. No one needs a miracle more than a young man whose long walk to the Abbey has cost him a great deal of pain, thanks to a twisted leg that cripples him. No one except, perhaps, that young man's sister; for both are orphans, in the care of a loving but poor aunt, and between her brother's care and her own lack of dowry the girl needs a miracle if she's to have a decent life.No one is more mysterious to Brother Cadfael, the Abbey's medical practitioner, than two young men who travel together inseparably. Ciaran, a Welsh clerk, walks on bare feet and carries a heavy cross around his neck on a cord so thin that it cuts into his flesh. He's accompanied by Matthew, who never willingly leaves his side; and who constantly urges Ciaran to put on shoes, take off the cross - do something to make himself more comfortable, despite Ciaran's insistence that he is bound to his suffering by a vow he dares not break. When Matthew and Ciaran fall into company on the road with the crippled Rhun and Rhun's sister, Melangell, the lovely young woman captivates Matthew; and the attraction proves mutual. But Matthew will not be separated from Ciaran - not even when Melangell considers herself freed from taking care of Rhun. The reason for that connects plausibly with the novel's larger plot structure, which follows the real world history of conflict between King Stephen and the Empress Maud for England's throne.Nicely written, although rather complicated thanks to the heavy doses of medieval politics. Luckily that aspect of the book does not overwhelm the human dilemmas faced by the characters. I particularly enjoyed the return of Olivier, whom we met in an earlier book, and Cadfael's interactions with him.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"This is the second or third Cadfael novel that I've read and it makes me wonder why I don't read more of them. The series centers around a Benedictine monk in 12 th century England with the civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen (both grandchildren of William the Conqueror). I don't much care for contemporary mysteries but I enjoy historical ones (Caleb Carr's 'The Alienist', for example). And in addition to being good mysteries Peters' books are well-written. Like so many of the really good authors, she has a gift for metaphor and that is what puts the poetry in her prose. The books also educate the readers about life during this time and the history of 12th century England."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"Ellis Peters's THE PILGRIM OF HATE continues the series with a second appearance of Oliver, Cadfael's son and expands their relationship leaving the reader with the question, \\"Does Oliver know his father?\\"The mystery of who murdered the knight Rainald Bossard is a background plot the an excellent story of pilgrims in search of miracles and those who prey upon the believers.This is a series that should be read in the order of their appearance to understand all the small references and relationships among the main characters.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"This installment of the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael-the tenth of twenty-- should bear a Spoiler Alert. The first chapter summarizes the plot of A Morbid Taste for Bones (the second in the series) and a later chapter discusses a secret revealed in The Virgin in the Ice (sixth in the series). While each of the Brother Cadfael mysteries can stand alone, it is a good idea to read them in order. The reader who does so will welcome the reappearance here of some of the characters met in earlier volumes, including the elusive Olivier de Bretagne, and will appreciate this volume's variations on earlier themes. The murder that drives the plot takes place not at Shrewsbury Abbey, but many miles away, at the king's court, and of course is ultimately intertwined with the varied destinies of a group of pilgrims who come to the abbey to celebrate a saint's day and pursue their own demons."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"There's a saying among statisticians (a group I identify with from time to time): \\"You can always draw a straight line with two points.\\" Loosely translated, this means that you should avoid drawing conclusions based on fewer than 3 observations. This being my third Brother Cadfael mystery (I obtained a random selection from a neighbor's giveaway bin), I feel I can now opine more confidently, knowing that my recommendations are probably not based on a coincidental selection of the best the author has to offer.As always, the author provides us with a fascinating and unparalleled look into life in medieval England, with particular focus on monastery life. This installment, however, is less of a whodunit than the others. The principal crime was committed hundreds of miles away from Cadfael's home in Shrewsbury and all he has to go on are some second or third-hand accounts and some unusual visitors at the annual pilgrimage in honor of St. Winifred. In some ways, the mystery solves itself, with Cadfael simply providing a nudge here and there to bring the matter to conclusion.For those interested in 12th century English history, there is an especially potent dose of it here, as the brewing civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen comes to a head. Wading through these details makes this a bit more difficult of a read than usual. One interesting upshot of this part of the story is the implication that it is possible for political (if not military) enemies to be civil and gentlemanly with each other. What a novel concept!The book also explores the nature of revenge, and the ultimate lack of fulfillment in it. This, too, is a concept that is mostly foreign in today's world.Romance is again a significant feature, always a pleasant surprise given that the setting is a monastery. In this case, however, the romance is relatively conventional and only peripherally related to the crime. It does however, provide useful clues for resolving the mystery.Another subplot relates to a mysterious visitor whose past is connected with Cadfael's, resulting in a surprise revelation at the end of the book. Cadfael also engages in a good deal of introspection regarding miraculous divine intervention, as befitting the occasion of the pilgrimage.In summary, this book continues the tradition of solid storytelling and fascinating reading established by the author in the Brother Cadfael series. Both novitiates and long-time fans of the series will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THE PILGRIM OF HATE The Tenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael.","review":"I thought I had tired of Cadfael, but the book suddenly sat there on a shelf - the only new book that seemed to call my name, so I tried, and she did it again. The storyline is close to the rest of the books in the series, a combination of a mystey and a lovestorey. This time with a surprising conclusion. Resume: there is (as usual) a fair near the convent, pilgrims come to the fair because the saint (from Morbid taste for bones)is beeing moved to her permanet resting place. Among the pilgrims a pair of men travelling together, one a pilgrim the other his companion and a small family consisting of brother, sister and aunt. These five plus Cadfael are the main charecters. We get a miracle, some political intrigue, a small love story and a murder all in a readable prose.

A child of 12, sold for $500 to a brothel in Manila services 10 men a day and she is kept in perpetual slavery. She has been infected with HIV. &quot;Veronica's life has ended&quot; and all the miracle prayers we send up will not redeem her.This book is about the shattered lives of children. It is about the reality of such painful deprivation for the estimated one million new child slaves each year. It is not just about the pain, Kilbourn also considers what prevention and holistic intervention needs to take place to salvage these abused children.In \`Sexually Exploited Children' Phillis Kilbourn presses the boundaries of our dignified comfort zones as she takes us into the world of 'Sexually Exploited Children'. She does not stop with just child prostitution, child pornography, or pedophile rings, but she also peals back the ugly scab of incest. Kilbourn does not leave us as voyeurs into the heinous world of sexual perversion, rather her sections dealing with prevention and intervention postulates some hope.Reality says that the immoral world of child sexual exploitation is only a symptom of deeper economic, social and spiritual problems. Normalcy says parents don't sell their children into sexual slavery on a whim; rather it is because of a major breakdown within the society. A breakdown not just in Asia, Brazil or in &quot;those backward poor countries&quot;, but this world exists here in our homeland - big time.Kilbourn's bottom line is that if we, as an educated, advanced society, fail to acknowledge and then engage these profane activities, then we 'de facto' accept the dehumanization of these perverted people and their pervasive powers. We 'de facto', by our disengagement, inadvertently accept Dante's world as our world.Kilbourn and MARC publishing have done us a significant service by revealing this dark world to us. This is a must read if you are willing to have your conscience pricked. But, be aware that during your reading you may hear the voice of a child crying and find yourself involved.

He made the move to be closer to his mother, although inwardly he dislikes the move. His very first day on campus goes poorly as he inadvertently sits on a bench reserved for athletes who have earned their letters. In a heated exchange with Curt Robinett, the starting center on the basketball team, Vard immediately makes a bitter enemy.The basketball season has already started, so when Vard talks to the coach, he is told that he has little chance of playing this year. However, Vard insists on going out for basketball and immediately shows that he is a quality player. This earns further hostility from Robinett, although some of the other players dislike Robinett and try to make friends with Vard.Unfortunately Vard has a chip on his shoulder and a temper that is occasionally unchecked. When his roommate tries to pull a stunt to steal a bell from a rival college, Vard tries to stop him. He is placed on probation when he refuses to name the guilty parties after an anonymous letter places him at the scene. Despite being given many chances to change his attitude, Vard continues to simmer, blaming everyone else for his difficulties.In a fury, Vard quits the team, but he finds that not playing hurts more than swallowing his pride and seeking forgiveness. The coach, a very nice and low-key man not consumed by winning, agrees to allow Vard to come back on the team. The final game of the season is for the league championship and Vard plays the game of his life, leading his team to victory. At the end, Vard is happier than he has ever been, when he sees how moved his coach is by their victory.This book is an example of the best juvenile sports fiction. It is so well written that you feel like part of the action and there is a serious lesson about life. Learning that team play is important and that we succeed or fail as consequences of our own actions are lessons that we will find valuable throughout life."},{"Title":"Captive universe","review":"When my dad used to read to us kids 'way back then', I remember Captive Universe as one of the more graphically vivid stories.

He has the terrible feeling something is wrong with life in the ancient Aztec world. Yes, it's ruled be despotic rulers, there are monsters and superstition, but something more insidious is amiss. Our hero attempts an escape from his valley to find answers and a better life -- and what he finds is mind boggling.When Chimal uncovers the truth, well, what we have is just amazing science fiction fun.I wish more of today's books were tightly written like this compact novel. My old paperback is 160 pages of tiny print. It's a 1969 copyright edition issued by Berkley Publishing. It seems that today's publishers are trying to sell books by the pound. They think that if a person is going to cough up $9 for a paperback, they want something with 700 pages, with some heft to it. But the result is a lot of egregiously overwritten books filled with dead weight print, pages that one can skim and still pick up enough of the flow to get through the book.

Needless to say I very much enjoyed rereading it.Although written as an exciting sci-fi adventure, the book examines in the role of religion, intelligence and culture in regulating human life. The book follows a life of Chimal a boy born a genius amongst a civilization of below average intelligence Aztecs. The boy continually questions the cultural traditions and sometimes barbaric religious rules that his village has followed without question for hundreds of years. To his elevated intelligence some of those rules make no sense at all.Needless to say his questioning gets him into trouble and on a series of adventures which reveal the true nature of the world in which he lives.I find great parallels between Chimal's situation and those in the world today.

This book offers plenty!!"},{"Title":"Collins Atlas of World War II","review":"I chose to purchase this Atlas on account of its author, John Keegan. The Atlas is presented in an an attractive format. Each page contains a description of the battle/era alongside a map portraying the relevant events. The maps are clear, colorful and diverse. Map topics range from political developments (pre-war), strategic military events and tactical battle views, down to the battalion level. Of particular interest I found the Stalingrad map, which clearly displays the city's various districts through an isometric view. It's the first map I saw of its kind, and provides excellent understanding of a battle conducted in urban terrain. On the downside, the pages are too small for my taste, degrading the level of detail in the maps. Additionally, while ideally covered in conventional Atlases, I believe that this Atlas should have provided a geographical survey of the battlefields, describing the topography, demography, climate and land-type. It would have saved me the need of consulting another atlas. All in all, an excellent buy, and an interesting read on its own, although mainly suitable as a companion to other WWII literature."},{"Title":"Collins Atlas of World War II","review":"The Collins Atlas of World War II is by no means comprehensive -- but it's not meant to be. What it is and what it does very well, is give an overviews of battles and situtations from the war. It does this with a ton of full-color maps, supported by text and charts. The maps, to be sure, are somewhat small -- but the book is small. It atlas offers itself as a well-illustrated overview, and it more than keeps the promise. The price is extremely enticing."},{"Title":"Collins Atlas of World War II","review":"This is a generally excellent reference source. It contains clear, comprehensive, and well-drawn maps on a variety of issues relating to World War II, including for example, shifting political boundaries and allegiances, as well as battles. The troop formations and movements for major battles are very well done. All charts, tables, and maps are in color for further clarity. The text itself (each mini-topic is given a two-page treatment) is also very well-written.But a shortcoming to the book is its slant on references to certain activities involving the Soviet Union at the outset of World War II (and beyond). For example, the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland in September 1939 is politely described as an \\"intervention,\\" suggesting that the Poles somehow needed to be invaded by the Soviet Union to protect themselves. In addition, after the Soviet Union invades Finland and Finland reaches a temporary accord with Germany to protect itself against the Soviet Union, Finland is categorized as an \\"Axis\\" power. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's takeover of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is described as a peaceful process whereby, after the Soviet Union established a military \\"presence\\" in these countries, they were annexed to the Soviet Union. (The book does disclose, however, the little-known fact that the Soviet Union, after its mutual non-aggression pact with Germany, \\"annexed\\" the province of Bessarabia and portions of the province of Bukovina from Romania.) Further, the book discloses that the Soviet Union took 3 million German soldiers prisoner and says they may not have been treated well but gives no indication whatsoever on how many died (even the Soviet Union's capture of approximately 250,000 members of the German Sixth Army, of whom it is generally estimated 90-95% died in captivity, does not merit a mention). Yet the book does mention the Soviet capture of 600,000 Japanese soldiers as prisoners of war, then mentions that 10% of them died in Soviet captivity, purposely implying that the death toll among German PWs was the same rate when it fact it was several times higher. Finally, the Katyn forest massacre is included in the index but there is no actual discussion of the event in the book.The point of this seeming digression is that book should only be viewed as a starting point for the topics it discusses, not a comprehensive treatment.The book is divided into five parts: (1) \\"The Prewar World\\"; (2) \\"The Axis Advances\\"; (3) \\"Turning the Axis Tide\\"; (4) \\"Allied Offensives\\"; and (5) \\"Allies Victorious\\". There are no photos other than an introductory one for each part. As noted, there is an index. The index does not include any persons, places, or things mentioned in the many maps and tables in the book. I.e., if an American general is mentioned in the text on one page and a map on another, the index only includes the textual reference."},{"Title":"Collins Atlas of World War II","review":"The perfect Military Atlas of WWII probably does not exist since one could always wish for more or for less detail and features. This one is an acceptable compromise even if I would have wished for more complete coverage: for example it does not cover the 1942 campaign in the Crimea, around Sevastopol and on the Kerch peninsula (of questionable strategic importance, but of tactical excellence for its commander FM von Manstein; should be given the same importance as Rommel's Tobruk).Still this Atlas has a wealth of information including* a summarized timeline on the top corner of each left page* www links at the top of each right page* detailed maps of tactical movements with topographical features and longitude/latitude in most cases* maps other than tactical: economies, losses, expulsions, resistance, camps* an accompanying text of quite high quality.But there are unfortunately minuses:* the format is too small for the level of detail and the wealth of information* there is no legend explaining the topographical color coding (see for example as illustration Pimlott's AtlasThe Atlas of WWII)* there is no km or mile scale (again see Pimlott's for an example) which for a less experienced user may confuse the concepts of tactical movement in say the Crimea versus say the CaucasusAnd finally there are some blatant errors:* page 83: \\"2 north Caucasus jan-apr 1942\\" should read 1943 instead of 1942* page 96: \\"Kassserine ...German counterattack on 14 May\\" should read February, not May.And those are only the ones I caught so far so there may be more."},{"Title":"Collins Atlas of World War II","review":"This colorful atlas is a mild abridgement of theThe Times Atlas of the Second World War. That large coffee-table atlas is my favorite for WW2. However, the Collins Atlas includes about nine-tenths of its larger brother in a more portable package. In the Collins edition, the pages are smaller, some of the two-page overview spreads are gone, most of the maps are redrawn in a cleaner graphic style (though with less relief detail), some smaller maps are absent, photographs are now only in section dividers, the large timeline at the front of the Times Atlas is now split up into mini-timelines for each spread, and websites are listed. I still prefer the Times Atlas overall, but the Collins Atlas is a terrific value and can be carried around for reference when I'm reading other books on WW2.

The photographs and illustrations are first rate - angles, cropping, detail enhancement, color/lighting - all are superbly produced and intelligently presented. In addition, there is plenty of helpful information (locations, hours, tips ). History/background is brief, but as expected in a general survey guide. The heavier, art quality pages add a bit to the weight (approx 1.4 lbs), but it is definitely worth it, given the volume's beauty and durability. For any trip to Venice and the surrounding area, this is one of two essential books (Venice for Pleasure, is the other)."},{"Title":"Venice & The Veneto (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"The DK guide books are becoming a necesity for us on our travels. The pictures give you an idea of what you'll see, but what's helpful, is that based on what you read, you can narrow down what is on your priority list. Because honestly, unless you're going to be in a place for over a month, you can't see everything."},{"Title":"Venice & The Veneto (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"and with this unhelpful guide, it's especially easy-in fact it almost broke up my marriage! The maps are simply not detailed enough for reliable navigation and the fact that you must see adjoining maps for continuation make it especially frustrating -in a city where the average street seems to be only 1 block long-streets rarely continue from one map to the other. Using the maps became an exercise in exhaustion. Just a bit of overlap between map pages would have greatly facilitated navigation.The book is also not up to date. For instance the Vaporetto routes that run from the large car park at Tronchetto are not different than the ones that actually serviced that stop, leading me to have to alter plans as to how I would get to my hotel.I also found the restaurant recommendations unreliable and wound up doing far better trusting my own instincts. In fairness, I did use one of the recommended hotels and was quite pleased with the accommodations, and the index is quite thorough and easy to use. In sum, if, for some unexplained reason, you feel compelled to purchase this guidebook, buy it because of the pictures and by all means, make sure you have a good map to supplement it."},{"Title":"Venice & The Veneto (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"Liked it alot.

I'm actually a travel book addict, and I bought four different (yes, I know it's excessive) guides for my recent trip to Venice. The DK guide was my favorite. It is completely engrossing, with actual pictures of the food, the palazza, many of the art works, etc. It's a perfect guide for a 'high points' look at the most touristed sights: the Basilica, the Doge's Palace, etc. My favorite feature turned out to be &quot;A View of the Grand Canal.&quot; I actually sat with the guide open in my lap on the vaporetto ride from Piazalle Roma to my stop near the Salute and could watch as every important church and palace on the canal passed by. It was so much fun! And the guide is absolutely gorgeous! Even after my trip, I have enjoyed just flipping through the guide to take a look at some of the beautiful photos and drawings. It's a great souvenir in that it has photos of many things you are not permitted to photograph: the insides of churches, museums, etc.So why only four stars? Well, the guide is actually a little light on more practical information, such as where you can get a good meal for a decent price. It's full of all the expected tourist recommendations (e.g., Harry's Bar), without telling you about how to navigate a good baccari like a Venetian (although I did think the pages which included descriptions AND photos of typical Venetian dishes was excellent). If you have a budget of a few hundred dollars a day to plop down on food, that may be ok. The rest of us will need some help. And while it may be an unfair criticism, the guide gives all its information in lire. Unless you want to carry around a currency converter to figure out the Euro equivalent, I'd supplement this guide with another. In fairness though, I'd like to give it 4.5 stars. It is really an excellent book."},{"Title":"Venice & The Veneto (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"This wonderful guide book is crammed with pertinent information, helpful as well as lovely photographs, detailed maps and valuable suggestions.

We studied them before our trip, consulted them during our trip, and kept them as memo and photo book after our trip. They are simply essential part of the travel fun.I recommend buying indiviual city/area book wherever possible instead of the country book.

I bought many guides available to this city but took only two with me: DK Eyewitness and City Secrets (the latter one is an excellent assortment of subjective specialist views, get it if you take your trip seriously).Descriptions of usual high-profile highlights and lesser-known places are clear and accurate, as usual, pictorial plans of churches and streets are very helpful.Accommodation and dining sections are quite superficial, I increasingly find these parts not the strongest bit of Eyewitness guides: they tend to focus on most famous places which rarely represent the best value for money and often are shameless tourist traps. In fact, there is no need to list specific places - what the guide could do is present general guidelines on what to avoid (such as places with menus in five languages) and what to look for (places that don't take credit cards, for example).I found the map of Venice at the end of the book completely sufficient and as easy to use as could be possible in the Venetian maze of streets of multiple names and multiple spellings.Veneto part is not really the best bit of the book - Verona is covered only adequately and Padova receives simple an inadequate treatment. The authors probably had to find a balance between thickness of the book and depth of coverage.I was pleased with coverage of less obvious areas such as Dorsoduro and Canareggio, which are still inexplicably ignored by 90% of visitors (well, maybe they don't have time).All the criticisms above are observations of only minor glitches of what is a very, very strong guide and what probably should be your first choice for a trip to Venice."},{"Title":"Venice & The Veneto (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"Guidebooks in general are going to have their limitations. The gentleman that complained about this one answered his own complaint. A larger, folding map is certainly an essential when trying to navigate (and I use the term literally here) this city. That said, this appeared to me on a recent visit to be extremely helpful, especially in terms of giving me an artistic/cultural overview of the main sites. The same could be said about the same company's editions of Rome and Italy proper. They don't dwell on frivolous detail. They are relatively compact and they will guide you to the places you want to go if you are interested primarily in art, history, and architecture, which I was. As an aside, for anyone who is serious about art I would suggest that before you go you aquaint or refresh yourself with Vasari's &lt;Lives of the Artists&gt; (Penguin suggested), Cellini's &quot;Autobiography,&quot; and any Art book published by Rizzoli. Buy your guidebooks beforehand and determine which artists and which works are most important to you and try to pre-plan in your minds eye at least the path you want to take. Also ask some travel agents or discover on a website the museum hours and when the publice is allowed in free. My only chance to visit the Vatican, for instance, came on a Sunday, when there was free admission and early closure, which led to a rush-job through the sistine chappel. Don't rely entirely on a site such as Rick Steves. My friend did and thought he could pretty much wing it through Italy.

Unfortunately, in the more advanced chapters, there are some factual errors and misleading statements which made me suspect of the rest of the book's validity; including the MATLAB files.For example, in Chapter 6, the statement is made; \\"The most unique characteristic of the matched filter is that it produces the maximum achievable instantaneous SNR at its output when a signal plus additive white noise are present at the input. The noise does not need to be Gaussian.\\" For non-Gaussian noise, the optimum signal processing is often non-linear; not the linear matched filter describe in this book. For example, for impulsive noise, the optimum receiver includes a clipper, which removes the large peaks of the impulsive noise. Also, I did not see where it was pointed out the optimizing the SNR only maximizes the detectability if the Probability Density Function of the signal plus noise remains unchanged. For non-Gaussian noise, the optimum operation will increase the Probability of Detection (for constant False-Alarm Probability), but might not maximize the SNR. If faced with a problem which includes non-Gaussian noise, the student of this book might have to \\"unlearn\\" what they read in this book.Also, it defines noise figure as \\"...the noise figure is the loss in the signal-to-noise ratio due to the added thermal noise of the amplifier ((SNR)out = (SNR)in - F in dB).\\" It does not state that the SNR in must be with the input noise due to a input termination at 290 degrees K (IEEE definition.)

I was so sad to finish the book, and yet could not stop reading! I loved the characters and the way the story begins and unfolds. The narrator's take on marriage and relationships resonated deeply with me and I really, really loved the book."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"After thoroughly enjoying my first discovery from author Jeanne Ray, Eat Cake, I immediately returned to the library to check out what else she had to offer. I'm pleased to say that I found Step-Ball-Change a delight as well, if not QUITE as enjoyable as Eat Cake (after all, what could beat all that cake?), then nearly so. Again, Ray has taken a family drama and turned into something both relatable and endlessly entertaining. There aren't very many books that can make me laugh out loud, but so far, Jeanne Ray's novels are batting 2:2 in this category. Ray's characters here can seem a bit stereotypical at times--there's Caroline, the mother holding the family together; Tom, the endlessly understanding father; Taffy, Caroline's sister and an impeccable Southern lady; Kay, Tom and Caroline's daughter who seems to be a confused new bride-to-be; and Trey, Kay's finance, a typical privileged rich boy--or is he? As the novel progresses, Ray does a nice job of adding additional layers of complexity to her ensemble cast, so the plot, while comfortable, is never predictable. This was a fun book that would make a great summer read; highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This author is hilarious! Couldn't put the book down. Fabulous story whether you are a dance enthusiast or not."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"Lovely little book. The writing is witty, characters are charming, and I'm sure you'll recognize several of your family members here. Doesn't everyone have a relative's dog that has never bitten before? I'm bummed Ms. Ray only seems to have two other books - but am enjoying Julie &amp; Romeo right now. Thanks, Ms. Ray, for a delightful story."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I had heard about this book from other book club friends and I have to say they were all right, it's a wonderful story. I found myself wishing by the end of the book that I was one of those magical and talented people that had dance in their blood.Caroline and Tom have a home that at times appears to be a three ring circus. Caroline's sister invades their home after her husband leaves her, daughter Kay arrives engaged to one perfect man but in love with another and son George falls for the contractors daughter, who just happens to practically live there as well. Throw in one small yappy dog and numerous other colourful characters and you have total chaos. Through out the story the one constant that Caroline and her sister have in their lives is their love for dance. No matter how difficult times seem once those dancing shoes are strapped on all is right with the world. Is it any wonder this reader wishes to be a dancer?This is a truly heart warming story and I certainly hope to read more of Jeanne Ray in the future."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I was reading slow, I didn't want it to end. I am now looking for more books of Jeanne Ray's. I normaly only read book dating in the 1800's. I loved it"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This novel was wonderful. I truly did not want it to end. Ray's characters are so vivid and three-dimensional they may as well be living next door. Her writing is witty, sharp, and endearing. I hope she publishes another novel or two soon!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I was looking forward to this book, unfortunately, I was disappointed. 1 dimensional characters and a forced plot made this not a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I just finsished reading Step-Ball Change. I couldn't wait for it to come out in paperback since I loved Julie and Romeo so much. The story was good, funny, entertaining. The relationship between Caroline and her sister Taffy was typical of two siblings....it had it's moments. It was nice to see that even though they were so different all theirs lives, in their later years became so close. It had the families intertwined as did &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot;. But I felt there was something missing. I also was not thrilled with the inter-racial relationship of Caroline's son George and the Contractor's &quot;Woodrow's&quot; daughter Erica. As was Woodrow himself, not eactly thrilled but was accepting because he knew the whole family well and respected them.The story on a whole was good and a fast read. But those of you who loved Julie and Romeo (her first book)as much as I did, might be a little dissapointed in Step-Ball Change. I'm still looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I read this book because Ray's first book, Julie and Romeo, had been so good I decided to follow up on her progress. She is just as good in Step-Ball-Change. The story starts off very unassuming with our two main characters having supper when the phone rings. From there on it is one family catastrophe after another. The story is funny and the main characters are interesting and true to life. The secondary characters are also realistic. Actually, one of the best characters in the book is a white terrier who is nervous and energetic and never bites anyone until...well, you'll see.Step-Ball-Change is a very funny story of family life. The story encompasses the lives of both young and old characters and their happiness, trials, and tribulations and how each member of the family relates to one another in the context of those trying times.Step-Ball-Change is a funny and entertaining story and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"If this were a movie, it would be one of those wacky screwball comedies from the 30's. Some of the scenes are so funny, you find yourself laughing out loud - particularly when food is involved.The cast of characters includes:The husband and wife who just want to make it to retirement and a well earned quiet existence by a lake who find their lives turned upside down by ...The sister whose husband has left her for a woman younger than their daughter who arrives for a visit (of undetermined length) with her little dog who loves to bite ankles.The daughter who becomes engaged to a man whose mother is planning a reception for 900 (&quot;And how many do you have on YOUR list, dear?&quot;) but who gets distracted when her ex-boyfriend (who always seems to be around - especially at meals) becomes attracted to her exotic cousin.The contractor who is adding a Florida room on their house. Major foundation problems have come up and he also always is around - eating and giving advice.Read it, enjoy it and share it. This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars. I loved it, I could not put it down.I knew that I wanted to read it because I enjoyed her first one so much. By the way, if you havn't read that one, Julie and Romeo, you will enjoy that one as well. I was supposed to be packing for a trip, but I found myself just sitting and reading, and reading. I loved this family, warts and all, I wanted to introduce George to one of my nieces, and I wanted to take tap dancing lessons, even though I cannot dance at all, and I mean any kind of dancing! I just wanted to feel the joy the author was describing. I love watching old Gene Kelly movies, well all the old dance and song movies, and I was envious I could not ever really feel the joy you get from the actual dancing, not just the watching. This was a funny book, warm and sentimental book, and a hopeful book. This is a book I would buy as a gift for a friend, what better compliment is there,than that!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This is my first time to read this author and I thoroughly enjoyed Step Ball Change. Her characters are believable and recognizable. Take the time to read this one...you'll recognize your own family members in this story. I couldn't keep myself from reading parts out loud to my husband as I raced through this book. I'll definitely read her other books."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"The plot of this novel is detailed in so many other reviews that I will try not repeat it all again. Suffice to say, this is a delightful story that can be read easily in an evening. By page thirty we have met most of the main characters and they are truly likeable people. Enter 'sixty-something' Tom and Caroline McSwain. Both have fulfilling careers; he's a public defender approaching retirement and she's a dancer running a small dancing school.The four McSwain four children are grown now, but the story of their parent's own wedding has become something of a family legend and early on we are entertained with an amusing account of their elopement. Ironically, a large portion of the book deals with their daughter's impending marriage to a member of Raleigh's blue blood society...and what a financial disaster it could turn out to be for Tom and Caroline.The McSwain's are a family with a great sense of humor. The dialogue is fast paced and dotted with snappy one-liners. (Why can't my family be as witty?) The description is apt without being excessive, and many times Ray's subtle, yet insightful, phrases touch the heart deeply. As we read along and watch members of the McSwain family agonize over the age old question of: What love is and if it's real? One thing we know for certain is that the size of the wedding has absolutely no bearing on the ultimate question - will love last? Excellent!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"If you're ever down, buy this book and keep it on hand. It's sure to lift your spirits!!! You may even start tap dancing!Likable and believable characters, good story line told with great charm and humor (not the cynical brand of humor that is so often found in today's writing)--just charmingly funny. When this book came to the end, I thought how much I'd love to see it made into a movie!!!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I really liked Julie and Romeo and couldn't wait for Ray's latest Step-Ball-Change. This is truly a delightful read. We meet Caroline and her husband Tom who are trying to save the foundation of their house which has developed a few cracks in it.All of a sudden their personal lives seem to take on the same aspect. Caroline's sister Taffy calls to say she is coming for a visit as her husband has left her for a woman younger than their daughter. At the same time Caroline's daughter calls to tell her parents she is engaged to the wealthiest boy in town. From there on the story starts to roll. Caroline and Tom begin to see their retirement fly right out the window as they invision having to pay half of a million dollar wedding. The quiet contractor Woodrow, training Taffy's viscious tiny leg biting dog into being a calm house pet and trying to fix their house before it totally gives way. I love the way dance is brought into this book. Caroline has been a dancer all her life and this book tells the story of how one family learns to dance together. That time goes by too fast and that you have to speak up and say what you feel and always dance."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"It was charming from beginning to end, never dull, never over-the-top and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read it. Having recently read two very lackluster &quot;chick-lit&quot; type books this story was a refreshing change of pace. There was no bitterness, no over the top shenanagins, no ridiculous situations and no 20 or 30-something nitwit heroine.Instead the story is told from a happily married 60-ish heroine (Caroline) whose life is turned upside down when she receives two phone calls simultaneously from hysterical woman. One is her daughter, Kay, who is crying tears of joy because she's become engaged to the catch of the century and the other is from her sister Taffy whose husband just ran off with a very younger woman. Taffy &amp; her nasty little dog Stamp temporarily move in with Caroline and Tom while she decides what to do with the rest of her life. Caroline is less than thrilled with the fact that her daughter is marrying into such a wealthy family especially when she learns that they intend to invite 900 guest. Poor Caroline sees her retirement plans flying out the window. This story is about life's little (and bigger) bumps and all of the interwining relationships.I also really enjoyed the way the author incorporated dance into the story ~ it read like it was her true passion and added a lot of depth to Caroline, Taffy &amp; George. There are many touching moments and wise observations about love, romance and marriage. The characters were all terrific and came alive for me and I hated to let them go when the book ended (something I rarely say about a book these days!). At times I wanted to shake some sense into Kay and felt like she was totally insensitive and selfish but it turns out she's only human (and really not so bad in the end) just the rest of the folks in this book . I smiled and my eyes teared up quite a bit while reading this and I'm adding this author's other books to my wishlist when I find a few spare minutes. My only complaint? This book could've been longer as I felt it all ended too quickly but maybe that's just because I enjoyed it so much."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"No one can make domestic chaos as much fun as Jeanne Ray. In her second novel, Ray creates two delightful characters in Caroline McSwain and her long-time husband, Tom. Just as they congratulate themselves on having a quiet night with a dinner for two, the McSwains are interrupted by two phone calls. One of them is from their emotional daughter Kay, who has just become engaged to one of the wealthiest men in town, and the other is from Caroline's sister Taffy whose husband is leaving her for another woman. Thus starts the delightful chaos which envelopes the McSwains and their friends. One especially enjoyable character is Woodrow, a contractor who is making the McSwain's home improvement project into his life's work. In his spare time, he trains Taffy's wayward dog and begins to restore her self-esteem. By the time things are worked out and the proper people have become couples, the reader has had some good laughs and has grown very fond of Ray's loveable characters. Ms. Ray, please keep these delightful books coming!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"Like Julie and Romeo (Jeanne Ray's first bestselling novel) Step-Ball-Change is a comic novel full of light moments and romance. It is a domestic novel in the most literal sense of the phrase: most of the scenes take place around the McSwain's kitchen table. Caroline McSwain, age 62, is happily married to her husband Tom and enjoys her job as a dance studio owner and instructor and her role as a mother of four grown children.Though there is a constant low level of chaos in her life due to the renovation work being down on their home, the chaos level jumps at the beginning of the book when two tearful phone calls come at the same time. The first is from her daughter Kay, who has just become engaged to Trey Bennett (of The Bennets, who own the local hospital and bank). The second is from her sister Taffy, who is in need of comfort and a place to flee her philandering husband. Though Caroline and Taffy have never gotten along well, Caroline invites Taffy to come stay for an indefinite period of time.How Caroline dances the ever thought-provoking exchanges with her sister while keeping the home fires burning for her adult children makes for an entertaining tap dance of a read. Jeanne Ray makes the sixth decade of live seem vital and full of humor and possibility, while also capturing the depth of the sister relationship. This was a wonderful book to read, and I look forward to Eat Cake, which will be published in May of 2003."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I loved this book so much, I started re-reading it immediately. I thought the characters were a hoot and so real. I don't often laugh out loud when reading a book, but I surely did with this one. Having been involved with 5 children/stepchildren's weddings, I found the whole deal really humorous. I thought Woodrow was the best character. Such a great book!!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"After reading several less than satisfying books this summer, I finally hit upon a winner. Step-Ball Change by Jeanne Ray is one of the most delightful books I've read in a long time and I highly recommend it to one and all. In the tradition of authors like Susan Isaacs and Elinor Lipman, Jeanne Ray approaches family life with both tears of joy and sorrow. And we as readers can't help falling in love with both her characters and writing.Mimi and Tom McSwain have raised four children over the course of their marriage while Mimi owns and runs a dance school while Tom, a lawyer, works for the prosecutor's office in their town. During a rare and tranquil evening come almost two simultaneous phone calls. On one line comes the voice of their third born child announcing her engagement to a most eligible bachelor, while on the other line comes a sobbing phone call from Mimi's sister, Taffy, announcing that her husband has left her for a much younger woman. While their house is undergoing what was supposed to be a minor renovation, Tom and Mimi are beset by a host of problems with Ray treats with great wit and pathos. While Mimi worries if they have enough money to host a wedding of nearly 800 people, she must also contend with her sister's arrival and her poorly trained dog who bites everyone, her daughter's future mother-in-law who is busy choosing colors for bridesmaid's dresses and making appointments with a wedding party planner, her dance studio and a contractor and workmen who are now making the McSwain residence their second homes. As you can imagine this book is filled with wonderful characters and some of the funniest scenes I've read recently. Mimi who at 62 dreams of retiring although she still likes to do a step dance number or two, her husband Tom a calming influence for all who insisted that he and Mimi elope many years before, their youngest son, a law student, who also teaches at the dance school and everyone thinks is gay, Taffy, Mimi's younger sister who typifies a high maintenance woman and who also has a few dancing surprises in store for Mimi and finally George, the black man hired to build a sun porch who winds up teaching the McSwain family a thing or two about life and love.This is the perfect book for a hot day in the summer or come of think of it at any time. If you liked Jeanne Ray's first book Julie and Romeo, you're bound to love Step-Ball Change. And let's see if you don't consider taking tap dancing lessons the way I am doing now once you've finished this book."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This is not the best that Jeanne Ray has written - that goes to EAT CAKE which I highly recommend. Jeanne Ray is an entertaining writer. Her stories focus on an older generation of women which can be more rewarding than the obvious &#34;boy-meets-girl-in-Jimmy-Choos&#34; scenario that is so common in regular Chick Lit."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"There is a vast expanse - or is it just a tiny tightrope line - between engagement and divorce, in between which lies the realm of marriage which can be fraught with turmoil and chaos. When it's good, however, it stands the test of time, as Caroline and Tom McSwain have learned. What began for them as a snap decision to elope has matured and blossomed into a relationship that has seen birth, loss, tumult, strife and uncertainty but has, if anything, grown stronger for the experience. Despite the wisdom they've gained, they still find it difficult to help others through the same journey. They struggle to accept their daughter's recent engagement to one of the wealthiest men in Raleigh and can't help but feel dread at the thought of putting themselves into debt for a marriage that couldn't possibly last, especially since Kay seems to have strong feelings for another man. Neither can they really help Caroline's rich, beautiful and once-estranged sister, Taffy, make sense of a marriage that has failed and left her with no purpose to her life. Because life is never simple, Tom and Caroline's lives are further complicated by a crumbling house foundation and a demon-possessed dog. Will things ever return to normal? And will they be able to help Kay and Taffy find the way to a love like theirs?Jeanne Ray's understated, subtly ironic style is so refreshing and I have enjoyed every single one of her books. Her characters are realistic and down-to-earth, easy to relate to in the way that you would your own family. Their lives are not perfect and the situations in which they find themselves are painfully funny, but there is something so captivating about them that the reader just can't help but want to have that certain something that they all seem to possess. Her observations on family, relationships and life in general are poignant and wise, but delivered in an off-beat, tongue-in-cheek way that makes them amusing at the same time. She truly is a master at the one-liner. I can't sing her praises enough. Five stars and more!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This was another light reading and I enjoyed it.

There are numerous characters and multiple plots; all the characters are different and likable and all the plots have happy endings.

Though their love has only strengthened with the passage of time, their lives are complicated when Caroline's sister Taffy, newly dumped by her husband, moves in with her obnoxious pet lap dog; their daughter Kay gets engaged to a Kennedy-like millionaire and plans the society wedding of the century, while still dallying with her old boyfriend; their house foundation is threatening to collapse around their ears; and their footloose and fancy son George falls desperately in love with the housing contractor's daughter, all at the same time.Will Taffy get a good divorce lawyer, will Kay choose the right man, will George's love be returned, will the sagging foundation ever be fixed, can they possibly pay for Kay's mega wedding, and most importantly, will Caroline and Tom ever get a moment's peace together?

It made me feel good about people and life. It made me smile. It made me wish for more. I love Jeanne Ray's writing and hope she has many more stories up her sleeve.

Daunted by the fact that their only daughter is engaged to a rich man in town ~~ they try to figure out ways to help pay for a lavish wedding.

I hope not! I don't know what it is about her writing, but I adore it. I polished this in a day, most of it spent in a room full of miserable people at H&amp;R Block. I laughed so many times it was rude, but I couldn't help myself. As a wife, a daughter, a woman who planned many weddings only to elope herself and the mother of a nine-year-old who lives to dance, this book was the best. (not to mention that it was full of lawyers and I'd just polished off Grisham's KING OF TORTS).I love all Ray's husbands too. Probably because they're so much like my own--hard-working, hard-loving everyday guys with kids and bills and regrets who still know how to make you laugh. Sure there were a few dips here in there in this story, but I loved every moment of the ride. It's what I love about her books, I know exactly what I'm getting, but I'm never quite sure how I'll get there.And the characters... George was a dream. What better son, brother, fiance' could you have? And Kay, well, let's just say I couldn't be a bit mad at her. Been there, done that. Picked the right guy. Taffy probably made the longest trip of anybody in the book, much like Ruth's mother in EAT CAKE, but in a different way. I would have liked more flesh on Woodrow. (He was at the table but didn't seem a full partaker? I felt he had more to give) All in all though, it was great, refreshing and I hope she never quits. If she does, I'll keep writing drivel. She's one of the few people who make me consider quitting all together."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"Parents of toddlers think they have the toughest job. It's a busy time but it is possible to feel like you are in charge. Jeanne Ray's book illustrates that parents of adult children have it just as tough, big problems but no control over how the problems are solved.The characters in this book, especially Woodrow, are warm, wise and loving. They felt very real to me. I enjoyed reading the dialogue as the family ties grew and bent to adapt to changing situations. The scene of the dancing sisters will stick in my mind for a long time."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I love this book as well as all her other ones. The characters in this book are so familiar that I feel I have met them before. Caroline is such a strong woman who loves her husband and her life and when challenges come through her sister and children she loves them all through it. Ray has such a talent for writing about everyday life and the ups and downs that go with it in such an entertaining and realistic way. And in the end you always feel uplifted."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"The hardcover of \\"Step Ball Change\\" aged on my nightstand for several years before I finally got to spend time with Jeanne Ray's very interesting characters. The premise of two competitive sisters who love to dance and come together in a period of great personal change with divorce and children's marriages keeps you turning the pages. Caroline, through whose eyes we experience the story, has an edge, a no-nonsense woman who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina. When picture-perfect sister Taffy comes after a breakup with husband Neddy, the action kicks into full gear. Taffy's dog Stamp is wonderfully portrayed, the kind of dog whose yap is as big as his bite. The animal personality is delightfully portrayed, jumping high off the floor for liverwurst. Daughter Kay is torn between marrying the wealthy Trey or the romantically inept D.A. Jack. This is compounded by son George who is an excellent dancer & falls in love with the carpenter's daughter Erica. Two interracial couples find each other with a minimum of fuss. Caroline's husband Tom & Taffy's daughter Holden are excellent supporting characters. Ray uses the analogy of a house whose foundation is buckling to reflect the state of the family. By the end, couples find each other, the house is repaired & expanded, smiles are passed around as the sisters tap dance into the sunrise with \\"Putting on the Ritz.\\" This is a sweet domestic tale that kept my attention and leaves the reader with a smile on the face. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This is my favorite of Jeanne Ray's books. I'm a writer, too, and when I finished STEP-BALL-CHANGE I thought how much I wished I'd written it, and that's the highest compliment I can pay another author. Jeanne Ray is a terrific writer. Not only does she have a great sense of humor (and I laughed out loud many times while reading this) but she has something to say about life. I caught myself nodding my head in agreement more than once. I especially loved her observations about marriage. And I absolutely loved the way she depicted Caroline's relationship with her sister.Jeanne, if you read this review, don't pay any attention to the person who only gave STEP-BALL-CHANGE one star and said it was boring. She's wrong. This story is charming and warm and wonderful, and I hated for it to end. And you are a WONDERFUL writer. I only wish there were more than three Ray books to read."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I think everyone reading this book will wish they had a family like Carolina (Minnie) has -- even when her family is creating problems for her, the warmth and love in the household shines like light coming from a Kincaid cottage painting.For those prepared to dismiss the book as simply being about a series of love stories, I would say that while this is true, the same criticism could be made of Jane Austen. This is a book that women will particularly warm to, about the relationships and struggles that form our lives. The theme of this book is love -- mother/daughter relationships, husband/wife relationships, boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, sister/sister relationships, etc.Although Carolina/Minnie has a great marriage (after 40 years), her sister Taffy does not. When Taffy learns that her husband has been having an affair with a much younger woman and wants a divorce, Taffy calls her sister and is invited up for a visit. She arrives with a lot of luggage and no definite time period for the visit. The two sisters have never been close -- they're very different and rivalries have left a strained relationship between the two. But family is family, so Taffy is welcome, although the undisciplined fox terrior she brings with her is not so welcome, particularly after he starts biting people.At the same time, Carolina's daughter Kay becomes engaged to Trey, a wealthy man from a prominent family. His family expects a wedding well beyond the means of Carolina and her husband George. Where will such a large amount of money come from? Then there is Woodrow, the contractor who has been working on their house for quite a long time and shows no signs of ever finishing. What started out as an addition has turned into major repairs on the cracking foundation of the house. The workmen are often off working on some other job, and the work shows no sign of completion. The contractor Woodrow makes himself at home and seems to be a fixture at their kitchen table.This is a very funny book with some great lines. It's well written and the kind of book you can't wait to get back to. It is perhaps only a certain tidiness in the ending that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars -- everything falls perfectly in place, and although some readers may like this kind of ending, I don't think Jane Austen would have ended a novel quite so neatly."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This was an easy, likeable read about a perfectly normal family-something pretty rare in fiction these days. The action starts right away when the McSwain family is thrown into chaos by a simultaneous divorce and engagement. Caroline, \\"Minnie\\" McSwain, the matriarch of the family, finds out that her younger sister Taffy is coming to stay with her after leaving her husband, Neddy. The same night, her only daughter, Kay, tells her she is engaged to Trey, the wealthiest man in town. Of course, between the two events there are a myriad of little details that make things interesting-Kay loves another man, too, Taffy takes an interest in Caroline's dance studio and falls for the family handyman, Caroline's youngest son finds love with the handyman's daughter and so on. There's certainly enough going on here to keep you interested without tragedy or trauma. It's a pleasant little novel that's as light as a tap dance-a nice break from heavier fiction."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and have never been more pleased. I read it straight through laughing the whole time. A lighthearted, sincere read."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"When an author's first novel is as wonderful as &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot;, the expectations bar is set quite high for any subsequent work. Once again Jeanne Ray has written a fine book and, while perhaps not quite as insightful and wise as her first novel, &quot;Step-Ball-Change&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience.Ray's style is understated, deadpan humor and she employs considerable irony. Clearly speaking from experience she effectively depicts how a lifetime of experience provides a broader perspective and, often, results in less impetuous -- more rationale decisions.The author evocatively (but not saccarinely) depicts the fundamental fulfillment that a family -- spouse, children, siblings -- represent, and how regardless of life's challenges they are ultimately the harbor to which we seek to return.In comparison to &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot;, if &quot;Step-Ball-Change&quot; has flaws, however, they are in that it tends to be a bit too idealistic, and the lives of it's characters are a bit too easy and smooth -- relatively free from economic concerns they can fully endulge focusing on their emotional side. Additionally, the ending was devoid of any complexity in that the angst of the many characters depicted I felt was resolved too neatly, completely and happily ever after.I felt warmed after reading this novel. While I didn't think conveyed as effective or &quot;profound&quot; a message as &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot;, it was still a wise and a definitely entertaining diversion."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"A wonderful easy fun book to read!

The first is from daughter, Kay, delightedly announcing that the wealthiest, most desirable man in Raleigh, North Carolina, has just proposed. The second is from daughter, Taffy, sobbing that her husband is going to leave her for a woman younger than their daughter.Well, when Caroline's life starts to crumble everything does, including the foundation of her house.

Next, Caroline and Tom discover that they're going to pay for Kay's society wedding.It doesn't rain but it pours, and &quot;Step, Ball, Change&quot; pours lots of humor into a rapidly paced plot that will keep listeners entertained.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"I could not wait to buy Jeanne Ray's new book. I found &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot; so delightful and hoped she would follow it with another winner. I was not disappointed.In &quot;Step Ball Change&quot;, Ray portrays a family that seems to be constantly in the throes of change. Caroline and John, long- married, seem to always be facing complicated situations that keep them from the comfortable and event-free life they had envisioned in their later years.Their Raleigh home, despite its collapsing foundation and a contractor who seems to have taken up residence, is a haven for their children and others.The book opens with the latest twin complications. Their daughter has become engaged to the most prominent/richest bachelor in town (although she maybe involved with someone else) and is planning a wedding for 1,000. In addition, Caroline's sister Taffy calls to announce that she is on her way to them, having run away from her philandering husband, the richest man in Atlanta.Ray writes in a way that makes the reader feel that s/he KNOWS these people and is glad to have their acquaintance - and misses them when the book is closed. They are wonderful folks without being sappy and I enjoyed every minute I spent with them."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"This book reads like a chick flick, and that is not a bad thing. The characters were different enough to be exciting, and the story was dramatic only in that which happy ending would happen was slightly unpredictable. No worries about people dying or lives falling apart here! This was a great, quick, light read - perfect for entertainment."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"Caroline gets two phone calls within moments of each other. The first one is from her daughter with the joyful news that she is getting married. The second call is Caroline's sister, Taffy saying she's coming to stay, because her husband is having an affair. Caroline and Taffy are far from close, and as the tale unfolds, we see them learn things they never knew about each other.Ray introduces us to some intersting characters, from Taffy's saucy dog, to the construction worker Woodrow who is trying to save Caroline's house from falling down.This is a very light read, with a comic flair. Well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"Jeanne Ray has presented us with a humorus but thought provokingfamily saga in her novel &quot;Step Ball Change.&quot; I especially enjoyed the developing relationship between the dancing sisters.This is a book to warm your heart and paste a smile on your face.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"Step-Ball-Change","review":"\\"Step Ball Change,\\" the new novel by Jeanne Ray, is a lighthearted look at family relationships, including those between parents and children, siblings, and most of all, husbands and wives. Without preaching, Ray manages with gentle humor to say quite a bit about what makes a relationship work and how difficult it is to keep a relationship viable.Caroline and Tom McSwain have been married for forty-two years, and they are still very much in love. They have four grown children, one of whom has just become engaged to a very wealthy man. Kay, the newly engaged daughter, is so caught up in the excitement of her engagement that she has forgotten to mention one small detail to her mother. Kay may still be in love with a lawyer named Jack, with whom she has had a passionate love affair. Into the mix comes Taffy, Caroline's younger sister, who has been dumped by her husband, Neddy. Taffy is a beautiful but egocentric woman, who has never been particularly close to Caroline. However, during this time of crisis, she turns to Caroline for comfort and emotional support. Taffy manages to throw the McSwain household into an uproar with her theatrical manner and her excitable dog, Stamp. Stamp loves to bark loudly and bite painfully, not necessarily in that order.Jeanne Ray's characters are lively and amusing. I enjoyed Woodrow, the contractor who is helping to rebuild part of the McSwain's crumbling house. During his long association with Caroline and Tom, Woodrow has practically become a member of the family. Not only does Woodrow train the dog, Stamp, to curb his violent impulses, but he also dispenses wise advice and helps Taffy come out of her funk. The title \\"Step Ball Change\\" comes from the world of tap dance. Both Caroline and Taffy know how to dance well, and Caroline teaches tap in her own studio. She considers tap-dancing therapeutic and a great way to express one?s feelings. Ray implies that if people lived their lives with the same self-discipline yet freedom of expression that tap dancing generates, their lives would be much more fulfilled. When the author writes about dancing, her prose sings.Like Elinor Lipman, who also writes light romantic comedies, Jeanne Ray whimsically mixes and matches characters romantically, until all of the many complications finally sort themselves out. Ray accomplishes this with grace, style and much merriment. For a wonderfully entertaining and diverting novel, read \\"Step Ball Change.\\""},{"Title":"Race and Labor Matters in the New U.S. Economy","review":"The most sweeping analysis of the period that articulates the major debates facing race and class today."},{"Title":"Race and Labor Matters in the New U.S. Economy","review":"I find myself the subject of a portion of this book. Some statements are opinions, but some of the statements are actually errors. I would like to respond.1. When I bought the property in October 2001 I continued (but did not initiate) the opt out of the single contract with HUD. The previous owners had begun the process, but had not informed the tenants. I met with the tenants immediately and explained the opt out process, and their rights to have Enhanced Vouchers, giving them special rights to STAY at the property.2. One basic and essential right of Enhanced Vouchers is that the tenant will NEVER pay more than 30% of their income, no matter what the contract rent. The contract rent had no bearing on what my tenants would pay.3. Anyone who was evicted for non-payment was opting not to pay the normal family portion of 30% of income. Less than 5 tenants were evicted. Some tenants left to take advantage of the Enhanced Voucher to relocate outside of central New Haven, to be in a less urban environment, or to be closer to their now grown-up children.4. Since 2001 I have continued to operate the building adhering to my goal of having a mixture of different kinds of tenants, from many different races and nationalities, and I have kept my promise to retain the original tenants, many of whom are \\"overhoused,\\" that is, living in a multi-bedroom unit as a single person (their family having grown up and moved away). Since HUD offers a subsidy for ONLY ONE YEAR after it is aware of overhousing, I took on subsidizing the difference for these tenants by accepting a ONE bedroom contract rent for the TWO and THREE bedroom apartments the tenants were inhabiting. Ovella Watts is still a tenant in the same apartment she has occupied all these years, even though she technically would have had to move if I had not stepped in and accepted the lower rent.5. Although it is difficult to make improvements to occupied apartments, I have offered to each of my long-term tenants to choose an improvement they want (which is in addition to appropriate maintenance). One section 8 tenant recently asked for a hardwood floor to be installed in her living room, which we did.6. I have an excellent relationship with all my tenants at 65 Dwight Street, especially my section 8 tenants whom I have now known for over 6 years.7. I WAS NEVER CONTACTED BY THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK, even though my office is two blocks from the property, and I would certainly have been willing to give them detailed information on any question they might have asked."},{"Title":"The art of lawn tennis,","review":"Nice book classic principles still true today amazing insight and detail in the intangible aspects of tennis never knew about him"},{"Title":"The art of lawn tennis,","review":"Why would the USTA want to bury this man and his writings to the Isle of Forgotten?

Because all the letters derived from images at some period in time.Now let me tell you that I'm not being cynical. I learned Hebrew under two of the top Hebrew scholars of my life time and i have an Mdiv from a respectable Seminary. the teachings in this book are not useful one bit for understanding how to translate or read Hebrew.It is more along the lines of Kabalah mysticism. Its used by many to do the Bible code work which is I'm itself a horrible practice. The same can be done with Moby Dick and the test of the classics. It had nothing to do with hidden messages in the OT.I'm addition, this type of Hebrew learning is being popularized by guys like Joseph prince and is being used to make people thing the OT is full of sacred messages that are hidden.It totally doesn't take into account that ancient Hebrew scribes did not always use modern Hebrew. Some OT books were written originally in proto-semetic Hebrew which is a different alphabet. The modern Hebrew alphabet didn't get adopted until many years after Israel lived in the promised land. The letters they used were adopted from Aramaic.I'm sad to have to write this review because the language is rich with meaning but i don't think this book is going to open the door to learning Hebrew or how to interpret the old testament texts.I suggest buying a book that teaches the language, not mysticism."},{"Title":"The wisdom in the Hebrew alphabet: The sacred letters as a guide to Jewish deed and thought (ArtScroll mesorah series)","review":"this was just as promised, it arrived even before I thought it would and was in excellent condition.thank u"},{"Title":"The wisdom in the Hebrew alphabet: The sacred letters as a guide to Jewish deed and thought (ArtScroll mesorah series)","review":"This is not an easy read because it is a so wonderfully written.

Unlike Christianity, where the Greek texts of the New Testament are not subject to scrutiny, the Hebrew texts of the bible, on the level of language and even of alphabet, have been seen as a mine to excavate some of the deeper meanings and secrets of the Torah.The Wisdom of the Hebrew Alphabet, by Rabbi Michael L. Munk, gives English reading audiences a chance to get the flavor of the language based mystical theology of the Torah through an examination of each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Munk delves into gematria, the mystical names of God, the hidden and revealed Torah, the meat and bones of Judaism's esoteric and arcane lore. He explains this concepts in a way that most can understand, taking apart the Hebrew and rendering it into clear English.Unless you read Hebrew, and have knowledge of the games the rabbis would play with the language, this is the book that will get you closest to the text centered orientation of mystical Judaism."},{"Title":"The wisdom in the Hebrew alphabet: The sacred letters as a guide to Jewish deed and thought (ArtScroll mesorah series)","review":"This critique is for Christian students who might purchase this book looking for deeper insights into God's Word.Appears I'm \\"odd man out\\" in the # of stars I've given, but often-times I get a lot of insight from so-called \\"negative\\" reviews.It's not that this work doesn't have lots of information in it, it certainly does. But for 22 years I was \\"into\\" all things esoteric and for the past 20, a Christian. So I have some track on discerning the distinction between the two. The first I will call philosophical/spiritual and the latter, Spirit.The author, a Rabbi, not a Messianic believer, is most apparently a devout Jew and diligent in his studies. Such OT-orientated teachers can teach the NT-believer immensely. However, to my perception, Rabbi Munk credits creative power in the symbols {words and letters} themselves rather than in the Spirit. This is a Kabbalah-take on the utterances of God whereby instilled within the creation of things which God--by His words--spoke into existence, resides the power that the Spirit uttered.For example, on page 19 he writes, \\"The 22 sacred letters {of the Hebrew alphabet} are profound, primal spiritual forces....the raw materials of Creation. When God combined them into words, phrases, commands they brought about Creation, translating His will into reality, as it were. There is a Divine science in the Hebrew alphabet...the sacred letters were used as the agency of creation. The letters can be ordered in countless combinations, by changing their order within words and interchanging letters in line with the rules of various Kabbalistic letter-systems. Each arrangement of the same letters results in a new blend of the cosmic spiritual forces represented by the letters.\\"In John 6:63 Jesus said, \\"It is the spirit that quickeneth...the words THAT I SPEAK {my emphasis} unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\\" And the scripture, \\"If you have not the Spirit of God, ye are none of his.\\"A Christian's only authority is in Christ, in his Spirit. When we pray, we pray to the Father in the regenerated spirit. In ourselves i.e. without God's Spirit in us, dwelleth no good thing.Learn from this book what is there to learn, but do not wander off \\"worshipping and serving the creature i.e. creation, more than the Creator, who is blessed forever.

In desperation, he asked one of his disciples to recite the Hebrew alphabet. He did -- and the Rebbe's memory came back to him. After reading this excellent book, you will understand how that is possible. The Hebrew alphabet is much more than 22 letters written on paper. Each letter has a numerical value, a number of symbolic Torah meanngs, and a mystical connection to the Creation of the Universe. According to kabbalah, the Hebrew letters are the primal \\"energies\\" with which God spoke the Creation into existence. The inner essence of a thing are the letters which compose its name in Hebrew. (The Overview in the book is entitled \\"Protoplasm of Creation,\\" and explains this concept in more detail than I can do here.)Unlike so many of those pseudo-kabbalah books on the market, which attempt to use the Hebrew alphabet and its numerology for fortune-telling, this book is solidly grounded in authentic Torah sources. Like all of Artscroll's publications, the approach is Orthodox, but also accessible to both Jews and non-Jews of all backgrounds. This is not an easy-read \\"spirituality\\" book, however. It is a detailed set of Torah lessons, to be savored slowly, one letter-chapter at a time. The author also assumes that you are either familiar with basic Hebrew terms, or at least willing to take the time to learn them.

I could not have known how right my hunch was.After beginning to read the book, I decided I had to buy it for my Father; then, a separate one for my Mother (she kept stealing his); my brother; and at my dad's request a spare one that he could have to give away.The author has a wonderful way of presenting a historical perspective on the structure and sounds of the Hebrew letters; while also presenting the religious and cultural considerations.Being a Christian, I have found it especially wonderful. I didn't realize that many of the concepts related by Jesus and the other writers in the New Testament were dealt with at length by the Scribes and Rabbis in sacred writings other than the Torah, Books of Wisdom and the Prophets. This book uses references to those writings (as well as those included in our Old Testament) to explain the importance and nuances of meaning of the letters. This adds so much meaning for me to some of the things Jesus said and did: I'm truly amazed at how many of the things that seemed a little odd, actually have a reason behind them.This book cannot just simply be read in a sitting. I find myself going over and over the chapters; gleaning something new each time. Actually, I have yet to get through even a chapter in one sitting. And, has it helped my grasp of the Hebrew language? It really has! To know that each letter is made up of parts, and to have word pictures to remember the letters by...makes it so much easier to remember the shapes and sounds.I do wish the author had put the Transliteration along with the actual translation when he uses the Hebrew phrases. I love the phrases; and, their meaning. But, I'm not skilled enough with the Hebrew to be able to sound them all out, and I would like to \\"hear\\" the Hebrew as well as read the translation of it. Perhaps, that makes an online version with audio a valid option in the future.My Father also expressed this as something he wishes it contained. That is the reason I gave it a 4. In concept, content and presentation, The Wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet is certainly excellent. This is it's only flaw, I think, if you can call it a flaw."},{"Title":"The wisdom in the Hebrew alphabet: The sacred letters as a guide to Jewish deed and thought (ArtScroll mesorah series)","review":"one enters the realm of alef-bet wondering what could it have to do with me and leaves pondering how did one ever exist without comprehending the applicability of the knowledge that emanates from this tome? \`Wisdom' transports the reader not only back in history, but also through a panorama of the very essence of how words were birthed within the culture of HaShem's people and yes, their history too.

I am totally adddicted to her now and am devouring everything she has ever written. Her stories are magic, haunting and mesmerizing. Blackbird House, like the rest of Hoffman's books, deserves to be read slowly so take your time..."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Blackbird House is one of Alice Hoffman's best. Her characters are as real as if they in the same room with you. Hoffman uses images, smells and tastes that allow you to feel as though you are participating in the story! I never thought she would top Turtle Moon, but I give Blackbird House five stars!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"When I received Blackbird House, I was a little bit disheartened when I saw the small size of the book. I love a big, delicious book that will last me a few days. This is a smallish book, only 225 pages of actual story, so I set out to savor it rather than inhale it. Reading it over the course of 2 weeks, I discovered beautiful gems buried in the stories of Blackbird house. The story is a history of the house, comprised of several stories of the people who lived in it over the course of several decades, many of them just like people that we all know. Hoffman's prose took me out to sea, to the marsh, out into the field of sweet peas, sitting with the sheep, and watching for white blackbirds. Although the stories are quite short, the characters were developed enough for me to get a feel for how they felt as they lived in the house. I got the feeling that the house was an historical treaure, just waiting for one more family to discover. This is definitely a book for savoring. If I'd rushed through it, I might have missed the poignancy of the stories and I could have overlooked the humor that I found buried just below the surface.If I had a criticism, it would be that the book is too short. I want more!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This is one of Ms. Hoffman's best books, a set of interconnected stories about Cape Cod, love, loss, redemption. The prose is beautiful. I re-read this book every summer, to remind myself of the Cape Cod girl I am in my heart, no matter how long I've lived here on a different ocean."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This was such a clever format for a story! The book began in the 1700's and each chapter was about a family or person who lived there in each following generation. The focus was on a life altering moment in their life. Some characters reappeared in the next chapter as an older version of how they appeared in the preceeding chapter. A very interesting perspective on how lifestyles evolved in the coastal community of Cape Cod over the centuries! Excellent!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This is my favorite Alice Hoffman novel. When ever I think upon it I am haunted by her magical realism and that house on the Cape. I loved how she spanned all of American History by using a house to build a story around. This novel has so much depth and offers so much pleasure with its finely drafted prose. This is the ideal novel for any avid reader."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I loved this book! It was subtle and quiet, and I felt like I needed a cup of hot cocoa and a burning fire place! I loved the way, one didn't feel to intimate and slightly detached, but nevertheless, enthralled by the stories that I never wanted to end!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"A schooner and its passengers encounter a horrible storm in the first story of this collection by Alice Hoffman, author of the Oprah Book Club selection, Here on Earth, as well as almost two dozen other novels. It's hard to find fault with Hoffman's Blackbird House, either in its writing (good) or its plot (great). The well-thought out connections between successive stories create an ordered web about life in and around rural Massachusettes. My favorite, The Conjurer's Handbook, is about a man who falls in love with a Jewish interpreter and guide named Dorey while touring a camp in Germany. The interactions between strong, capable, Dorey and her love's stubbornly independent grandmother, during a visit of less than a day, are marvelous. Those few pages, along with the recurring links between characters and stories, make this a wonderful choice both for those who love short stories and for anyone who hasn't yet given short stories a try. Those who enjoy these short stories, will probably also like those of authors Alice Munro and Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This novel is compelling and very gripping and you really get to feel like you are actually part of the story and know the characters.I really did not want this to end and have thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend this to anyone who is a book worm!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Alice Hoffman is my favorite author and this collection of stories, that all link together, is my favorite work of hers. I received it quickly and it was in excellent condition. I have read this before but did not own a copy, so I ordered it because I wanted re-read it. I have now decided to give this copy to my mother to enjoy and I am going to buck up and get myself the hardcover so that I can read it again and again, for many years to come! This is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"These intertwined storied beg rereading. There's an elusive depth to many of them, and the aforementioned literary imaging is presented masterfully. This collection is written in differing prose; the earlier years of the house being presented in the formal, careful style of the past and the stories of the more contemporary age reflecting the language of that particular historical time. You'll be introduced to some truly arresting characters, many which will stick with you long after you finish the book. There's much creativity and magic to Hoffman's writing, and she readily suspends disbelief. The perfect book for an enjoyable, rewarding weekend's read."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I usually am a huge fan of Alice Hoffman. Her writing is beautiful and I love the way she makes the most seemingly mundane things magical. However, this book left me very disappointed. The disjointed story lines left all but a few characters destinies uncertain. Why invest yourself in a story if you don't find out what happens? The fact that all these characters lived in or near blackbird house seems like a charming idea, but the followthrough isn't very satisfying. I wish she had instead chosen a few characters at a specific time and delved deeply into their lives. If you are unfamiliar with Alice Hoffman's work don't start off with this mediocre work, try Here On Earth or Practical Magic."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I was in the mood for a short story collection for a change, so I picked this one up. These tales are all set in the same place, a farm in Cape Cod. I especially liked &quot;the Witch of Truro&quot; and the stories centered around Violet. These stories are often strange and depressing, yet the writing style has some original and beautiful devices. And there is an underlying quality in some of the stories that moved my heart's sympathy.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"A modest house on Cape Cod is a backdrop and continuing character to history. The cottage was originally built by a fisherman who wanted to give up the dangerous profession because of the perils of making a living at sea. And the trade became all the more dangerous when the British blockaded access to the sea. Blackbird house became the symbol of freedom from a seagoing livelihood that had no guarantee of a homecoming.The reader then becomes an audience to the various people who inhabited the house from Revolutionary times to the present. The house goes from pristine to rundown over time and mirrors the ups and downs of the house's various inhabitants. There are other threads that lend continuity to the novel and that is the white blackbird which was originally lost at sea with the cottage's builder, a field of flowers that resurrects each spring, and a pond that becomes a convenient disposal site for a violent, abusing husband.While it is a clever concept and unrelated lives are woven together over time because the house is both a backdrop and a central character, the book is a pleasant read at best."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I have been a fan of Alice Hoffman for years- Blackbird House is my new Favorite Book!The House is more than the setting, it becomes a character, itself."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I have never read one of her books before. After reading this one I'm gonna read some of her others. I loved the book, the only thing I would have maybe done different would have been the ending. I really enjoyed her writing style and her creativity."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I was very excited about this. I've loved the author's books for years, but this is hands-down the worst of them I've read. It is without any direction or intrigue- obvious and unimaginative, and badly put together. I was dissapointed with Alice Hoffman. I could barely believe she worte it after The River King, The Probable Future, and Second Nature, a few of my favorites. Please get them instead, you'll be very happy. I really don't know why this book got so many stars from so many readers. I guess stories are easier to read, but they are really not worth it even so. Besides J.K. Rowling, it's hard to think of an author who writes books easier to get through."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"A number of the stories have characters who find love to such a profound compelling way (and far from anything they themselves would ever expect) that they are completely bereft when faced with loss. The grieving person becomes an inconsolable mystery, it seems, to everyone around them. They are single-minded and persistent in acting out their grief in such baffling ways. All the characters interact with the natural phenomena of the Massachusettes shoreland in all its beautiful and painful manifestations, some of which are almost too disturbing to witness, such as the beaching of the blackfish. The lives of the people and the local wildlife and landscape seem mirror one another in wondfully portrayed details that transported me to the scenes completely."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I am more of a movie buff, but have recently been spending alot more time reading. I couldn't have found a better book to keep me wanting more.My favorite concept of The Blackbird House was all the short stories and how each one of them intersected. My only regret was not reading it with a book club. I passed it along to my sister and she can't read it fast enough for me. It was just long enough that I may have to read it again to find details that I missed. This was my first book of Alice Hoffman's and I will surely be reading more."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"In a rare and beautiful departure, Hoffman follows her celebrated novel, Probable Future, with 12 lush and evocative stories that trace the lives of various inhabitants of a small Cape Cod farmhouse over the course of generations.Built during Revolutionary times by a man who tragically dies on his final fishing trip during a British emabargo, Blackbird House is as magical and extraordinary as the characters we meet.Lysander Wynn, who lost his leg to a giant halibut, finds courage and love with a witch in red boots. Violet Cross, a brilliant girl who loves books and the Harvard scholar who betrayed her, finds love with a local boy. Fourteen-year-old Jamie Farrell becomes a different person when he delivers hot tomato soup to his neighbor on a wintry day. Maya Cooper, the angry daughter of hippies, doesn't understand the love between her parents until it's almost too late.From colonial times to modern day, Hoffman describes the lives and loves of the farm's inhabitants in lyrical yet melancholic prose that pulls us deep into their history, into the very rooms that shelter secrets and inspire beauty. There are lessons of the heart to be learned inside Blackbird House."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"From Revolutionary times to the present-day, the lives of inhabitants of a Massachusetts house are examined with compelling awareness. Alice Hoffman weaves tales of acute happiness and profound sorrow, each rewarding in its own right. Together, they combine for a loosely-constructed novel of the changing events in the life of a house. Vivid images of blackbirds, pear trees, sweet peas, the color red and more unite these stories with an undeniable charm.\\"The Edge of the World\\", a tale of seaman John Hadley who originally built the house in the 1700's as a gift for his wife Coral. The sailor and his two sons are lost at sea and the grieving widow and mother slogs on with only her field of sweet peas and the ghost of her son's pet blackbird to sustain her.\\"The Witch of Truro,\\" a lyrical story of red boots, pear trees, and a love story that is one-of a kind. After a horrifying event, Ruth Declan becomes a charity case for neighbors who sell her into servitude to a blacksmith named Lysander.\\"The Token,\\" features Garnet, one of the book's most endearing characters. Her love for her sister Ruby and even for her seemingly uncaring mother, Ruth of the previous story, is heartwarming and uplifting.\\"Insulting the Angels\\" introduces Larkin, another lovable character who finds fatherhood in a most unusual way.\\"Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair\\" acquaints the reader with Violet, a physically scarred young woman who falls in love with a professor. She carries his child while he falls in love with her sister.\\"Lionheart\\" picks up with Violet, now a mother of seven, living in Blackbird House and doting on her firstborn son, Lion. His life is charmed and, as the author tells us, he was not like anyone else and he never would be.\\"The Conjurer's Handbook\\" is the story of Lion, Jr. who is raised at Blackbird House by his grandmother and takes a Jewish wife while abroad. Can the granddaughter-in-law ever win the love of Violet and will Violet ever accept her? This reads like a fairy tale, a wonderful, magical happy-ever-after story to cherish.\\"The Wedding of Snow and Ice\\" is set in 1957 and televisions and canned soup have appeared as staples at Blackbird House. Grace Farrell is caught in the crossfire of impending women's liberation but it is her son Jamie whose visit to the next door neighbor's to shovel the sidewalk and deliver homemade soup that is the focal point of this haunting tale.\\"India\\" is set in the 1960's and 1970's when a young hippie couple purchase the house and raise their two children, Kalkin and Maya. The very back-to-nature parents have given birth to children who have no interest in their mother-earth upbringing but prefer to woof down hamburgers and watch \\"Dallas\\" on tv. How one escapes and one comes to terms with her roots makes for a riveting read.\\"The Pear Tree\\" is the story of the Stanley family. Unlike the families before, they only use the home as a summer getaway. For that reason, they never fit in with the community and their son Dean is a loner whose tragic life plays out at Blackbird House.\\"The Summer Kitchen\\" is the story of the family of Katherine and Sam, a couple drowning in sorrow. Their lives are centered around Emma, a young daughter dying of leukemia. Their son Walker is jealous of the attention lavished on Emma and rebels in typical ten-year-old fashion.\\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the final story is perhaps the weakest. It picks up the tale of Emma more than twenty years later when she inherits Blackbird House from her parents. Emma has had an empty and unhappy life, but can she find happiness at last? Readers will also be treated to what Walker has accomplished with his life."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I was initially attracted to this book because of the author, and then I thought, what an intriguing title..then I saw the cover and said...hmmm...I've GOT to try this one. I was NOT disappointed!This series of stories about the different inhabitants of the same house on the Cape is fascinating. Her writing style is, as usual, lyrical! To see so many lives tied to the same plot of land...how their stories intertwined was fascinating. How many people have wondered about the families that lived in their house before them? I'm sure there are many, myself included. The concept of this book hooked me from the start and although these \\"snipets\\" of each person or family and time period could have been elaborated upon (and who knows, she may go back and write full stories about these intriguing people someday!)...their being short didn't stop you from being able to feel connected to them immediately. By the end of the book I felt a kinship with all of these characters, and with this delightful farm of light and memories, joy and sorrows.There is much of real life here...nothing candy coated. Life in its realities...pain and joy all rolled up into one. It is her ability to roll it all up in neat little package that keeps us coming back. Alice Hoffman is a writer that can dish us up a dose of reality and like little Oliver, we always ask for more!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I have to be honest, I read this book months ago but was unable at the time to find the words to describe this novel. I just have to start by saying that it is one of the best novels I have ever read in my life (and I clearly read a lot). Previous to reading Blackbird House, I had never picked up an Alice Hoffman novel. I knew that she had written Practical Magic and some other novels in the same vein and I thought that she wouldn't be my kind of author. However, when I cracked the spine on the Blackbird House, I wanted to slap my own wrist!It is very difficult to adequately explain this novel because it is very simple and yet some of the stories are quite complex. Basically, the novel is made up of short stories (those of you out there who don't like short stories, don't run away yet!) about a house on Cape Cod that was built in the 1700s. There are twelve stories in the \\"novel\\" and each describes a new generation of the house as it is bought, sold, and passed down through certain generations. The stories follow the characters but only as it relates to the house. The true development of the book is that of the house and the times that surround each generation of owners. Each owner brings a part of themselves the property which allows the house to grow with its inhabitants. There is no climax or enthralling events, the true satisfaction comes with the unveiling of each person and the mark they leave on the house.I simply adored this book. I thought that it was beautiful in every way. The characters were not always likable but they were real, which I believe is far more important. The atmosphere was almost tangible and I felt completely engrossed with each tale. There isn't a single \\"story\\" that I could pin point as my favorite because they were all splendidly written. This is a book that I will certainly go back to over and over again and urge others to do the same."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Who knows just how a history is held by a house? In a desolate end of the Cape, the story begins as Coral Hadley loses her husband and young son Issac at sea in a storm. Vincent survives and takes 20 years to get home. Issac's pet blackbird flies home somehow and is seen throughout as pure white.200 years of history and demons are kept in this house. Generations of Crosby, West, Griffon, McGuire stay. Others tarry awhile, but the history is not theirs to carry and they move on. Terrible beauty in this place, joy and terrible sadness. Birth, dead, suicide, mystery and magic, love and relationship. A fabulous piece of writing."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Alice Hoffman has yet to disappoint me in the three books I've read by her. This haunting book is a collection of short stories that build upon one another, but could easily be read and appreciated on their own. Hoffman is a master of magical realism, and these tales are filled with white blackbirds, cursed pear trees, the color red, hardy sweet peas, and sadness. And yet, this is not a bleak collection. She somehow imbues every story with a glimmer of hope. Maybe it's the hope that fuels love, and love is central to each of these beautiful, moving stories. Highly recommended. Also, a fast read!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Ms. Hoffman is one of the four or five best writers in this country today. Blackbird House is a wonderful tour through history as experienced by families who all live in a Cape Cod house from the American Revolution forward.As there is in the world, there is a bit of magic in this book. There is also love, grief, and family struggle. It's interesting how something planted generations ago remains to please or bother succeeding occupants, a metaphor for neighborly rumor or belief that transcend time and people's lives.I highly recommend this book. It's short, but full of finely crafted sentences, and finely wrought ideas."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Simply put, this is a beautiful book. It's dazzling with its prisms of colors and kaleidoscopes of dreams and all of the stories of the inhabitants of a single house over time which sits on the top of a hill almost at the edge of the world.Blackbird House is near the ocean in Cape Cod and its got a huge history. From the original owners to present day, each family who has lived there has a story and Alice Hoffman spins her web of enchantment in each tale. Stories run from incredibly sad to inspiringly hopeful. Children, adults and old people inhabit the house and all have seen the strange white, blackbird and its descendants through the years. It all started when John Hadley had a dream of a beautiful home for his wife, Coral. But when the sea called, he took his two sons to it, though Coral had her doubts about the voyage and begged for her youngest to be left behind, but he wasn't. Coral never gave up hope that they lived through the May gale. She labored on her farm alone and planted Sweet Pea that would last for ages, but her hopes and dreams were dashed.There is an old pond on the property where an elderly woman, who refuses to have the house updated, retrieves ice from the frozen pond. Boys fish it and once it was rumored that a sea serpent had crawled from the ocean and made the pond its home. And all throughout time, the blackbird can be seen hovering somewhere. The bird is a descendant of the original owner's pet. A bird that left black, but came home white, a sign to Coral that something terrible had happened. This sets the stage for all of the inhabitants of Blackbird House, a house that is filled with so much hope each time someone moves in and then life takes over.The stories about Blackbird House are also stories of the times people lived through. Each generation has their own battles and triumphs and there are characters that come to life within the pages of this book. Bewitching and inspiring, this book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"When I received this book the first thing I noticed was that the dust cover had been glued to the book. While this was odd it wasn't until I started reading the book that I realized that it was not a new book (which I thought I was buying) but a used book. At the end of the first chapter the page was dog-eared--as if someone had turned it as a bookmark. So I rifled through the book and came upon more turned pages--but the coup-de-gras was on page 52--what appears to be spaghetti sauce smeared on the page! Although over all the book is in excellent shape--it is not a new book--it is pre-read and should have been sold as such."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Each story was unique, but they all connected. Using a place as the central theme, with the story crossing over many years, was intriguing. I was sorry when I reached the end, wishing it could go on. I love how the author conveys the characters, I could get a very good feel for who I felt they were. I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This is a great read. The subtle intertwining of the stories adds to the appeal. This is a book I reread often."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"A lovely chronical of a home built with love in the 1700s and the people over the next 2 centuries who inhabited it. Ms Hoffman wove bits and pieces of each story into the other. The color red plays an important part: red boots, red pears, sweet peas, turnips, but most of all, love and death. What else would one expect of Alice Hoffman?"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"An absolute favorite of mine. I thought 'how strange' when I first started it but it has become one of my very favorites of hers and I am SUCH an Alice Hoffman fan. Anything I read of hers becomes my 'bible' while I am reading it.This is a book of short stories. Each story is about someone who lived in the \\"Blackbird House\\" in a different time and era.It is an absolute wonderful book!~!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This is one of the best books ever written by AH! Honestly; the theme, the story is woven beautifully throughout the many generation in this book. The evening is never wasted by reading this book."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I have a back and forth relationship with Alice Hoffman. Sometimes I'm in love with something she's written. Sometimes I'm unsure and indecisive. She rarely works in the short story form, but this is a collection of linked short stories that makes me wish she wrote in the short form more often. This is a series of tales that move through time from the origins of Blackbird House to its present, relating the stories of all those who have inhabited it, loved in it, lost someone they loved in it, haunted it, etc. It's quite magical in an extremely believable way, without any moments of, \\"Come on, really?\\" that sometimes occur when I read her books. This one just works."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Another great novel by Alice Hoffman! In this one she offers up 12 interconnected stories which take place in a Cape Cod farmhouse over many decades.

I really had no idea what this book was about. After reading it I have some mixed thoughts on it. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. It didn't grab me, I found I had to push myself to read it and finish it.The book is a collection of short stories based on people who lived in a farmhouse in Cape Cod called Blackbird House. The stories vary from different times and events. From a mother whose sons and husband are lost at sea, to a woman who loses the man she loves to her more beautiful sister, to a pair of brothers whose only wish is to leave the small town and move on to better things. The stories are all intertwined in some way. The writing was wonderful as usual Alice Hoffman style."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I quite enjoyed this book by Alice Hoffman. Blackbird House follows families through decades that reside in a particular house in Cape Cod Massachusetts. Being a fishing community we get a glimpse into the lives of the men and women who battled with life married to the sea.We find love and loss, success and failure all surrounding the lives of those that live in this house.

Blackbird House is definitely one of the best books I've read all year. While its an easy read, it didn't bore me one bit. I couldnt put it down!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Beautifully written stories that work as a novel about generations of people living in the same house. Lovely motifs weave their way through the years. Great read."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Every tale in this wonderful collection of short stories by author Alice Hoffman have one thing in common: they all take place in the fictitious Blackbird House on Cape Cod. Set in the historically rich fabric of New England, each story revolves around something magical and yet heart-wrenchingly real. The stories span from the Revolutionary War to modern day, and explore the timeless themes of love, betrayal, devastation, exhilaration, death and life.Hoffman writes about young lovers, witches, women with heartache, men who navigate the sea, and children who misbehave. She explores every facet of human emotion, both tender and harsh. Many of her stories are symbolically portrayed, while others are so beautifully written and insightful that they read like poetry. If you have never explored the world through Alice Hoffman's writing, BLACKBIRD HOUSE is an excellent place to start. It gives the reader a wonderful example of just how prolific and talented a writer Alice Hoffman is and how powerfully her writing resonates with her readers. BLACKBIRD HOUSE is a stunning achievement and an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Once again, Alice Hoffman writes an amazing novel (I hesitate to call it a novel much like other reviewers since it is a collection of stories, but it is seamless nonetheless). I enjoy her use of color throughout these stories - this seems to be a reoccurring style with Hoffman - it truly adds to the brilliance of each individual tale. Highly recommend - a relatively quick read for those on the go - best part is how rewarding it is!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This book really deserves five stars but I'm giving it four only because it feels more like a story collection than a novel. Is it a novel? The publisher doesn't really say. As far as linked stories go, this is one of the better concepts I've read in a while. All the stories are connected by the life of a house which is, truth be told, the central character. But I've enjoyed so much getting lost in the fluid and transporting prose of Alice Hoffman's novels that I felt at times interrupted in this case. Still, I did enjoy the various pieces very much. My favorite chapter is \\"India.\\" The sixties era comes alive in this section, where the Cape Cod house might as well be a microcosm of an era. While she seems only to be writing about a house and the simple lives within it, Hoffman in very few pages speaks for whole generations."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Hoffman has written a number of fine novels but not so much recently. Her penultimate novel, The Probable Future, was better than anything she's published in years; and it gave hope. Blackbird House is so fine. I read it in a single sitting, stuck to the chair, didn't move until I'd finished the book.I never know what to say about Hoffman because there's so much around her writing that I tend to sniff at, to abjure. But, as with others of her best books, she drew me in with this one and I cannot do more than writhe with a certain contenment, with satisfaction, with a sense of history embedded deeply by Hoffman. I think she does that, like a tick sort of, with most of her readers."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I have read several other works of fiction by Ms. Hoffman and enjoyed them. However, I was disappointed in the \\"cobbled together\\" collection found under the title: BlACKBIRD HOUSE. Magical realism can be very enjoyable but it requires some actual \\"meat on the bones\\" to sustain it. Hoffman usually has a deft touch with this suspension of reality but these tales seemed to be little more than fragmented ideas for longer, more fully-realized stories that she just couldn't flesh out. The house as central theme drew me in (as I am always most attracted to old houses with rich histories that can captivate the imagination).This so-called novel barely skimmed the surface and left me feeling cheated...I wanted something more substantive. Hungry for a loaf of bread I found only breadcrumbs, instead.Alice, I know you can do better.Ms. Denise in Virginia"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"On Cape Cod sits a white house surrounded by Massachusetts vegetation and farm land. It could be any New England home, but if you look closely this home is the setting for Alice Hoffman's newest book, Blackbird House.As a long time reader of Alice Hoffman's books, I looked forward to her latest title with much anticipation. And now that I've read this book, I found it to be another one of Alice Hoffman's best books.Blackbird House is a series of interconnected short stories. While they can surely be read one at a time, if they are read together loosely as a novel they will provide most readers with another of Ms. Hoffman's books steeped in wonderful characterizations and magic realism. Every sense is awakened as one digests her flowing words. We feel her characters joys and losses, revel in her descriptions of nature and animals and hope for a good outcome for her characters lives as they unfold before our eyes. With the house as a backdrop and one of her most endearing characters, Ms. Hoffman provides her readers with pages filled with unusual people, magical places and events which challenge the emotions of the human heart. So entranced was I by some of the passages and stories, I was forced to close the book for a few minutes and take deep breaths before I could go on to read more..As we read we come to learn of the history of Blackbird House from over 200 years ago. We first meet the builder of the house John Hadley, a fisherman during Revolutionary times who builds the house as a monument to the endearing love he has for his wife. When he goes off to sea with his two young sons, a blackbird, the youngest son's pet accompanies them and returns to the house now totally white after disaster strikes. This blackbird and its other white descendants seem to hover around the house at other times during the tales as if a witness to everything which happens both to the hoseu and the people who occupy it. In another story we meet Lysander who lost his leg to a giant halibut but finds love and courage with a woman thought to be the witch of Truro. In turn we read story after story of succeeding families who inhabit the house. Violet, who is betrayed by her lover, but then learns to love the local boy and gives birth to seven children eventually traveling to England to bring her orphaned grandson home. And then we meet this grandson all grown home who meets a German Jewish survivor in Germany during WWII and bring her home to meet Violet. How these two very different women come to terms with loving the same man provides readers with a wonderful story of love and jealousy. Finally we meet Emma, a 30 year old who rather lost after her divorce returns to her family's vacation home which she inherits from her parents. But of all of the stories I think it was the story India which rally captivated me the most as a young woman learns about the love her parents had for one another in a rather unusual household during the 60's.At one time almost every Hoffman book I read I considered a favorite. But recently, being a bit more critical, I came up with the following list which includes Fortune's Daughter, Practical Magic, Seventh Heaven, Green Angel and Turtle Moon. Now to this list I add Blackbird House which takes its rightful place along with the other titles mentioned. If you are reading this review I hope it will encourage you to read Blackbird House or at the very least some of the other titles I have loved. As I often say an even so so book by Alice Hoffman is better than most. And while Blackbird is at times sad and overwhelming there is also much joy and lessons to be learned from within the pages of this book."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Because I think I have.If you're looking for a book with a well-defined plot and clear-cut characters, this isn't it.BLACKBIRD HOUSE has no sharp edges. Rather, it's about blurred boundaries between water and land, organs and skin, love and hate, life and death, conscious and subconscious. The inner and the outer. Seeming contradictions that come to make perfect sense.It's about different ways people can be lost (\`at sea'), find home (even if they've been there all along), shape their lives or let circumstance take over, love, die, be wounded, heal.Alice Hoffman skillfully maneuvers a thin line, finding a balance between the limited part of existence about which our senses inform us, and what lies beyond ordinary senses. She's created a place where everything has meaning, though that's not necessarily a comforting thing; it's simply what is.Although it has what may seem to be fantastical touches, BH is not a fantasy, nor is it a New Age-y, feel-good read. It's about aspects of reality some shrug off as imagination, a trick of light or last night's bad clams.If you give BLACKBIRD HOUSE half a chance, you'll find its truth and beauty -- the type of truth and beauty that are as likely to prick as they are to placate.Threads of metaphor abound: red and red-related colors, black, fish, birds, snow, cold, feet, cows, milk. And of course the blackbird (which isn't, really)."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Alice Hoffman is a conjurer of prose. She understands human frailty, vulnerability, self-conscious loathing of birth abnormalities, the need for feeling love, and other acts of living. She writes about New England as well as anyone writing today - her pages are filled with visual stimuli that hang so closely to the retina that though they are often repeated (the color red as embodied by pears, berries, blood, leather, etc.), each repetition serves only to magnify the original richness of impulse. BLACKBIRD HOUSE spans 200 odd years of life on Cape Cod, and while many are calling the chapters 'essays' or 'short stories', they seem more like a cohesive novel about the land and the endurance of the sea and time than anything so disjointed as individual stories. Each of the chapters is connected and it is this connection of odd characters and their progeny that propels the reader nonstop from the early days of the colonies to the present. Hoffman creates dark characters: pain, bruise, emotional devastation and fate are woven like a continuing tapestry, passed from generation to generation. The seeds of all the characters, no matter from where they may be speaking (from the Cape, Boston, London, etc) all are firmly planted in the sweet peas, nettles and bramble that surround the sturdy house that makes the title. Here are witching, blackbirds that become white like ghosts, the ocean, and every type of family dysfunctional unit imaginable. BLACKBIRD HOUSE is not unlike the magical realism of our Latin American writers, but with a thoroughly American twist that makes it even more delicious! An excellent book, this!"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Now, I might be a bit prejudiced because I live with 15 parrots and am a wild-bird watcher, but I find this book wonderful. Reading Alice Hoffman's writing is like gazing through a sun-catcher. As the light moves through the colors, it catches your eye and touches your heart in unexpected ways. Ever since her book PRACTICAL MAGIC, Hoffman has lead this reader into a mystical and magical realm where all things are possible, and although truly sad things happen a heartlift is felt at the end if the tale. Hoffman has a deft touch, neither clobbering the reader with too much explanation, nor failing to inform. What happens to the bird? He isn't always black. Do the lovers get together, why yes, you discover a few pages later when their grandchildren tell their story.Each of the stories in this little book stands alone, yet all are woven into a fabric which includes the threads of singular lives who within the space of a few pages you come to care about. I have read whole novels and not cared for the protagonist or any of the other characters. How can an author be called anything but magical when she can make you care for many people individually wihtin a few paragraphs?"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I find Alice Hoffman to be completely unique because her world is a multi-layered, intertwined place where the fish in the pond, the birds and stars in the sky, the leaves on the trees and the people that inhabit the spaces between them make up a landscape that I cannot compare to anything else I have read. This book takes her sensibility and uses it in a new way.Writing teachers always try to get you to tie up loose ends which I think is not always real. In this book, Alice Hoffman ties up some loose ends and leaves others hanging in an extremely intriguing way. I like this quality because it is more true to life. The book tells the stories of the many who have lived in one house over a period of close to 200 years. Some of the characters of Blackbird House intersect and conclude. Others, as in real life, are left open ended. Each character is original and intriguing. The writing is evocative, rich and unique to the gifts of one of the few modern writers that has carved out a place where no one else has gone. Blackbird House is a quick, satisfying, rich read. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I'd most like to comment on the story called, \\"Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair.\\" I find this to be the best most close-up of the stories with a deft interplay of the inner world and fears of Violet and the rich and palpable goings-on around her, wherever she is. For example, a man, a stranger to the area and her, has been watching her from a distance at the shore. She is convinced that, from that great distance, he sees her as beautiful, but the closer the view, the uglier she will look to him. When she is introduced, she hides her purple birthmark in the shade of her sun hat. Her attraction to him is palpable, but she can show only a little of her plain face to him at time. All the while the shoreline setting and the movements of the characters are so realistically drawn that you almost feel yourself taken by the hand to walk with these people. Violet guages the man's reactions to her at every step, stunned to discover, little by little, that he is not repulsed by her face. As long as he has not been scared away by her looks, she contrives ways keep him near her. To say what she does would give away too much of the story. In some of the other stories, I felt more like I was watching the characters from a distance and couldn't get as good a sense of how they experience things inwardly, or if I knew what emotion was there, grief, for example, I couldn't understand why they acted out their grief in the ways that they did. In all the stories, though, the sense of place is fantastic. You would think the author had a time machine that took her to each period in 200-year span this book covers."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Every tale in this wonderful collection of short stories by author Alice Hoffman have one thing in common: they all take place in the fictitious Blackbird House on Cape Cod. Set in the historically rich fabric of New England, each story revolves around something magical and yet heart-wrenchingly real. The stories span from the Revolutionary War to modern day, and explore the timeless themes of love, betrayal, devastation, exhilaration, death and life.Hoffman has a wonderful way of creating captivating stories that come alive with her luminous prose. She reinvents the fairy tale and never fails to create remarkable stories that stay in the reader's heart long after her books have been put down.BLACKBIRD HOUSE opens with the story of a mother who loses her son and her husband to the angry sea. All she is left with is the house her husband built and the constant cries of a blackbird that was raised by her son. The stories that fill this collection are short, but their themes ring loudly. Hoffman writes about common feelings in a magical and almost ethereal way. Her descriptions for everything from turnips and water to fears and destiny are lyrical and haunting.Hoffman writes about young lovers, witches, women with heartache, men who navigate the sea, and children who misbehave. She explores every facet of human emotion, both tender and harsh. Many of her stories are symbolically portrayed, while others are just so beautifully written and insightful that they read like poetry. If you have never explored the world through Alice Hoffman's writing, BLACKBIRD HOUSE is an excellent place to start. It gives the reader a wonderful example of just how prolific and talented a writer Alice Hoffman is and how powerfully her writing resonates with her readers. BLACKBIRD HOUSE is a stunning achievement and an unforgettable book.--- Reviewed by Jocelyn M. Kelley"},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"This is the kind of novel only Hoffman can write, full of mystery and the indelible images of people who spend their short time on earth stepping quietly into the pages of the past, as the years speed forward to embrace the future.The epicenter of each family who lives there, Blackbird House knows each memory, the good and the bad, etched into time as it hovers at the edge of the earth at the Cape, only a mile from the ocean, in a fertile field of trees, wild berries and wildly growing vegetation. From the first family residing there and their travails, Hoffman never shrinks from the realities of life and death. Rather, the house serves as an impassive witness to the fortunes and misfortunes of a succession of families. In such a harsh part of the world, where many men make their living from the sea, families endure their losses, accepting fate or despairing at life's cruelties.Blackbird House seems to draw an inordinate amount of unhappiness, many lonely, desperate people; yet, in its quiet solitude, the house is an anchor, overflowing with wild growth as if nature would make up in abundance what people have lost. Certainly, there are omens, such as the return of the blackbird pet of a young boy lost at sea, the bird's once black feathers turned white. But omens are, after all, in the perception of the beholder.Hoffman is an artist, a writer who cannot exist in a land without ambiguity. Her message is one of healing, no matter the damage and compassion for a world that often seems careless of human feelings. Blackbird House is a place of opposites, hope and despair, sadness and happiness and death and renewal. Years of disappointment witness the passage of time, ushering in a new day with the promise of tomorrow. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"I've read several of Alice Hoffman's books, and have, for the most part, enjoyed them. BLACKBIRD HOUSE is one of my favorites, mainly because the story is weaved through centuries of history, but also because of the magical element that this mysterious Cape Cod cottage has. In short, it's a fun story to read and dream about a house that has inhabitated all types of fascinating people."},{"Title":"Blackbird House","review":"Alice Hoffman is one of my favorite authors mainly because her work has resonance. When you read an Alice Hoffman book, you cannot help but be moved by the characters, by the situation, and even by the setting. Blackbird House is no different.The novel weaves the stories of the successive inhabitants of a house in Massachusetts with great skill. The prose is wonderful. While the novel does not have a story or defined plot to speak of, the reader is ensnared by the power of the house and by a genuine interest for all of the inhabitants. Hoffman even makes references to the early generations of the house through the new tenants.Hoffman makes you believe that we leave a part of ourselves in our homes, and when we move into a house that has been lived in before, the presence of the previous owner's spirit can still be felt. When the book concludes, the reader knows that 5, 10, maybe even 50 years from then, a new person will be living in the house. The house and the lives of those who lived there can never truly be erased.It's hard to really review this book because its best feature is practically indescribable. It affects you. You read the book, and you are moved by it. Its stories haunt you, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. It definitely is a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"With war everywhere, everyone needs to stay alert. With their immense bodies and hi-tech gizmos, it will be an easy task for The Iron Hands. Their leader was once a human, but after many battles, his body was replaced with metal and he became a cyborg. And as for his brain, it is much stronger now for it is half computer. Iron Hands by Jonathan Green was a great read. With its vivid description and intense battles, all sci-fi readers will enjoy it.This book has many different races to help intrigue the readers. One such race is the Chaos, strong magical wielders. Their enemy, Iron Hands, have very powerful hi-tech cyborgs and weaponry that can blow apart anything. Their leader has lived for centuries because of their technical advancement allowing to increase his life span by millenniums.This book also has original names of characters races, and ranks in armies. The highest rank in the Iron Hands army is Carrion Lord of Imperium, but this rank is only achieved once you have killed the previous one. The throne he sits on is called the Golden Throne of Worlds. Though he is only one, many respect him and trust him with their lives. Adeptus Astartes is the class of many races. Each class has its own characteristics and traits that separate them from another. Iron Hands, for example, is the only race to solely focus on technology and fire-power using projectiles such as guns and rockets. Chaos on the other hand, has monsters that attack first and clear the way for them to advance.Iron Hands imagery was that of a masterpiece. Everything it described made the reader feel like he was looking at it right in front of him. It described the army of Iron Hands as immense soldiers suited in armor made of the toughest metal, only penetrable by the strongest of weapons such as blades as magic. Their guns were the size of a human body, and they wore helmets of gold and silver to keep them strong. Their ruby red eye holes so they may see had sensors in it so they may find out more information about their enemies. And they had a great insignia on the chest plate to proudly show who they were.This book would be great for all readers who enjoy wars and sci-fi/ fantasy reads. Though many would find it as a fantasy book, it is also a sci-fi due to its advanced technology and armor/weapons, as well as the cyborg armies. It is a little confusing, but once you get started around the fifth chapter, you get engrossed in it. Therefore, grabbing the reader and making him read the entire book and then the rest of the series with its story and characters. Once you read this story, you will continually want more, and the thing is, there are so many books in the entire series, that all of the books intertwine with each other and you have to pay close attention to understand it all.N.

In it, the Iron Hands space marines are called upon by the adeptus mechanicus to investigate a mysterious warpstorm bordering the eye of terror. The story takes place during the harrowing time of Abaddon's thirteenth black crusade. Iron-father Gdolkin is the leader of the small band of marines dispatched for the mission, which turns into an epic quest whose outcome decides the fate of a million Imperial worlds. Johnathan Green makes excellent use of the warhammer lore and you get to see obliterators, dreadnoughts, defilers, raptors, plague marines, a battle aboard a mountain-sized ordinatus artillery cannon and a battle within a towering emperor titan. The chaos forces are well-represented; never before have they been described this relentlessly as corrupt, rotting pus-filled, diseased abominations. And that's a good thing.The character's in Iron Hands are well-imagined, but suffer a marked lack of depth. The story is vividly imagined in some parts, and half-baked in others. The writing is a bit clunky in comparison the wonderful 40k writings of Dan Abnett. Overall this is a truly epic story that makes great use of warhammer lore and depicts an interesting side story to the thirteenth black crusade."},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"Ohhh where can I start on this review.Lets start with the main character, Iron Father Gdolkin. He seemed to be a pretty characterful guy when he was young, but when he became a Space Marine apparently they decided to remove part of his brain and replace it with part of an Ork's brain. Gdolkin does two things in this book. If you think this sounds rather odd then I agree with you, but unfortunately its true. Gdolkin is extrememly shallow and one of the biggest train-wrecks of a main character I've ever read. First of all, he is very gullible. Its not fun to watch our hero follow a Tech Magos around because \\"he is on an important mission\\" and never find out what that important mission is, EVER (as in the reader never knows what the whole point of the book was). You wouldn't believe how gullible this guy is. Next, he gets angry at everything. With how often he gets angry it doesn't make sense that he doesn't shoot the Tech Magos who is dragging him around everywhere halfway into the book. And finally, he is stupid. You wouldn't believe the idiocy of this guy at some points in the book. I would spoil them because after reading this review you shouldn't even consider reading this book, but just incase you are going to anyways, I won't.The ending is priceless (in a bad way). There Gdolkin is, a gullible drooling idiot with a very short temper, and well, you will have to see for yourself.If you have considered starting an Iron Hands army in Warhammer 40,000, this will turn you off from them forever. If you have an Iron Hands army then you will be seriously disillusioned if you read this book. I am a hardcore Iron Hands player, they are my favorite army, but I really, really had to force myself to finish it. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because the book does have a few good parts. One star is reserved for the very bottom of the barrel."},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"OK, I realize that Warhammer novels are not exactly tops on the list for deep characters, but this novel brings 2 dimensional characters to a new low. I'd call them 1 dimensional in this book. Iron-Father Gdolkin, the main character, apparently has only one emotion...anger. He is angery at this guy, angery at that guy, angery at this situation, angery at that situation...blah blah blah. I suspect he is even angery at his rice crispies in the morning - I say it like that because it was getting tedious that he was angery at every single encounter. Other then that Gdolkin was as flat as can be. He began to get on my nerves about a third of the way through the book.Other characters were simple paper cut outs to be killed, shot up or used as extras as the situation warranted. The plot was spelled out very early in the book, but quickly became boring. The enemy presented no real challenges and Gdolkin always has the right answer for everything...boring!!! Interactions between side characters was laughable. The writting was also very clumsy.Ya, I was hard on this book. Let me finish on a bright note. Mr Green's knowledge of the 40K universe was very good and he did a nice job of using the different aspects of the 40k universe. That plus the ending was a little different is why I gave it 2 stars."},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"This may well be the worst space marines novel i've read todate.

Other characteristics of the novelweren't all that bad but when you feel nothing for themain character, you'll feel either numbness or disliketowards the entire novel.On another note, sometimes supporting characters are thereto take over and support the lead character.

While Green has a good grasp on the Warhammer Universe, it means little when it comes to the plot of this book.I'd say over half this book is just describing how things look, and that is not an exageration. Green will describe down to a freckle what a character looks like (which he does do a good job at), but when it comes to an action scene, he will mention \\"he did this\\" and \\"he did that\\" with no enthusiasm or liveliness. The majority of acion scenes consisted \\"Gdolkin fired his bolt pistol\\" or \\"Gdolkin brought down his axe.\\" Nothing original and very repetivtive.As mentioned by others, the characters are very bland, boring and 2 dimensional. You can't relate to any character, main or supporting, in any way.I really wouldn't recommend this book, as 1/4 of the way through it, almost nothing had happened, and what did happen was inconsequential to the rest of the book.

The writing is just repetitive, tiring, and full of fluff. If I had to read 'black ichor' one more time I was going to scream. The story is un-interesting and the characters not only shallow but also not likable. Granted the universe of WH40K is fiction but Green makes the world completely unbelievable in this story.The one good thing about the book is Green does a nice job of describing both ground and space actions.

The story centers around the leader of this contingent, Iron Father Gdolkin. Gdolkin is a demanding, humorless figure displeased at having to leave behind the home world of the Iron Hands in the face of Abaddon's approaching crusade. Gdolkin's journey ultimately takes him to a long lost Mechanicus stronghold that holds a prize which could possibly decide the outcome of the 13th Crusade. Along the way, Gdolkin and his battle brothers must fight through hordes of mutants, traitor guardsmen and chaos space marines of the Death Guard and Word Bearer chapters.While the book was a fun read overall, I found most of the main characters, including Gdolkin, to often be rather two-dimensional and predictable. With one possible exception, the rest of the marines accompanying Gdolkin are really nothing more than anonymous suits of armor that play little, if any, role in the development of the story. Likewise, the Death Guard and Word Bearers who stand in the way of Gdolkin and his forces are really nothing more than stock antagonists doomed to perish in large numbers at the hands of the loyalist marines. I found the treatment of the Word Bearers chapter in Daemon World by Ben Coulter to be far more nuanced and interesting that the depiction contained in Iron Hands. I will give Green credit, however, for crafting a unique and unexpected ending which made up for some of the more conventional earlier parts of the story."},{"Title":"Iron Hands (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"This book was my first exposure to Warhammer 40k.

I consider his book \\"Necromancer\\" to be one of the best novels ever written about Warhammer Fantasy. That said, I can only ask what happened here.The main character is a 1-dimensional creature whose emotions range from slightly annoyed to supremely angry. The main antagonist is a badly scripted Bond villain. The twist at the end of the plot if foreseeable. The Judaic name of the creature at the end would have been better served if it fit. The Tech-Magos was depressingly un-tech-savvy. The lore of the Iron Hands working perfectly with the Adeptus Mechanicus was butchered horrendously. This novel reeks of failure and half-baked ideas.

The book can be regarded as an excellent primary source of information from a historical point of view. These are anecdotes from people ranging from sharecroppers on up to highly placed executives, politicians, and professionals. Terkel leaves no stone unturned, as these stories (grouped by occupation and social stratum) show how the Depression affected people in all walks of life in the United States.No secondary source is going to prove as truthful as the stories themselves. No high-flying armchair analysis by a detached political commentator, PhD or windbag is going to give you the true flavor of what our country went through after October, 1929.We are in the midst of an economic downturn that has 800,000 American citizens without unemployment insurance, a looming health crisis among unemployed members of the middle class, and a war on the horizon. If you want to be prepared and to understand the ramifications of this situation, I urge you to not only read this book cover to cover, but also to go out and find people who lived through this time and listen to their stories. Go to your grandparents, parents, elderly relatives, the old guy on the porch across the street, the local senior centers. Ask them to talk.Understanding history helps us understand the future.Studs Terkel's book is a recounting of the past, but is also a story of our coming future.Read it!"},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"Studs Terkel interviewed dozens of people for his oral history, &quot;Hard Times.&quot; What you get is a very good overall picture of the Great Depression in America.Terkel interviewed the rich, gangsters, southern sharecroppers, Oakies and Arkies, the rural poor, young and old (in the 1930's as well as in the 1960's when he was interviewing people.) The perceptions of the Depression by each is as individual and as varied as America itself. What struck me most, however was the inequitability of the Depression.When I thought of the &quot;Depression&quot; images of soup lines and &quot;Hoovervilles&quot; sprang to mind. And yes, many remembered those as well. But there were several interviewees who never saw a bread line, a shanty town, or felt the sting of economic crash. To my suprise, there were even a few individuals who became RICH as a result of the Depression.Another interesting aspect of the book (which was totally unexpected) was the reflection of the &quot;present&quot; while looking back at the Deperession. Terkel assembled the book in the late 1960's; as you may imagine, the social turbulence and youth culture of the day was often brought up in the various interviews ... fascinating.All in all an interesting and engaging read - if nothing else, it certainly puts things in perspective relative to the &quot;hard times&quot; the nation faced in the 1930's. The book is not for everyone, but I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"Studs Terkel's &quot;Hard Times&quot; offers an excellent look into the 1930s from a multitude of Americans, including: the young/old, rich/poor, and new immigrant/old stock Americans were all coved in &quot;Hard Times&quot;. Their stories will change you and your understanding of the Great Depression will be enhanced from what you learn from these readings.Interestingly, the interviews were conducted in the late 1960s, so you also have a comparative oral history of the 1960s as well.However, Stud Terkel's book would be greatly enhanced if he had included an index and a bibliography for interesting and important subjects. Maybe he will include an index and a bibliography in the next edition.Overall, an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"Studs Terkel has assembled a great collection of oral histories from a pivotal period in the twentieth century. Don't look here for a detailed analysis of the economics of one of this country's worst downturns. Instead, one should read this to get a glimpse of the despair that seemed to capture nearly everyone in its grasp while no one seemed to know what was causing it nor how to fix it.There are a lot of terrific stories in this book, covering everything from union strikers, farmers to business men and college students. This book is a must-have for any serious student of this era."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"This is the first book I've read on America's experience of the Great Depression of the 1930s. My parents and other relatives and some of my older friends went through it. One man whom I knew, frequently brought it up and with great bitterness and anger, often directing that anger to others around him - especially those who were younger and didn't go through it - while others had little or nothing to say and seemed to brush it aside. Most though, seem to just want to forget it.One fine elderly woman - my grandmother - was incredibly generous and loving to others the rest of her life, because of living through it. It still stuns me to see how these people with similar experiences could react so differently so many years later.The author, being a Chicago man, places a lot of emphasis on the Depression as it hit that city and its citizens. Also he has a definite Left-oriented sort of outlook - and after reading this book it becomes entirely understandable. He frequently brings up the possibilities of revolution during the 1930s when so many ordinary and poor people lost just about everything. But the message comes through clearly that the Americans of those years firstly still had respect for law and order and the government, and secondly they had a kind of optimism or set of positive 'it will pass' illusions that kept them going.Reading how people were treated back then, it is nonetheless a wonder that they really didn't rise up and overthrow the entire capitalist system. If a similar Depression occurred today, it would happen. And that is also the reflection of many voices in this book.I highly recommend this book to everyone. More than anything else, it taught me to understand more clearly how and why different generational values and perceptions were formed from that period - and how they have come to impact succeeding generations."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"I had to read Studs Terkel's &quot;Hard Times&quot; for school. At first it seemed confusing and long b/c there where no main characters and it was 462 pages. I was surprised to sincerely enjoy it. It was a captivating book with many fascinating stories. I liked the way the book shows you all aspects of the Depression from people with all different lifestyles."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"HARD TIMES is moving oral history about the Great Depression of the 1930's from people who lived through it. A majority of the interviewees are Chicagoans, who on balance tend to reinforce the author's liberal views. We hear from former jobless, hoboes, people who had work, the rich, even a gangster. We read varied opinions on President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, which eased (but didn't end) the hard times before later evolving into the welfare state. Imagine times so difficult that thousands hopped freight trains and traveled long distances in an often-fruitless search for a job - any job. Some interviewees worked for the WPA, a New Deal program that put millions of unemployed men (including my grandfather) to work repairing sidewalks and building structures like post offices and Chicago's Lake Shore Drive. HARD TIMES helps readers understand why so many of our grandparents kept talking about the Depression long after it had ended.Some say that Studs Terkel isn't an author, but merely a good listener with a tape recorder. Either way, the result is a series of very readable oral histories such as HARD TIMES, THE GOOD WAR, DIVISION STREET, WORKING, etc."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"This is the second book by Terkel I've read, the other being his superlative \\"The Good War\\". Like that book, it is a joy to read, and it was often hard to put down. He usually opens his interviews with just enough exposition to set up a scene, and then lets his subjects talk. And, do they! The personalities of each come through such that you feel as if you're sharing the room with them, an experience that is the more poignant for the realization that most of the people in this book are long-dead, taking their stories with them.Nonetheless, the book has its weaknesses. Though the Great Depression is by definition an extremely broad subject, I never felt quite like I was getting a good \\"slice of life\\" of the times. For instance, there seem to be a disproportionate number of interviews with former Communists and socalists; though their movement was powerful during the Thirties, one may get the idea that they were more common than they actually were--especially since, as one reviewer noted, much of the book is set in and around Chicago. On the whole, it's a less gripping text than \\"The Good War\\"; reading that book felt like an awakening, while this one will reveal little to those with a working knowledge of the Depression-era U.S.All that said, I'm glad I read it, and still recommend it for anyone interested in this complex and unsettling period of American history."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"History is best talked about, not read. You can read scores of books about the depression, get your dates and figures right, but until you read first hand accounts you can never truly understand the times.As a twenty-something in this new millenia, the depression has been shrowded in mystery for me, my parents got only bits and pieces from theirs, and I got even less from them. This book fills in the pieces, helps me understand an era I know very little about, and allows me to understand how that era shaped my parents, and myself.Mr. Terkel has done us all a great favor with his books, and this one is on the top of my list."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"There's a review on the back of my copy which reads in part, \\"Read a page, any page. Then try to stop.\\" I read this smugly, as I'm not the sort to just get lost in a book that quickly, but I didn't even have to read a whole page before I'd noticed a full hour had passed. Really any paragraph in this book will get you hooked.It's so immensely interesting the varying opinions people had on the Great Depression from a political viewpoint. I was surprised how many people who lived through it didn't seem to think it was so bad and had the \\"anyone can make it in America if they work hard\\" attitude. They call Roosevelt a despot, hate the New Deal and claim they never saw a breadline. Other people criticize the system, praise unions and speak of how the government programs helped them, but surprisingly to me there seemed to be fewer of these voices.What's so great about this book though is the stories of what happened to people. They're funny, sad, sometimes scary, but always deeply personal and educational. I think young people could learn a lot about history by reading more books like this rather than traditional history books - this stuff is downright fascinating and addictive."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"A wonderful book filled with short easy to read stories about the great depression.

Great book."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"This book is so insightful and current at the same time. It is as though it was written last week. The personal perspective puts you right in the middle of their lives."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"As I have done on other occasion when I am reviewing more than one work by an author I am using some of the same comments, where they are pertinent, here as I did in earlier reviews. In this series the first Studs Terkel book reviewed was that of his \\"The Good War\\": an Oral History of World War II.Strangely, as I found out about the recent death of long time pro-working class journalist and general truth-teller \\"Studs\\" Terkel I was just beginning to read his \\"The Good War\\", about the lives and experiences of, mainly, ordinary people during World War II in America and elsewhere, for review in this space. As with other authors once I get started I tend to like to review several works that are relevant to see where their work goes. In the present case the review of Hard Times: An Oral History Of The Great Depression serves a dual purpose.First, this book serves as Studs attempt to reflect on the lives of working people (circa 1980 here but the relevant points could be articulated in 2008 and thus can serve as a cautionary tale as well) from Studs' own generation who survived that event, fought World War II and did or did not benefit from the fact of American military victory and world economic preeminence, including those blacks and mountain whites who made the internal migratory trek from the South to the North. He includes other stories, like that of the society photographer Zerbe who took the Depression with blinkers on and never missed a beat and was barely aware that it had occurred or that of the lumpen proletarian extraordinaire Kid Pharaoh , who do not easily fit into any of those patterns but who nevertheless have stories to tell. And grievances, just, unjust or whimsical, to spill.Secondly, always hovering in the background is one of Studs' preoccupations- the fate of his generation- \`so-called \\"greatest generation\\". Those stories, as told here, are certainly a mixed bag. I have mentioned elsewhere my own disagreement with the popular media title for this now fast dwindling generation. I do not want to repeat that analysis here but, for the most part, the stories here confirm at least part of my thesis that the members of this generation, at the end, had some qualms about the lessons they took from the hard, hard struggles of the 1930's. That was really the period of their \`fifteen minutes of fame'.One thing that I noticed immediately after reading this book, and as is true of the majority of Terkel's interview books, is that he is not the dominant presence but is a rather light, if intensely interested, interloper in these stories. For better or worse the interviewees get to tell their stories, unchained. In this age of 24/7 media coverage with every half-baked journalist or wannabe interjecting his or her personality into somebody else's story this was, and is, rather refreshing. Of course this journalistic virtue does not mean that Studs did not have control over who got to tell their stories and who didn't to fit his preoccupations and sense of order. He has a point he wants to make and that is that although most \\"ordinary\\" people do not make the history books they certainly make history, if not always of their own accord or to their own liking. Again, kudos and adieu Studs."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"I read this book as an assignment in college and thought what a wonderful gift my professor has chosen.

Author Studs Terkel interviews people who lived through the Depression and gets their takes on that difficult period. We hear the experiences and memories of those who lived through it from multiple points of view. The book was published in 1970 and much of the research was accordingly done during the second half of the '60s which was also quite a turbulent time in the United States. Accordingly, a question which Terkel most frequently asks his subjects is how people would react to a Depression at that time. Most thought little of the ability of those coming of age or boomers during the '60s to weather the travails of the Depression. Many also thought that a worse Depression was coming. That would seem not to have been the case although it would seem that since the publication of this book, the economic standing of the large majority of Americans has actually decreased. With the current economic troubles in the United States (and the world), it was interesting to read of the difficulties experienced by many people during the Depression. It was also very interesting to read of the strong anti-Roosevelt-ism among many business magnates and the highest ranks of the upper-middle class. It was also intriguing to read of the belief of some that the Depression did not extend past 1936.Having not studied much Depression history in nearly 20 years, at least not in any great depth, and certainly not having heard people offering their own accounts of their experiences during the Depression, this book was tremendously enlightening. Terkel interviews old retired farmers. He interviews men who were factory workers during the Depression. He interviews those who worked in social services attempting to alleviate some of the pains of the Depression. As mentioned, he interviews business magnates. He interviews many who were help during the '30s-many of whom were black. By virtue of his speaking to such a wide variety of people, one does not believe that one has a limited understanding of the range of experiences had by people during this time period. We see history from the point-of-view of those with a wide variety of economic backgrounds. This allows the reader to see the subjectivity of history and introduces points of view (the poor, women, black and Latino people) which one might not read of in a textbook.The stories and their specificity of recall are fascinating. This really is a gem of a book. It expands the range off thinking about the '30s and I am sure opened avenues of thinking to historical researchers who wanted to broaden the scope of recollections about the Depression. If you think you're only getting a limited perspective about the experiences of the '30s, please read this book."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"\\"Hard Times\\" by Studs Terkel462 pagesShort review: Excellent book. I credit it with softening somewhat my attitude towards FDR's dealing with the Great Depression. I'm still no great fan of his, but, I can see and respect the many people in this book who undoubtedly were.When people were talking about this book and \\"oral history\\", I kind of figured out it was a bunch of people remembering the Great Depression. Both from personal experience and from hand-me-down anecdotes from parents and grandparents. That it is.However, it is also a lot more.I was surprised, once I get my curious mitts on it, on several issues:1) how many people were actually involved. Terkel interviewed hundreds and hundreds of folk. Of this vast amount of material, he whittled it down to just over one hundred and sixty unique individuals. These range across all social strata, and -in outlook and political sympathies- cover the broad political spectrum. That makes it a sort of unique \\"historical time capsule\\".2) Terkel wrote very little in this book; a one-liner here, a question there, a short paragraph somewhere else by way of explanation. Putting all his scattered comments and questions together, he still probably wrote less than 20 pages out of the 462. His skill, or genius if you like, was the way he gently prodded people here and there, and then wisely shut up and let them do the talking. He then arranged the material very interestingly. I quote some examples further below.3) The book radiates humanity. Warmth. Compassion, idealism, sincerity. It is full of people who tried. Tried hard. And often failed.It is uniquely inspiring.4) The book contains a sinister background noise. Was the Great Depression a man made thing? Who was at fault? Could it have been prevented, ameliorated? Nobody is really sure. Were people used and abused? Humiliated? Yes. Was there bitterness and great anger, hatred even? Yes. Did everybody see that? No. Did everybody suffer? No, many prospered.5) If, like me, you are interested in FDR, and what kind of person he really was, saviour or devil incarnate, or something in between, then you will find many tantalizing glimpses of him in this book. Some speakers hated him, others loved him. Of his many public programs, some people curse them as wasteful and frivolous, and mere ploys and bribes to ensure political re-election.Others however are clearly sincerely grateful -emotional- to this day for those Federal initiatives, and imply that without them, they might have starved.6) If, like me, you are interested in the class struggle, and the emergence of the Trade unions from reviled rabble to formidable labour movements, and if, like me you are suspicious that there are those (then and now) who seek to fan the flames of class divisions for their own selfish ends, then you will find much to ponder. The Unions then and now are not all good, and not all bad. It's a lot more complicated. Shades of gray...Long review:If you are looking for a technical, theoretical, economic treatise of the causes of the Great Depression, then (heavens!) don't buy this book. Check out some of my other reviews for that.This is a wandering, circuitous, snap shot in time of many different themes. It is a cacophony. But therein lies a magnificent, touching charm...I'll give you just a few examples amongst a great many.Consider Ed Paulsen, who was 14 in 1926. Despite the hardship, on page 31 he says:\\"We weren't greatly agitated in terms of society. Ours was a bewilderment, not an anger. Not a sense of being particularly put upon. We weren't talking revolution; we were talking jobs...\\"Mary Owsley (p. 46) \\"My husband was very bitter. That's just puttin' it mild. He was an intelligent man. He couldn't see why as wealthy a country as this is, that there was any sense in so many people starving to death, when so much of it, wheat and everything else, was being poured into the Ocean.\\"Country Joe McDonald (p.52) \\"I travel around and talk to some of the Mexican migrant workers. In a way, they seem closer to each other than most well-off middle-class people. Their impoverished condition somehow made them very real people. It's hard to be phony when you haven't got anything. I mean when you're really down and out. I think the Depression had some kind of human qualities with it that we lack now.\\"William Benton (p.69) \\"In 1929, most of your Wall Street manipulators called it The New Era. They felt it was the start of a perpetual boom that would carry us on and on forever to new plateaus.\\"Ruby Bates (p.92) \\"Roosevelt touched the temper of the black community..... He had tremendous support through his wife... The WPA and other projects introduced black people to handicrafts and trades. It gave Negroes a chance to have an office to work out of with a typewriter...\\"Yose Yglesias (p. 111) \\"People would put off government aid as long as possible. Aunt Lila and her husband were the first in our family, and the last, to go on the WPA. This was considered a terrible tragedy, because it was charity. You did not mention it to them.\\"Sally Rand (p.174) \\"I truly believe we shall have another Depression. I think people will just go out and take what they need. I don't think there will be any more people queuing up on bread lines waiting to be fed by charity, God damn it......The middle class look upon the deprived smugly: the poor we'll have with us always. Oh yeah?\\"Aaron Barkham (p.204) \\"The county sheriff had a hundred strike breakers. They were called deputies. The company paid him ten cents a ton on all the coal carried down the river, to keep the union out.\\"This book gave me many vivid mental pictures. They continually leap from the pages, and made me realize just how complex the truth of those times really is. There are many shades of gray to try and understand. Politically, nothing was black and white. I think it leaves me with more compassion for the ordinary people and some of the politicians of the Great Depression. It's too easy to totally condemn FDR and the WPA, from the comfort of the twenty first century. But something had to be done... Was it perfect? No. Was it a complete failure? No. Somewhere in the middle lies the answer, and, more importantly, the crucial lessons for our generation, and the current fiercely debated Obama New Deal. I don't envy him his job...Christopher Lasch (p.340) put into words an impression I've been getting myself. He says:\\"To talk in retrospect is to do so coldly, and,in a sense, to falsify what people experienced in the Thirties. While one can say, in the relative comfort of the sixties, that the New Deal measures were palliatives, they were more than that to the people living in the Thirties. They were, in many cases, matters of life and death.\\"For me, an excellent, wonderfully challenging book. One of the best I've read in the last few years. I think it's made my views a bit more balanced. I'm neither Democrat or Republican. What am I?Oh dear. Guess I'd better go read a whole lot more books and see if I can find out.I'm open to suggestions..."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"Studs Terkel discovered the great value of talking and listening to people, having them tell him their stories.

Read this book!"},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"I've read several books on the Great Depression...I don't know why it fascinates me, but it does. My grandparents lived through it, and when I found out that my grandpa lost the house he built in Salt Lake City, Utah and most probably the stress of that time caused his early heart attack at age 45 (he lived through it, but it impacted his health)...it caused me to look into the time period. I went after this particular book for some answers when people were debating whether or not this Recession was equal to the Depression. I personally feel when all is said and done, when they look back at this 'Recession' the economists may change their minds and their words, and call this another Depression. Even if they don't, when someone goes back and writes about this time period, they will record problems that people had along the lines not far different of what Terkel found in Hard Times...the only difference will be the way that people handled them...and the lack of government programs with which to 'catch' those people who fall through the cracks. Another difference, is back in the Great Depression...people got up off their fat asses and worked, really worked. They also made do with what they had. And they didn't blame others for their problems (most of them didn't). The rich did what they always do...some of them committed suicide. Some of them made it through with no problems.The ones that impressed me in the book, were usually the very poor, the disenfranchised, the blacks/African-Americans who used music to get out, of course the young men in CCC, the ones that worked hard and coped. This is a wonderful book. You can hear the words and voices of those speaking. If I taught a history class or even English, I'd have this as required reading...it's that good."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"There is undeniable value in recording the memories and perspectives of people who have lived through something as remarkable as the Great Depression. The Internet of the future may provide the best possible compilation of such raw materials: only then may we see video and hear audio of the actual event, culled from tape recordings and home movies of the 1970s and before, and from film reels of the 1920s and after. Compared to resources like those, the relatively brief excerpts that Studs Terkel offers in this book cannot help but feel tailored, managed, and limiting.I say the Internet of the future may be the ultimate resource. But in an important sense, that is exactly wrong. The ultimate resource would have been to have lived during those times -- to have experienced the event firsthand, and to have interviewed people and recorded information as it was unfolding. Do we, indeed, obtain a more compelling, a more visceral impression of the Great Depression by reading these timeworn memories, from the 1960s, of events that had taken place some 30 years earlier?In some ways, no decade in the 20th century could have been farther away from the 1930s than were the 1960s. We had newfound suburban materialism; the race to the Moon; John Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the Great Society; LSD; rebellious youth and college as one's real home; American global supremacy; Vietnam and the Cold War. We were *so* far removed from the 1930s, by then. When Americans looked back from the later decade to the earlier one, they could not help but do so through very colored lenses. The values of the 1960s -- the things that people would tend to speak about, in the 1960s -- did visibly flavor the way that Terkel's interviewees spoke about their distant past.Terkel's work is not history. It is a compilation of raw materials that a historian could use for some purposes. No doubt the historian would have to work through heaps of old material that might frequently repeat itself or express the same general impressions, just as Terkel's increasingly tedious interviews tend to do, as one progresses through the book. But a good historian would find a way to condense that material, to extract its most telling points, and to organize and present them in an intriguing and highly thought-provoking manner. This would be true even of the historian whose written work rested heavily upon verbatim quotations from primary sources. You have to make a point. You have to say something provocative if you expect people to get excited about your work.I do recommend skimming this book, dipping occasionally into its anecdotes and observations. There is much to be learned here. But I don't believe it is going to give many people just what they want for the Depression. Instead, consider reading a novel about the 1930s, or one written in the 1930s; browse old magazines and, particularly, old newspapers, including both the big ones (e.g., the New York Times) and the small, local ones -- if you can find any of the latter that have been preserved in your area.Gather your own data from these sources and elsewhere, and don't restrict yourself, as much of Terkel's book does, to one city. The 1930s was a world unto itself. This book does not do it justice."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"This is a compilation of over a hundred and seventy five interviews in which people recount their memories of the great depression. Many of them are very detailed heart wrenching accounts. Many are vague. Some are only accounts of people recounting what they had been told. Some are by people who were in high finance and high government offices, In Management and in Labor. Some were minor government officials. Most were ordinary citizens from all walks of life.There are so many of them the effect is overwhelming.What you will take away is that the \\"Great Depression\\" was not a single homogeneous event. It was vastly different in different places and for different people.Was there hunger?Were there food lines?Was there violence?Were there riots?Just how bad was it?Was the \\"New Deal\\" effective?Did Franklin D Roosevelt's policies make it better? or worse?Did the unions help? Or hurt?Did thousands of people really jump out of windows?Were people killing each other for food?Turns out it depends on who and where you ask.If it happens again, will it be the same?Either way, If you want to be prepared for the future, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"Hard times: An oral history of the great depression","review":"Absolutely fascinating.

I applaud Dr. McDougall's work in, and emphasis on, preventive medicine. He shows a person how to take control of their own health. You don't have to be sick. You don't have to be a victim of genetics or the victim of the pathology-based symptom-treating medical community. I loaned the book to a friend a number of years ago when he was experiencing chest pains and was scheduled for angioplasty. He declined the angioplasty, changed his diet, and has not had chest pains again. He then loaned it to a friend who had had a massive heart attack - his friend changed his lifestyle, too. I wish Dr. McDougall would revise and update the book to include his writings on other health problems that can be treated with a change in lifestyle - e.g., depression and multiple sclerosis."},{"Title":"McDougall's Medicine: A Challenging Second Opinion","review":"This is an extraordinarily good book that explains in detail how the standard American diet causes most of the major chronic diseases that people suffer from today, and also explains what you can do about it. Each chapter focuses on a different disease. Dr. McDougall explains how the standard medical approach treats only the symptoms, but not the causes, of such chronic diseases. He then demonstrates (with extensive references to the scientific literature) how a low-fat diet based primarily on vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes can help to prevent and/or cure these diseases. This book was published in 1986, but it remains both valid and useful today. (Indeed, it seems like every day another scientific study is published demonstrating the importance of eating a mostly plant-based diet.) The only slight drawback is that the book does not give much information about the practical implementation of the eating plan. (For readers interested in such information, I would recommend &quot;The McDougall Plan&quot; and &quot;The McDougall Program: 12 Days to Dynamic Health.&quot;)"},{"Title":"McDougall's Medicine: A Challenging Second Opinion","review":"I reduced my lipids from sky-high to normal by following McDougall's advice. It is comical to see other reviewers trashing the book and claiming that starch makes you fat. It is processed foods devoid of fiber and high in animal content that make fat. I met McDougall in person and the man is thin as a reed. So am I (now).I went to my university library to check McDougall's claim (in 1986) that the story on cholesterol had been known for 20 years already. I checked out a medical research book entitled 'Cholesterol'. All of the information McDougall cited on cholesterol is in that book, written in the 1960's. This is one of the oldest medical stories in the USA and the Atkins fanatics are still trying to start a meat religion. The best conclusion is that Atkins collapsed and died of congestive heart failure while obese and his family covered it up claiming he fell accidentally and then got pumped with fluid in the hospital. No, sorry. The Atkins propaganda machine may be going strong but the diet will kill you."},{"Title":"McDougall's Medicine: A Challenging Second Opinion","review":"Its a 15 year old book.

One of the best things about it is we can now eat as much as we want. It's really just a matter of changing your tastes to like veggies, grains and fruits instead of the high fat flesh products.One of the reasons we changed was because we noticed that even cutting back on the standard american diet is still not good. You really have to change your diet (not a change just to lose weight and then go back, but a true change). Our local school serves french fries four days a week (I know, vegetarian, but it's not good).

The book is broken down into four sections all of which are needed by people at some point in their life.The first section, \\"Redefining Failure and Success\\", helps you reshape your thinking about failure by presenting the real life failures of some of the most influential people in industry today. This section was an \\"eye opener\\" for me, and had I read nothing else in the book, I would have been satisfied with section alone.The second section, \\"Winning Through Losing\\", presents very effective strategies that can be put to use on a daily basis to build winning personal relationships.The third section, \\"Coping with Failure\\", is probably the most important. Failure can be devastating and I have personally seen people that have never recovered from past failures. The emotional strength this chapter provides could be a great comfort to someone who is trying to cope with significant failure in their life.The final section, \\"Collaborating With Failure\\", gives strategies for effectively investing in your future.I feel that this is an important book, especially with the recent down turn in the economy and the significant number of businesses that are experiencing failure. However, this book is not just about business, but about your personal health and well being.You should definitely buy this book."},{"Title":"The Power of Failure: 27 Ways to Turn Life's Setbacks Into Success","review":"Our society teaches us to fear failure. It teaches us that if a project or activity fails then we are a failure. This is a real problem because the only way we don't fail is if we don't try. Moving forward means that failure will happen at times. Instead of teaching that failure is personal in nature we need to redefine failure as part of the learning process. Failure has a purpose. Failure can be used to grow as a person or to redefine and improve a project or plan.&quot;The Power of Failure: 27 Ways to Turn Life's Setbacks into Success&quot; provides a framework for redefining failure and using it to get ahead and improve your life. Failure can be a devastating factor that completely stops a person in their tracks or it can be the tool that they use to become successful. The choice is yours.

Students enjoy the straightforward writing style and messages in the book, and I appreciate the content because I know it is based on solid research that Dr. Manz has done over the years. Self-leadership is about influencing yourself to become the best you can be by utilizing your talents, handling obstacles, and completing hard-to-do tasks that others tend to avoid.However, in &quot;The Power of Failure,&quot; Dr. Manz provides a much needed element missing from his previous books, and that is that sometimes as we take on challenges we will fail. Hard work and focus do not guarantee success in every endeavor. Yet, as Dr. Manz illustrates, the failure can actually be a learning experience and a step toward a future success. He provides both personal stories and examples from historic figures to show us how failure has happened to everyone who has become a success. Much like self leadership, the difference between achievers and non-achievers is how they view and handle the dilemma. Many who believe that successful people have had advantages over others are unaware that high achievers may have failed spectacularly too in their life at different times. However, history reports the achievements, not the failures. Dr. Manz teaches us that everyone has low points in their life at some time. It is how we handle that that determines our future.I am strongly considering adopting this book for my entrepreneurship course next year.

Her books are quick easy reads that have great suspense. I think this one is one of the best. It is so shocking what Lillie has to go through with her family that I found myself getting angry. I also enjoyed the way the author portrayed Lillie's emotions and her feelings toward her family members, especially her daughter. It was very well done. I thought the ending was fine other than the fact that I was so into it that I wanted the story to never end. A great read that most will enjoy!"},{"Title":"No Way Home","review":"I stumbled upon this author at the library one day. Her books are pretty good. Very fast reads! I've already read three of her books in less than a week (and I don't have THAT MUCH free time).Anyway, this book took some turns I didn't expect at first, although it was pretty easy to figure where the story was headed.The book is about a mother whose daughter is killed after a Founder's Day celebration. There are some red herrings as to who the killer is, and a subplot about the girl in love with the son that really just ends. And while it was an enjoyable read in the car on a road trip, my biggest complaint is that her story just ends. Even though you pretty much know what happened, the author doesn't tie up the story and give you the details on how or why. Most thrillers will rehash everything in the end and give you more insight as to what happened and why. MacDonald doesn't, and it bugged me - I like knowing all the details. (Every one of her books I've read has been like this)So, if you're looking for a fast read, with some surprise twists, this may be for you."},{"Title":"No Way Home","review":"This was an excellent book.

He has a very easy writing style which makes for easy reading. The title of the book is what the book is all about. When you are off the beaten path, if you ask for directions, you may get this response or something else even more vague. He talks of people he has met over the years in his travels all over the State of Texas. I enjoyed this book very much and am in the process of finding all of the books he has written (10 I am told). Leon Hale, in my estimation, is one of the best writers. He writes the same as he speaks -- with a lot wit and of down-home sayings. Great reading!!

You don't have to be from Texas to enjoy this book. It's about real people and written in such a way that you feel you've met them before. Love it."},{"Title":"Lessons In Murder","review":"Lessons in Murder is Claire McNab's first novel. Set in a Sydney High School, it revolves around the murder of the son of a prominent politician, who is found in his classroom with a drill embedded in his head. Enter Detective Inspector Carol Ashton, described as a cool blonde with a spectacular career. She is also spectacularly closeted, maintaining a rigid division between her work and personal life that even her partner, Sergeant Mark Bourke, cannot break through. This barrier begins to crumble, however, when she meets Sybil Quade, who is suspiciously linked to the murder victim. As further deaths occur, accompanied by threatening letters and phone calls, Sybil becomes the prime suspect and Carol struggles with her growing attraction toward her. Although entertaining enough, Lessons in Murder, is the source of many irritations. Ashton's introspective self-pity, her romantic pining for Sybil, and Sybil's inability to resist the domineering attentions of Terry Clarke, are annoying distractions from the narrative. The climax is cliched, which is not surprising given that this novel faithfully follows (if not establishes) the conventions of lesbian detective fiction. Murder, an emotionally repressed detective, and romance between the two main characters are all now standard features of this genre. When first published, this novel may have been exciting and unique, but twelve years on, it has been superceded by the work of other authors."},{"Title":"Lessons In Murder","review":"Lessons in Murder is not a perfect book by any means, but it's still one that I really like. I just finished re-reading it.The writing is a little awkward in places with some odd word choices, indicative of McNab being a relatively new author at the time this was written. (I don't mean differences between Australian and American English, which are also present, since I enjoy that aspect.) McNab chose to use third person omniscient POV for the narration and I'm not convinced it worked well for this type of book. Though it does have the advantage of providing multiple points of view throughout the novel.The romance element is fairly strong, on an almost equal footing with the mystery in terms of importance. I like the romance sub-plot a great deal, and yet it's lacking in the emotional immediacy and intimacy that one would expect if this had been a romance novel instead of a mystery. I think some of that is also due to the omniscient POV choice.Lessons in Murder introduces an intriguing and strong protagonist. Detective Inspector Carol Ashton is smart, calm, cool, collected, beautiful, and highly successful at her job. Yet this book only scratches the surface of who she really is, probably because as another reviewer pointed out, there wasn't much room for extensive character development in such a short book which is so tightly focused.What McNab does very well in this book is craft a classic murder mystery. There are several suspects, a lot of people keeping secrets, and a lot of possible motives, some obvious and some hidden. Ashton, and her partner Bourke, painstakingly interview numerous people and put together the evidence from a trail of clues. McNab does a good job of keeping the reader guessing and re-guessing well into the book, and does so in a way that doesn't insult the reader by using gimmicky red herrings or cheap deus ex machina tricks.It's probably worth noting that Lessons in Murder was originally published in 1988 and that context is important in terms of some of the attitudes of the characters and where mystery fiction was at that time, compared to now.I recommend Lessons in Murder as a solid, quick mystery read.KINDLE NOTE: The formatting is very basic, but without any glaring flaws."},{"Title":"Lessons In Murder","review":"First of all, I did enjoy reading this book. Claire McNab's Carol Ashton is a good detective and the mysterious death of a teacher killed by a Black and Decker power drill is a captivating plot. But at the same time I was a little disappointed at what I determined to be a lack of character development for the two main characters: Carol and Sybil. What makes them tick as a human being? What are their fears and ambitions? Maybe this can be attributed to the minimal numbers of pages as more attention was paid to the mystery itself? Who knows. This book(let) is a short one and definately a fast read. Under normal circumstances I don't consider myself to be a fast reader but I finished in two sittings.These flaws won't deter me from reading other books in this series. Actually tonight I'm beginning the second installment and it appears that we get to explore some of Carol's past.

A reporter by trade, Keyhoe traveled with famed aviator Charles Lindbergh after he returned to the USA from his historic 1927 flight across the Atlantic; he wrote a bestselling book about his travels with Lindbergh. He also served in the Marine Corps and rose to the rank of Major. In 1949, in the wake of the first widely-publicized UFO sightings and incidents in the USA, \\"True\\" magazine, a respected publication at the time, hired Keyhoe to write an article about the UFO mystery. After talking with his extensive contacts in the U.S. government and military gained from his years as a reporter and military officer, Keyhoe came to the conclusion that the UFO phenomenon was real, that the \\"flying saucers\\" were alien spaceships exploring the Earth, and that the U.S. government knew this and were covering up the true story to prevent panic. In January 1950 \\"True\\" published Keyhoe's article. Entitled \\"The Flying Saucers Are Real\\", it created a media sensation. UFO historian Curtis Peebles described the article as one of \\"the most widely read and discussed magazine articles up to that time.\\" The fact that someone of Keyhoe's credibility and government contacts had published such an article gave the UFO phenomenon credibility in the minds of many people. In June 1950 Keyhoe expanded the article into a book. Also entitled \\"The Flying Saucers Are Real\\", the book sold over 500,000 copies and helped to establish many of the ideas and beliefs of the modern UFO phenomenon. Among the ideas Keyhoe helped develop were the notion that UFOs were spacecraft from an advanced alien civilization, that the aliens were simply exploring the Earth, and that the U.S. government knew this but was covering up the truth. Keyhoe's insistence that there was a vast government conspiracy regarding UFOs would set a pattern that continues to motivate UFO \\"believers\\" even today. \\"The Flying Saucers Are Real\\" would establish Keyhoe as a leading figure in the UFO phenomenon, and over the next two decades he would be frequently interviewed on television and radio. In 1957 he became the leader of NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena), the largest and most influential civilian UFO research group of the 1950's and 60's. He remained NICAP's leader until 1969.If you are a UFO buff then this book is highly recommended. Keyhoe examines the most prominent UFO cases up to 1950 - the Kenneth Arnold sighting, the Mantell Crash, the Chiles-Whitted UFO sighting, and numerous others - and offers his views on the subject. A number of UFO skeptics, such as Curtis Peebles, have criticized the book for greatly exaggerating the government's interest in UFOs, and for exaggerating the evidence indicating that UFOs were alien spacecraft and not merely hoaxes, misidentifications of natural phenomena, etc. Peebles also criticizes Keyhoe for imagining, fantasizing, and writing about a government conspiracy to cover-up UFO incidents rather than basing his assumptions of a conspiracy on solid facts. However, given the book's importance in the history of UFOs in the United States, it is still well worth reading even today. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"I had a copy of this book when I was young.I wanted to replace it.it's a good read."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"Good solid reporting on a very sensitive subject from the early days of the UFO phenomena."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"This old 1950 book is a classic for the more gullible among us. Written by a retired US Marine corp aviator and writer of pop fiction, it gathered together claims and reports of UFO sightings. The author not only asserted that flying saucers exist, but that the US government knew it and was suppressing the truth about them. (Sharper readers may have wondered why the US government made no effort to suppress Keyhoe himself).The book was highly influential, and gave birth to a mythology that has lasted to the present. It also was just the first of Keyhoe's UFO books, as he made a career of the subject. The Flying Saucers Are Real still has its devotees, and was republished in 2006. The book is also available for free online.To review this book is a trip of reminiscence, since I read an old paperback copy in junior high school when it was exciting (and still possible) to believe in such things. In fact, I took a map of the US and stuck flagged pins in the many locations of such \\"sightings\\". (That was fun!) But there comes a time to put away childish things. Isn't it interesting that UFOs never triggered alarms at a time when US ICBMs and their Soviet equivalents were on hair- trigger alert for any intrusion into national airspace? And that to this day, none of the tens of thousands of satellites orbiting the earth nor any of the countless telescopes trained at the sky have managed to capture any verifiable evidence? By now, we must believe in a massive conspiracy involving most nations on earth -- countries that can agree on nothing else, even anthropogenic climate change. :-)The cover on my copy is the original 1950s one. I used to wonder what the stuff coming out of the saucers was. Electron beams? psychic energy? emissions from a 1950s - style combustion engine?"},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"This, Donald Keyhoe's first book originally published in 1950, was written whilst he was still a serving officer in the US Marine Corps (with the rank of Major) and had an office inside The Pentagon.Keyhoe had access to original UFO sighting reports from military pilots in the late 1940s when the whole issue was more open and before the information clampdown became really effective. His conclusion that the UFOs represented some non-human and probably interplanetary technology was sound and reasoned against the weight and nature of the evidence - though interestingly in 1950, Venus and Mars were thought to be the likely source of visitation, as the current level of understanding of physics was simply insufficient to support the idea of interstellar (let alone \\"inter-dimensional\\") travel. The book contains a large number of meticulously documented and really astounding sighting and contact reports, mainly from aircraft crews both civil and military. The writing style is straightforward and sticks to the facts, and yet at the same time racy and interesting.Keyhoe was one of the greatest researchers in the history of the UFO phenomenon, and a tireless and persistent campaigner for the Air Force and the early INTELS to be more open with the public about the subject. This book deserves the accolade of a true classic, an over-used word which in this particular case is fully justified."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"Don's book is one of the best on the subject of flying saucers.

I could see why the author reached the conclusion that the government is slowly trying to prepare the public, but since the book IS older, and the government is STILL trying to down-play UFOs, I don't think the opinion holds water. I also disagree with the author's conclusion about the aliens: yes, they're WAY advanced compared to us, and yes, they're worried now that we have space travel and weapons of mass destruction: but it just BECAUSE of those two factors that they are now inter-acting more & more with us; they now have a larger agenda than previously. The author also does not mention any OLDER evidence of UFOs, like the cave paintings, the Nazca lines, or the many paintings (even of religious subjects) which include UFOs."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"While I won't go so far as to say I'm a true believer, I am willing to accept the possibility they are real."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"It looks like this book was printed by cutting and pasting an electronic text into a book printing machine without proofreading it first.

The author demonstrates none of the hysteria that characterizes so much of this genre. In addition to being informative, the book is a great read, more like a novel than a work of non-fiction. However, one never gets the sense that Kehoe is embellishing for effect. This is solid reporting. One element of the story that the book does not cover (as it emerged later) is the wide range in sizes these objects manifest, and their extremely varied form factors. Some, evidently, can take on the appearance of biological organisms, even quite small ones. For instance, I have seen such UFOs in my apartment, usually in the kitchen, and they look exactly like houseflies. After many years of observation, I have noted that these UFOs, for some reason unknown to me, return to their home galaxy in the Winter months, only to return in the Spring. Nowhere have I found a credible explanation for this in the extensive literature on the subject of unidentified flying objects."},{"Title":"The Flying Saucers Are Real","review":"I found this book unsatisfactorily casual and slap-happy for the work of putative been-there-done-that expert with such lengthy tenure in and around things ufological. Yet, by reading this, I did manage to concretize a philosophical system that has been emerging for years as I read one UFO book after another--while also reading widely in other things paranormal, as well as a spate of less abstract fields, such as history, science, linguistics, anthropology, and such. Let us posit that aliens (1) exist; (2) have the technology to visit remote star systems; and (3) took greatly enhanced interest in earth only when it developed weapons systems capable of either harming other civilizations (i.e., in combination with its rocket technology) or of destroying itself (which would constitute a crying shame from the viewpoint of fundamentally beneficent aliens who respect other sentient life forms). Keyhoe leads me to believe--amid his conspiratorial musings and his subtle hints at what was meant by what was really meant by what Mr. X thought that Mr. Y intended--that they are watching us and executing a hands-off policy until such time that we pose a direct, immediate danger to ourselves (this will occur long before we pose a direct and immediate danger to exocivilizations), at which time--Starfleet-style \\"Prime Directives\\" od non-interference notwithstanding--they will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the harmonious continuation of our culture. Whether that means utterly conquering and enslaving us, or surreptitiously seizing control over certain key organs of our governments (possibly to include forging certain elements of the whole-earth government whose existence Einstein endorsed as a logical and necessary eventuality), or just providing cultural \\"guidance counselors,\\" who can really say. It is indeed food for thought to ponder the likely--well, the possible--archetypal alien ethos and surmise what it might intend for us and why it should, or will, occur when the time requires it."},{"Title":"Soncino Books of the Bible","review":"Soncino's complete OT commentary contains valuable information with respect to the theology of the OT and related customs, practices,etc. Judaism is the point of view; of course Christian readers may take exception to some of the conclusions offered by the editors.

Congress has made available some of rachell's hard to fine post-war recordings on his Random Chance label as well as put together Rachell's oral history. The first 100 or so pages are devoted to Rachell's recollections and if some parts are sketchy, its because Rachell's death prevented Congress from fleshing out more details. Rachell's association with John Estes and others in the neglected Jackson, Tennessee music scene is discussed as is his life as a travelling musician, as well as his pursuits of daytime employment unlike others he played with. He recounts playing in St. Louis and then recording, Big Joe Williams and John Lee &quot;Sonny Boy Williamson&quot; and his early recordings as well as moving up to Indianopolis for the last years of his life. The oral history is supplemented by Rich Delgrosso's discussion of Yank's mandolin style, David Evans' distillation of Yank's guitar playing and recollections of those who came under Yank's spell including Henry Townsend and Charlie Musselwhite. A full discography of Yank's recordings, both as a leader and an accompanist is provided. In summary, this is a very nicely put together volume that provides us with a window into a slice of the blues past often neglected."},{"Title":"Blues Mandolin Man: The Life and Music of Yank Rachell (American Made Music)","review":"The glory of this book is that it is Yank Rachel's story, told in Yank Rachel's words, Yank Rachel's way. The absences and differences from what those with a check list for Blues biographies desire in a biography speak to what Yank wanted, Yank thought, and to his age when interviews.For example, he answers questions about learning the mandolina nd the guitar similar to what other Bluesicians of his generation answer, because these instruments were all around at the turn of the century and early 20th Century when Rachel was growing up in the music. People learned not from lessons, but from hearing players and trying to match their styles. There was much to hear in the Delta and its environs where Rachel grew up.Rachel is quite important to me because rather than being a solo blues guitarist as the stereotype of a blues singer is, Rachel usually played in small bands and trios, usually with a guitarist and a jug player, but often with bassists and other instruments. Such bands were a really important part of the early Blues although they tend to be neglected by white folkie-Blues fans who fantasize about the solo guitarist. Actually, many of the solo guitarists like Robert Johnson, usually travelled with a partner and played a lot with another guitarist or a mandolin or bass or fiddle player or all three.This is because the main venue for making money for bluesicians was playing for dancers at Juke Joints, at country suppers, and in bars and tavern. Dancers needed more support than a guitar could give, particularly in larger venues.In Handy's autobiography, he mentions one night his Ragtime band of 9 pieces played a dance in Cleveland, Mississippi sometime in the early 1900s. When Handy's band wanted to take a break, the crowd asked if a local band of a guitar, mandolin, and bass could play a few tunes in the intermission. Handy reports the thrills these three scruffy blues players gave the audience and how they motivated the dancers. Hand who is always concerned about commerce first, second, and third, notes that the crowd gave this trio more in tips, than he was charging for his entire band! He says this was one of his main reasons for adopting the Blues for his orchestras and band (Handy was as much of a booking agent with a number of bands travelling throughout the South as he was a bandleader in these years.).What Yank tells us is that Handy turned the tables on this kind of arrangement. Not only did he move his orchestra to play Blues tunes, or at least ragtime tunes tinged with the Blues, but he hired little Blues bands like the one Yank played in to play intermissions for his band.Well, if Handy learned from folks like Yank, we should be grateful that this book allows us to learn from Yank."},{"Title":"Blues Mandolin Man: The Life and Music of Yank Rachell (American Made Music)","review":"This book is for anyone who's not sure what the definition of a Blues-man is. For those not familiar with Yank Rachell, but have seen the original Blues Brothers movie you will have heard his \\"I Caught The Katy\\" The book isn't full of fluff and theory and should be required reading in any college level music course for those who want to make it in the music business. Once you've read the book you'll understand why he was such an influence on Sonny Boy Williamson, B.B. King, Allen Stratyner, John Sebastian and Charlie Musselwhite."},{"Title":"Blues Mandolin Man: The Life and Music of Yank Rachell (American Made Music)","review":"This book was pretty dissappointing. The author did virtually nothing except turn on a tape recorder and let Yank speak, and then transcribe his monolog. The publisher did nothing excpect slap the pages betweeen a softcover wrapper.The author provided no or very little historical context of the subject or the music; if it's there, then it is so short and shallow that I missed it. The only discussion of other musians and music is what Yank provides.For example, there is virtually no real description of how this son-of-a-share-cropper learned to play mandolin or develop his style (heavy tremolo) of music. All Yank said is that he got hold of a mandolin and started fooling around with it. This is the sort of basic information that should have been explored in fuller detail.On the other hand, maybe I was just looking for something else. Perhaps, if you're into studying Southern culture, you'll find this book useful. But even then, you'd better come with some knowledge of the culture of rural West Tennessee in the first half of the 20th century or you'll miss out on a lot of what Yank is describing. Again, the author could have provided supplemental detail and context."},{"Title":"Blues Mandolin Man: The Life and Music of Yank Rachell (American Made Music)","review":"Richard Congress' Blues Mandolin Man provides a biography of the life and music of Yank Rachell, a 1960s blues mandolin performer.

I say &quot;accidental&quot; because I saw &quot;9 types of lovers&quot; and jumped to the incorrect conclusion that this was an enneagram book. Whereas this certainly IS a personality type book, it has nothing to do with the enneagram.Daphne Rose Kingma is a practicing psychoanalyst and also a prolific writer who specializes in love and relationships. This book draws on her 25+ years of experience in counseling couples and individuals, during which time she has concluded that people tend to fit into nine basic &quot;love types,&quot; each with their own characteristics and idiosyncracies.The majority of the book is dedicated to Kingma's detailed descriptions of each of the nine types of lovers. Each chapter starts with a section on how to identify a type; then covers the various &quot;attraction&quot; and &quot;detraction&quot; characteristics of that type. Next, we're offered a fairly thorough psychological explanation for how a person's history makes them fit into their type, identifying the specific &quot;emotional wound&quot; that affects their behavior pattern. I found these to be the most insightful and poignant parts of the book, with some very &quot;on the money&quot; ideas. Finally, each chapter has a section directed to the person actually of that type, with suggestions on how to better understand and manage their relationships.The book is fun and easy to read, and mostly works as a tool to identify and understand each of the nine types. It does outline some very basic truths about How We Are, and I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be a good resource for someone stuck in a pattern of choosing the same kind of (unsuccessful) relationship, over and over. On the downside, I feel that very little time is given to the more practical aspects of how each type interacts with other types, &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; combinations, the realities of finding the right type for you, and so on. And although Kingma uses a fairly upbeat tone, I did come away with the feeling that the popular psycho-buzz phrase &quot;everyone is damaged&quot; must *really* be true-- at least based on this book.Final thoughts: Recommended, although not brilliant (7.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10). Does a nice job of teaching us about the different types, but is a little thin on how to APPLY that knowledge. As with most books of this genre, I'll also add the usual caveat that we shouldn't put TOO much emphasis on trying to &quot;shoehorn&quot; ourselves into specific &quot;type&quot; descriptions-- we ARE, after all, individuals."},{"Title":"The 9 Types of Lovers: Why We Love the People We Do and How They Make Us Crazy","review":"I don't normally like books like this because I don't believe that you can truly seperate people into categories. Only 9 types for all the plethora of diversity in the world? And yet, when I picked up this book I could put it down. The author has captured some basic truths about people in America, how we act and why. If you're the type of person that seems to attract the same kind of mate over and over, this book will probably attract your interest.Each lover type has its own chapter with standardized sections, so that no matter what type of lover you have or want, you can find out the information you need. The author gives us tell-tale signs for each type and yet provides us pretty convincing ways in which each type is different than everyone else (in case you aren't sure). There is a section on why we are attracted to that type, and why they drive us crazy, what's really going on psychologically, with a special emotional wound identified for each person. What we can learn from each type and what they need to improve on in themselves. Basically, all the secret questions we've ever asked ourselves about past lovers and maybe even family and friends are answered here.I do have a few complaints, though. The catch phrase on the back of the book, &quot;How to find the perfect lover... and keep them!&quot;, isn't sufficiently addressed (after reading the book, you won't think there is a &quot;perfect&quot; type out there). Only a small chapter discusses how different types deal with each other, and we don't learn the specific mechanics of how people attract the same type over and over, or how to break that cycle. Also, the book doesn't discuss how people tend to flex between types, and often act as a certain type with friends and are a different type with a lover. Finally, even though the author tries to write this book from an asexual point of view, as a man I found it to be specifically written for women. Nothing wrong with that, except that it reduced the book's effectiveness for me."},{"Title":"The 9 Types of Lovers: Why We Love the People We Do and How They Make Us Crazy","review":"Any book with a number on the title usually connotes to me a book with a catchy marketing hook but little content. This one does have the catchy marketing hook, but the content is spot on. I found a great description of myself and my wife. I was able to classify many others as well.I don't think this book should be confined to examining lovers, but applied rather to all people who we meet and seek to understand.There are other books and systems that classify according to personality, but this one is different, as the author knows not just externalities, i.e. is he pushy, is she maudlin. The author, being a counselor, knows what deep down is actually driving these personality types. I prefer her system to Meyers-Briggs and the others.It seems to me that all people have one real story in life, a central theme, and different manifestations keep playing variations on this central theme. The way we interact with others, with crowds, and especially lovers is based upon the central theme of our lives, which, of course, is from the first 5 or 6 years of our life.So, if you are a pushy control type personality, there is a reason for this. She explains it. She also explains what these different personality types really crave. It is useful to us, so we can really know how to give others in our lives what they need.The book is great. It is a quick read, you won't probably read it in order, rather, you might read it in order of the personality types that intrigue you.I found the book to be a great addition to my library, and I have already recommended it to others."},{"Title":"The 9 Types of Lovers: Why We Love the People We Do and How They Make Us Crazy","review":"Having trouble in your relationship? THIS book is the REASON why, not the solution. Kingma tells you things about people that you probably already knew and nothing that you couldn't figure out on your own. In addition, she further muddles things up by blaming everything on circumstances you can't control.First, the 9 types of \\"lovers\\" (the word is too strong; this book is about 9 types of people, not lovers specifically, or even romantic partners) overlap and fail to cover all types of people. Second, the 9 personalities are all viewed in a negative way. Besides a short paragraph on \\"why we love attention seekers,\\" the author focuses on all their flaws. Additionally, while she gives her (completely skewed) opinion on why people fall into this personality, she gives no advice on LIVING with someone who is like this. If you're in a relationship with someone and know them well enough, chances are, you already understand who they are and why they're that way; what you really need to know is how to keep from biting their head off.What really bugged me is how she attributed EVERY personality type: it was your parents' fault. Probably, they never gave you enough attention. You never felt good enough. Or maybe, they were TOO concerned with your life. One or the other. Or maybe you had both, one in each parent. Or possibly your parents had this problem, too? Seriously, she attributes EVERY SINGLE personality type to parents. She plants a seed in the mind that should never be there: \\"Maybe it was all Dad's fault!\\" Look, life is life. Some people have bad childhoods. But you can overcome it. The problems you have now are quite possibly problems that you developed on your own, not because Mom was a drug addict who forgot to feed you. (Again, seriously.) Not only is this very stunting growth-wise, it's a psychological downward spiral that leads to the inability to accept that what YOU do in life makes a difference. After all, you'll never get away from what Dad did that one time...Kingma so often gives examples of \\"my friend Dave,\\" or \\"a woman I know, Holly,\\" that I wondered if she was just making them up. I know she's a therapist, but I find it very hard to believe that she's found so many people who fit EXACTLY into her nine types of people, especially considering I could only think of a handful of acquaintances who didn't fall into the square-peg-round-hole category.The entire book is written in an utterly pessimistic, rote, and, to be blunt, boring light; the nine types of lovers are not one of them people I would like to spend any kind of time with. I've been in several good, steady relationships and have never experienced anything like what apparently the rest of the world is going through. Each section is written in exactly the same formulaic way. It got to the point where I could predict what Kingma was going to say next, from the very point at which she'd drop a story about someone she knew, to the moment she'd say \\"It's probably because your Mommy didn't have very good self-esteem.\\"Finally, in the only part of the book in which she actually gives advice about ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS, the section reads much like a bad horoscope column. \\"Controllers like People Pleasers; an Attention Seeker will NEVER be with a Workaholic.\\"In attempting to write a self-help book, Kingma has completely overlooked several facts:1. Many parents are amazing people and never abandoned or emotionally hurt their children.2. People do not fall neatly into categories.3. Personality is not a flaw that you must fix in yourself.I do not recommend this book to anyone, least of all someone who is having problems understanding WHY they have problems in relationships. The entire book is depressing and incredibly narrow-minded. Please, if you absolutely cannot live without reading it, check it out from the library. Don't spend your money on this abomination of a \\"help\\" book. I beg of you."},{"Title":"Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look to Now","review":"This book has both beautiful photographs and informative text. The only reason I took off one star is that I think more photographs from each designer should have been included. I especially would have liked to have seen a few more photos of clothes from American designers from the 1990s. Throughout the book, the author mostly displays clothes made by European designers. I would not have expected much attention to be focused upon American designers before 1980s or 1990s. Arguably, it was not until the 1990s that American fashion really started to influence Europe, instead of the other way around. Because this reversal of influence was such a change, I would have expected more attention to be paid to it visually. Therefore, the lack of representation in this era makes me think that American designers were somewhat shortchanged in this book. However, I agree that all the designers selected, both European and American, did heavily influence their own time periods.This book covers Post War 1940s through 1990s. In each era the author focused on a few key designers. The author chose Balenciaga, Balmain, and Dior to represent the 1940s and 1950s. The author primarily showcased Correges, Yves Saint Laurent, and Quant to represent the 1960s. Halston and Yves Saint Laurent were the focus of the 1970s era. More designers are represented in the 1980s. The book has one or two photos from Chanel, Lacroix, Blass, Herrera, Azzedine Alaia, Armani, Gaultier, Comme des Garcon, and Issey Miyake, among a few others. The 1990s are represented by a photo or two of designs from Versace, Anna Sui, Chanel, Tom Ford for Gucci, Galliano, Donna Karen, Westwood, Calvin Klein, and Prada.Just as it is the maxim for fashion in general, so is it for this book in particular...less is more. The photos in this book capture the essence of each era and the text details the stylistic atmosphere to which each designer contributed. I highly reccommend this book. Despite having access to it at the library, I plan on buying it."},{"Title":"Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look to Now","review":"This book takes us from decade to decade from the 50's to now with an examination of social, cultural, economic, and historical factors both setting the backdrop to and influencing changing fashions. This is an intermediate book in fashion, if you compare it to picture-only books to the other end of the spectrum where text dominates (often no pictures), and we see a treatise on aesthetic theory, anthropological roots, feminist writings, and studies on human sexuality and psychology.This book is a very light introduction to the type of questions you see in more advanced texts, but will not alienate the dilettante fashionista or costumer. The pictures provide exemplary examples of the styles discussed, and the chapters summarize everything quickly enough to have a solid overview of our recent fashion history. Again, I am sure this book will gain lots of interest, whether for browsing or seriously perusing an interest in a compelling aspect of human history and society. Check Steele's other books as well--she writes with insight, but doesn't overdo it with the dry academic stuff; she also has excellent taste with her picture selection."},{"Title":"Clean: Reflections of the Other (1992-2006)","review":"Clean: Reflections of the Other is not your mother's book of poetry.

The book reviewed here was one of the latter.By all accounts, Bemelmans had a very \\"eventful\\" life. He claimed that (at least his books for adults) were based on actual events he encountered. Well, maybe he exaggerated a little considering the current book.In this book, Bemelmans narrates a story about some adventures in travel with a certain Count de St. Cucuface.

The ever faithful servant of the Dr. Frankenstein: &quot;Yes, Master. Yes Master.&quot; Well, the reader gets the disturbing, yet comical, feeling that Mike Wilson is playing the literary Igor to the real-life success story of software mogul Larry Ellison.From the title onward, the disjunctive narrative is generously sprinkled with Wilson's &quot;Yes, Master. Yes, Master.&quot; rationalizations and cooing adorations of Ellison. Be it Ellison's incessant prevarications and half-truths or be it Ellison's extravagant lifestyle, Wilson cannot even pretend to be objective about his subject.This Igor-like devotion to Mr. Ellison, strains the credibility of the writer and the sensibilities of the reader if taken seriously. It should be obvious to Mr. Wilson, that the story of how Ellision made his billions in the software industry is one which worthy of being reported and one which people would want to read.However, if the reader can suspend his/her annoyance at the predictably unctious and serflike writing style, the tale of Larry Ellison and Oracle's rise is one which unfolds with the all classical ingredients of the business start-up tale. There was the complementary business partnership between Ellison's marketing wizardry and Bob Miner's technical genius. There was the bit of luck that the entrepreneurs were able to bring IBM's own relational database research to market before IBM and parlay that into lucrative government sales. There were the problems with hyper growth and consequent setbacks, as well as Oracle's resilient comeback from apparent failure.All in all, the subject matter manages to carry this software success story despite the narrator. Just a suggestion Mr. Ellison. The next time you commission an authorized biography about yourself, leave Igor behind. Check if Wallace and Erickson are available."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Although Mike Wilson claims to have researched his book thoroughly, with voluminous references, he seems to have missed a significant reason for the early success of Oracle Corporation. Long before there was much mention in the daily press of the rise of the global market, Oracle WAS a global company. The first steps by Bob Preger to encourage international customers and the leadership of John Luongo in diversifying Oracle sales to incorporate subsidiaries and distributors in every inhabited continent very early made Oracle a multinational corporation. Much of the drama was not only in the rise and fall of Gary Kennedy, but equally as significant was the establishment of the first overseas subsidiary, Oracle Europe, by Bo Ryden and Bryan Cassidy, and eventually the rise and fall of Geoff Squire and John Luongo. None of these important people receive more than a passing and even insulting mention.For an author who claims accuracy he seems to be as fast and loose with past truth as Kitty Kelley. This book may be full of amusing tales, but he is not closer to any truth about Oracle or Larry Ellison as his hit and miss sources."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"This book could have perfect at 100 pages. Instead the book goes on and on about how bad, delusional, self-centered and lying Larry Ellison is. It also belabores how decadent and immoral are Oracle's marketing and sales people.The book does not really paint a picture of how Oracle became successful. The time line is blurred, instead, we get repetetive stories ripped out of different periods in Oracle's history.The explanations of database industry and technology sector overall are weak.Perhaps if the book was shorter, I would not be as negative, but as it stands at 350 pages, I can not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"This is a great read. I have been fortunate enough to work for two of the largest Computer companies in the world, one of which was Oracle, although from a unique position ( ie : working for a partner, but with a desk inside Oracle ).This book gave me a good insight into the culture of Oracle, and the reason why...Larry. Its a great read, that if true, surely makes Larry one of the most interesting, and ego driven CEOs of a big valley firm.If your interested in Silicon Valley, and the Software/Computer industry, this book is worth a read. I have read a few books on similar companies, and this one I found the hardest to put down."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"What became apparent about Ellison was a self-confidence that is unparalleled in the annals of Fortune 500 CEOs. When he has failed, he has an innate ability to block it out and move on with just as much enthusiasm. Some of his visions, such as the Network Computer, were, in concept, slightly premature for 1995. But today with centralized computing and web-based software, his vision is suddenly making sense. From this book, I'd have to say Ellison has one of the more arrogant yet appealing personalities I've come across...a very compelling blend."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I purchased this book to read for part of my research for a paper I wrote on the entrepreneurial success of Larry Ellison. It was by far the most informative and fun to read of all the articles and books I read on his life. I wish it dedicated more space to his childhood, but was still very satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Great book to learn the early and tumultous history of Oracle and Larry... now, he is a REAL visionnary, not like the marketeers in Seattle... the book is worth a read for anyone in the IT industry, although some inaccuracies exist... a definite 4 star"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I have always been fascinated by Steve Jobs, and little did I know that he and Ellison were best friends. As the past president of my fraternity, I find their leadership styles and personality a lot like my own, which I find very scary at times. Ellisons aggresiveness, attitudes, etc. I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in Ellison not only read this book but read the July issue of Icon Magazine. It contains some good quotes from Ellison and others that know him. Mike Wilson he does a great job of making the book as interesting as possible. I am a computer geek, and admit that understanding computer life can be a bit dry if you are not a propeller head. I do agree with what someone said about Larry in an interview with Icon. He will definetly grow old lonely with that life style of his. Ellison will never accept anyone until he accepts himself. This book is well worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"The reviews above pretty much say it all; I can't really add much to it. Mr. Ellison is indeed quite the character; making the story of Oracle's rise interesting to read.After reading the book; it's amazing that see that Oracle is the company it is today. Looks like Microsoft isn't the only less than ideal software company..."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"After reading this book i find some realities and competition existing between giant corporations.Mike wilson's view of ellison is trueof a dynamic and powerful corporate leader.ellison as has always been quoted by many other author's as a arrogant,and powerhungry which has been nicely represented in this book"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Like many other people who used to work for Oracle (albeit many layers removed from Ellison), I found this book fascinating. I can attest that the depiction of Oracle's corporate culture is accurate. I enjoyed the book more as a history of Oracle the company rather than Larry the man, although the two are inseparable."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"This book has repercussions beyond the Rise-and-Fall-and-Rise story of Oracle. The portrait of Ellison rings especially true for those of us who work in high-tech: reading it, I realized how many other, albeit less successful, Larry Ellisons are out there. A fascinating account of the Machiavellian mind at work, this book should be required reading for everyone on his/her way up the corporate ladder."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I seldom read any books but this one.This is the book for which I can read like a movie.The author describes how Ellison uses talented people to built his Empire, and dump them cruelly when they are no longer making contributions, or not meeting his expectations. There are three things Ellison cared the most during the early years of Oracle:1. Making Deals2. Making Deals3. Making Deals"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I absoultly loved this book. I am currently recieving my MBA, and it gave me a whole new perspective about how busniess can be, how it can suceed, and fail. Also, Ellisons sotry is realy fabulous, and the author does a great job of interviewing many of Ellison's ex-wives, ex-employyes etc. This gives a very realistic viw of Oracle, and how they felt about Ellison. I started ths book this morning, and I simply could not put it down until an hour ago when i finished it. Great Read!"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"While Larry proclaims himself a &quot;VISIONARY&quot;, I found this book to neaty describe how a self made man determined to climb his way up to the top by 30% software and 70% lies and decit. However, upon finishing the book I found myself putting Larry Elison in my &quot;hero's&quot; list of what to be and not to be if I ever became a CEO of a high tech company. A fast pace and fun book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Reading this book, it becomes startlingly clear that Larry Ellison is extremely similar to Bill Gates - neither billionaire is particularly visionary, but both were able to find the right product at the right time, then succeeded in marketing the hell out of it. Assuming the accounts of Oracle's sales techniques are true, it seems rather ironic that Ellison is constantly sniping at Gates for tactics such as preannouncing 'vaporware' and releasing bug-filled software - Wilson's account gives the impression that Ellison pioneered them! But ultimately, while he is far from likeable, you can't help but feel a gruding respect for the way Ellison appears to have bent reality into the shape of his own ambitions. It helps that even the people he has harmed seem to forgive him - clearly, the man is a charming rogue. Unfortunately, this book was released just before Oracle's most recent setbacks - perhaps a sequel is in the offing?"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I noticed that a previous reviewer gave a low score based on disagreements with some of the book's recounting of Oracle's growth. I can't really comment on that, but the book really did seem to give a pretty thorough portrayal on the intriguing figure that is Larry Ellsion, especially during his earlier years. Larry Ellsion did agree to a few interviews for the book, which I think gives it added credibility. One funny thing happened soon after I finished the book. I just read an Oracle press release after a disappointing quarter, and was struck by a wierd feeling reading statements by Larry and others, that I really knew these people, even though I had only read about them."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Mr. Wilson's biography of Larry Ellison (and Oracle) is truthful, direct, and sufficiently detailed to give a clear picture of not only the life and times of Mr. Ellison but also provides an enlighting overview of the nature of start-up to major corporation and the trials and travails of achieving success. In describing Larry Ellison, the word &quot;unembarassable&quot; is used and is apparently precise. Therefore, bravo to Mr. Ellison for the courage to bear all his achievements and life lessons to the world. Bravo to Mr. Wilson for remaining honest to the purpose of the story given the presumably formidable character Mr. Ellison seems capable of."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Why smoke tons of illicit substances for a script, when all the plots you need is in this book? This book has great entertainment value (please order it directly from Amazon :-), and really deserves massive attention like Oracle's equity market performance last year. In the past people filmed Wall Street stories, leading to trader-wannabees religiously citing Gordon Gekko's lines. With the exuberance of New Economy, why not make a movie based on this book? This will make Mike Wilson happy, will give Larry another achievement in life after Oprah :-), will give Hollywood a new idea to monetize, and will give the world a more vivid portrait of the difference between God and Larry Ellison. Financing the film should be no problem for Larry, he might want to think who he wants to cast as himself. I'd like to audition the Adelyn part ..."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Okay, so who is this guy Larry Ellison? He's the man behind Oracle, one of the world's largest software companies. Not only is he known for his \\"battles\\" with Bill Gates of Microsoft, but also for his personal and professional exploits.Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this biography, I felt it was lacking something. I'm not sure what exactly, but I walked away feeling Ellison to be some sort of a lone egomaniac, using everyone and everything around him to further grow Oracle - and by extension, him - into even greater success.Not that there is little biographic value, because there is. His childhood is chronicled, how he left behind his humble beginnings and attained greatness. Had it been any other person, they would perhaps have been forever relegated to a life of poverty, misery, etc. But Ellison overcame that and became a billionaire. So if anything, it is a story of triumph, both in his own life - though admittedly filled with tragedies of divorce, etc. - and in Oracle's.I would suggest that you read it, but don't make it the sole biography. There are at least a couple of others, one even with commentary by Ellison. Check them out! :)"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Fun book for one who's been on the ride, like me. I don't know if anyone who wasn't an employee, a business partner or competitor to be able to relate to much in the book, though."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Its a fun book read but without much substance, you get to know how crazy things used(are) at Oracle.

I admire the way mike wilsonportrays larry so candidly and shows thatruthlessness and agressiveness are what larryleveraged to success.this book is compelling and chilling. lawrence josephellison's ride to the top was not as easy like william gatesbut he showed exemplary management skills and devoted his lifeto Oracle and its growtha must read for anyone who likes sheer brillianceand visionLarry portrays no emotions at all known to man except greedand the desire to win at by making others fail.Lawrence Ellisonshows that even a second generation immigrant can reach thehighest levels of power in corporate america by sheer effort and visionBusiness schools should make a case study of larry and his success story and this book is a good study into winning at any costIf Larry were in Microsoft,it would be 10 times larger than what it isThe book also portrays the intense hatred larry has for williamgates,simply because gates didn't think larry was important enough. Gates bashing is also part of Larry's styleAll in all I became a great fan of larry after reading this book.But then again I am a fan of any book or movie that portrays the intense burning desire of man to succeed at any cost"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I just sold my copy. Found the book a little boring. I bought it since I have met Larry awhile back. But mid-way in the book I got the feeling that his values are just so incongruent with mine that I didn't feel it necessary to finish the book. The jury is out whether Oracle succeeded because of him or despite him."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Besides that fact that God doesn't think He is Larry, I don't think I learned anything... Just kidding.The author did an exceptional but often subtle analysis of Larry 's character and personality (and some of the important people who helped him got to where he is). It really doesn't matter what happened or how it happened but how it evolves around Larry. It's almost amazing how such disorganized company ended up as the second largest software company.If one examines carefully, Larry by no means is an evil person, or even a bad person. He is basically an agressive businessman geek-at-heart. If money is all he cared about, why doesn't he choose to become a drug dealer after dropping out college? He is smart and worked hard for Oracle's (his) success. Like the author said, there are thousands of people who read the original SQL paper from IBM but few act upon it. Sure maybe Larry's company didn't invent SQL database, but IBM didn't hand him $6 billion either. (Of course, also remember those people who contributed significantly to the making of Oracle).It is often too easy to judge extremely succesful and wealthy people like Larry or Steve Jobs with a one-dimension measurement - net worth. Unlike most of the &quot;others&quot;, these people (so-called early &quot;geeks&quot;) made their money the right way, and they worked hard for it. They all had a relatively rough childhood, they took the risk to interrupt their &quot;formal&quot; education to pursue their dreams, one has to give them the credit for achieving so much. If one reads this book with an open mind and not too much judgemental mentality, there is a surprising amount of treasure."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"That observation, made by a friend many years ago, kept running through my mind as I read this well-researched and written, yet tedious, biography of Larry Ellison. An egotistical liar who thinks nothing of stabbing his most loyal followers (he has no friends) in the back, Mr. Ellison incessantly whines about how lonely and misunderstood he is. Poor baby. As the famous Chinese curse goes, \\"May all your wishes come true.\\"Although Mike Wilson apparently likes and admires Larry, he fails to make his case. The man has no redeeming virtue. The book suffers as a result, the reader being left emotionally drained and disgusted. As Sophocles observed 2500 years ago, \\"I would rather fail honorably than win by cheating.\\" Larry would rather win by cheating.Since Larry is a member of the Vietnam Generation (he turned 21 in 1965), I had hoped that the author would include some discussion of his attitude towards the military, particularly in light of the fact that Larry recently purchased a jet fighter in which he stages mock dogfights over the Pacific Ocean. If he's so macho, why did he take a pass on the real thing?"},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"It's really a funny book to me when I try to learn more about this Silicon Valley outspoken playboy. I am always amazed by its vision and its confidence and that's one of the main reason he can build up a 6 billion powerhouse.

Larry Ellison's personality comes out in this book. He is a fun, flamboyant, in-your-face billionaire who knows how to enjoy the money he makes. Big houses, sharp clothes, fast cars, and hot women!

It kept my attention long enough to dedicate 2 days to reading it cover to cover. As an Oracle programmer, it helped me understand some of the thoughts I had of the company since working with their product since the early 90's.The author tried the address the book as a novel, skipping around in time and making it difficult to follow. You go from 1977 to 1989 to 1991 to 1984 to 1996 to ... (you get what I mean). Confusing.This is the type of book that needed to be more linear in timeline or overlapping in timeline, but not arranged the way it was. Still, very enjoyable and worth the read for those that enjoy the behind the scenes action that shaped technology as we know it today."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Yes, I liked it. As an Oracle UK employee it filled in information on many of the myths that float around the company. It would make good reading for anyone who would like to get an insight into what drives Larry and how he views himself (and wants others to view him as well).The book is well written but compared to other biographies that I have read, does not capture and hold the reader. I found some of the chapters very hard going (particularly the discussions of in depth finance) but others held my attention well.The book is worth reading merely for the information that it contains from realtives, friends and even interviews with Larry."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I found out about this book in an Oracle training class two years ago but put off reading it until now. THIS BOOK KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF! The most fascinating thing about this story was that I had witnessed almost all the book's events in my own experiences working for other high-tech startup companies here in the Denver area. I was constantly saying to myself, as I read, &quot;That's exactly what happened when I was working at (fill in the blank) Inc!&quot;. The same personalities (some even worse), the same marketing pressures, the same technical problems, the same product support problems, the same legal problems, the same IPOs, and some of the same rewards (but I didn't receive as many stock options ;^).I would HIGHLY recommend this book to any (technical) person who is considering working for a high-tech startup for the first time. This is the greatest and most accurate tale (at least in my experience) that is available of day-to-day life in a startup company. Some of the stuff that happens at these types of companies is SO WEIRD that you usually have to see it for yourself to believe it. This book gives a VERY GOOD look at &quot;the weird stuff&quot;."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"A fascinating read, but I was quite surprised to find no discussion of Attention Deficit Disorder in this book. Much of Mr. Ellison's behavior is quite 'understandable' assuming he 'suffers from' / 'is blessed with' ADD. Read 'Driven to Distraction' along with this book and see if you agree."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I really can't add to the professional reviews; they're right on target. I will say that Ellison is a piece of work...brash, creative, flawed- and in the end quite fascinating. Machiavelli and Hugh Hefner come to life in the high flying world of the silicon wars. Great read...inspirational in showing what you can do with guts and determination. I really liked it and recommend it."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Having worked for Oracle as a technical support rep, back when there were only five of us in the US and seven worldwide (we kept our support database on paper because the database was too slow and prone to corruption!), I too recommend book.&quot;The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison&quot; is a 'must-read' for anyone considering buying a relational database management system, working in the industry, or for anyone who is simply wants to mercilessly crush their competition with mediocre products and high pressure sales tactics. Larry Ellison makes Machievelli look like Saint Francis. However, like Ghengis Khan, you have to admire his accomplishments."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I always recommend this book to people starting their own firms when they ask me what they should do to build their business. I like this book because it gives a glimpse at what really goes on out there instead of motivational BS so many books throw around. Before Oracle, Larry was working at another firm but he wanted to set up his own company. He stayed at his job but rented an office in the same building to launch his own firm at the same time without telling anybody. I thought that was brilliant. He would ride the elevator a few floors to his own firm but still have access to the resources of the larger company while maintaining his salary and building his business the whole time.Academics are always shocked when I mention what really goes on in the business world and this book gives an up close look."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"The book flows well, is interesting to read, and gives good insight into Larry Ellison himself as well as Oracle. There is considerable background material that all seems relevant as the book progresses. Ellison was interviewed 4 times for this book, and while the book reflects overall a favorable opinion of him, it also seems very truthful and frank. I gained a better insight of the software and database industry from reading the book. Was also helpful in analyzing Ellison and his leadership strategies."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"I found the book a fairly easy read. It was informative and each quote was marked with a 'who said it' reference in the back of the book. The book paints a grand picture of Larry but also gives you the sense that you may not want to buy a used car from him. Overall the book gives you the insight that Larry got to be a billionaire due to a crafty ability to sell to people, and a complete determination to win. Many of the stories within the book are interesting and entertaining even if some of them may be fabrications of the people who told them. I recommend this book if you know anything about Larry and Oracle already."},{"Title":"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison","review":"Could not stop reading this book, but it sure seems like a smear campaign against Ellison at times. However, I do think that the book presents genuine and honest feedback from those who worked at Oracle. There is a never-ending array of people offering their input, and at times disagreement about facts. Things jumps around a bit, but the title says it all.Love him or hate him (I am firmly entrenched in the former), this book serves up an interesting history of Oracle without too much of Ellison's personal bias. Great stuff.

When the pain gets too bad and the anger rages out of control, Amy uses the power of the glimmer to keep her father away from her. Everyone knows the secret of the Perry household but nobody does anything about it and soon the town will have more to worry about them a child abuse. Soon being hit will be the least of Amy's woes.In the catacombs below the town teen club known as the Iron Angel, Cyn, a disturbed and alienated teenage girl has made a pact with Azazel, the Shredder of Human Souls. This entity is bound by iron in a statue and needs thirteen human souls to break free. Amy meets Grendel; a Bane who is a soulless immortal who never sleeps nor eats and can heal from any injury. Grendel informs the teen that she too is a Bane, born to be the one to send the Shredder back to hell. As she sheds her humanity to fight in the upcoming battle, it is her human love for her younger brother Charles that will determine whether she contains the resolve needed to win victory from a being more powerful and older than Lucifer.In the new millennium one of the premium writers of cutting edge horror is Karen Koehler with her distinctive gothic style, vivid imagery and dark characters. Amy is an attractive \\"coming of age\\" character who goes from fighting her fate to accepting the mantle of responsibility thrust upon her; this endears her to readers. Azazel is fascinating in a macabre malevolent way. Their confrontation makes this book worthy of a Bram Stoker award nomination.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Manhwa Mania: How to Draw Korean Comics (Manga Mania)","review":"So many reviews state that this book seems just like a how to draw Manga book.

Except that its virtually all manga/anime stlye. It seemed just like some of the author's other how to draw manga books.

In this particular book Hart is not even listed as a contributing artist! Typical books of this sort \\"by\\" Hart average at least 16 pages of his work out of the standard 144 pages. Check out the copyright page of this book and look at the contributing artists listed, Christopher Hart's name is nowhere to be found for the artwork in its pages.When I look for how-to drawing instruction books I expect the listed author(s) to be responsible for all the content. Or that proper credit is given to the contributing artists by publicizing them among the book's ad details and placing their names on the cover.That said, there's some good artwork here and to echo a previous reviewer... it's not much different from standard manga. Better books on this style of drawing are out there and worth taking time to investigate if you're serious about getting into creating this type of art. The Hart books are on average thin on the details and this one doesn't even contain art he created, what does that tell you?"},{"Title":"Manhwa Mania: How to Draw Korean Comics (Manga Mania)","review":"As a long-time reader of both Manga and Manhwa, I am very familiar with the various common styles they employ. Not only is the majority of art in this book terrible, it is not remotely Manhwa. I saw no heavier eyelashes, angular and sharper styles, stretched anatomy--all very common hallmarks of manhwa. Seriously. Take a moment to simply google \\"manhwa\\" and compare what you see to this junk. It is not remotely smiliar, unless the manhwa artist is actively employing a style closer to Japanese manga.As I've improved in my own art over the years, I've realized how truly terrible Chris Hart's books are. Don't buy them. They will only teach you how to copy various pictures done by multiple artist in varying styles. Find a quality art book and then develop your own style. Draw from life. If you like Asian styles, dig up the How to Draw Manga series (the real one) that is translated from the Japanese series. Those are good.

I was expecting a lot of wonderful fashion style images, and rightfully so. However, Comte did not only choose to include his masterful fashion images, which, in my opinion, carry less weight than the rest, he also included many of his photojournalistic work in a few war torn locations. Those images can be devastatingly haunting, and some of them gave me nightmares. It stops me for a while pondering how fortunate I am, to be able to view these images in a comfortable setting, even writing a little review about it. I think I am fortunate not having to be in the images. He succeeded in capturing and conveying the hopelessness, the helplessness and the tragedy behind wars. Maybe we should show these images to the politicians all over the world, especially those power-craze dictators.If Fashion means only beautiful new clothing, this genre of photography may be too narrow-minded. To be, fashion means fashionable. And fashionable means anything, both good and bad, recent. Comte redefines the usual Fashion in the sense that these tragic events are also as recent and as fashionable as the models on the runways in Paris.

Written from a feminist perspective, it combines information within the framework of the feminist movement. In today's context, the material it covers generates anger at how little was understood about this issue in that era. The book incorporates interviews from victims, fathers, and mothers which ring true, but the author's interpretation of those words may bring anger and disbelief. We know now that incest is not solely attributable to living in a patriarchal society and that offenders are not easily rehabilitated. If you want to understand how much progress we have made, this book provides that perspective. Be warned that it looks at ALL the issues through a highly feminist viewpoint."},{"Title":"Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso","review":"Written by an anthropologist who tells Maria's story through short stories as told to her by Maria.

An interesting accounting of their work which earned world acclaim for the unique pottery they produced. This book is a window to a time long forgotten and into the soul of a creative artist.

There was no depth to their characters, I just felt like they went through the motions and Zeke was a bit too perfect to me. Pretty easy read, but if you are used to Catherine's Coulter novels, don't expect too much.

It was a lighter read than Blue Skies (Hank Coulter's story). I didn't like it at all. I enjoyed that Zeke and Natalie meet and fall in love without all the sexual tension in other books. That storyline is so played out. Zeke was great with Natalie's kids and was just touching for him to especially reach out to Chad who was so troubled and helped him gain confidence in himself. Rosie of course was delightful. Yes, Natalie's sister was portrayed as a bit slutty but seems like she had a good heart.

It is refreshing to read books about people who overcome real life handicaps."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I am a sucker for a family series, and I have been in love with the Coulter family since reading Phantom Waltz (Ryan and Bethany). Each book in the series weaves an engaging, mature, and heartwarming story. Bright Eyes is no exception.Bright Eyes is Zeke Coulter's story. Confirmed bachelor Zeke Coulter finds himself in a tomato patch of a mess when his neighbor's son vandalizes his house, and he goes over to confront the boy's family. What he finds is Natalie Patterson, a temptation in a black dress and strappy black sandals. Zeke's bachelor existence is turned upside down when he convinces Natalie to let her son work off the damage to his property. From this point on, Zeke's life is completely changed.Not only does he find himself falling under the spell of Natalie,he also becomes wrapped around the finger of her cute-as-can-be daughter Rosie. As much as Zeke tries to resist, he finds himself wishing less and less for bachelorhood and more and more for what Natalie and her children can offer.Natalie is a divorced mother, who once had dreams of being a singer, but must now struggle to support her children because of her ex-husband's narcissicism. Natalie is very much attracted to Zeke but bitter experience has made her cautious.Bright Eyes is an engaging story that leaves the reader with a warm and fuzzy feeling. After reading one of Catherine Anderson's story I am always left with a feeling of family. This book offers romance, suspence, heartache, and renewal-all essential elements for a great story. Throw in the family &quot;pet&quot; Chester (who is such a scene stealer), and you've got humor like you've never seen before. Chester's antics kept me laughing out loud several times during the night.Overall, Bright Eyes is a well-paced read. Lucky for us, there are several more Coulter kin so we can revisit this family once again."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"Another job well done by Catherine!! Outstanding story with so much humor and with so much understanding and love.

Great job Catherine."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"In Crystal Falls, ranch supply store owner Zeke Coulter turns livid when he sees the damage to his house. When he notices a boy running towards his neighbor?s house Zeke follows only to have his brain malfunction as he sees the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. He informs Natalie that her eleven year old son Chad vandalized his property. An angry Chad says so what just ask dad to pay. Natalie knows that Robert is too busy with his latest bimbo to worry that his son is falling apart. She informs Zeke she cannot pay him at this time. He says Chad can help repair the damage.Zeke shows a sullen Chad how to use a saw and praises the lad for doing a fine job making Chad feel good as he is used to his father telling him he is clumsy. That night, Natalie?s other child four year old Rosie cuts a deal with Zeke that allows Rosie and Natalie to help Chad pay off his debts. Over the next few days, Zeke falls in love with Natalie and her two children, but know he must go slow as the mom and the son have major relationship problems that become compounded when Natalie will face murder charges.BRIGHT EYES is an engaging relational romantic suspense that readers will enjoy because of the intriguing interactions between the cast including Chester the gander and the strong attraction between the two lead protagonists. Though Chad overcomes his anger too easily and Robert is too self-indulged, fans will appreciate this fine contemporary even if the lead couple needs to stop chasing fast mice in her bedroom.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"MS.

Thank you Catherine..."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"Normally, Catherine Anderson can fill 400 pages with riveting ease. BRIGHT EYES launches easily -- prompting the reader to settle back, fully anticipating another Anderson gem. Unfortunately, half way into her story Anderson flounders. This gifted writer usually delivers heartwrenching, poignant stories -- but here she chose 'cutesy' -- coupled with a predictable crisis.The rugged Coulter family continues. BRIGHT EYES is Zeke's story. Zeke Coulter is the normal Anderson hunka-hunka burning love male -- gorgeous, sensitive men who ooze toughness. Zeke is a busy bachelor who is content with his life and his new acreage.Fortuitously, Zeke's new property borders Natalie Patterson's land. Mrs. Patterson is a sexy mom with two children and a worthless ex-husband -- a jerk who continues to make life miserable for Natalie and his children. Natalie Patterson and the kids find Zeke Coulter equal to a knight in shining armor. A spectacular man who bolsters their confidence, builds their self-worth, and brings new hope to their bleak lives.As usual, Catherine Anderson draws wonderful characters. Natalie falls from the pages as a normal woman, a woman who tugs at her summer shorts, frets over 10 pounds, yet is determined to lose 20. However, the true character prize is little Rosie Patterson, Natalie's young daughter. This four year old is adorably precocious and has enough charm to leap from Anderson's pages straight into the reader's heart. Oh how, I cherished the pages this child inhabited.Yet, somewhere around page 200, the story became ordinary. A predictable crime soared to the foreground changing Zeke and Natalie into grisly sugar-coated lovers -- I love you -- I love you -- say you love me -- say it again --.The beginning saved the rating, but that ending! Oh, Ms. Anderson pull out that heart-rending pen! Save the syrupy-sweet for another author -- nobody does poignancy better than you!Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"There are good ways and not so good ways to meet your neighbors. Among the not so good is having to confront the mother of a young vandal about her son's misdeeds, only to have an argument and get chased off by an attack goose. Despite the inauspicious beginning, Zeke Coulter, a brother of other Anderson heroes, finds himself admiring Natalie Patterson. Not only is she beautiful, her own opinion notwithstanding, and hard headed as he himself is, but has an inner strength and the voice of an angel. Her children, even the vandal, also win Zeke's heart. His entry into their lives could not have come at a better time either. Natalie's ex has finally p.o'd someone one too many times, and winds up dead, with the best suspect being Natalie. Fortunately, Zeke has strong shoulders for her to lean on; and no one messes with the Coulter family and gets away with it.**** Bright Eyes has a bit more tension than some of Ms Anderson's books, but is still heartwarming and real. The pages ripple with gentle humor and love. I hope the Coulter clan has a few more siblings to meet in future novels. ****Amanda"},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"4th book in the Coulter family series.In this one you have Zeke Coulter, who owns and runs a ranch supply store. He also recently bought a ranch bordering another ranch. When he comes home one day, he finds that his home has been vandalized by a 12 year old. He chases the boy to the neighboring ranch where he meets the kids mother, Natalie. Natalie is a divorced mother of two who is living with her odd family because her rich, creep of an ex-husband has not paid child support. Since she can't pay Zeke for the damages, she agrees to let her son work at Zeke's house to repay him. In the process, Zeke gets to know Natalie and her children, and despite the fact that he has never had any desire to get married and have kids, he finds himself falling in love with all of them. Things get complicated when Natalie's ex-husband is murdered and she is the main suspect.Bright Eyes is a little different in tone than the other two of Anderson's books I've read. It's not quite a poignant, but it's still an interesting romance. I enjoyed seeing Zeke's perceptions and desires shift. His relationship with Natalie's son was wonderfully done. I liked how that was the initial focus of the connection between Natalie and Zeke.One of the things I liked most about the book was the more traditional romance of it. Natalie and Zeke meet, are attracted to one another, engage in a relationship, fall in love, and decide to get married. So many romances in books are chock full of angst, denying feelings, breaking up, getting back together, etc. It's nice once in a while to read a book where there is a more natural flow to two people getting together and staying together. So I really enjoyed that aspect.Another great part of the book was that there were some truly hilarious scenes. I couldn't stop laughing at a couple of them. It's always great when some humor is surprisingly slipped into a book.All in all, a good read. It's maybe not a serious and dramatic as Anderson's other books, but I liked it.Rating: 4 / 5"},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I have to start out by saying that I could not put this book down. From start to finish, I enjoyed every page of this book. This was my first Catherine Anderson book and it WONT be my last. I want to read about all the siblings now!Natalie Patterson is a devoted mother to two children that you grow to love. Chad, a child suffering from divorced parents acting out and growing up far to fast. Rosie, a little girl that you love from the start. (Although I think that Rosie's character was far fetched for her age.) Natalie has divorced her husband and the father of her children after 11 years of marriage and she lives at her family home with her gramps, father, and sister. (They are included in this quite story quite a bit and you have too love them also.) She owns a club where she loves to sing her songs. Zeke Coulter lives next door and falls in love with Natalie almost instantly when Chad destroys some of his property. He hires Chad and Natalie and little Rosie to work off the debt by fixing all the work themselves. Then, Natalie's ex-husband is murdered and she is the main suspect right up to the end of the book.This book was very WELL written and instead of foccusing on the two main charcters, you got to read about their families and actual surroundings. Also, the family pet is even included in this book a lot. She is a goose that will make you laugh so hard you'll cry. I wouldn't say that this is a hot steamy romance book, more like a knight in shining armor book that is family oriented. If you like heated emotional scenes between the two main characters than this book is not for you, but if you like simple, love inspired books then read this one."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I normally absolutely love the Coulter series. Of the 8 there are, this one I couldn't even finish. I really didn't like the extra characters. I felt disgusted reading about overly slutty Valerie and drunk and dirty Grandpa. I thought Catherine painted a very low \\"white trash\\" picture of Natalie. Neither did I like the whole murder mystery angle. I know Catherine usually does the mystery thing very well, but the feel of the entire book was off. So, I guess I am one of very few people who did not like this book. ALL of the other ones have earned a place on my favorites list, and Catherine is still one of my favorites too.

Instantly, I fell in love with the characters & was rooting for Zeke & Natalie to get together. This book has good romance & an interesting mystery as well.I can't wait to read my next Catherine Anderson book."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I picked up this book because I liked the title, I have never read any Catherine Anderson books before. I really liked this book, I liked Natalie's character how she wanted to be independant and didnt want Zeke to order her around. I didn't like Zeke's character, I thought he was way to perfect and no guy is that perfect. I thought Rosie was adorable, but can 4 year olds really talk like that? I don't even talk that perfect and Im 17. She uses huge words that she doesnt know what they mean and she's never even been in school. And I don't think Chad would have overcome his anger that fast just because of Zeke, who he doesnt even know."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I love all of Catherine Anderson's books. Bright Eyes is no exception. Zeke and Natalie are a wonderful couple; and the secondary characters are so real and entertaining. Like all of Catherine's books, this story has it all. I really enjoyed this book. I found it endearing and very funny at times. I also enjoyed the mystery plot as well."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I haven't had a Catherine Anderson book that I didn't like, so I was anticipating a great read when I stopped and picked Bright Eyes up at the bookstore. I was not disappointed - in fact I was so entertained by the story line as well as the secondary characters that I found myself laughing out loud. The gander and Rose are pure fun.Bright Eyes is fun - full of tender romance - heated passion - and lead characters who have depth and character. Catherine Anderson has written a beautiful story about love that comes when you least expect it and manages to overcome all obstacles. By the time I finished the book (all in one sitting, I might add) I was believing in the magic of the heart and that love can find us even when we aren't looking. Cannot wait for the next book to be released.........."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes (Coulter Family Series)","review":"I look forward to every Catherine Anderson novel that comes out. And I am never disppointed. She has created wonderful characters and stories with every book, and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; is no exception.

Smith, Sr. (1838-1918) was the sixth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). He was the last president of the LDS Church to have personally known the founder of the Mormon faith, Joseph Smith, Jr., who was the brother of his father Hyrum Smith. This collection of his sermons and writings was first published posthumously in 1919.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"We are the children of God. He is an eternal being, without beginning of days or end of years. He always was, he is, he always will be.\\" (Pg. 64)\\"I do not believe in the ideas that we hear sometimes... that it matters but little what men do in this life, if they will but confess Christ as the end of their journey in life, and that is all-sufficient, and that by so doing they will receive their passport into heaven. I denounce this doctrine. It is unscriptural, it is unreasonable, it is untrue, and it will not avail any man...\\" (Pg. 95)\\"The devil himself can appear like an angel of light. False prophets and false teachers have arisen in the world. There is perhaps no gift of the Spirit of God more easily imitated by the devil than the gift of tongues. Where two men or women exercise the gift by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, there are a dozen perhaps who do it by the inspiration of the devil.\\" (Pg. 201)\\"It is the purpose of God in restoring the gospel and the holy Priesthood not only to benefit mankind spiritually, but also to benefit them temporally.\\" (Pg. 209)\\"Women would marry if they could, and would accept cheerfully the responsibilities of family life.\\" (Pg. 281)\\"It were better far that many such young men never went to college than that the excuse of college life be made the reason for postponing marriage beyond the proper age.\\" (Pg. 281)\\"The history of our missionary work already written proves the futility of public debate and argument between our elders and their opponents; and this in spite of the fact that in the great majority of such undertakings the forensic victory has been won by our representatives.\\" (Pg. 364)\\"And it is one of the greatest puzzles to scientists that they are discovering in the path of ancient civilization of this continent evidences and proofs of the divinity of the Book of Mormon, that they cannot dispute or gainsay. And their wonder is, how Joseph Smith, a man unlearned in history, in theology, in science, a man without book learning, practically, coudl ever so closely hit upon facts that are now being discovered by explorers and scientists...\\" (Pg. 466-467)"},{"Title":"The constant circle; H.

It has nice larger black line drawings showing clear step by step drawing of each move. It doesn't require purchase of a lot of tools, that most will have in the house. The material can be simple electrical wire that you have stripped the covering off to start with. Or leave the plastic covering on for colored work.The pictures of the finished items are bright and clear. The projects are more for daily wear and some for fancy dress up. You will find the needed info to make any jigs for the component making. I am partial to what they now call Egyptian coils or Celtic twist/coils of copper bare wire.If you have moved on from simple wire work with only connections made of the wire work.

This collection features many of X.J. Kennedy's kid classics, plus some new ones, and lively, active drawings. Airtight, singsong rhyme and meter combines with absurdist wit to come up with gems like \\"Mother's Nerves\\": \\"My mother said, 'If just once more - I hear you slam that old screen door, - I'll tear out my hair! I'll dive in the stove!' - So I gave it a bang, and in she dove.\\" Many kids have a natural silliness that such extremes will appeal to, and poems like \\"One Winter Night in August\\" are excellent introductions to so-called nonsense... \\"Exploding Gravy\\" will be lapped up."},{"Title":"Exploding Gravy: Poems to Make You Laugh","review":"Reason for Reading: A bit of a story...As every year, I am participating in the AtoZ Challenge. For the first time, this year I only have the X's left and I will have completed it so I decided to actively search out books. Since it's so close to year end I decided to go with a juvenile book. I browsed through the library and could not find a book on the shelves for an author whose last name started with 'X', so I went to the librarian for help and after much searching on the computer she finally alighted upon this title and I took it to save her from spending any more time searching for me. As you can see I fudged a little and my 'X' is for the first name.This is a collection of Kennedy's \\"best\\" work, all previously published; some from his prior collections of poetry and others from published anthologies of children's poems. Divided into topical sections such as: \\"Eats\\", \\"Birds, Bees & Beasts\\" and \\"Peculiar Characters\\", these are all silly poems in the vein of Shel Silvertstein, Dennis Lee or Jack Prelutsky only Kennedy never really hits the mark and passes the smile stage into the giggling out loud nature of the other poets. Silly poetry is really the only poetry I truly appreciate so I say with some confidence that Kennedy's work just doesn't reach the bar of other authors of this genre. While I had a few smiles, mostly the poetry fell flat with me or just simply failed to amuse. The illustrations on the other hand add some much needed whimsy to this collection and may make some poems funnier than they really are if you concentrate on the accompanying illustration. Kennedy's other books have received good reviews, so your mileage may vary."},{"Title":"Enlightened Beings: Life Stories from the Ganden Oral Tradition","review":"Good description of Gelukpa teachers.

Following this merit badge guidebook approach, the entire subject of risk is covered in 3 pages, and CP/DR is covered in just over 2. It just doesn't contain enough text to be the sole reference book for any single aspect of the job, but it does have some useful information that I'm not aware of in any other text. It is process and organizationally organized, and does not deal with technology at all.My favorite chapter is the second one, &quot;Understanding the Business and Management Environment.&quot; With a background in social science and significant experience in multi-cultural situations, the author is uniquely qualified to help an information security practitioner operate effectively within what is essentially an alien culture.A question that I'm frequently asked, and I see often in infosec forums, is &quot;What do I do to get into the security business?&quot; Chapter 4 provides excellent advice on creating a career path, followed by Chapter 5 which contains suggestions on finding a new job. I recommend these chapters to anyone who is looking to break into this field, or who wants to advance their career.If you have managed to find yourself a leadership role in infosec, and are wondering what you should do next, the chapter on creating security plans should be helpful. The chapter on establishing an infosec program is also helpful, and contains some excellent job descriptions for different infosec positions. This is hardly stimulating reading, but if you are an ISSO, your choice is to find usable boilerplate like this, or make it up yourself.The author approaches the subject from a single point of view. All of the examples are drawn around a single hypothetical corporation, and it is obvious that the author has a law enforcement orientation. An infocop approach like this is not necessarily successful within every corporate culture, nor does everyone who is responsible for an information security program think of their role in corporate criminal justice terms.I do think that anyone running an information security program would benefit from this book-or anyone who wants to work towards such a position. If you like org charts and job descriptions, you'll probably feel comfortable with it. For those who are not ISSOs, or those who just looking for an introductory guide to security, this is not the ideal text. For those who are ISSOs, or otherwise responsible for infosec programs, Thomas Wradlow's book, &quot;The Process of Network Security,&quot; is a meatier and more sophisticated book that covers much of the same subject matter at a lower price. I recommend that anyone responsible for creating or implementing infosec programs get both books."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"I found this book a real disappointment. More about planning your career in this area than actually the practicalities of doing the job."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"If you are looking to grow as a security professional, this book can definately help you. Regardless of if your just getting started in the industry or if you have 20 years under your belt, you will learn something from this author. It discusses everything from marketing yourself, getting hired, planning, hiring staff, performing risk management, classifying your information, doing metrics analysis and of course how to deal with people and politics in your &quot;ISSO&quot; position.

His approach will enable the reader to better understand the corporate environment concerning, not only the management process involved in protecting information, but also the importance of communicating and interacting with the organization in a way that people feel motivated to develop and maintain a successful and effective InfoSec program. The book discusses important management tenets and procedures which demonstrates the authors insight and experience in dealing with \\"real world \\" InfoSec issues. This book is easy reading and provides a clear understanding of the information security functions by taking the reader through the business and management environment and at the same time stressing a very important point that is often overlooked, i.e., an awareness and expectation that change is constant. I've recommended this book to those who are currently in the information security business and anyone who is attempting to pursue a career in this field.

This is a one-of-a-kind book for the InfoSec professional and a must reading by all people interested in an InfoSec career. Even the experienced ISSO can find great value in this book.

Also I really think that some of the other reviewers here must have been working to promote this book. I unfortunately say this because the author creates entirely too many unique and extremely complex management policy theories on communication development, which frankly gets way off the subject of INFOSEC, and even has him chasing his own tail in the narrated scenarios. The author even goes so far as to concoct and create possibly 20-30 new acronyms (as if you didn't have enough already as a real INFOSEC professional), which almost became a little comedic by the end of the book, especially when hearing even the author try recap each chapter and make each new theory tie into another new theory. Although I'm sure the author is a very distinguished professional in his own right, I unfortunately found this book weak to incorporate into any of my perceived Information Security plans. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and move onto the next, and make sure the books you choose on this topic do not try to reinvent the wheel."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"For years, we being trying to define InfoSec.

One would have to have never heard of the Internet or the Web, and never to have worked anywhere, to benefit from it. The author repeats infosec and management bromides ad nauseum, waves the bloody flag of 9/11 to puff up the importance of the field, and introduces new acronyms faster than the Pentagon.It's also frequently incomprehensible, due to the author's poor control of English grammar.If you're in infosec, don't let your bosses read this -- they may think you're as full of hot air as Kovacich.Also note that at least 3 of the 5 star reviews below are by sometime coauthors of Kovacich."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"One of the biggest challenges in any career is how to present yourself and your objectives to gain favorable support from others.

The book is written in a format that makes it very readable and also that you can easily find that piece of information that you can remember seeing but can't exactly recall where..I wish that he had been writing this type of book when I first started out in the Infosec field.

A book that should be adopted for required study in business management, computer science, and information security courses."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"Dr. Kovacich has updated one of the classic management works for the people who are responsible for the overal design, development and delivery of a comprehensive, enterprise-wide protection program. There are lots of books out there that will assist those who have technical responsibilities for security in doing a better job. There are very few that help develop the manager's who must harmonize people, processes and technology to address the rapidly increasing range of risks that can impact organizations that are all becoming ever more dependent on information technology to accomplish their objectives. If you are now or aspire to be a manager or director of information security for an organization this is an essential guidebook that will advise and assist you in meeting the challenges inherent in that role."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"Another excellent book from a knowledgeable authority. Insightful and well written, Dr. Kovacich provides some excellent advice for the ISSO and anyone involved in Information Security. The practical approach to implementing and managing an effective Information Security (INFOSEC) program is applicable to both US private sector and governmental organizations. This book is a must read for both the novice and seasoned professional and anyone interested in Information Security."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"...I expected more for my $.While some of the material was good, there is just not enough substance to justify the cost."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"I have found the Information Systems Security Officer's Guide by Dr. Gerald Kovacich provides many gems of wisdom, not only valuable to me as a former ISSO, but also in my role as a business continuity planning (BCP) professional. For example, I've struggled with how to facilitate BCP communication and interaction among our mission-critical organizations. Making the BCP charter consistent with the company's Strategic, Tactical and Annual Plans, as Dr. Kovacich suggested, has provided the needed common thread of BCP motivation for rapid deployment. Most importantly from a personal perspective, the idea of the ISSO Portfolio in the chapter titled \\"How to Market Yourself as an ISSO\\" is worth its weight in gold! By following Dr. Kovacich's advice, I was able to effectively compete for and win my current global BCP management job."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"* Shows good research done prior to writing. * Written in easy to understand terms. * Very well organized. * Contains highly factual information. * Accurately portrays the ISSO position. * A must for any person responsible for developing and maintaining corporate Information Systems security processes. * This guide is the best on the market today."},{"Title":"The Information Systems Security Officer's Guide: Establishing and Managing an Information Protection Program, Second Edition","review":"I read this book for a Internet Security course and I was very intrigued with it's handling of the subject matter. As the title suggests, it is a guide for an ISSO's job. It give clear insight as to what you should be focusing on and how you should expect to handle your day to day job and also how important it is to get the entire company involved in your efforts.I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Christopher Walken: Movie Top Ten","review":"This is a great source of information about Christopher Walken, his movies, and the themes that drive them - however - it does tend to overanalyze, and contains little information on Walken that you could not pick up yourself on the internet. It seems that Walken is not the chatty type. In his own words, he enjoys working and is not proud of all the 90+ features he has appeared in, but he does have his favorites. I have no idea after reading this book if one of these top ten are in fact the actors favorite - rather they are showcased as his best performances. This is a lot of speculation, as Walken has an incredible amount of work, including broadway shows to choose from. So if you are looking for that personal touch, it's not really there. You have to ask yourself though, is there really anything behind Walken as a person that would warrant a personal touch? From all appearences, he works, he goes home, he works some more. He has been married to the same woman for 30+ years, thinks he cooks really well, and aside from the really odd stab at screenwriting (he wants to do the John Holmes story - apparently he is fascinated with Holmes' life, and the attention paid to Holmes' member vs. the real man behind the porn - Okay Chris - you get the different award) he would appear to be reasonably stable (discounting the Natalie Wood thing, but even that is scandal of the most mundane variety.). Christopher Walken is a person who has lived his entire life on film (since the age of 3) and no doubt will die on film as is his wish. So perhaps there is no personal touch to be had and his films are the only window into his life, aside from the odd interview (such as his most recent wish - to host a cooking show). If you want to experience an exhaustive analysis of ten of what are his best well-known films by good reviewers that have never interacted personally with Walken himself - this is for you. If you want to read Walken on Walken, get the playboy interview."},{"Title":"Christopher Walken: Movie Top Ten","review":"I only rate this book with 4 stars because of its interesting subject - not for the editor Jack Hunter. Did Hunter actually read it? I was completely distracted from the material by the numerous spelling and grammatical errors. An actor like Christopher Walken deserves better treatment than this sloppily thrown together collection of essays. Though some of them were pretty interesting (Deer Hunter, Comfort of Strangers), I found myself wondering if Hunter actually watched all of the actor's major films. How could he include The Addiction and Suicide Kings in the Walken Top 10 but leave out the awesome performances in At Close Range and Biloxi Blues - both with gripping climax scenes that deserve essays of their own. A comparison of Walken in his stand-off with Sean Penn to Walken's flip-flop stand-off with Mathew Broderick (Walken is held at gunpoint by Penn/ Broderick held at gunpoint by Walken) sorely needed to be added to this collection. Will someone please re-write this book?!?!! Heck, give me a week; I could do better than this."},{"Title":"Christopher Walken: Movie Top Ten","review":"A great book by Jack Hunter. Christopher Walken is a very gifted actor, and Hunter gives loads of insight into the many characters he has played throughout the years. You may even be inclined to view some of the movies, again after reading this book. It is obvious that Hunter recognizes talent when he sees it. Hunter goes beyond the typical type-casting, that many film critics are stuck on. This book has many nuggets of wisdom, and is laced with respect. Christopher Walkwn is very fortunate to have an insightful author, like Hunter, write about him. Thanks Chris for sharing your gift of acting. Thanks Jack for sharing your gift of writing. The pleasure has been mine from Indiana."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"This book is a must have for all practices.

I've seen lots of \\"other\\" veterinary drug handbooks, but they pale in comparison to Plumb's. There's just the right amount of information here--not too much, not too little. Other handbooks seem relatively lacking in content."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"I am a senior veterinary student and use this constantly on clinics.

If you are not, you have been missing one of the best helps that a veterinary practice may have. It is simply a collection of monographs of 90% or so of the most used drugs in a veterinary hospital (YOU will have to get the other 10% and, I assure you, it will take plenty of your time). They include everything that a conciencious veterinarian wants to now, and then a little more. The language is simply enough for any professional to understand even if one's chemistry and biochemistry is a bit rusty. What are you doing reading this? Go and get it; your patients and you need it!"},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"This is the only book that I have that I use every single day!"},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"I do cat rescue and needed a detailed reference book on veterinary medications. I asked my veterinarian what book she recommended and she said that this was the best book by far. She prefers it over other medical textbooks that costs hundrends of dollars. I purchased this book and use it all the time now. It has helped me resolve medication related questions in emergency situations. This book has more than paid for itself in the $$ is has saved me in veterinary bills. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs access to information on veterinary medications, especially when it's a night or weekend and I cannot contact my veterinarian. This is a must have book for anyone who works with animals."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"I love the text book! It's one of the most useful texts in my library. I even had the 1995 CD-Rom version for my practice, and it was indispensible while on house calls. But the 2005 edition sucks. It won't work on my Mac (although the disk case says it should), uses a windows-only proprietary format that won't even search properly, has non-standard user controls, useless help files, and is basically unusable. Steer clear of this CD version and just buy the book."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"When it comes to veterinary drugs, this book is the bible. Does get technical in some places, but it gives you everything- interactions, and other tidbits of pertinent information. This is the first place I look to for drug info- all of our vets use it daily as well- the cover is beyond shredded! Alphabetical and in some cases both common and trade names. What more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"This book is a vital and must needed item for college for a veterinary technician student! It had what you need."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"First, the bad news. This book is not complete: I ckecked some 60 drugs of common use in our clinic and I could not find about 10 of them. Some of the missing ones were dipyrone, chlorhexidine, clotrimazole and econazole, mebendazole, scopolamina, and spiramicyn. You decide whether they are important to you. On the good side, every drug that IS included in the book gets a full treatment. And I really mean full. After you read any monograph, you know everything that is to know about the drug: chemistry, compatibility, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, uses and indications, contraindications, toxicity, doses, etc., etc., etc. The day I got the book I left it on a desk in my clinic and could not recover it for a week; every colleague had something to ckeck, and each one had words of praise for the book. On top, the binding is rugged enough to take a lot of abuse. In summary, an excellent book. I hope the 4th edition adds some of the missing items."},{"Title":"Veterinary Drug Handbook, Desk Edition plus Abridged Companion (Pocket Edition), 2 Volume Set","review":"I'm not sure what book the other reviewers were writing about, but it wasn't this title. The book I am reviewing is: Veterinary Drug Handbook Client Information Edition by Gigi Davidson and Donald C. Plumb.This book contains entries for the most commonly prescribed drugs in veterinary use in layman's terms for clients. It does not contain pharmakonetics, extra-label uses, contraindications, dosages, concentrations ect. It is a stretch of the imagination that this would even be considered for use as a textbook.My advice for you: if you are a student in a veterinary program, get the newest edition of Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook. If you are a pet lover, pet owner or other layperson, then this is the book you are looking for; it provides information on many drugs that are commonly prescribed by your veterinarian in plain English that is clear and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Low blood sugar","review":"Only 128 pages and This Book Saved my Life! I kept bugging my doctors to do something for years about all the symptoms I had of low blood sugar. Finally, 2 heart attacks later, I have an internist that has zeroed in on the problem. This book served as a guideline for me until I was diagnosed, and kept me level and relatively sane. LOL! It really explains the details of the disease and best of all, gives you a sound diet plan to follow. This is exactly what Dr. Atkins has been saying for many years about low blood sugar being the primary cause of overweight.Dr. Steincrohn's parting note says it all, &quot;whoever or whatever you are, please do not procrastinate. Ask your physician to arrange for a complete blood sugar study&quot;. And &quot;Hopelesness feeds on one's lack of effort to help oneself. More than you realize, your life is in your own hands&quot;. I say, don't take no for an answer, get the help and information that you need. This book should be reprinted!"},{"Title":"Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin","review":"Having been wowed by DK Publishing's gorgeous \\"Rock and Gem\\", I was looking for a more technical volume that would cover the basics of mineralogy. The intended audience for this book is likely 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates in an earth sciences program. I compared this book with several others, particularly Nesse's \\"Introduction to Mineralogy\\" and Klein's \\"Manual of Mineral Science\\", which are the two most commonly used mineralogy textbooks. This volume covers the same basic content as those two, but has a more concise, clear writing style and includes more material on the applied aspects of mineralogy (ore deposits, gems, minerals in human health, etc.). I was pleased with my choice - this book makes some difficult concepts and technical material (e.g. crystal symmetry) understandable for the layperson with a decent knowledge of basic math, chemistry, and physics. It is also excellent in its descriptions of the analytical tools that professional mineralogists use to study crystal structure and advance our understanding of mineralogy. Recommended."},{"Title":"Contemporary Moral Problems","review":"I thought that I had purchased the regular version of the book, but it ended up being the instructors edition. It has a lot of interesting passages which help generate discusssion."},{"Title":"Contemporary Moral Problems","review":"I needed this textbook for my ethics and morality class and it was excellent. Absolutely satisfied with my purchase. Thank you~"},{"Title":"Contemporary Moral Problems","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter's college class. She found the book(and teacher) to be very difficult and dropped the class after two weeks. The teacher actually told the class that they would have to read each chapter about 5 times to understand it."},{"Title":"A Tree Within (A New Directions Paperbook)","review":"Octavio Paz wrote some of the most remarkable poetry and prose of the 20th century. The collection of poems entitled &quot;A Tree Within&quot; represents one of his most memorable achievements. A remarkable diverse blend of short lyrics and longer, Whitmanesque creations, &quot;A Tree Within&quot; is definitely a collection that bears careful reading and re-reading.The book is richly studded with multicultural references and allusions--to Epictetus, Buddha, Gilgamesh, Jack the Ripper, the Aztecs, Don Quixote, and many, many, more. But Paz is not merely trying to dazzle us with his knowledge. He is also introspective and revealing. He struggles with deep questions about language, love, and other concerns.Paz seems to be searching both for an ideal poetic language, and for a form of connectedness that transcends language--a paradoxical quest, yet pure Paz. When he writes &quot;Man's word / is the daughter of death&quot; (in the poem &quot;To Talk&quot;), it strikes me as both a tragically naked confession of inadequacy and a moment of serene liberation. At other times, Paz seems, like Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, to be groping towards the creation of a sort of &quot;secular scripture&quot; for the (post)modern age.In the poem &quot;I Speak of the City,&quot; Paz writes, &quot;I speak of our public history, and of our secret history, yours and mine.&quot; The histories recorded by this visionary genius are certainly some of the most important literary creations of the 20th century."},{"Title":"A Tree Within (A New Directions Paperbook)","review":"This bilingual text enhances the experience of reading Paz's poetry. His poetic form can be as spare and suggestive as tanka/haiku or dense with visual imagery as in the poem, A Fable of Joan Miro. The meditative tone of many selections suggests that beyond the accomplishments of art, literature and music, the essential composition is of oneself: &quot;to learn to see so that things will see us and come and go through our seeing.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I wonder how people are able to rate the book and it is not out yet? Where did they get their copy from?"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"The continious story of Lucky Santangelo, is as expected, deliveried with a bang.

Love the Luck character as well as all the others, but sometime it was a little crazy trying to keep up with all of them. Just love Jackie Collins!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Another outing with Lucky, another success. Danger lurks around every corner-- beware the ambush. I've gotta say, the Lucky books have been highly enjoyable. You'll never be bored reading about her and the people in her orbit.Hang in there, things start out a bit slow, establishing character and whatnot, but once the plots pick up motion it's hard to stop reading. All the storylines were compelling; my favourite had to be Brigette and her monster of a husband, now this is a guy it's easy to hate. A wife-beating Eurotrash sleazeball, how charming.The relationship drama between Lucky and Lennie, I saw that coming in the previous book, still I was all \\"oh damn you are in trouble boy, you just lost your wife\\" when the reveal happened. Most times when I see it coming I yawn and say \\"whatever\\". Collins does not do \\"whatever\\" books, this is true. She's sure to please if you're in the mood for trashy drama."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"She never misses! Great story; dynamic charecters kept my interests until the very end.

You won't be able to put down the book until you finish it, JC has the ability to write five different stories in the book, merge all of them at the end of the book and keep you interested in all the stories and willing to read for more."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This book is incredible! This book keeps you reading until it's finished. It is so hard to put down. It is another one of Jackie Collins sensational Lucky Santangelo novels. If you have never read one of the Lucky Santangelo novels you are certainly missing out on some good reading."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This book was about Lucky Santangelo and here life of up and downs. I love the way this novel was written and this was the first romance I've read before. The book was really enjoyable, very lengthy yet you absorb all of it. The style of writing captured my attention and the whole point to the story was intriguing. I loved evey bit of it. Unless someone likes romance and long novels I wouldn't recommend it. Overall a great book!!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Everything was going perfect for Lucky Santangelo in spite of turning the big 40. However, her run of good luck abruptly ends when a carjacker kills the wife of her half-brother. Being the daughter of a powerful Vegas mobster, no one messes with a member of the Santangelo clan and escapes free because Lucky takes care of her kind and their enemies. Lucky begins to track down the odious killer with special plans to enact revenge.While she is on her quest, other problems arise. Claudia accompanied by a small boy comes from Italy claiming that her child's father is Lucky's husband, a by-product of a one-night stand. Her goddaughter Brigette Stanislopoulos has been raped and fed heroin by her disgusting spouse. As she adds these two situations for super clean up, Lucky must deal with Alex Woods of the DANGEROUS KISS, who wants back into her life.The Lucky Santangelo tales are all entertaining fun and fluff that turn into a fast reading experience. The fifth entry DANGEROUS KISS is fast-paced, filled with humor, sex, and death. Lucky remains an enjoyable lead character and the returning cast members continue to augment the story line. Jackie Collins provides her fans with a pleasurable tale and anyone who scorns this novel without reading it will miss a fun time."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I read all the other books! And this book is the best one. Lucky's life just keep getting more and more intriguing. I just couldn't put it down. I got the book on a Friday and Finished it Saturday Morning.

Damn it was good."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I would like you all to know that Jackie will be planning to release in the future. She is in the process of writin Lethal Seduction a follow up novel to the L.A. Connections series. After that, she will write Hollywood Wives: the New Breed."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"As always, Jackie Collins has done a great job in writing a fast paced novel. The &quot;Lucky&quot; Books seem to be her best and this is no exception. Great characters all around too. For those who have not read any of her earlier &quot;Lucky&quot; books, fear not. This book has hints of previously introduced characters so you will not feel lost and confused reading about them. You can easily go back to her other &quot;Lucky&quot; books and see what you had missed!A quick synopsis: Lucky Santangelo, now married to Lennie Golden, writer and director, is now herself working in the movie biz. As she deals with this part of her life, another part starts to fall apart when a family member is gunned down in cold blood and it starts to affect her marraige to Lennie.The characters in this book are well developed and I find that I care about each one of them. We root for Lucky as she tries to find the killers and as always there is that happy ending! You wont' be disappointed with DANGEROUS KISS."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Jackie Collins does it again! I just finished reading this book yesterday.I've read all Jackie's books and the ones about Lucky are always the BEST. Gino (Lucky's Father) is still alive and going strong at 87. I like the way she gives you little hints thruout the book to remind you of past characters that delt with previous Lucky books. I know she bases her characters on real Hollywood people as a few readers of this book have mentioned. Venus as Madonna, Lina as Naomi Campbell? Anything is possible. I guess I never took the time to figure out exactly who it was she was writing about.Too busy digesting every word. Jackie could go so much farther writing about Lucky. Bobby (her son with second husband Dimitri is 15 now) and Gino and Maria, (named after her parents) children with her present husband #3 Lenny. A new generation of Santangelo's to write about. Gino and Maria as teenagers would be wonderful. Does anyone know anything about the next book - Lethal Seduction? Does Jackie have a fan club? My only complaint is having to wait so long for the next Jackie book to come out. If your a Jackie Collins fan, don't wait for the paperback to come out - get this book TODAY!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"A typical Jackie Collins book, excellent, great read, and hard to put down.

It will keep you wondering about the fates of Lucky and everyone that she loves!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Jacie Collins' books since the last Lucky novel (which is one of my top 5 favorite books of hers) have not been that impressive. In fact, they have all paled next to &quot;Revenge&quot;. I knew this one would kick butt, and it does! I CANNOT put it down, since I started reading it yesterday. It just keeps getting better and better. It's so fun to read about continuing characters like Jack Nicholson and Madon--oops! I mean Charlie Dollar and Venus. (even though I can't stand Madonna, Venus is much more likeable than she is). Now the new characters, such as Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks-oops, I mean Lina and DiDi are entertaining too (though so far nothing's been able to top the last one where the German Victoria's Secret Model turns out to really be a man!)

I have loved the other 'Lucky' books but found this one very predicable and unbelievable - too much like the last book with Lucky and Lennie having their 'marital difficulties'. Jackie Collins should put Lucky to rest and write about a whole new set of characters - there is only so much that can happen to one woman and it has all happened to Lucky already!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I felt the book was an evolution of Jackie and Lucky.

It had me on the edge of my seat for hours.Although I feel the lucky character has gone on long enough, but maybe the next generation could carry on the series."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I hope that Jackie Collins ignores the pleas to remove sex, swearing and general debauchery. If they don't like it, let them read children's stories! Collins' Lucky is one strong woman and doesn't need to make apologies. She's a bit much for the soccer-mom crowd but a true fighter who's fun to follow."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Jackie Collins never ceases to amaze me, the moment you think that it's all over....bam! She does it again. Lucky and Lennie are the most lovable couple in Hollywood. Though Brigette is a little too naive for me, she ends up being a survivor just like Lucky. Though the plot twist got me a bit hot under the collar, this is overall great reading. Don't miss this one, its definately a keeper!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I have just finished Jackie Collins' new novel &quot;Dangerous Kiss&quot;. I am an avid Jackie Collins fan and I have read all her works. In particular, the Santangelos have been my favourites. This book is not as good as the earlier novels, but carries on Lucky's very interesting life well. There are twists that you may not expect, but are inevitable...My only criticism of Ms Collins would be that she should get these books checked for mistakes more thoroughly.. and I do not mean spelling mistakes - I have read the Santangelo novels at least 10 times each and there are many mistakes such as ages, things that have supposed to have happened in earlier books that have not actually happened etc. I still enjoy these books immensely - but I think that Ms Collins' publishers would have picked these little mistakes up..All in all the book is great.. very Jackie Collins and still &quot;unputdownable&quot;!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I too had a hard time putting this book down.

What a thrilling read - it had me on the edge of my seat - Lucky is at her best - and I have always loved her relationship with her husband Lenny! For other Jackie fans - you should read a older title of hers called Lovers &amp; Gamblers I just read it last month and was riveted. She is my absolute favorite author and I cannot wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I was originally planning to buy this book, but the price stopped me. Now, I can see Amazon has cut their prices for this latest work by Jackie C., and I don't blame them! In a word, it was &quot;nyeeeeh ...&quot;Don't get me wrong; Lucky is the woman! But, I believe Jackie was trying a bit too hard with this one. You know, the perpetual cute-as-buttons-but-take-no-prisoners children; the last-minute malcontent, malevolent thugs that buy the farm in the end; the usual European creep-on-an-ego-trip-but-too-insecure-to-speak-his-actual-plans-of-thievery to a wealthy heiress (I'm referring to Count Carlo Viterri Vitti); the consistant, loyal, pining away in the wings housekeeper with the neverending devastating secret to tell her employer as far as her illegitimate kid is concerned; the press; the stars; the glitz; and the models. It's all the same throughout all her recent works.Overall, this was a pale version of Lady Boss, Thrill!, and Revenge: Lucky's Vendetta. Lucky showed she held her own in all situations, and I liked the personal side of her illustrated in this novel this time. But I got the sense that there isn't any more she can write about about Lucky without getting in a stereotypical rut with the Santangelo lady with cojones like galvanized iron.And I was glad that the cursing and sex wasn't as rampant as it was in her previous novels; I appreciated that a lot.I am looking forward to Lethal Seduction. Should Ms. Collins happen to read these Amazon reviews, I hope she takes this suggestion: As creative with words as you are, you can write a novel in ways that don't have to utilize very graphic descriptions of sex or use of the f, gd, a-hole, s or mf words. (Hey! Prudes like me like quality reading, too!)This wasn't her best work, and I'm glad I waited for the book to be available in the library. If I'd bought it, I'd've been a very unhappy camper indeed!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Not as good as &quot;Revenge&quot;, but very close (and that's saying a lot). The wait for the next Lucky book was worth it! I could NOT put this down.I walked down the street reading it (not very smart) because I had to keep reading! The characters are great, both old and new.Nicholson--uh, Charlie Dollar is up to his old tricks. Lucky is as kick-butt as ever. Collins brings in some very nasty new villians, who I really hated and wanted to see come to horrible ends (especially Carlo, an insane, possesive, abusive evil pr*** who gets Bridgette, Lucky's goddaughter, hooked on heroin to control her) and one of them came to exactly the end I was hoping for (I won't tell you which one). I didn't find Lina all that sympathetic of a character (maybe because I can't stand Naomi Campbell) but she did get more likeable, and she was very entertaining. I probably found Irena, a russian housekeeper with a dark past, the most likeable, and felt the sorriest for her. When you finally find out how her horrible daughter Mila was conceived, it's 100% pure Jackie Collins all the way. The scene is over-the-top, yet still beleivable (and sad).Here's a little tip for gossip-hounds like me who love to read her Hollywood novels and try to figure out who each character is based on. OK, if you read the tabloids it's pretty obvious sometimes, but sometimes it takes you a little longer. Usually what she'll do is have the character in a room or at a party and the celebrity that Collin's character is based on will walk in. Usually another character will say something like, &quot;Oooo, look! (insert celebrity here) just walked in!&quot; and the character who is based on that celebrity will get irritated. She's gotten a little less subtle about it as the years go by--the characters will have rhyming names with the celebrity they are based on, or very similar ones. Either way, it's a blast.This is one book thast's worth not waiting for the paperback. Pick it up if you're a fan--you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Jackie Collins has done it again. This book kept me on the edge the whole time. I can't wait for the next one! Ms. Collins certainly draws you in with her story lines. Way to go!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This book was very good. The plot thickens and thickens. Jackie can keep a reader up all night wanting to finish one of her books. I could not wait until it hit the stands. It seems it's too long before she releases her next book. Now I'm waiting for the next one!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I am 1\\\\4 of the way through, and I can't put this book down. If you are a Lucky fan this is a must-read. Can anyone here at AMAZON tell me about Collins's next book (LETHAL SEDUCTION)?"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Lucky me! I just finished reading Dangerous Kiss, the characters jump off the page and there is enough scandal and sex to keep everyone happy. Lucky Santangelo is a terrific heroine. Reccommended highly!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Very disappointed. Lucky has become an unbelievable character. Jackie Collins should reitre the whole Lucky Santangelo series."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This is true Jackie Collins style,it is an excellent book and i look forward to her next one,as i always do."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I recieved this book (hardback) on a Friday and finshed it the next day Sat. Wow! it was way better than Vendetta, and that was a good book. I loved that she put a lot more people of color in there. ABout time! I can't wait to see what Lucky will be up to next. Hurry Jackie I'm excited and can't wait."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I knew what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book: one-dimensional characters, melodramatic plot lines, laughably B movie dialogue. There is something horrifiably pleasurable about such mindless escapism. However, after reading 500+ pages, I felt like I had consumed cheap carnival candy. Yuk."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Like all of Jackie Collins material, this one lived up to my expectations! I was sad to see it end. I look forward to the next chapter in the Lucky Santangelo/Lennie Golden love affair. And, the story line about Bridgette had me at the edge of my seat. Well worth the time!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"JACKIE COLLINS DID IT AGAIN..EVERYTIME SHE COMES OUT WITH A LUCKY SANTANGELO BOOK THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SHE CANT GET THEM OUT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME! THIS IS THE KIND OF BOOK YOU NEVER WANT TO PUT DOWN. BRIDGETTE IS OLDER AND LEARNING HOW TO BE JUST LIKE HER GODMOTHER!!! AND LUCKY IS HOT AGAIN!! SHE KNOWS HOW TO USE A GUN AND SHE USES IT WELL...."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"Before Dangerous Kiss, every Lucky novel was an improvement from the last. That's why I was hoping for this to be the best Lucky novel, and Lucky could end at her best. Unfortunately, this one almost makes Chances look better!This is &quot;A Lucky Santangelo Novel&quot;, yet Lucky only plays a secondary part. Lucky's persona we all knew and loved in her prior adventures is much more passive, which is a major letdown. Another thing that I must say is that most of the characters crossing over from other Lucky novels serve no point in the novel, and you almost want to yell at the book, wondering why they are wasting pages.Lucky has been a lot of fun, but I think it is time to leave her be, and move on to bigger and better things."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"In 1999 Jackie Collins release \\"Dangerous Kiss\\", a blockbuster book that featured her most popular character Lucky Santangelo who appeared in four previous novels by the talented and famous writer. In this outing Lucky tries to track down the killer who killed a member of her family while trying to keep her marriage together. Then, a mystery man from Lucky's past enters her life complicating things for the young diva.\\"Dangerous Kiss\\" proved to be another winner for Jackie Collins as it received excellent reviews and was on the \\"New York Times\\" Best Seller List for weeks.Fans will enjoy this outing that has Hollywood as its glamous background with sexy characters, interesting and insightful dialogue and most importantly an involving and heart-stopping story."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"From reading some of the reviews the customers have said i was a little sceptical about reading this book, but once i started it i couldnt put it down. i brought it everywhere even to work (something my boss was not thrilled with). i would deffinatly read this book again. personally i think it was the best book out of the whole lucky series. i hope you enjoy reading it like i did!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"The Mafia princess is still hiding the brief affair she had (ina a previous novel) from her comedian husband, Lenny, while dealing with the fallout when she decides to step down from being the head of the movie studio she runs. The main story of the book involves the murder of one of Lucky and Lenny's friends during a robbery. Lucky's streak of bad times continue when a secret from her husband's not-too-distant past shows up on her doorstep. Not as much trashy fun as the previous stories in this series, but still good."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I've followed Lucky through every book that Jackie Collins has written about her. What else can be said but, &quot;Wow.&quot; Lucky Santangelo is a great character and I am so glad Ms. Collins chose to write 5 books on her.If only Jackie Collins could write more books more frequently. She really does an excellent job and I love every one of them.This book is supposed to be the last Lucky Santangelo installment, but I will jump for joy if Ms. Collins decides to write another."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"All I can say is, there better be a sequel! This has to be the best she's ever written and I was riveted, reading this through within 24 hours! This was her 1st novel that truly impressed me. I have been reading her boks for years, can't resist. Her style has definitely improved over time."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I thought this book was so exciting! The Lucky Santangelo series is extremely good and hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I could hardly wait for this book to come out,but after reading it I feel I should have gone to the library and got it instead of spending the money. Too much hype for not a really great story.It was so predictable we all knew were the author was going. I love all her books but I was disapointed in this one."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This book lacked heart. There were too many things going on throughout the entire story. Collins jumped ahead by months leaving you to wonder and wanting to see how things evolved. Because most of the characters were well defined in earlier books you had a great understanding of their personalities, but the new characters were vague and I missed getting into the old characters. I am a huge Lucky and Gino fan and missed not seeing their usual antics. Lucky fans will enjoy this book (of course) but the heart and that feeling of not being able to put it down will be lost. Hopefully the next book will concentrate on smaller, more intimate story lines about the Santangelo family."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"DANGEROUS KISS will not dissapoint! Lucky Santangelo is my all-time favorite heroine and I was a little worried because VENDETTA wasn't that great. However, Jackie Collins redeemed herself with this latest installment. I waited over a year for this book to come out and it lived up to my expectations. Please Ms. Collins, don't let this be the last Lucky book!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"This one took me less than two days to read. I loved it. Totally Jackie Collins. The worst is having to wait for another from her. A great book. Lucky is the best, the new characters allow for more books about her. I can't wait!!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss","review":"I have always enjoyed Jackie Collins's novels....and this one didn't disappoint! A fast, fun romp of a book, it is the continuing saga of Lucky Santangelo and her family. Lucky is one tough broad (in her father, Gino's words) who protects her family and friends. When her brother's wife is senselessly murdered, Lucky does what she can to help the police. When her goddaughter Bridget is in danger, Lucky springs into action. And of course when the life of the man she loves is hanging in the balance, Lucky shows extreme bravery. She is a fascinating and complex heroine who I enjoy reading about.

Everybody ends up living happily ever after. It's a good read if you're a fan; however, I do not recommend it on audio. Ms. Collins' nasal voice and affected pronunciations distract the &quot;reader&quot; from the content!"},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"I recently purchased a book titled The Art of Taking Minutes by Delores Dochterman. It had been years since I had taken minutes for an important group. Well, today was my first day and I was not sure what I would do. I went to amazon.com and purchased this book about taking minutes. It was fantastic! It helped me with all arrangements before the meeting, it explained a quorum, a proxy, gave agenda formats (with samples), talked about meeting calendars, ideas of what to do while taking the minutes, to -- my favorite part -- how to say it with phrases. This is my bible at work. It is a must for all executive assistances that take minutes for committees, ad hoc groups, all the way to the trustee meetings. Don't waste your time trying to figure out what to say or what you may have missed in preparation, just buy The Art of Taking Minutes. You will not regret it and your boss will thank you."},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"I purchased this book many years ago after graduating from college. My degree was in office administration and there were no training courses or discussions regarding taking minutes at meetings. I had landed a job that required taking minutes at various board, committee, task force meetings (out of town and locally). The book was very helpful to me in terms of how to take minutes, organizing my minutes on paper, and avoiding redundancy (especially using the &quot;How to Say It&quot; section). I received many compliments on my ability to take &quot;good&quot; minutes. It's been over ten years since I've had that job. I now have another job where I am required to take minutes. At first, I was a little panic stricken because I had not taken minutes in over ten years. Then I remembered this book that had been so helpful to me in the past and starting referring to it once again. It is a very valuable resource for anyone taking minutes."},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"I purchased this book immediate after I graduated from college with a business degree in Office Administration and did not know how to take minutes at the major meetings that I was required to attend on the job. This book has done wonders for me and I've received many compliments because of the way I have prepared my minutes using this book(especially the phrases suggested in &quot;How to Say It&quot;). It is a &quot;must have&quot; reference for anyone taking minutes."},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"This book looks as though it was typed on a typewriter. Although the information is not obsolete, the style and format certainly are. The information in this book was not anything most of you don't already know (book a meeting room? Duh!). Most of the information on how to book a room, schedule a meeting, etc., totally depends on the company you are working for. There was nothing in this book that &quot;sparked&quot; the task of taking minutes."},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"This is a great reference book for those of us taking meeting minutes! It contains lots of useful information at my fingertips. I particularly liked the \\"How To Say It\\" section. No more overusing the same words for me. My minutes sound much more professional now. Great Find!"},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"Waste of money. There are a number of mistakes in the book. \\"Old Business\\" has not been used for over 30 years. It is \\"Unfinished Business\\". The Agenda items are not listed correctly and items missing. There are more accurate books on minutres. Suggest to do some research before buying and make sure you receive the correct information. The writer should of done some homework."},{"Title":"Art of Taking Minutes","review":"I take Minutes for 3 different organizations and approximately 50 meetings a year. I wanted to learn to keep more professional Minutes and anything else that would make the job easier. This book is very easy to follow and has many examples of Agendas, Minutes and other helpful ideas to keep you organized. As I was scanning the book for the first time, I found several tips that I immediately put to work. These tips alone were worth the book. This is a valuable tool."},{"Title":"Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology (Greenwood Technographies)","review":"In a concise manner, the author gives a history of rocketry and missiles. Starting with black powder used by the Chinese. But then rapidly the narrative passes to the Europeans, who used and improved it in their interminable wars. Naturally, most of the book is about the 20th century. Relating the advances made by both sides in World War 2.Then in the Cold War, rockets become exoatmospheric. Some were used for research, to carry satellites into orbit, or launch probes into high altitudes. But others were ICBMs. The book relates the frantic arms race between the US and Soviet Union, with Britain, France and China playing only bit parts.The space race is described, where we see the massive Saturn 5s that were used to launch moon missions.Unfortunately, if you read between the lines, progress in rocket propulsion has largely stalled. The end of the Cold War removed one major motivation. But also, the chemical and mechanical technologies appear to have plateaued, leaving us with still every high launch costs per kilo of payload."},{"Title":"Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology (Greenwood Technographies)","review":"This book offers a interesting overview of the history of rocket technology in the 20th century. Some technical details of the technology are also presented.Of particular interests are the vivid accounts of Apollo spacecraft, Space Shuttle, Intercontinental ballistic missiles, Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Tactical guided Patriot missiles, Missile defense and Arms control.Missiles have evolved in the past decades and major changes have been made in their design. In contrast, improvements of the propulsion systems have been incremental only. However, the robot probe (Deep Space 1) was launched by an innovative propulsion system (a small ion engine) to study comet Borredly in 1998. This technology demonstrator may be evaluated for use on future spacecraft!"},{"Title":"Bootleg: The Rise & Fall of the Secret Recording History","review":"I collect bootlegs and I bought both this book and Heylin's second book, Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry. Sadly, I would have saved money if I had only purchased one book or the other, as both books contain identical (seriously, word for word identical) material. Granted, there is *some* (albeit nominal) difference between the two books but the repetition is so extensive that I feel like I was hosed."},{"Title":"Bootleg: The Rise & Fall of the Secret Recording History","review":"This should be considered the Bible for those of us who are compelled to seek out live recordings & studio outtakes in addition to (or sometimes instead of) the officially released \\"product\\". BOOTLEG is exhaustively researched, providing a fascinating overview of the bootleg recording industry (for lack of a better term). I've been collecting bootlegs for almost 20 years, but it turns out that I knew very little about the history of bootlegging (not to mention the details of how bootleg records / CDs came to be pressed and distributed). I can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"Bootleg: The Rise & Fall of the Secret Recording History","review":"Bootlegs! To the vinyl aficionado, who thinks that music should be clear and concise, bootlegs provide sounds that make them wince. To the music aficionado, who sits on the edge of his seat waiting to hear the next note no matter the clicks and hisses of the vinyl, bootlegs provide honesty and visions of the music maker. Heylin's thought provoking history of bootlegs fills the reader with the hopes of acquiring a collection of this soul swelling music ripped into a piece of vinyl. I began collecting \\"boots\\" quite a few years ago, together with copies of Hot Wacks. Heylin's Bootleg is the definitive history of a time when the music meant more than the artist or label. I applaud Heylin for being the master scribe for the genre!"},{"Title":"Bootleg: The Rise & Fall of the Secret Recording History","review":"I own many of the different releases mentioned in the book, both vinyl and CD. It was fun to finally know what the story was behind many of the bootleg releases. If you collected bootlegs in the 70's and 80's you might find this book very informative. Fun easy read. Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Bootleg: The Rise & Fall of the Secret Recording History","review":"Very much takes the view that Bootlegging is just as much about making available unreleased music as it is about making illegal cash.The author rightly points out that the Internet and downloading put more old time bootleggers out of business than the RIAA."},{"Title":"13 User-Friendly Bible Study Lessons: Based on the International Sunday School Lessons (Broadman Comments, December 1999-January, February 2000)","review":"In this continuation of a wonderfully written series of Bible study guides, Dean and staff have once again done an outstanding service for God and for Christians everywhere. If you are alone, or in a small study group, Dean's work will guide you as you walk with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The book is extremely well organized, easy to read and follow, and provides an excellent foundation for Bible study sessions. In this series, we follow the gospel of Matthew and are given thoughtful insight into the holy scriptures. The book is chock full of useful suggestions for the leader or instructor, and comes complete with pronunciation guides and suggested group activities. A must if you are considering leading a bible study."},{"Title":"Spectroscopy for Surface Science","review":"The book covers the gamut of spectroscopic techniques available to analyse an interface (surface) between two substances. The techniques are non-destructive. Often, the aim is to study the surface composition. This is especially true in the important case where one substance is a fluid, typically air, and the other substance is a solid. Do oxide layers form in such a situation, for example? Do molecules from the air clump onto the surface?Most of the cases considered have a subject that is flat. This enables spectroscopy with specular reflections, as opposed to diffuse reflections from rough surfaces. Plus, when you get specular reflections, you might also get refracted transmission inside the target substance. And possible the excitation of surface plasmons on the surface, for example. Under such circumstances, we get nice instances of applied electromagnetic theory."},{"Title":"Radiation protection: A guide for scientists and physicians","review":"Great book, even though not the most recent edition. Condition was as described by seller. Arrived by promised date."},{"Title":"The Secret Road","review":"This book is very good, though it wasn't a book that I raced through and couldn't put down I found it very interesting and enjoyed it immensely. &quot;The Secret Road&quot; is written about the secret service back in the time of George Washington. There are a group of people who feel so strongly for their country that they risk their lives every day. The best part about this book is that a lot of it is true. It is fascinating to know that that the characters were real. It was an interesting read and I suggest that if you like historical fiction, there are a lot of other GREAT books out there. But if your interested in how secret service started, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"The Secret Road","review":"This wasn't the best written book I've ever read. It seems to have been written for a youth audience, not overly sophisticated writing, but a good story nonetheless. For the history purist, there are a few inconsistencies, such as words like \\"holographic\\" in normal conversation, and none of the genteel language one would expect from the late 1700's. Putting those details aside, though, it had some interesting information on the secret communications that kept the revolution going. I'd give it about 3-1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"Dan Holden captures in print the human emotions that we each experience as we live each day. Through his own life experience, he gives the reader an account of discovering the realities of life - both beautiful and harsh, and then explains in a most profound and powerful way, how each of us has the ability to travel through life's experiences and not only survive, but to become better, happier, and more fulfilled. &quot;Lost Between Lives&quot; takes the reader on an emotional and spiritual journey towards reaching an understanding of life and to appreciate each moment we are given - and thus live life to the fullest!"},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"Lost Between Lives is a self-help guide to coping with terrible devastation, whether physical or emotional - illness, injury, job loss, divorce, or the death of a loved one. Chapters stress the strength in acknowledging that some forces are simply beyond one's ability to control, the value in focusing on what one can change, and the importance of letting go of the raw desire that is so heavily instilled within Americans since early childhood. One does not need to be a Buddhist to realize how acutely excessive desire can rob one of the pleasures of life; Lost Between Lives goes a step further and demonstrates how living fully in the moment can help one come to truly enjoy the precious experiences of each and every day. A practical and spiritual guide to resiliance and growth through self-improvement."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"I mentioned to a friend that I was in \\"transition\\" and he mentioned Dan's book, Lost Between Lives and I thought \\"Lost? I'm not lost...I'm just on a new path that isn't clear yet\\". I bought and read the book in spite of the fact that the dramatic title didn't seem to match my own experience of where I was. I am so glad I did. Dan's quiet generosity of spirit is on every page. It's an extraordinary book full of gentle wisdom and timely new perspectives. If you are in \\"transition\\" this book is a wonderful resource. You will not be the same person when you are done reading it."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"I found this book to be quite provocative, it had me thinking about things that I've not given much thought to before. There was an interesting balance between pragmatic and ethereal thought. I enjoyed the practical advice which was filled with wisdom as well as the more astral ideas of guidance and higher self. The book was written with honesty and candor. I also appreciated the sharing of the author's personal experiences, which makes us all feel that we too can tap into sources of greater consciousness within ourselves."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"Dan Holden's extraordinary book came to my attention at just the right time! The light had gone out in my own journey and this gem of a book became the flashlight that opened the way for me to re-emerge into a new relationship with my life experience. Writing from his own experience, Holden's passage through his inner terrain is at once a singular journey that also points the way toward the journey we must all undertake. The reward is that bittersweet experience of the spiritual warrior. Thanks, Dan, for sharing your path and marking the opening for us all!"},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"Dan is talking about a journey that I believe more and more people in our culture are embarking on without any preparation or roadmap. I highly recommend this book for anyone who feels they are lost in uncharted territory as their former way of living slips or even crashes behind them.I first read this book when, in my own life, I felt \\"lost between lives.\\" I couldn't go back (and in my case I didn't want to), but I didn't know how to move forward. And what was worse, I didn't trust where I was. I wanted \\"it\\" to be over already. I was suffering.Dan's book gave me comfort as he shared some of the now familiar stages and challenges of his own journey. No, I was not crazy. He understood. He'd been there. He offered both a loving, spiritual perspective about the shifts that typically occur, as well as some very practical guidance for living through this time.It was the perfect book for me and I suspect it will be for some of you."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"There are times in life when the \\"big picture \\"has dramatically changed. The future is unclear, frightening and the rules for running your life are gone. This book speaks to those unnerving times and lets you know how to trust yourself and open your inner resources to navigate the changes. For me it provided companionship, hope and the strength from one who had been there as support in my own, ultimately successful, journey."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"In this unique and valuable guidebook Dan Holden shares the fruits of his own \\"dark night of the soul.\\" A highly successful consultant, psychologist and executive coach, he went through a period of major challenges in his own business and personal life that led him to personal breakthroughs - experiences that required him to come to terms with his own \\"sacred self.\\" Dan has turned that experience into a map of the stages in the journey, sharing insights, tips and helpful pointers for those of us who confront similar challenges. At one level, the book is a collection of guideposts along the difficult pathway through major, life-changing transitions. This book resonates powerfully for those in corporate life at a career or personal crossroads who may be seeking tools for survival, deeper self-knowledge or a way to join with spirit to address their crisis. I know of no other book that combines these elements - honest self-disclosure, a clear picture of the challenges such transitions present, deep wisdom, and practical guidance on how to engage with one's own spiritual nature to navigate the passage."},{"Title":"Lost Between Lives: Finding Your Light When the World Goes Dark","review":"I found Holden's angle on accessing and using the wisdom that's already inside of us to be not only refreshing, but, maybe more importantly, practical.As I read I found myself saying, \\"Here's a guy who's been hit with some pretty tough stuff, is willing to share it frankly and openly, and has figured out a way to get through it and come out better than he went in. Hey, I want to know how to do that!\\"I guess the thing that impressed me most was his honesty and the lack of agenda. I didn't get the idea he was trying to sell me anything. He just had something that worked for him and it was customizable to make it work for me.All in all, I felt I ended up with a new way to look at life that left me feeling positive and encouraged."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"It seems that Mr. Landes tried a bit too hard to write a book rather then an article. If a good editor worked on this it would have been an intersting article for a magazine such as Smithsonian. Although I bought the book because of seeing if there was any historical perspective, I found that it lacked detail that would have made me connect or say wow."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"Contrary to the other reviewers, I thought this was a worthwhile and interesting read. The subject matter is compelling given that, as Landes points out, many of the great companies of the world start out as family run and were handed down within the family for at least two more generations.Landes rather convincingly shows that while long term adaptation requires shifting to professional management, the family-run model holds unique advantages that explains the critical early success of the enterprise. Loyalty, passion for the business, esprit de corps, willingness to re-invest in the business, and long-term thinking are all characteristics of the family-run business. Professional management tend to think in more short-sighted ways and the shift from the family as well as the alientation brought on by the big money paid professional managers can seriously erode morale.All of which raises the issue of why we tolerate the compensation structures of professional managers. It would seem preferable to restructure financial incentives to reward long-term thinking. Perhaps we should think about lower salaries that don't completely alienate the rest of the workforce as well as stock options or deferred compensation tied to long-term corporate performance.Landes is thoughtful and entertaining and has wonderful anecdotes. The portrayals of Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller are all very striking and amusing.I recommend it."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"You know the names: Rothschild, Rockefeller, Ford, Toyota, Guggenheim. Yet, economists rarely analyze the impact of family enterprises. Bestselling author and scholar David S. Landes corrects this imbalance with his study of 11 enduring, influential dynasties. He defines a dynasty as a successful business held within one family's control for at least three generations. Family companies, even immense ones, often follow a predictable pattern: First, an ambitious, clever, hard-working patriarch, and, perhaps, his children, found a big, profitable business. Then, the following generations spend the accumulated wealth instead of adding to it. Yet, there are fascinating anomalies within this model - from amazing philanthropy to bad apples. The dramas behind family ties that unravel (or knit more strongly) in the face of big money make each chapter read like an absorbing novel. Sometimes Landes' attempt to track every branch of a family tree can leave the reader out on a limb, yet getAbstract warmly recommends this entertaining work to anyone with an interest in history, economics or family dynamics."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"David Landes has written one - not only in my opinion, I believe - of the \\"must read\\" book of all times: ''The wealth and poverty of Nations'' . Based on this, You can tell the amount of expectation on every single line he writes, and \\"Dynasties\\" unfortunately does not help at all. The book is too long, too superficial, and some times it was really hard to keep on reading. If you are looking for something to chat on cocktails and/or with your colleagues at the cafeteria - there are some interesting stuf in here. In the other hand, if you are looking for some analysis on the familiar enterprises and their evolution (organizational, structural, etc.) - search somewhere else."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book. I kept thinking the book would get more interesting but nothing kept my attention. Part two on automobiles was probably the most interesting part but I still nearly put the book away to read others. I was not impressed with the author's style of writing. He seems to have a fascination with one or two words sentences which became very annoying. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"I bought David Landes' \\"Dynasties\\" expecting alot more than I finally got from reading what might best be described as potted histories of some of the most illustrious business families in the world. With the exception of Toyota, the others were not surprisingly either American or European. The highlights and most memorable stories were about the rise (and fall ?) of the business empires of Rothschild (merchant banking), Ford (automobile), Toyota (automobile) and Rockefeller (resources). The others were either too cursorily handled or laden with anecdotally tantalizing bits that otherwise lacked substance or more weighty research that may reasonably be expected of a book such as this. Inevitably, most of these stories would start promisingly but start to diffuse midway before sliding all too quickly to their unsatisfactory end.In writing these chapters, Landes seem to think that the genesis of these business empires is all that would intrigue us readers. Why do I believe that ? Because more often than not in these stories, he would race through the last 50 years suggesting that this must be the most ordinary of times when nothing could be further from the truth. Surely, the dynamics and changes in global business trends in the past two decades must make this among the most tumultuous of times and how these empires have coped or not coped with these external forces surely deserve more page space than they are given. For this reason, the stories feel incomplete, which is a shame because \\"Dynasties\\" could have been a far better book than what we've got."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"Certainly not a book for an ambitious manager in a hurry, but for guys who can lean back for a few hours and have time to contemplate: it's a very good read.Landes' focus is very big business. But standing back - the patterns he describes are applicable to all kinds of families and - presumably - concern most of us.Landes describes these family patterns extremely well, looks closely at religious aspects too. It's this comprehensive view which renders his book so interesting."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"It lays out the history of some prominent family run business and how history and the corporate worlds affected these extremely successful family businesses."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book which, aside from being poorly written, edited and proofread, presents interesting information in a less than interesting way. It isn't easy to discern the author's personal opinions from fact and there is no consistent flow in how the subjects are treated. The book would be easier to read if the author had followed a consistent methodology to present the historical relevance and purpose for the families he chose and had discussed each one in the same way. Instead, the subjects are treated haphazardly and the addition of personal opinion and trivia makes what could be an interesting discourse rather boring."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"'Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes in the World's Great Family Businesses' did not measure up to my expectations and was not consistently interesting. By omitting some of the world's most fascinating dynasties, David Landes has missed an opportunity to entertain his readers. For example, the famous Oppenheimer dynasty surely merits a mention in a work of this nature? Ernest Oppenheimer established the Anglo American Corporation in 1917 and also gained control of the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company, which was originally founded by Cecil Rhodes in 1888. De Beers subsequently became an international cartel under Ernest Oppenheimer. His diamond empire continued to expand under the control of his son, Harry Frederick Oppenheimer - a leading opponent of the South African apartheid system - and grandson, Nicky Oppenheimer, the present chairman of the company. The background to the struggle to gain control of the diamond monopoly in Kimberley would have made interesting reading.I feel that this book, despite its interesting theme, would have benefited from a better selection of material."},{"Title":"Dynasties: Fortunes and Misfortunes of the World's Great Family Businesses","review":"This book details 13 dynastic businesses. It is divided into three sections, which cover; banking, automobiles, and raw materials (oil, mining, refining and metals production). Each section is divided into chapters covering a different dynasty or in the case of French automobile manufactures, three dynasties. British, European, American and one Japanese company are profiled.Professor Landes defines a dynasty as \\"... a succession of at least three generations of a family business, marked by continuity of identity and interest.\\" The book consists mostly of short biographies of these dynasties, with some common themes, namely; the advantages and disadvantages of a dynastic business compared to a publicly owned company, and the extent to which the families have remained in control of the businesses versus having to turn control over to outside experts. The chief advantages of a dynastic business are in the passion that successors may bring to the management of the business, the support that the various heirs may give to one another, and the prominence of a family name that can connote quality and stability. When this passion, support, and good family name exist, the dynasty can thrive, but when absent the business gets into trouble. The story of almost all of the dynasties that are discussed is one of an eventual loss of family control, either through a lack of interest or poor family management. Outsiders bring in talents that the family does not possess, but they also tend to lack the passion for the company as an entity, as opposed to just being a vehicle that can enrich the outside manager. Professor Landes also makes the case that dynastic firms can be a very good choice for developing countries if they are committed to their country as well as to the business. In contrast, multinational firms are generally interested in repatriating profits and not in building up the local economy, unless that can also reap profits that can be returned to the parent company.The writing is interesting and entertaining and I liked this book, but with some reservations. I had the feeling, supported by the concluding chapter that refers to a few events that are not covered in the book, that the initial draft of the book was longer, but that the book was reduced to a more saleable size. This view was also supported by the omission of a few important and widely known events that are not mentioned in the book. For instance, there is no mention of the aborted Edsel division of the Ford motor company. The attempt, in the late 1950's, to honor Henry Ford's son and the father of the then current chairman Henry Ford II, was a dismal failure for a variety of reasons. The surprising thing is that it is not mentioned in the book, in spite of its intimate involvement with the Ford dynasty. Another surprising omission is that of the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company.I recommend this book to those interested in biography, business and economic history."},{"Title":"Kate Culhane: A Ghost Story (Signed)","review":"I love Michael Hague's art so I usually snap up anything he does. In this book which is a retelling of a mid-nineteenth century ghost story from Ireland, Hague is in his usual great form with the illustrations. This is a spooky tale with some pretty ghastly imagery that Hague really nails. While visiting the new grave of her mother, poor Kate Culhane accidently steps on another nearby grave and becomes the unwilling servant of its inhabitant as a result. The ghost is a vampire of sorts and requires her to cut her boyfriend and mix some of his blood in with some oatmeal and eat it. See what I mean? Yucky! Kate is a clever girl, however, and she figures a way out of this mess but not until she's really gone through a lot of trauma. Please don't read this to any little kids until you've checked it out yourself. It really is a no-holds-barred ghost story and a good one but I would rather see Hague illustrate a scary story that doesn't have bloody oatmeal in it. But that's just me...."},{"Title":"SAT II Success Literature, 2nd ed (Peterson's SAT II Success Literature)","review":"This has a decent coverage of the basics of most of what you need to know for the test, but its sample tests are horrible.

Once I read the last page my mouth was wide open. I am in the military and I have heard about a lot of these issues and yes they are out there and Ms. Thompson brought them to light. She did the damn thing with this book."},{"Title":"Knockin Boots (A Novel)","review":"Once again, fourth time novelist, Tracy Price-Thompson has drawn the reader into a captivating and compelling storyline with her latest novel, Knockin' Boots. Price-Thompson continues to demonstrate that she can creatively craft a story and write outside of the box no matter the plot/theme. In her latest release, she takes the reader on a wild and wicked sexcapade as she allows one to experience the wild-freaky side of sexual rendezvous via friends, lovers and spouses.Set against a military backdrop (Fort Dix, NJ), Price-Thompson demonstrates that once the uniforms come off, the blinds are shut, the bedcovers are turned down, there is no telling who might be knockin' boots with whom. But as the old clich&eacute; goes \`what is done in the dark will come to the light' and sometimes what is exposed might be embarrassing, explosive, deadly and unfortunately very addictive.Knockin' Boots is a plot-driven storyline with colorful and memorable characters, edgy dialogue, and sometimes steamy and erotic but definitely raw and raunchy sex scenes. Disclaimer: If you do not like in your face booty call scenes then this might not be the book for you. Filled with taboo and sensitive subject matters, Knockin' Boots touches on any sexual escapade you can envision; if you can imagine it is probably included in the storyline. However, as is Price-Thompson's tradition, when you look beyond the surface, there is generally a social message present.Despite her latest novel being fun, sexy, raw, edgy, and at times racy, she does not disappoint in leaving us a message to ponder long after the last page is read. If you are looking for a book with plenty of juicy sex scenes, but also a well-written storyline, then check out Knockin' Boots by Tracy Price-Thompson. It is definitely hot and guaranteed to make the most frigid reader warm.I do not generally like to compare authors to other authors, and readily admit that Price-Thompson is a talented author with her own style who needs no comparison to others. However, I highly recommend Knockin' Boots to Zane fans and believe that after reading Price-Thompson's latest release these same readers will want to pick up her other books.Reviewed by YasminAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Knockin Boots (A Novel)","review":"Hi everyone.This is Kola Boof, author of \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" and a few other books.

Emile will date only White women, and has nothing but feelings of contempt and disgust for his African-American sisters. But he has no problem \\"faking the funk\\" to line his pockets at his side hustle....Brother Kevin is just the opposite. He loves Black women...and can't get enough of them. Kevin's sexual appetite seems to be in overdrive...but in wife Fancy he has most certainly found his sexual soulmate. Fancy, however, doesn't appear to be honoring her marital commitments...or so it seems to everyone on the military base. No one can figure out why Kevin doesn't rein in his lovely wife....what exactly can be going on here?Scandalous title and hot cover notwithstanding, I figured that anything written by this author has got to have some substance.....and I was not wrong. Although full of hot sex and drama, this tale is extremely well-written, and addresses important, even life-threatening topics that exist in the Black community today. This is a great book....exactly what I have come to expect from Ms. Price-Thompson. An absolute must read.DYB"},{"Title":"Knockin Boots (A Novel)","review":"This is my first time reading from Tracy Price-Thompson and this novel was very entertaining to read. I don't know why it took me so long to grab hold of this book but I'm glad that I did. It was easy for me to understand the atmosphere of this book being that I'm a military spouse. While reading this book I know that a lot of secretive things go on in the military and in life period. It is really a good read but was also a little bit far fetched even though this story is fiction.The novel begins with a sassy wit, but becomes increasingly serious towards the end this novel. Brothers Kevin and Emile are soldiers stationed at Fort Dix, and though they've made a success of themselves, it was a hard-won victory with a price. Traumatized by their foster mother Dirty Sue, Kevin is now a sex addict and Emile is a self-hating black man who'll only be seen on the arm of a white woman. Trouble is not far off as Kevin pushes his wife Fancy into more and more sordid scenarios (he emails her with the evening's instructions, usually involving some stranger who fits into any one of Kevin's given fantasies) and Emile degrades every black woman in his command, including Fancy's best friend Sparkle. Miss Sparkle is all that and then some, but when her friendship with Phil (a fellow soldier, but white) starts to heat up, she has to question everything that's important to her regarding family, race and identity. To tell you the truth I did not like Emile and I wanted so bad for him to get slapped. Kevin, now he needed Jesus.I'll admit that I was disappointed when the book came to an end...I wanted to know more. At the end, Tracy Price-Thompson allows you to draw your own conclusions about the future of the characters. The author explores some provocative issues (from threesomes to brothers on the \\"down low.\\") but it's the sex talk that carries the book. Frisky and erotically honest, occasionally the language slips into the realm of silliness. Sexy fun, lewd language and a little bit of reflection on sex and race in America.This is a must read for any adult who enjoys reading and not scared to possibly see a little of themselves in her characters. If you have any affiliation w/the military or enjoy black erotica, grab this book ASAP!"},{"Title":"Knockin Boots (A Novel)","review":"After the success of her latest book, A Woman's Worth, Tracy Price-Thompson returns to the literary scene with yet another well-written, fast-paced story which immediately draws in the reader. But unlike her last book, which I have no doubt will become a classic, KNOCKIN' BOOTS takes on a whole different view on life, love, and sacrifice and will appeal to those affiliated with the military, fans of erotica, and simply readers who love a good book.KNOCKIN' BOOTS centers around four people: military man Kevin Lawson, his brother Emile Pinchback, Kevin's wife Fancy and her best friend Sparkle Henderson. Kevin presents the image of the perfect man and on the surface appears to treat his wife with love and respect. Fancy on the other hand is viewed as a hot-mama who consorts with men other than her husband, but unbeknownst to many, she's acting via the request of Kevin. She does things for Kevin that will leave your mouth open, some she even finds herself enjoying, yet it bothers her that he has requested these things of her. Emile is a character you'll love to hate. He loathes black women and all he feels they represent, so on his arm is a white woman who he showers with presents and affection, all as a means of making himself feel more important. Sparkle is a beautiful woman and knows it. She flaunts what she has and has no objections to making it known what she's after; yet when she finds a good thing, she runs from it. From one instance to the next, scene after scene, this plot-driven novel is a much-needed cautionary twist on sexual addiction and the impact it has on the lives of those involved. It is an erotic, witty, and an eye-opening read.Price-Thompson is a writer you can't fit neatly in a box, in one genre. This recent Hurston-Wright Award winner is an author to be watched. Her writing is diverse and touches various subject areas and themes, but there is no doubt about it, she can write. While I totally loved A Woman's Worth, KNOCKIN' BOOTS is a book that I feel will be well-received by the literary industry and shows her ability to \\"mix it up\\".Reviewed by Tee C.

It depicts and describes all of the world's principal military aircraft produced from the outbreak of World War I to the present day. There are 800 types in all, ranging from fighters and bombers to reconnaissance planes and trainers, with 1,706 airplanes shown in color, 16 color charts, 252 photographs, 772 cutaway drawings, and seven color diagrams. Full-color illustrations are paired with capsule descriptions that provide extensive technical information on each plane, including insignia, manufactere, type, year, engine wingspan, length, height, weight, maximum speed, ceiling, rancge, armament, and crew.The extraordinary graphics include:*Dramatic gate-fold illustrations--such as a four-page fold-out with minutely detailed color drawings of the 88 principal bombers of World War II, ranging from Japan's tiny Yokosuka Ohka 11 to America's jumbo Boeing B-29 Superfortress, from Germany's Junkers Ju.86 to Russia's Tupolev TB-3.*Major diagrams, on two-page spreads, which minutely detail individual models by presenting a cutaway view of the plane in color, with up to 100 parts numbered and keyed to an index adjacent to the diagram.An informative text traces the development of military aircraft through the years, including such background information as production costs, quantities produced, strengths and weaknesses, and impact on aerial warfare.This is the definitive reference, prepared over a period of six years by the same creative group responsible for Rand McNally's highly acclaimed \\"Color Illustrated Guide\\" aircraft series."},{"Title":"The Rand McNally Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft 1914-1980","review":"If you have seen Jane's All the World's Aircraft, then you have an idea of what this book is like, but this book is done much nicer.

His theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are known as \\"genetic epistemology\\".He writes in his Foreword to the Second Edition, \\"This work ... was followed byThe Construction of Reality in the Childand was to have been completed by a study of the genesis of imitation in the child ... these works form one entity dedicated to the beginnings of intelligence, that is to say, to the various manifestations of sensorimotor intelligence and to the most elementary forms of expression. The theses developed in this volume ... concern in particular the formation of the sensorimotor schemata and the mechanism of mental assimilation...\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"Intelligence presents, on the contrary, a remarkable continuity with the acquired or even inborn process on which it depends and at the same times makes use of.\\"\\"But the great psychological lesson of these beginnings of behavior is that, within the limits we have just defined, the experimental trial of a reflex mechanism already entails the most complicated accommodations, assimilations and individual organizations. Accommodation exists because, even without retaining anything from the envirionment as such, the reflex mechanism needs the environment.\\"\\"Association and habit form the automatization of an activity which functionally prepares intelligence while yet differing from it by a more elementary structure.\\"\\"In short, the theory of pure groping makes of the discovery of new procedures a simple accommodation, thus neglecting the formal coordination belonging to assimilation: hence this theory is analogous to an empiricism ascribing invention to experience alone and neglecting the activity of the mind.\\"\\"We are consequently confronted by the most delicate problem which any theory of intelligence has to treat: that of the power of invention.\\"\\"In short, at every level, experience is necessary to the development of intelligence.\\"\\"(I)f experience appears to be one of the conditions necessary to the development of intelligence, study of the first stages of that development invalidates the empirical conception of experience.\\"\\"Also, experience is never simply passive receptiveness: it is active accomodation, correlative to assimilation.\\""},{"Title":"The Origins of Intelligence in Children","review":"This book is being used for my PhD work and has been a great source of information regarding Jean Piaget's work on human development."},{"Title":"Prehistoric Europe: An Illustrated History","review":"I expected the book to be somewhat uneven in quality since it has 11 authors and 13 chapters with each chapter written by one individual. But the chapters on the Neolithic era are particularly weak. These chapters divide Europe into the southeast region, the southwest, etc., at the same moment in time, without showing movements of people and cultures into different regions at somewhat later or earlier times. The regions are just arbitrary compass points; they don't reflect the significance of transportation along coasts and rivers, for instance. Within a region the presentation does little to distinguish the agricultural people near the coasts from less settled or highland people living further inland. The coverage of Iberia is flimsy at best, and too brief. The account of the bell-beaker people is totally confusing. I could go on. On the other hand, the chapters surrounding the era of the Romans are really great. (But I didn't buy a book entitled &quot;Prehistory&quot; to read about that era.) As far as the book's illustrations go, there are over 10,000 dolmens and other prehistoric megalithic monuments in Western Europe today, but the book has just a single photograph of one, and that particular one happens to be covered with earth, the photograph is taken from the air, and all you see is a mere mound of grass. Reviewing the illustrations as a whole, some of them are worthless, but the majority are well worthwhile pictures of weapons, drinking vessels, jewelry, statues, etc. A few of them are in color. There are also some maps. Maps can be a great help in presenting findings in a work like this, but the book doesn't utilize maps as much as it should (and again the Neolithic and Bronze ages are the weakest in this regard)."},{"Title":"Prehistoric Europe: An Illustrated History","review":"I read this book through once, and have read the second half again. I found it very difficult to keep track of different tribes and their movements from Central Asia, into the Balkans and onward. Some of the contributors wrote extremely clearly and their chapters were easy to follow, Others, including the editor, made me cringe. I nearly put the book down while reading the introduction and had to resist taking a red pen to the text. I found the description of the rise of metallurgy interesting although oversimplified. No mention was made of small indigenous metal working. I also agree with the previous reviewer on the confusing description of bell beaker pottery and the use of this style of pottery. Having found bell beaker shards, I would like to know more about the spread and use of this highly decorative and stylized pottery."},{"Title":"Wild Texas Wind","review":"I liked this story because Rebekah proves to be a very strong and determined individual in having to overcome her internal struggles.

It's a pleasure reading both poets I know and those I'm unfamiliar with.So, why four stars instead of five? It's based on a design choice in the book. The book does not have running page heads. This might not matter in a novel (though I can't think of any novels that I own that don't have running heads), but is very annoying in an anthology -- especially a poetry anthology. Like most people, I don't read poetry anthologies from start to finish. Instead, I pick it up and flip through it. But with this book, you open to an unfamiliar poem and want to know who the poet is. Look to the running head -- but there is no running head. So you have to start paging back, until you come to the name of the poet. Annoying.But otherwise, I'd heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Three Centuries of American Poetry","review":"I saw this on a friends bookshelf and had to have my own.

It covers everything from specific machine setup, gas pressures and welding techniques to the shade of eyeshield lens that should be used. There are also dedicated sections on weld defects and probable causes which assist in overcoming welding technique and equipment setup faults. I found the book to be excellent value for money and to contain most of the useful information found in other books available on this subject, presented in a format that does not require the reader to wade through pages of text to find the information required.

The only thing missing is my testimonial. I have one relative who had several months of obsessive compulsive prayer episodes in conjunction with a head injury. The episodes cleared up on their own with the added twist that the victim has no memory of them. And, I have another relative who died on an operating table who will tell you how much one should believe in NDE's and how it changed her outlook on life...how she can be at peace with herself and how she doesn't fear death anymore...yet her day to day actions and attitudes not only do not reflect this but are often downright unpleasent. As for the style in which the book is written,use of multiple examples of such things as various religions, gods, or practices is helpful to those who may not be aware of their existence, their correct context or to those in need of exact references.

In his frustration with the different religions, he tried mind-altering drugs with no productive results. After years of these attmepts failed and a bad acid trip scrambled his brain, he sought out the medical/scientific answers to the questions, &quot;What is spirituality? What is the human soul? and Where is the source of the human soul and human spirituality?&quot;At great length, the book details the sociological, the philosophical, and the scientific results of his quest to find the source of the common human experience we call spirituality and true nature of the human soul.Alper's conclusion is anticlimactic (at best) and (it is evident to this reviewer) he hasn't searched in the right places for the answers he seeks.The most interesting aspect of the book is never fully explored... When Alper identifies the exact region of the brain that demonstrates hightened activity during prayer and meditation, he fails to explore the fact that observant Jews have practiced a custom for more than 3,300 years relating to the same region of the brain he discusses breifly. Apparently, he did not look deeply enough into the different world religions in search of God.The custom is called &quot;wearing Tefillin.&quot; But Tefillin are not mentioned once in this book.Perhaps if the author did more research and in the right directions, the book would answer some deeper philosophical and spiritual questions.

Because it was his experience then it must be true for the rest of humanity??? GUESS AGAIN. Why would Alper \\"FAIL TO OMIT\\" LSD research studies conducted by John Hopkins University. Is it possible that his conclusion would differ from the results of the worlds #1 research hospital.

In the Buddhist traditions there is as many as 8 levels of consciousness (heavens). Native American traditions talk about the 4 levels. The Christian bible mentions at least 3 heavens. In modern day physics, supestring theroy has identified at least 10 \\"fabrics\\" or parallel universes.In the true scientific method, the research results would dictate that any conclusions regarding the existance or nonexistance of God, someone like Alper would have travel to those other fabrics (universes) of superstring theory and come back with hard evidence that God does not reside in any of them.

It provides a nice introduction from Matthew Alper's perspective. The author attempts to introduce scientific method, but his methodology is pretty weak and only marginally effective at supporting his premise. So, although I feel God is a bio-neurological impulse-leaving Alper preaching to the choir of me-, I was left unimpressed. Moreover, he avoids many aspects where he could not formulate a strong argument, so I have to demerit his work there. I was really surprised to read all of the endorsements, insomuch I can not see how anyone could see this work as groundbreaking. All of this said, this is still a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This is not science. There are logical fallacies and quantum leaps throughout the book - interspersed with perhaps, maybe, possibly, apparently, probably, most likely and \\"I believe.\\" The author has a B.A. in philosophy and can't even seem to get that part right. For him to talk about neuroscience the way he does is insulting to me as a graduate student in neuroscience. I am convinced that he wrote this book first and then did a google search for quotes and articles that vaguely support it. Simply quoting scientific studies does not constitute science. He quotes Dawkins (an actual evolutionary biologist) and represents that he read \\"The Selfish Gene\\" but it is conspicuously missing from his bibliography - it is instead listed in the endnotes as a quote from a single page. The entire book reads this way. And, of course, there are at least a dozen E.O. Wilson quotes (\\"Excellent Reading\\" endorsement on the front cover) peppered in for good measure.The author talks about doing fMRI studies as if you can just pop someone into a machine and draw broad sweeping generalizations about the entire human population based on the results. The book ends with an addendum titled \\"Experiments That Might Help Prove The Existence Of A Spiritual Function\\" wherein he suggests an extremely ambitious longitudinal study consisting of fMRI's taken of one year olds followed up every year until they reach twenty years old - as if there is nothing to it. If the author is so interested in this field of study (he calls this book his life's work), why doesn't he use the profits from the book to finance a degree in neuroscience so he can do his own research? Most likely (if you're not satisfied with most likely don't read this book) he is not concerned with the science and is only interested in the money. His lack of actual scientific experience is painfully obvious and invalidates the entire book. I might have been able to put some of it aside if the author had conviction and stood behind his unsubstantiated claims, but he waffles the whole way through.The biggest problem is that the fundamental premise of the book is completely unfounded and the author does nothing to back it up. He claims that early humans, the only animals conscious of their own death, had to evolve some mechanism to deal with the utterly crippling anxiety this causes: \\"Living with certain knowledge of our imminent death leaves us in a perpetual state of anxiety. At every moment, we stand metaphorically face-to-face with a mountain lion from which there is no escape, staring straight into the jaws of death. Consequently, we are forced to live out our existences in a state of unrelenting mortal terror and dread.\\" Really? I do not believe in an afterlife, or anything spiritual, and I have no anxiety whatsoever about death. I used to have a lot of anxiety when I was younger and I was still inclined to believe in a spiritual realm. I would argue that this can actually cause more anxiety. Regardless, the author claims that this anxiety is so crippling that \\"nature\\" (he talks about nature throughout the book as if it were a conscious being guiding evolution toward its own end goal) had two choices - weed out the more intelligent, self-aware members of the species or select for spirituality, which would ease this anxiety. One of the first logical fallacies you learn about in an informal logic class (perhaps that wasn't a requirement for the author's B.A.) is a false dichotomy. Are these really the only two mechanisms by which humans could have survived the crippling, paralyzing, debilitating, suffocating anxiety caused by our awareness of death? If you are satisfied with this explanation then you don't need to read the book because all the author does is make this claim. If you can think of other possible explanations and believe that this is a gross oversimplification then you don't need to read the book because you will be as annoyed as I was.Should science have something to say about religion? Absolutely. This, however, is anything but science. If you have never read anything on the subject start with Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris or anyone else for that matter. If you're still looking for more you won't find it here. I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste any money on it. I just can't believe they carry this book while Buckman's \\"Can We Be Good Without God\\" is unavailable. I also can't believe that this book received some of the reviews and endorsements it did from seemingly intelligent and respectable scientists. Perhaps they were compensated for reading the book and didn't have time to actually dig in and find out there was nothing at the bottom.I read a few books on physics recently and I'm inclined to write a book myself on how quantum mechanics will eventually disprove God's existence. I think I could make a pretty convincing argument. Fortunately, I have too much respect for science - and the scientific community - to make unfounded claims based on my own intuition and sell it as science."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"&quot;clear, thoughtful, intensely rational...I was amazed by the sheer volume and obvious quality of material read and synthesized - a Herculean task...As a lawyer, I enjoyed the clarity and logical progression of the arguments...Although you present your theories in an accessible, easy to understand fashion, you demand the reader's active participation.

I can agree with that basic premise. But then in the last chapter of the book, we are asked to somehow simply wipe out millions of years of genetic programming and start living as if there never was a God. If we do this, the author says the world will be a better place. According to this book, the people who believe in God are the ones who are responsible for all of the wars, murder, violence, and all other unmentionable acts. Somehow or another these people who believe in God are also responsible for World War One and Two. I don't remember reading anything in my world history class about these being religious wars. In fact, correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that it was the scientists who developed missiles and the atomic bomb during WWII. When there were religious wars, they were fought mostly with spears and swords. If the next world war is a religious war, I think we can thank the technological warfare of science for taking away the spears and swords and putting nuclear weapons into the hands of religious zealots. My point is that there is enough blame to go around for everybody, but credit should also be given where it is due. Science had provided us with the medical technology to cure diseases, and save lives. Religion has provided meaning for people. We don't have to look too far back in history to find a society that was based upon the tenets of science, and prohibited religious practice. How soon we forget the Soviet Socialist Republic, the utopia for scientism. Is this the model for the Godless society? Rather than have believers in science trying to get rid of belief in religion, why not try to find common ground? That is just what Ken Wilber does in his book, The Marriage of Sense and Soul. I just saw some numbers in a poll(it was a scientific poll) showing that a larger per cent of Americans believe in God than ever before in history. We ain't going away anytime soon. We can't condemn all of the scientists for the misdeeds of some, nor can we condemn all of the believers in God for the misdeeds of some. The book argues that the direction of evolution is to grow away from God. Teilhard de Chardin, who happened to be not only a scientist, but a paleontologist and a priest, came to the conclusion that the purpose of evolution is to find our way *to* God. Readers of the &quot;God Part...&quot; might want to read Teilhard's &quot;The Future of Man.&quot; You will see how Teilhard starts out with the same scientific evidence that Alper does, but comes to a whole different conclusion."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Unscientific and purely speculative.

I'm an atheist, so I\\"d like to agree with him wholeheartedly, but you could also say, as I believe Chomsky said, that humans are hardwired for language in a way animals are not, yet this doesn't negate the fact that language, while culturally constructed, is a real phenomena and we are wired to receive it and acquire it quickly. I'm probably getting in over my head with my analogy, but I think it's worth considering. We humans create music, a cultural construction that is not found in the animal world, yet the phenomenon itself --- the sounds-- are a concrete reality. In fact, some deists might insist that because we are 'wired for God', so to speak, that in itself is proof of God. I wouldn't go that far; we can also be 'wired' for hallucinations and mental illness too. An interesting read and a worthwhile contemplation on a timeless subject; what makes Alper sympathetic is that he arrived to his conclusions as a result of a spiritual search, not a biased knee-jerk stance against religion, which I find a bit off-putting from folks like Hitchens (Mr. Caustic himself). And Richard Dawkins' book, \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" is a bit abstract for me; the statistical probability discussions of evolution just went right over my simpleton head.

It's honest and accessible. Other reviewers have made most of the many favorable comments that I would make. Those who gave this book a low rating exhibit their strong pro-God bias. There is no proof for the existence of a divine being. There is only the powerful human urge that Alper so logically describes that makes us see God where he is not. All of the negative reviews seem to be from people who cannot part with their religious beliefs. Can't Alper's book be read without religion's rose-tinted glasses?"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"The book opens as the author's personal quest to uncover the meaning behind, and origin of, the posited cross-cultural impulse to religiosity. As one can imagine, this endeavor might hardly not fit into one sole book, something especially notable in his one-chapter(!) summary of the history of the universe, but Alper makes it work in a very simplified, and thus, accessible manner, to the delight of this non-scientifically-oriented reviewer.His thesis, namely that religious belief surfaced in humans as a defensive mechanism meant to cope with humans' unique awareness of their own eventual demise, is brilliantly presented and slowly put together piece by piece in his second book, Intro to Biotheology. A main theme in this book is the negative side effects of those advantages we receive from nature. For example, pain and anxiety help to keep us alive by safeguarding us from things detrimental to our survival. Consciousness enhances our self-preservation by helping us to envision, and thus prepare for, tomorrow. However, given how consciousness greatly amplifies our foresight, the human condition is left in a state of perpetual fear when consciousness and anxiety are mixed, and we realize that, not only will we one day die, but also that any moment may be our last. Nature had to develop some sort of mechanism to shield us from these side effects.This is of course a very simple explanation to what indeed happened throughout our history as a species. Indeed, I give this book four stars instead of five because I feel that he can oversimplify his point. For example, at one point, he conjures up the image of newly self-aware proto-humans \\"looking down at their own hands, their own bodies, in awe of what they saw and... asking... \\"What is this that I am?...\\" In reality, this probably never took place, just as nature didn't really develop anything; humans who somehow developed a \\"pre-disposition to believe in or perceive an alternate reality, one that supersedes the limitations of this finite physical realm which can only offer us pain, suffering, and ultimately death\\" triumphed over other humans because their anxiety was relieved, and thus, they could return to perfecting survival and quality-of-life skills.The portion of the book that struck me the most was his description of the so-called ego function and transcendental function in humans. Alper cites the findings of a psychologist, Jean Piaget, who says that \\"humans are born without any recognizable sense of self.\\" (p. 145) As he develops, he begins to realize that he is \\"autonomous being\\" who must develop \\"a sense of responsibility\\" and \\"must learn to fend for himself\\" (p. 146). In other words, he develops an identity, an ego. Alper argues the ego is the \\"body's control center\\", \\"our body's personal manager\\" who is responsible for making our conscious decisions, and informs us of our life needs such as food, drink, or sleep. When the ego becomes aware that there is nothing it could do or seek to guard us against death, something Alper calls the \\"transcendental function\\" takes over, relieving our body's manager or captain of duty, so to speak. This, Alper claims, is the origin of the spiritual experience, that self-described sense of loss of self, absorption in something grander, being one with God, the cosmos, or existence, etc. I interpreted that as the body's own way to hearken back to the last time it felt this, that is, during infancy, a kind of \\"return to innocence\\". With our anxiety relieved, and feelings of spiritual transcendence introduced, we are able to resume our lives with our fear of death abated.Given this, there are some shortcomings in the work. For example, Alper argues that all cultures have religion in one form or another, but then modifies this claim by adding all \\"recorded\\" cultures. He admits it is impossible to know for certain since we do not possess records of all the human cultures that have ever existed. I agree with that, but I will argue (as he does) that, given our recorded history, it certainly seems impossible to believe there have ever existed cultures without any religious or supernatural beliefs. Given his argument of the evolutionary basis of religious behavior, it seems credible that if there had been irreligious peoples, these would have been naturally selected to extinction, as they would not have been able to survive their newly-formed awareness of their own death.Another shortcoming that detracted a star from this book in my opinion is that Alper, towards the end of his book, addresses relevant topics such as the accessing of God through drugs and other substances, the purported existence of a \\"spiritual gene\\", the existence of atheists, who by definition must at first contradict his theory, near-death experiences, and speaking in tongues... and yet, on average, each of these chapters is about five pages or so in length. (Chapter 16 is actually slightly under two pages when put together). This leaves the reader feeling a sense of haste, as if the author has made his point and is now rushing to conclude his book. I wish he had explored these topics in more depth and how they relate to his thesis.His concluding appeal to fellow humans to consider the implications of his theory, and how an objectification and \\"biologization\\" of religion might actually have positive consequences for our lives (e.g., no more religious discrimination, no more wasting opportunity to better *this* life, etc) is not to be missed, but to be taken seriously, and urgently acted upon.I don't know if Alper's findings are the definitive conclusion regarding the origin of humanity's spiritual tendencies and religious beliefs, but they are certainly intriguing and eye-opening first steps in the direction of the answer."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Mr. Alper has done an excellent job in presenting his theories. He covers everything from the scientific, biological, medical fact and theory, to the psycological aspects, to logical arguments, to support his theory that a belief in a God and the spiritual experience is a natural,necessary &quot;prewired&quot; function of the brain for survival of our species. He puts up quite a convincing argument for his theory. This book will open some minds, challenge others, give support to the like minded and probably infuriate the closed minded fundamentalists of ALL religions. This book will make a lot of people rethink their beliefs, open new possibilities for others or just raise the passions on just about every front.

The author presents his points in a very well structured way, a very rational way. His writing was so efficient that it convinced me for a while that there is no God outside our brain.

Theology has long debated the question of Gods experience through the human faculties. This question and its inability to prove or disprove the existence of God has developed little since the middle ages.The larger picture he draws is flawed and easily dismissed through the updating of very old arguments. For example, we experience light because we are hard wired to do so. This hardwiring is the result of an evolutionary process. However, this does not mean light does not exist.An iteresting begining, but the author needs to give theology a little more respect and a much closer study.

He begins by saying there are no absolutes, yet continues to talk in them. He doesn't explore other avenues of possibility in his arguments, ignoring the subtleties of thought so characteristic of true philosophers. His arguments are sophomore-ish and heartbreaking to read.Also, his view of science is extremely limited. He claims science as reason, but science is not reason. Science is testing of a hypothesis and gathering tangible proof. Reason and logic are often faulty. And there is no proof anywhere that LSD causes chemical imbalances. The chemicals in the brain are constantly changing. The drugs he was given lose their effect after only a short period of time. So the only thing that was helping his consciousness was faith.As a side note, I am not a religious person at all, and I don't think very many people accept without question the God he portrays.

This could be due, in part, to the fact that many people have sensed (from within and from their surroundings) that there is more to our world than meets the eye - a creative, greater-than-self force that is not fully understood.The author is in the same boat as the rest of us.

For the first 15 years of my life, I never questioned the religious beliefs my family and church imposed on me. After that age, I began to have my own thoughts, and to wonder if what had been &quot;programmed&quot; into me really existed. I began to doubt that I would experience eternal life, and began to be more inclined to believe that when I die, I will totally cease to exist. However, I never explored these possibilities, and chose rather to try to ignore my concerns and fears. I have done a reasonable job of subscribing to the &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; theory until I unexpectedly happened upon Matthew Alper's thought provoking, stimulating, and well written book. I read it in its' entirety today, and I feel that in some ways I may have opened Pandora's Box. But I also feel that thanks to Mr. Alper, I can now begin to form a solid foundation to explore these issues more thoroughly, and to hopefully begin to understand myself and all the feelings, questions, and fears that I have tried to suppress all these years.

Without claws or venom, nor fangs or horns, on intellect alone we rose to the top of the food chain. The great display of human dominion over animals, sea, and land is a clear indicator of our unparalleled innovation and abilities to adapt to our changing environment. We have pushed the need for physical evolution aside; we no longer need to evolve in the mechanical sense. In other words, if Texas were to become as frigid as Northern Alaska, the animals there would have to evolve into thicker coats to survive extinction. Humans on the other hand would simply sew coats together for insulation, avoiding extinction and expediting the spread of humans into new territories..As our hominid ancestors continued to evolve into this ever cleverer creature, there would be certain side-effects that would need to be overcome. In order to make this clearer let's use Alper's own illustration and first imagine the, \\"conditions that a rabbit experiences when cornered by a mountain lion - its body pumped with adrenaline, its heart palpitating, its muscles tensed, its brain surging with painful anxiety.\\" While it is obvious that such anxiety is good for the rabbit in the short run, as a relaxed little rabbit would surely be eaten, it is easy to see that if the rabbit had to experience this on a continuous basis that its mind would shift into an unhealthy state..According to Alper this is exactly the state that humans were once in. A state of constant anxiety, a circumstance in which humans felt like cornered rabbits their entire waking life. It is not difficult to see why Alper thinks this. Humans are the first animal in the known Universe to become self-aware, \\"For the first time in the history of life, an organic form turned its powers of perception back upon its own self, rendering it aware of its own existence.\\" While at first this may seem like a most wonderful discovery; for a brain not prepared for such an idea it could be an all consuming anxiety that could prove catastrophic to human existence. The main problem with such a deep cognition such as becoming aware of one's own existence is that the next logical realization is of one's own non-existence. And now suddenly humans are aware that they will die; like the rabbit cornered by the mountain lion, humans are cornered by the realization of their own mortality..It's simple to see how detrimental such a mindset could be to one's survival. Knowing you were going to die, knowing everyone you loved would die, wondering if everything would be cast into oblivion and all was meaningless. This new, \\"Cognitive Revolution\\" could be more detrimental than beneficial if not controlled quickly. So what could Natural Selection do to fix this stemming problem? Obviously a bunch of people walking around like panicky lion food on the brink of nervous breakdowns weren't going to get very far in the Darwinian struggle for existence. What possible solutions could Mother Nature come up with? Alper supposes that one solution is that she could make people dumber; that Mother Nature could cast a spell of stupidity on humans so that they would not feel the anxiety from realizing their own mortality. But this probably wouldn't work because as we said earlier, humans have no claws, no horns, etc., it is intelligence which gives humans their advantage, and to take this away would be like stripping a snake of its teeth or a turtle of its shell..Maybe nature had something more inventive in mind; maybe it would tell a white lie for the good of all mankind. Maybe it would instill inside us an undeniable feeling of immortality. If nature could convince us that we wouldn't \\"really\\" die then the anxiety would be gone and the daily struggle for life could continue. Alper argues that this feeling of something bigger, this intrinsic connection most of us feel to the Universe, Nature, Gods, etc, is nothing more than genetic programming. That our perception of reality has been preconfigured for us by nature because Mother may indeed know best..There is of course with anything involving genetic coding, a variation of sorts, with some people on the far left of the bell curve feeling no such sensation or connection, all the way to those on the far right of the curve, typically manifesting themselves as the hyper-religious/evangelical whom often are so enveloped by the sensation of immortality that they literally spend their lives waiting for deities to come and physically remove them from the planet, or sometimes participate in even more schizophrenic behavior such as visual and auditory hallucinations and in some circumstances even glossolalia..Alper's, The God part of the Brain, has some excellent insights that have really cleared up some questions I had in regards to human religiosity. I have always wondered why it was so futile to discuss the potential non-existence of deities with people whom feel connected with one. As a \\"Non-Believer\\" I have never had a problem with discussing the potential for the supernatural, but with a complete lack of evidence and science making it unnecessary, I simply can't have beliefs based on nothing. I had always assumed that those whom did, made such decisions because of early indoctrination into a church/cult combined with the powers of confirmation-bias. But all those things are looking more symptomatic now, rather than a root cause. If Alper is indeed correct, then there is no point discussing non-belief with someone who has a strong genetic predisposition; they will simply not be able to wrap their mind around the idea of non-existence. Immortality has been, \\"Hard-Wired\\" into their brains and the rest of us must accept this genetic condition and navigate around it as best we can."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"The captivating title draws the individual in, asking if God can really be a product of the brain. The author brings to light many interesting facts; however there are a few logical fallacies which are painfully obvious, causing the book to lose some credibility. The book did, however, prove to be a very interesting read. It takes a new approach to the concept of God, one which not many people have viewed, or even considered. The presumption that God can be explained by signals in the brain is bound to deter people; however this book should not be passed over so lightly. It provides some very provocative arguments which any open individual should explore at some point.The book is a quest and Alper is the guide who shows the reader one path to take to solve the question of God. It begins with Alper's reason for questioning the existence of God and progresses with the steps he took to come to a resolution. He begins not at the beginning of humankind, but at the beginning of time. The book first talks about the origin of the universe with a physics basis, then goes on to talk about the planet and chemistry; following this is an explanation of early life and evolution and biochemistry, extending into biology and finally finishing with philosophy and neuroscience. It is here that the book begins to address the God aspect in society. Alper then uses a combination of philosophy, backed by biological data, to begin explaining aspects of human culture and the mind which cause us as a species to believe in a higher power. As the book progresses, it takes a turn from a philosophical view to a more neuroscience view, though the first real mention of any real neuroscience does not occur until halfway through the book. It is here that the core scientific evidence begins; addressing drugs, psychosis, genetics, and exceptions to his theory, atheists.The beginning of the book, though mostly not relevant, does provide good information which serves mainly to solidify the author's credibility by stating and explaining in layman's terms many fields of science. That was when I first noticed the main qualm I had with the book. Alper has a tendency to make a point, reiterate it, create an unnecessarily long list of examples, and then reiterate the point yet again. While this reinforcement is good, showing that a lot of research was conducted and that the facts are solid, it resulted in a large amount of excess reading which got to be very tedious.However, despite this literary problem, the information was quite interesting, especially the biological reasoning Alper addressed. He spoke of universal traits and how humans are only animals and thus can be studied just as we study other animals, using the same logic. This outlook was quite refreshing and interesting. During the psychological analysis of humans, I felt Alper made some generalizations which were hard to accept. Though his logic and the path taken to address his main points are sound on a rudimentary level, there is some uneasiness in trying to accept his suggestions. Only later does the book really take off, when the author begins to address the neuroscience behind his theories, even though his is a simplistic interpretation. Here he uses theories formed by prominent neuroscientists and reinforces his own theories with experiments conducted throughout the world.There were two sections during the more heavily scientific part of the book that were relatively weak, the explanation of the spiritual gene and the reason for atheists. Throughout the entire book Alper kept referring to how the concept of God was hardwired into our genetics, yet when the time came to address it, he merely stated a few experiments which were conducted with identical twins suggesting belief in God was genetic. Since this was his main thesis, it seemed that the chapter should have been longer, explaining the experiments in greater depth, particularly the science behind each experiment. The chapter about atheism also left something to be desired. His reasoning for atheism contained two parts, outliers on a bell curve and nature versus nurture. Alper suggested that the human race's belief in God can be expressed as a bell curve with the lower tail expressing no belief, representing the atheists. To address the vast number of atheists in the world, he explained that the nurture these individuals experienced would cause them to change their beliefs. These rationales seem to be more of an evasive maneuver, rather than a fully solidified theory, especially since he does not back up his claims with experiments or other theories as he did in sections before.\\"As is true for all of the Earth's creatures, whenever there is a behavior that is exhibited by every individual (or as in the case of humans, among every culture), we can presume that such behaviors must represent an inherent characteristic of the species, that is, a genetically inherited instinct.\\" -pg. 57This was one of the most thought provoking quotes from the book which I contemplated for a long time. I feel that this is a valid argument, and Alper does spend time dwelling on this to further solidify his view.\\"...Dr. V.S. Ramachandran of UC San Diego's Center for Brian and Cognition Research found that twenty-five percent of those who suffer from a form of epilepsy that involves activity within the temporal lobes experience a distinct religious fervor...\\" -pg. 113Just an example of Alper's more solidified arguments, when he pulls in experiments and theories from other neuroscientists, rather than basing the arguments on his logic.Over all this was a very interesting read. Despite the logical flaws and excessive reiteration of facts and concepts, the book had some very thought-provoking ideas. I would suggest this book as an introductory read for any individual who is willing to question the existence of God."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"I just finished reading Matthew Alper's book titled &quot;The God Part of the Brain&quot;. I found it very interesting, intriguing, and eye opening to a whole new possibility of thinking. While I will not divulge everything of the book and all his examples and explanations I will try to summarize the basis of the book. The basis of the book is that the author, Matthew Alper is explaining his research using mechanical means of explanation of a God or a god(s) using the means of science/psychology/religion in seeking to find out about a belief in a God or god(s). The main idea of the book is that mankind through evolution and natural selection has been physiologically &quot;hard-wired&quot; to a belief in a transcendental/immortal/ethereal soul in a spiritual reality and the existence of our concept of a God or god(s). Mr. Alper suggests in his book that mankind through his evolution at one time was unaware of his existence, or rather his existence as being mortal. Alper goes on to suggest that over a period of time through evolution the ego (i.e. mankind's own personal conscious) became consciously aware of his mortality thus creating an anxiety in mankind. This newfound anxiety of mankind becoming aware of his own mortality created in mankind by means of evolution and natural selection created a cognitive part of the brain which Matthew Alper terms the &quot;god part of the brain&quot; This &quot;god part of the brain&quot; enabled mankind to relieve his anxiety and fear of death by means of having a cognitive belief in a transcendental/immortal/ethereal soul and the existence of a God or god(s). Read with an open and inquiring mind!"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This book will appeal to those who already believe that religion is a product of the human mind. This is neither a scholarly work nor a scientific treatise but rather Alper's interpretation of data from various unconnected studies and experiments that support his world view. On the back cover of the book, one of the reviewers described Alper's work as \\"a lively manifesto.\\" That is a perfect summary of this book."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"At last! A rational solution to the age old questions of God, of spirit, of afterlife, of &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;evil.&quot; As a student as well as a professor of philosophy, I must say that I found Mr. Alper's analysis of the big questions to be one of the most lucid and revealing I have ever read. Moreover, it is also incredibly entertaining - a quick read, hard to put down. If you are a searcher, an explorer, a seeker of truth, I highly recommend this book. Regardless of whether or not one agrees with the author's conclusions, I have no doubt this book will leave an indelible impression on all those who venture within."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"As you can probably ascertain from the title of this review, reading this book changed my life. Since I was very young, I had been spiritually inclined and prone to mystical experiences. For instance, when I desired to go to church, my parents would drop me off or I would go with friends. It wasn't an obligation forced upon me by my family; it was my own innate desire.My belief in God was bolstered by something I came to refer to as \\"The God Feeling.\\" I interpreted this feeling, which is being evoked even now as I am typing this, to be something happening outside of me, to me: God acting upon me and making me feel loved and peaceful. I took this \\"truth\\" for granted. I knew God existed because I \\"felt\\" God. Like Mahalia Jackson used to sing, \\"My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.\\"My God Is Real (Yes, God Is Real)My life was guided by this belief. I chose to go into the ministry; first Christian, then later I converted to Judaism and wanted to become a rabbi. My life, education, and career centered around God and Judaism.My approach to ministry was the natural result of my relationship with God. I assumed everyone was capable of having the same experience with God as I did. I thought this relationship was the ultimate purpose of life: without it, one had nothing. My goal was to help facilitate this experience in others and to give their lives meaning.I never considered that my experience of God was only happening in my head. This book showed me the error of my ways. After reading the book, I am forever changed. How many books can one say that about?"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This book is very good to give the basic groundings into why people believe in God other dieties in general.

Mr. Alper states that he spent years delving into science's proven answers to the origins and intricacies of existence as we know it. I am not a scientist, but I believe that if one finds one plausible explanation for anything -- and stops searching -- it is akin to believing in a flat earth, thunder gods, or magic beans. For his sake, I hope Mr. Alper has resumed his search since the publication of his work."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"I agree also with what Matthew Alper has written and said in his many interviews. \\"Human beings are genetically hard wired to experience belief in spirituality and various paranormal phenomena, even though there is no scientific basis for it. According to sociobiology, there are regions in the human brain that generate these belief systems, and the brain evolved this way as a coping mechanism to deal with the knowledge of our inevitable deaths.\\" He also said, \\"I believe that the anxiety [about death] was so overwhelming that it forced the selection of this cognitive modification which...compels us to believe that there's this other transcendental force...through which, even though we know the physical body will die, we now believe this spiritual component will live on forever.\\"He wrote about studies of meditation and prayer, which show decreased blood flow in the amygdala region of the brain-- this helps to reduce anxiety and fear, which could account for the sense of spirituality. He also wrote that the parietal lobe also gets a decreased blood flow, which can affect spatial and temporal consciousness. In his research he feels many people who are hyper-religious have epilepsy.Being a Neuro-theologist Matthew has also expounded about his theory on the genetic nature of spirituality and how humans are wired to believe in a \\"God\\" and spiritual realm. As an atheist, he feels the God part of the brain evolved as a coping mechanism through natural selection-- human survival was enhanced through belief in an afterlife. For those of you who are not familiar with the meaning of \`atheist' it is in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities, and in a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. He cited the work of neuroscientist VS Ramachandran who discovered a connection between temporal lobe epilepsy and religious experience. Ramachandran even found that sometimes reading religious text to epileptics could trigger a seizure in them. Another study indicated that religious figures such as the Apostle Paul and Joan of Arc suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.The tests of Michael Persinger ,using a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator, showed that stimulation of the temporal lobe could bring on spiritual or religious experiences. In an interview at the University of Pennsylvania, he mentioned the study of Tibetan Monks during meditation/prayer showed blood flow changes in their brains, which could account for reduced anxiety and an increased feeling of transcendence.I highly recommend this book for those who are brave enough to think \\"outside of the box.\\" It is one of the books our Spiritual Study Grroup in Florida has read with great enthusiasm. There is a difference between being spiritual and being religious.

I live in the UK which could be considered the first atheist nation in the world. People are raising families and living pretty much as they always have , and the lack of a religious framework and the general conviction that there is no afterlife doesn't seem to change this. People are living and breeding regardless of absense of theological belief. So how could religion be naturally selected into the brain ?There are many different forms of religious experience, or experience of 'values', beauty, goodness, our interconnections with others and with nature. Not many religious experiences specifically imprint one with an illusion which at its core says 'don't worry, theres an afterlife, don't lay down and give up'. This would be a confused message, and anyway this is not the core of true religion ! If it were, how would it carry a selective advantage ? Experiences that carried this philosophical impact (conviction in an afterlife) would make people more relaxed and less competitive about life, and in fact More willing to die, not more willing to live !Abraham Maslow said 'Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature and to the cosmos.' I would like to ask Alper, how does the trans-logical implications of transpersonal psychotherapy and quantum physics fit into the narrow framework presented in this book ? They don't. The circular block has been cut to fit the square hole. This book falls short of science by excluding evidence that would complicate the agenda that Matthew seems so motivated to push."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This is one of the better books that I have read dealing with Religious Studies and the study of the religious drive in humans.If you are a believer you had best be sure you have some thick skin and expect a further bifurcation of your 'religious' and 'scientific' mind. Matthew Alper has written a fascinating book that explores the idea of looking at homo sapiens proclivity for belief in god as something that can be traced to a physical cause (our brain structure) and compares that proclivity to other traits and characteristics such as hair color, smiling, organ development, etc. that are unique to all those who are of the species homo sapiens.All of the above are determined by our genetic makeup which determines the development and structure of our brain which is the organ that brings forth these behaviors, according to the paradigm presented by Mr. Alper. I especially enjoyed his treatment of language. The faculty of language has been quite often pointed at as a unique trait of our species and many religious have used our ability to speak as proof-positive of the paradigm that asserts our 'divine' origin'.As Mr. Alper convincingly shows, there is a better paradigm that both explain the origin and location of the ability to speak and understand language. I won't steal Mr. Alper's thunder but I will say that one would do well to read and reread this one chapter and let the implications of what Mr. Alper is saying sink in. He is looking at language through the paradigm of science and he produces a very power explanatory model with this paradigm. It is incumbent on those who disagree with the effectiveness of this paradigm to prove him wrong. This paradigm (the scientific paradigm) is the operative one in most of our thinking process, except in those areas which some humans have reserved as off-limits to scientific investigation because of various factors (I will let the reader be their own judge of other's motivations in these areas).For me, it seems apparent that these are the last areas where the biblical ideas of Homo sapiens intrinsic uniqueness still are the operative view. The resistance that is put forth by believers who refuse to allow these areas to be studied by the scientific method and dismiss the conclusions that scientific studies produce as false because the inevitable result will be the closing of a few more gaps where their god currently resides.I have often wondered how religious folks who firmly believed that the earth was flat, or that it was really at the 'center' of the universe adapted when the facts of the matter became real to them.We may be able to study this psychological phenomenon when the thesis of the book becomes the working hypothesis of cognitive researchers which, I anticipate, it should in the very near future judging from some of the luminaries that wrote little blurbs for the inside covers.As Mr. Alper's thesis is acted upon by researchers in various fields that look to substantiate his proposals and develop working hypothesis regarding genetic structure and the location in the brain of belief structures and attempt to test them, we will begin to see that color blinded ness, musical and language ability and the willingness or unwillingness to believe whatever myth the culture you happen to be born in holds as being the 'true' revelation from god are all determined by the genetic sequencing in each individuals DNA.Perhaps one day, we may be able to engineer scourges out of human existance such as breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, cancer, etc., and, if Mr. Alper is correct and I believe he is, there will be no more Jonestowns, Holy Inquisistions, World Trade Centers, Wacos, elections of Shrubs, invasions of countries under false pretenses, and scores of other examples as this psychotic behavior known as belief in the supernatural can be eliminated by some fortuitous genetic engineering."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"who is he writing for?

There are a wealth of materials by respectable scientists that will give a more accurate picture of what happened (and they will include the evidence).So is he writing for Christians (as i first assumed)?

Enormous ground is covered highly effectively, laying the back drop for his journey to the \\"GOD\\" part of the brain and neurochemical processes. For readers not inclined to subject themselves to a \`dull, dry lecture format', Alper tackles the topics in a way that feels more like a lively conversation over coffee where mental sparring is encouraged.Although I did not agree 100% with all the conclusions drawn in the second half of the book (Intro to Biotheology), it did provide me with lingering examination of why I lean more toward mystical explanations than the scientific. This is a powerful book that has me pondering this oversimplified conundrum:Did God give me my Imagination or did My Imagination give me my God?I wish this book had been in existence when I was in college.

My brain became baffled as I began to think of C.S Lewis' MIRACLES as I read the book. I have never understood MIRACLES or much of Lewis outside of Narnia. I began to get nervous...1.The paranormal gets dismissed apriori without discussion. Never mind the years of research by reputable groups such as SRI, many plausible and some bogus studies p8.2.Ironically, Matthew Alper began his departure from the spiritual at a place where many enter it-experimenting with LSD. Read DOORS OF PERCEPTION by Huxley for added insights on this subject. The use of psychoactive drugs not only to cure mental illness but to act as way to perceive higher reality may be valid.Alper is saved not by God but by psychoactive drugs operating on the laws of nature. Excluding any thought of a law giver or the fact that he had access to scarce medication and kind staff willing to help him we are told that his cure was proof of no soul p10.3.Consciousness is affected by matter yet this excludes the possibility that matter was initially created by spirit or that matter's laws of behavior were designed by anyone p9.4.p19 A false dichotomy since the intelligent design movement hosts many secularists. Evolution is both upheld and attacked by many groups.5.p19 Partaking the fruits of science by religious people is not hypocritical if you believe that God gave creation as a gift.6.p25 Earth began to cool when hot meteors stopped hitting it?There is no mention of entropy or the Second Law of Thermodynamics here or in other cosmology discussions. Why? Order descending into chaos does not quite fit. Heck of a lot of meteors!7.p26 The 1953 Miller atmosphere tests are the subject of scientific debate none of which is mentioned here.8.p28 Macro molecules \\"continued to evolve\\" even digestive tracts and specialized energy efficient structures. Why isn't the possibility that they existed separate from the beginning even discussed or that things become less energy efficient over time even added to the discussion? See point 6.9.p28 Survival is a function of energy efficiency yet locomotion which is mentioned is not.10.p35 Speciation or evolution? In industrial areas moths become grey as they adapt but they remain moths not ever becoming wasps.11.p36 Darwin's finches,despite beak differences, are still finches and not sparrows. see point 10.12.p40 Kant and neurons become the end all in the mind/body problem. MIRACLES goes into this area more honestly yet abstrusely. Why doesn't Alper mention Hume or Plato? No need to confuse the reader I guess.13.p45 The Big Bang reoccurs ad infinitium? Think again about dark universe cosmology not mentioned.14.p45 No evidence of the paranormal?What about the few cases involving reliable witnesses who have seen ghosts or UFOs to the detriment of their reputation and the few photos that can't be debunked. Think of the SS Watertown haunting or the UFO incident at Exeter.I recount two incidents that occurred to me mentioned in my review of MIRACLES titled \\"Miracle Men\\" on Amazon book reviews. Recently, I found a store keeper who I had thought about after a long absence exactly where I saw her and she told me that she had been thinking about me when I thought of her. These types of experiences are common yet unexplained but ignored by Alper.15.p56 Smiling is correctly described as innate behavior but so is a whole list of alleged cultural behaviours listed on p57.Burial is allegedly cultural innate behavior. Can you really compare cremation on the Ganges with mummification in Egypt? Even taking into account environmental differences,which is partially done in another section of the book, the comparison is ridiculous.If we can design a machine to play music then why can't nature do the same? p.61 Indeed, doesn't design imply will and thought? So why can't God?16.p85 Redundant anatomy is evidence of evolution yet the debate on this is ignored by Alper as some question how redundant some body parts really are.17.p87 Man is the only self conscious species? No discussion of the debate on this point.18.p90 Pleasure is just the absence of pain? Think hypothalamus, orgasms and even Hugh Hefner on this point.19.p93 Rabbits developed anxiety memory from successful near brushes with predators?Several issues here: how many rabbits with proto-anxiety reactions would have survived to breed? If animals are not self conscious how can they comprehend cause and effect? If something is instinctual then is learning moot? If escape reaction is instinctual then it existed as part of design or the rabbits could have never survived in the first place.20.p102 Humans with high death anxiety developed religious brain centres to protect against mental breakdowns?Would not the anxiety debilitate them first keeping them from reproducing and giving dumb humans a breeding advantage. The only way around this is to say that intelligence developed in tandem with spirituality yet simultaneously fostered the higher dangers of debilitating anxiety. Is this really probable?21.p101 Spiritual death anxiety coping keeps our intellects intact from mental breakdown, yet religion is opposed to reason p19.22.p104 We can comprehend infinity? Try to imagine a billion thumbtacks.23.p105 Math brain centres influenced the spiritual, yet religious art and music, not mentioned, are not influential? What purpose do paintings and cathedrals serve?24.p107 Fear is mollified by a God-Parent nexus. God is a secure father image. What about common universal mother fertility gods? Because of childhood, wouldn't a mother figure be more probable?25.p109 Zen satori is a state of non being or the dissolution of the self rather than being born again or fellowship with God.26.p113 A neural reaction does not prove outside reality reacting upon it.27.p116 Prayer and text reading is anxiety reducing as is sex. Sex is a sacred religious rite to some. Does this mean that prayer and scripture reading is sex inducing? Interrelation should imply cause and effect.28.p117 Only humans are self aware? See point 17.29.p119 Phantom limb sensation exists despite the present non-existence of real limbs. Since real limbs existed then does God not exist?30.p120 Infants are not self aware. Much reputable data contradicts this and even posits fetal consciousness.31.p125 If intelligent people were the most death anxious then their survival would be less likely. Contradicts point 20 p100.32.p130 Similar molecules could point to common design. Causation assumption?33.p141 Religious conversion is neural because it is cross cultural. Never mind that the faithful are explicitly told to preach.34.p141 The faithful have ideology replace individuality and become drones. Did not Dr. Albert Schweitzer study medicine and then went to Africa at an advanced age because of faith?35.p142 Religious change is a listed disorder. What about secular fanaticism? Why is Alper silent about secular ideologues?36.p143 Help to the needy is motivated by altruism not because they are emotionally vulnerable. Is Alper willing to say that recent aid to Turkey from Iran and Israel was motivated by efforts to witness Shiite Islam or Judaism? Altruism neurons are separate from witnessing ones apparently.37.p149 Atheism occurs in individuals who have undeveloped spiritual centres? The great logical constructs of Marx and Russell are the result of fewer neurons apparently.38.p152 Near Death Experiences (NDE)? These are neural because they can be induced by a drug Ketamine and can be categorized as anxiety reducing brain evolution patterns.Why then are the NDEs sometimes related to Judgement, Hell, show a being of light, or show the nearly dead in verifiable visions looking at themselves dying?39.p154 Acts 2:1-42 refers to specific languages known to others present with Paul not to \\"tongues\\" spoken today by Pentecostals. Alper makes reference to this phenomenon as being repeated today yet even in cases of Dissociative Trance Identity Disorder (possession) there is no evidence of specific languages being spoken as in Acts 2.40.p156 Two sexes just emerged. How could asexual reproduction cease with continued offspring?41.p157 No mention of the uncomfortable entropy issue related to Laws of Thermodynamics see points 6,9 and pp 25,28.42.p166 Images of paradise could be Jungian and spring from collective memory of a past real event instead of being just neural. Is Hell universal? Zen Buddhists and Jehovah's Witnesses ignore Hell p.166.43.p170 Can spiritual and religious beliefs be so neatly dissected? Why does religion talk about morality?44.p173 Alper returns to Kant and states that reality is neural and therefore subjective. Alper uses the example of planarians turning to light reflexively as a neural function but does not mention that the planarians are turning to real light which makes Kant irrelevant and God as possibly real.45.p174 A new paradigm is needed without God and thus free of intolerance with \\"equality\\" the order of the day p184.Sadly, \\"equality\\" can become a new contrived God or just a delusional concept based on neural \\"reality.\\" Is Alper replacing God with a state created idol or a concept that must be false because it is just a neural impulse? The atheistic communist prison system is full of those who reject this kind of equality.46.p182 Turmoil in the world is related to religion as the civil war in Yugoslavia showed?Never mind that only three percent of the population of secular Serbia goes to church. Maybe human nature...nuerons?...or perhaps Original Sin is a better answer. Man is the problem not God because secular people also commit pogroms.footnote p182 What kind of God would design a God center so religions could fight one another? Human sin answers this one.Alper tells us in another section that religion is an excuse to avoid responsibility yet fails to tell us why fanatics would take the responsibility to die in religious wars.A God center exists shows evidence for God existing. If the crew of an alien spaceship came to earth in 1924,landed in rural Oregon and found a radio set this would prove the existence of KGO in San Francisco which started broadcasts in 1924 as the first west coast radio station even though the transmitter would be hard to find.47.p189 Religion wastes effort...too many shrines and fruitless projects. Also quite a few orphanages built in the process... not mentioned by Alper.p187 Opinions in social science are inappropriate unless the same proofs as used in physics are used? Freedom of speech missing here?Alper has George Orwell's gift of provocative, concise,and clear writing. Like Orwell, Alper avoids much depth. Orwell once said that he was only concerned with the things on the surface of the earth and not above or below it. The \\"socialist who hated socialism\\" ended up leaving us wondering why he would risk his life in Spain and never discuss the ideology that lead him there. Is Alper doing the same?This publisher should bring out a new edition of this book with plenty of dissenting footnotes for the sake of intellectual integrity.This book joins Comfort's works as an advocacy book shown by the two pages of shrill secularism in the preface. Alper's book is a far cry from DARWIN ON TRIAL by Phillip Johnson which seeks to dissect both evolution and to a lesser extent the Bible. Johnson is an LLD and it shows in his analytical skill.The purpose of any book is to grind a subject to dust and then analyse the dust for valid residue- not to advocate anything. The purpose of Bible apologetics is to do the same- to deconstruct religion and search the dust for valid God matter. The purpose of literature is to destroy pretence and create anti-literature.I see the ghost of Comfort in these pages...but thankfully only the ghost."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the brain-behavior connection. The author presents a fascinating, well thought-out argument for human spirituality as an evolutionary development with a physiological basis in the brain. Basically, he states that humans developed the concept of God and religion/spirituality as a coping mechanism to deal with the unpleasant reality of being aware of our own existence and, therefore, our eventual death. He goes about presenting this theory in a concise, logical manner that is easily accessible to the average layperson - no Ph.D. required! I would especially recommend this book for those of you who are turned off by the idea of a universe devoid of \\"intelligent design\\", and, in turn, no inherent, underlying \\"purpose\\" to our existence. Although the very idea can seem dismal and depressing at the outset, the author manages to bring us to the end of this journey with a strong sense of a renewed purpose and a hope for bringing about positive change in a world rife with violence in the name of religion. Perhaps if we thought that this truly is our only opportunity to experience life and comprehend the physical world around us, then we would work all the harder to enjoy each day and preserve peace to ensure that the human gene pool survives many generations into the future. I imagine that this book will spark many a lively debate!"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Mr. Alper has written an extremely readable comprehehsive analysis of the physiological basis of religiosity. This work is comparable to Freud's &quot;Future of an Illusion&quot; in its contribution to the continuing maturation of the human mind.

Right from the start, he makes it seem as though he knows every true secret to the world, and he wrote this book to tell you what he has learned. He is equivocal in his discussion of the origins of life. He is sometimes off in his explanations of natural phenomena (possibly, as a ploy to avoid indepth explanation, which are not important to his overall thesis.) As far as a psych-analysis goes, Alper seems like an individual who had a neglected child hood, has turned to intellectualism as a way to draw attention to himself, and give himself a feeling of inclusion in the world. This book has a very commercial feel to it, whilst in the discussion of a very scientific topicAlso, his use of massive amounts of repition further dilutes the facts that he is presenting. Furthermore, this repitition makes it seam as though he is targeting a very adolescent or ignorant audience. I can see how he would be trying to make this knowledge accessible to the general public, but isn't that what most cult leaders claim to be doing?though he saves some face in the end, he leaves the reader feeling like he is asking, begging even, for attention, begging to be recognized. And though he presents some very unique thoughts in this text, they are lost in repition and use of rehashed, reworded thoughts.I did enjoy reading this book, for its ability to give much free time to explore my own thoughts on the matter, as I scanned through the vast amounts of reiterated statements. However, in a realistic since, this book is best designed for somebody with the reading comprehension of a 10-11 year old, and would have been better off reduced to a featured article/essay in any one of the numerous intellectual magazines on the market."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Forgive me for jumping in but I just had to ask a question here. I have not read this book in it's entirety. I have only read random pages through the Look Inside feature. I did not read enough to give a review of the book but I did read enough to understand where this author was coming from. The question I would like to ask the author and those who have read this book is this: Did it ever occur to you that our God has placed within us the desire to seek Him and to know Him? That our thoughts about God were placed there by God Himself? That our God has made a way for us to actually know Him?I am not talking about religion. Religion is a man-made mockery of God's truth. Religion tells us that if we do enough good things then God (if there is a God) will allow us into His heaven. Our God created us for a purpose and that purpose was to live in relationship with Him. Man fell into sin and the plan of God which had already been put into action before the creation of the Universe went into effect. Our God would take on human flesh and pay the price for every sin we had ever committed, a price none of us could pay due to our sinfulness. Our God would live a perfect and holy life in our place. I know it sounds crazy to you but what if what I am stating here is true? If it is then we have a God that goes so far beyond our thoughts or imaginations. We have a God who loves us so much that He would allow men like us to nail Him to a cross so that He could bleed for us, take on the wrath of God for us, and take on Himself every sin we would ever commit against God. I know because on April 5, 1987 our great God brought me to an understanding of how truly sinful I was and saved me. He took on my sins and gave me His righteousness. Jesus, our God, became a man to reconcile us to God. If you truly want to know God then you can. Jesus stated, \\"I AM the way, the truth and the life. No man comes to the Father but by Me.\\" Call out to Him now before it is too late. He will answer.Jesus also stated, \\"Come unto Me all who are weary and heavy laden.\\" Religion can only weary a man and put heavy burdens on him. God is calling all men to an intimate relationship with Him and it can only be found through the redemptive work of Jesus our Messiah."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Wasted time and money purchasing this book.

He likes to push the envelope on neuroscientific \\"evidence\\" for religion.Fourth, Alper's demarcations between \\"religion\\" and \\"spirituality\\" seem a bit too rigid.Fifth, Alper seems to ignore empirical evidence that contraindicates his theory. Specifically, after stressing the rhythmic nature of how many religious practices, such as chants, music, meditation, etc. can lead to spiritual experiences, he ignores the rhythmic means by which hypnosis is induced, which can, at sufficiently deep levels of hypnosis, lead to experiences that would otherwise be labeled \\"spiritual.\\"Sixth, Alper seems to buy too much into Evolutionary Psychology (versus evolutionary psychology), and to see what he calls spirituality, even more than religion, as being at least a high-level exaptation (something that \\"came along for the ride\\" with another evolutionary adaptation but then further evolved and was selected for on its own), if not a first-level evolutionary move, and couples this with a pretty modular view of the human brain/mind. Instead, I believe spirituality is at best a far from optimal exaptation and might even be labelable as a spandrel.

The chapter on the origins of life presents explanations that still reside in the realm of theory and conjecture, and are critically short on citations of peer-reviewed literature. And the point when I finally put the book down is when the author, in the chapter explaining the existence of atheism, begins by arguing that all human traits are normally distributed (ie, the \\"bell curve\\" or Gaussian distribution)!

To me the Big Bang seems just as much a mystery as God.I guess, for some people, it's an easier leap of faith to believe that the universe magically created itself!Nothing that we've observed in nature creates itself. The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy, which means nothing new is created. All the material that exists in the universe has been present from the beginning. Any physicist can tell you that.But how everything started in the first place is still a mystery.So what's the bigger leap of faith, that God created the universe, or that it just magically happened?

It's not credible to disprove God by simply comparing behavior responses in tiny organisms with those of humans.Why is there not a &quot;Big Bang&quot; part of the brain then?You see, humans believe in God because there actually is a rational reason to do so.

We follow him through his personal understanding of the various branches of the broad discipline of scicence. Nowhere does he write of any personal explorations into what may be termed spirituality. I did not perceive any distinction being made between mind and brain, or spirit and mind, or soul and spirit.Dreams, visions, ecstatic union, feelings of connection to all life, etc., are perceived via the brain. Science can show a flow of certain chemicals or involvement of certain areas of the brain during these events, therefore they must be due to the chemicals only. This is vastly misleading conclusion.We live in this world via a physical body with its five sense modes of perception. As Rabbi Steinsaltz has expressed, &quot;The soul of man functions through its instrument or vessel, which is the body. Through it and with it, the soul thinks, perceives, feels, and acts;...&quot; (The Thirteen Petaled Rose, p.62.)

His book is weak, however, in exploring the practical consequences of his thesis. That would not be a problem in a book that was only designed as a survey or study of existing knowledge on the subject. Alper, however, promises that the knowledge he presents can free us from irrational religiosity. In my opinion, his book fails to deliver on this promise.Suppose everything Alper says is correct. The mind is hard-wired for religious belief because that enhances survival and successful reproduction. The next question is: WHY should we seek to become free of that hard-wiring? Here, ethical issues intervene. If one takes the view of Spinoza and other rationalist and empiricist philosophers that happiness consists of living in accordance with one's nature, and if religion is a very basic part of that nature, then doing without religion is an insult to one's inherent capacities, akin to permanent celibacy or a vow of poverty.I recognize that Alper is operating from a fairly high moral concept when he urges us to avoid religion because of the atrocities and irrationalities that have accompanied it in its corporate form throughout history. We must recognize his call to reject ALL religious belief, however, as a call to cut off our right hand (or in this case our right temporal lobe) to keep from &quot;sinning.&quot; Such drastic measures are called for ONLY if we can be certain that the God-concept has no basis in reality, a showing he does not even attempt.The issue of God's actual existence requires a specialized inquiry beyond the scope of Alper's book. Assuming we are agnostic on this question, why not take the plunge and find a workable conception of imminence or transcendence that satisfies the promptings of our right temporal lobe? Psychologists since William James have recognized the value of belief as an organizing principle for life.Throughout history people have discovered that it is possible to find a God belief without the irrationalities of doctrinal religion. Thus, &quot;transcendence&quot; calls on me to improve my life, to solve tough problems, to embrace great causes. &quot;Imminence&quot; rejoices with me in the beauty of what already exists. It may be only a useful illusion, but many people need to see these qualities as mediated to them by a personal being. Whether or not they are, one finds that these qualities are present, both within and in the world beyond the self.Thus, &quot;God&quot; may be pure abstraction, the useful parts of nature mediated to me through the right-hand side of my brain. Then again, he could exist as a real being; who knows? To ask whether &quot;God&quot; is supernatural or whether I can prove &quot;His&quot; existence is to miss the point. Even if he is nothing but a figment of my right temporal lobe, why should I lobotomize myself by anaesthesizing that very useful part of my brain?"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"I thought that finding \\"the God part of the brain\\" would bring us closer to understanding why some people are more religious than others or not religious at all. If it proved to be a part of our brains, it could be more developed in some people or completely missing from others; this fact would render being religious as natural as being an atheist just as some people have blue eyes while others have brown eyes. I was rather disappointed, since the author does not write how perception, language or any brain function could \\"create\\" our perception of God, but limits himself to state that a region of the brain seems to be related with this perception by mentioning a few examples of brain injuries that could point towards this conclusion. For a deeper, more complete and far better explanation of these clinical cases and their probable conclusions readPhantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind. You can find an excellent anthropological study of why people tend to believe in a superior godlike all-knowing being and why we tend to perform religious rites inReligion Explained, both are first-hand accounts of the respective studies.The book is very easy to read and it contains one interesting chapter, namely the one in which the author explains his perception of all the sciences being one only science, but focused on a different section of the space-time scale. Particle physics studies the origin of matter and of the universe; Cosmology studies its further development, Astronomy studies the stars and planets, Geology concentrates on the earth, Chemistry studies the composition of substances, Biochemistry studies the origins of life, Biology studies life on earth, then follow Paleonthology, Anthropology, etc.I consider the rest of the book completely unscientific. The author jumps to conclusions, that for me lack even basic logic, like the following: If two human groups with different religious beliefs live close together and there is a food shortage in the region, they will kill each other for religious reasons. If there is no food shortage they will coexist pacifically. Therefore religion is the source of our evils. Excuse me??? Am I missing something? Is this a new science of parallel or indeterminated causality?The author claims that if we could precisely localize the \\"God part of the brain\\", we could remove it with brain surgery (he mentions that he would not recommend it because of cost and risk reasons), but otherwise it would be possible and highly desirable to improve peace on earth. Isn't this a kind of atheist \\"fundamentalism\\"?Wouldn't it be easier to improve food supply or energy supply or whatever the people are fighting for? Otherwise we would have to identify and remove with surgery the \\"race identity part of the brain\\", the \\"nation concept part of the brain\\", the \\"left and right wing parts of the brain\\", the \\"class fight part of the brain\\" and maybe even the \\"liberte, egalite e fraternite parts of the brain\\". For all of these some more and some less good reasons, blood has been shed on earth. It has happened frequently that initially noble concepts like \\"liberte, egalite e fraternite\\", bringing a \\"liberating\\" faith to some people, liberating others from the \\"opium\\" of it or even liberating an \\"oppressed\\" nation from its tyrant are imprinted on battle flags and a lot of suffering is brought to the people that apparently were going to be \\"liberated\\". At least, there is no need to kill all those naughty believers, just remove a tiny little part of their brains...I will dare a bold conclusion in the author's style: Once we have removed all these parts of the brain and after no more brain is left, humanity will be as pacific as an oak tree (desireless and completely zen).After reading this book, I would like to read an anthropological, psychological or biological explanation of the \\"mine is the only truth\\" part of the brain or why do we tend to go to extremes.

This is a not-so-artfully contrived homily by yet another wanna-be priest of scientism. Being (close) to a Ph.D. myself in Cognitive Science, I'm always confused by the willingness of certain of my colleagues to oversimplify. The NDE chapter adressed anoxia, ketamine, and various other \\"causes\\" of NDE's, but completely ignored the fact that out-of-body experiences are had all the time outside of the narrow range of conditions he specifies. He also fails to explain the tens of thousands of NDE's with strange components, such as clinically dead folks coming back, and telling doctors of happenings elsewhere in the hospital (happening while they were dead), being completely outside of any ability of the experiencer to perceive. In other words, it's usually good practice to believe half of what you hear, and take even less to heart. I find it somewhat laughable that authors like Alper consider themselves \\"rationalists.\\" All I can get out of it is that he's a poor philosopher of science."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Matthew Alper begins The God Part of the Brain with an explanation as to why belief in a supernatural being is important. If God does not exist, absolutes do not exist. For the most part, he says that our laws, our morals ... are as flawed and imperfect as the humans who created them. Any notion of good or evil, truth or falsehood would be left to the subjective interpretation of each individual. These concepts become relative terms.Death would provide a constant anxiety we could never escape. This angst includes not only fear of dying at some remote future time but also the immediate, daily fear of death by sheer happenstance: accident or disease. We see the fate of both old and young: the elderly die, sometimes in agony; we see the young die, maybe with leukemia or in an automobile accident. Alper posits that this fear of non-being would gnaw so heavily on our consciousness that it would destroy evolutionary development, leaving our race to face emptiness, meaninglessness, and ultimate despair.Next, The God Part of the Brain explains that unlike religious beliefs, the scientific method has provided mankind with a systematic way of observing, testing, and measuring reality as it is perceived by our brains through our senses. Alper only allows himself to believe whatever science can discover about God, including the very nature of this deity from a strictly physical, that is, from a scientific perspective.From his perspective of a time-line dating back to the Big Bang, Alper emphasizes that science has now explained the origin and evolution of the entire physical universe. This would include the 3.5 billion years of evolution of terrestrial life leading up to the appearance of thinking, conscious man. Yet, every truth mankind knows as certainty has come strictly from science; what we can know with conviction about God is this: God is a three letter word on a page.Alper explores behavior patterns characteristic of brute animals. Those exhibiting the same instinctual behaviors must be genetically wired to do so, he says. One example he gives is the intense labor behavior in an ant colony. Here, some insects are born to be workers, others become soldiers, some forage for food, one becomes the exalted queen. Without this innate caste system, the ant colony could not survive. Evolution has worked its miracle on these tiny creatures, building into their nervous systems the specific role each will play so that the fittest colonies survive.Likewise, Alper claims that human animals exhibit predisposed behavior patterns. Although he gives many others, a few example patterns would be: the creation of puberty rites, funeral rites, marriage customs, legal codes, sexual taboos, trade relations, penal sanctions, gift-giving. He would also include abilities such as speech, music creation, math computation, religious beliefs - although false, as evolutionary wired-in behavior patterns. Complex, involuntary, genetically inherited reflexes are responsible for all human expression of emotional states.Are we really that anthropocentric to believe that we are above the same laws of nature that bind each and every one of our evolutionary ancestors?The God Part of the Brain reasons that if evolution had not genetically built in a genuine but false belief in the supernatural, all motivation for self-preservation of our species would be gone. In order to survive the hopelessness of death, the first humanoid had to develop a coping mechanism -- a God center within its brain, however primitive -- or become extinct: \\"(God is) ... a coping mechanism that compels us to believe in an illusory reality to help us survive our unique awareness of death.\\"With this adaptive function within its corresponding physical part of the brain, the human race has been able to evolve--living and developing as if there is some ulterior reason to be. Man no longer needs to linger in lethargy, only to die by old age, sickness, his own hand, or the hand of immoral others. Although make believe, God is an entity projected out there from sheer necessity.I can truthfully say that The God Part of the Brain is an easy book to read. While somewhat philosophical and scientific, it is written in terms most any adult could read.A technical background is unnecessary to follow Alper's reasoning, or his fascinating concepts. The book is extremely thought-provoking and could be enthusiastically read as an introduction to college level courses in logic, basic philosophy, biology, evolution, and religion.Atheists admire the work for its assertion that God is a figment of the human thinking process and nothing more. On the other hand, Christians are drawn to the book to disprove Alper's disturbing theory, so they can persist with their methodical religious beliefs and practices.fascinated me, but I had a problem with Alper's main theory from the very first few pages. Here's why. If evolutionary adaptation instills in our brain the false notion of the supernatural so mankind has a reason to survive, why was continued existence necessary in the first place? Without it, humans would have become extinct--finis--kaput--the end!For some reason, The God Part of the Brain almost suggests purpose was involved in human adaptive evolution--it seems important that man survived. Also, how then can an atheist exist? Evolutionary adaptation should have weeded non-believers out aeons ago. Alper would explain that all human traits and characteristics fall within the parameter of the normal bell curve: \\"On the opposite end of this same curve are those we might call spiritually deficient, those born with an unusually underdeveloped spiritual function.\\"He claims that atheists fall at the lower end of the standard deviation of the religious bell curve. These folks are spiritually deficient in the same manner that some people are musically deficient. They have little or no talent nor are they able to appreciate melodies.To this reviewer, Alper's solution is problematic. Evolutionary adaptation of a God brain center so the species can survive is quite different than adaption of a music center. In the former case, non-adaptation would lead to extinction and evaporation of being. In the latter case, it would simply lead to some humans developing with more talent than others."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This book ranks among the top 5 books I've read in my lifetime!

It is logical, coherent, and answers a lot of questions about who we are as humans and how we reached our current state of social evolution. I believe most open-minded persons, after reading this book, would find it difficult not to accept that we are evolutionary beings whose behavior is substancially governed by our genetic make up.Another excellent book of similar subject matter is &quot;The Science of Good and Evil&quot; by Michael Shermer."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"This book by Mr. Alper is a wonderful tale of a personal spiritual journey written by an intelligent, honest person. But, although I agree with the conclusion that no gods exist if we can only have knowledge of &quot;things as we perceive them,&quot; I do not agree with Kantian metaphysics (i.e., subjectivism).Alper argues that because human reason is not adequate to provide us with objective knowledge of reality, a god or gods probably does not exist (this is a summary, his writing is much more eloquent). Again, I agree that no gods exist, but not because humans are incapable of answering that question, but because we are (in other words, I adhere to Objectivist metaphysics and epistemology).Alper's argument is well written, and is an important contirbution to religious and atheistic literature. But his conclusions are based on bad metaphysics. I also think his conclusion could be turned around: If objective knowledge is not possible for humans, yet we have a bend toward some kind of vague &quot;spirituality,&quot; then doesn't that constitute 'prima facie' evidence that a spiritual realm exists?Of course, Alper would be correct in saying that that means no religion is capable of &quot;Truth,&quot; but on a &quot;subjectivist&quot; view, neither is Alper. This book is great as a description of a personal journey, that is why it got 4 stars. But for an argument for atheism, or even a discussion of the limits of human knowledge and religion, turn to &quot;Atheism: the case against God,&quot; or &quot;Objectivism: the philosophy of Ayn Rand.&quot;"},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"The thesis here is that spiritual and religious experience is essentially something the brain *does*, not something that comes from 'God'/'external being'. The author argues that spirituality and religious impulses have emerged in the evolving brain by default amongst evolving social organisms- in this particular book relatively recently in hominid evolution. Key processes include the growing hominid awareness of death, which, when coupled with an innate anxiety function necessary for survival, ultimately led to spirituality, religious and mystical experience.The author ties together his own spiritual journey with ideas strung together from the likes of Jung, Kant, Plato, Freud, Darwin and E.Wilson, but unfortunately, in my view, leaves out many ideas concerning group conflict-something with which 'groupish' primates are very much affected. One trouble with emphasising 'awareness of death' in the evolution of religious impulses, is just how relevant the 'fear of death' is to say, teenagers-and yet teenagers can have a quite developed 'spiritual impulse'. (eg The average age of 'religious conversion' quoted in the book is 15.2 years, from a study of 15,000). The association of prayer with healing is discussed, (ie essentially placebo, but also stress reduction), 'near death experiences' (neurochemistry evolved to reduce anxiety), 'speaking in tongues' (glossolalia-not explained here, but possibly, in my view, an infant/childhood mechanism overlapping into adulthood-like crying tears), and others such as guilt, morality, etc are discussed in the light of evolutionary theory as applied to human behaviour.One major point I think the author misses though, is that like consciouness itself, 'spirituality' is likely a holisitic and/or emergant brain function, there may in many cases therefore be no specific 'part' as such. Another problem I had is that he vastly under-rates 'thinking' in other biological organisms. For example, in describing pantheistic mysticism \\"one feels that totality of the world is the greatest power and one can see themselves as part of that totality. During this experience a person has a sense that he is part of all that is around him\\" (p111). Why couldn't this be a kind of territorial instinct?-it could therefore be in other animals. In describing monastic mysticism-\\"a person experiences a surrendering of personal identity to a singular or central point of consciousness\\" (p110)-again why can't this be present amongst other social, hirearcheal organisms? Also, theistic mysticism-\\"seeng or feeling the presence of a personification or a named force which intones a higher power\\" (p110). There is no discussion of the possiblility of any of these experiences having biological origins more ancient than recent hominid evolution. There may be a difference between the ability to be 'spiritual', and to ability to formulate abstract concepts. (How does a bat really 'think'?). His argument against spirituality in other animals is wholly the lack of religious rites (p84), but 'religious rites' do not necessarily constitute spirituality-as anyone disillusioned with conventional religion will happily tell you (He alludes to this on p149). Another example of his gross under-rating of thinking in other animals is on p117, where chimps are given foot-noted recognition that they can see themselves in the mirror only because they have \\"evolutionary proximity to our species\\".The association of schizophrenia and (some) religious belief is also not mentioned, although the association is obvious and has been pointed out by others (eg Jaynes). In his discussion on 'religious conversion', for example, he suggests \\"when the ego is so riddled with anxiety that it ruptures, natural selection has installed our species with a physiologically based \\"religious spare\\"of \\"cognitive transformation\\", which often leads to \\"rapturous contentment\\". The cost of carrying this spare (in the gene pool) is \\"the small price of personal identity\\". However, there may also be more adaptive 'cost' than this-such a descriptive transformation is surprisingly similar to those who suffer schizophrenic breakdown through stress-there may *possibly* be a relationship, which is important. It is also possible that schizophrenia itself has biological precursors in other organisms-dissociating/splitting under stress may be adaptive.These points aside, his journey from religious skepticism to scientific explanation is tinged with individual strength and understanding, (notwithstanding what I would call his human arrogance). I liked his distinction between 'spirituality' and 'religion' (p149)-this is not widely recognised. I also think his points about different kinds of spirituality/mysticism are good- it seems our words for 'religion'/spirituality are woefully inadequate-which of course reflects our lack of understanding of the functioning of our own brains.Sociobiological in outlook-p156 quotes E.Wilson-\\"scientists and humanists should consider together the possiblity that the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the philosophers and biologized.\\" I happen to agree, but with much caution-frameworks which have stood socially for thousands of years need to be challenged/complimented very carefully, with verifiable science and open discussion.The book is a strong attempt to understand human nature. Very good, very controversial, with gaps and weaknesses likely to be strengthened in future years through ongoing brain research. Other books recommended in this general genre of 'sociobiology' are \\"Consilience\\" (broader philosophy of science, religion, sociobiology), and \\"Why God won't Go away\\" (neurological basis of spirituality)."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Just as I did, as a teenager Matthew Alper asked the big questions: Who is &quot;God&quot; and what is my relation to him? Which, if any, of the hundreds of religions and sub-religions is correct? Why do religions change so much over time? How come every person's religious view is different from everybody else's? Just as I did, Alper began a personal search for the answers to these questions. He looked everywhere. Like me, he found that the answers to the big questions of &quot;faith&quot; lie not &quot;out there&quot; but within us. He then continued his search far beyond mine, came to many well-reasoned conclusions, then documented and explained his findings in 'The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain'. This work draws on many scientific disciplines, including evolution, psychology, anthropology and history, to put into clear perspective the origin of the human need to seek a higher power and, more important, the effect this need has on humanity and its cultures. I found the book to be a &quot;revelation&quot; of sorts in that it finally makes sense out of the din of competing religious views. In this book Matthew Alper shows an enviable commitment to truth, exacting logic and scholarly research as well as a vast intelligence as he explains his search and the answers he found. I did not want the book to end! It explains a very important part of what it means to be human. 'The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain' has already made a very great, very positive impact on my life."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"The God Part of the Brain is the story of Matthew Alper's search for god. The short version of my review is that I think the author has articulately shared his genuine, open-minded search for an answer to the Big Question. It's a great read. He's smart and well read, and he presents a lot of interesting material. Few people tackle the question of god with as much humility, rigor and seeming lack of agenda as well as he does. Few people attempt to blend science and spirituality with the balance of open-mindedness and rigor that he does. I recommend it highly as a personal account of someone on the search.However, I do not recommend it as a book with much to say about the answer to the Big Question for someone else. He comes up with a conclusion, and I'm afraid my review is going to be a spoiler. So if you want to enjoy the explorations and follow him as he asks his questions with equally open mind, I would stop reading this review now.In my opinion his conclusion is a direct result of his process. His result was pre-ordained by his methodology and the decisions he made along the way. He walked himself into a box canyon and then concludes the canyon leads nowhere. I could see the result coming a thousand miles away. I don't think he had an agenda ... the book is personal enough for me to believe he has an open mind ... I just don't think he let his mind far enough out of the box.To appreciate where I'm coming from as a reviewer, I've signed up for the belief that we all create our own reality. And I believe that in just about every way one can believe it.So, in chapter 5 the author struggles with what he knows for certain about god, he comes to the conclusion that god is a word. At one level this is brilliant. It is just about the only thing one can say with certainty ... that \\"g ... o ... d\\" are 3 letters that form a word and exist as a concept. But this is where he starts to put god in a box. He now believes that god IS a word, and if we create our own reality, we now know that he is doomed to discover that god is only conceptual, which is what he discovers. Once he tried to anchor his search in certainty, all the aspects of god that can be experienced but not \\"known\\" by the mind got excluded from the search. I almost put the book down at this point, but the tale of his search was interesting enough.Once he put god in a box, his mind then jumps to a lot of conclusions to support the box. Although the book is filled with excellent questions and a generally rigorous approach, he takes a few key left turns very quickly and doesn't seem to recognize them.For example, he devotes a whopping 4 pages to plant medicine (e.g., mescaline, psilocybin) as chapter 10. The end of those 4 pages concludes with, \\"In essence, the fact that there exists a certain class of drugs - molecular combinations - that can evoke a spiritual experience supports the notion that spiritual consciousness must be physiological in nature. Herein lies the basis for an ethnobotanical argument against the existence of either a spiritual reality or a soul.\\" What? Because a physical thing can cause an experience, the experience must be physical? At this point his argument is circular. It's like saying that because I'm in a physical body, the spiritual body doesn't exist. This sounds like a reasoned argument, but it's just an opinion, obviously one this reader disagrees with. But again ... I don't fault his search or even his conclusion; I just don't think his conclusion encompasses what is possible. For example, he never considers the possibility of viewing the plant itself as spiritual.If I try to summarize where else I think he put himself and his conclusion in a box, it shows up in chapter 19. He discusses Kant (which I have not read) and agrees with Kant's perspective that humans are \\"forever bound to our relative human perspectives which are framed by the way our brains process information.\\" So far, so good. But then he \\"applies the same argument to spirituality\\" and concludes that all our spiritual beliefs \\"constitute nothing more than manifestations of the way our species happen to process information and therefore interpret reality.\\" The problem is this: he does not equally apply his conclusions to himself, the I. Yes, we are bound to our perspectives. Yes, spirituality is a fabrication of those perspectives. But there is a paradox he skips over ... I, also, am a fabrication of my perspectives. I don't exist as I think I do. But that doesn't mean I am not real. It also doesn't mean that the spiritual experience is not real. He's willing to accept the physical reality of himself in spite of his limited perception, but he turns the same argument against the existence of the spiritual. Again, the conclusion he arrives at is a simple function of how he applies his arguments.He buys into the standard argument that belief in an afterlife is a result of humanity being conscious of, and afraid of, death. This argument always ignores the fact that many of the people who have come as close as humanly possible to the experience of death, but not died, are often the people who have the least fear and hang-ups around death. Talk to someone who has survived a terminal cancer diagnosis. By and large they are not the ones locked up at home afraid to live. It's the people who keep death at arms distance who are afraid of it. This argument never holds water with me.So, as you can tell by my review, the spoiler is that he concludes we are physical beings and nothing more. I would say that this is the reality he has created for himself and he has done a magnificent job showing just how to create that reality. But if you are looking for a more expanded sense of self, there are other approaches that can lead to a different conclusion that are also completely consistent with rigor and the scientific method."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"I first came across this new science being coined &quot;neurotheology&quot; or what the author more aptly refers to as &quot;bio-theology&quot; when I read Newsweek's cover story several years ago titled &quot;God and the Brain: Are we 'wired' for spirituality?&quot; Finding this subject fascinating, I did a search on all books related to this field and worked my way through a great deal of them. From the works of Newberg, Albright and several others, I found their writings bland and incomplete. They were all apparently onto something, but they didn't seem to know what this was. Then I found Matthew Alper's The God Part of the Brain and found what I was looking for. Here, the author in a relatively small (though amazingly dense) work has pulled together every aspect of the scientific study of religion. Not only that, but he advances the most convincing explanation I've yet to come across as to why we evolved such a trait as spiritual consciousness. The book is then capped with a philosophical commentary as to how we, as a species, need to address this new research in order to advance mankind. Bio-theology, the evolutionary science of spirituality and religion, I predict will be the most relevant sociological and philosophical study of this coming century. While the world is engaged in religious war, this author provides answers and explanations that may be pivotal in resolving our modern conflict, something I agree with the author that if we don't come to terms with, we may very well destroy ourselves. Let me also note that those who might feel intimidated by the topics of cognitive and evolutionary science will find the book easy to read and brilliant in its lucidity and logic."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"Evolution invests every organism with the physiology, drives and strategies for survival. Every child born possesses strong motivation to achieve clarity, resolution and understanding of the world in order that it may prosper. If nothing else, man is a learner and problem solver, pitting his highly evolved intellect against a dangerous and confusing reality. The ability to understand and thereby control his environment is the hallmark of man's evolutionary niche. This recently published work theorizes, however, that man's brain also contains a region hardwired not for understanding or rationality but self-delusion. While &quot;surviving&quot; consumes man's impressive physical and mental energy, survival is, as we know, impossible in the long term. Every man and woman is guaranteed to lose his genetically motivated quest to survive among the fittest. According to Matthew Alper's, \\"The \`God' Part of the Brain,\\" this existential dilemma faced by sapient man alone, spurred the evolution of structures in the human brain which generate a cross-cultural predisposition for the metaphysical. This brain structure gave man the capacity to believe certain things existed even though none of his senses could confirm their reality. Why? Because belief in an alternate &quot;spiritual reality&quot; gave humans hope and consequently enabled our species to survive its unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. Religion provides a way to die, without actually dying. It creates &quot;Death-Lite.&quot; Alper theorizes that as man's intellectual evolution crossed the threshold of self-awareness, with it came the paralyzing knowledge of his own certain death. He was faced, as no animal before, with the problem of reconciling his innate arsenal of survival strategies and drives, with the debilitating insight that life was not survivable. The situation was dire. Life was like a fixed casino game. Why would anyone put his money on the table with no chance of winning? How could you play seriously? What was the motivation? Similar to cross-cultural drives as unlikely as those for music, humor, sport, dance, math, and language, Alper speculates that normal mutations formed rudimentary brain structures which allowed man to believe in an invisible world. Life for individuals with more highly developed &quot;God Parts&quot; in their brains was a lot easier. Unlike the others, they did not live life like cornered animals, constantly facing the withering finality of their own demise. Constantly hopeless. Constantly in a nerve-racking, exhausting, fight or flight mode. Religion, the ultimate survival strategy, allowed man once again to focus his formidable intellectual capacity with purpose, toward prospering and with this, continued evolution. With further evolution and the advent of society, however, came language, science and greater understanding of the physical forces governing the world as well as the psychological and social dynamics governing life and society. This knowledge, running leaps and bounds faster than evolution ever could, made religious beliefs much less plausible, much harder to maintain. Alper posits that this dissonance causes modern humans to be at odds with themselves, caught between their inherent quest for reason and their impulse to believe in the supernatural. In no uncertain terms, Alper veiws religion now as an often troubling appendage with largely outlived usefulness. It inserts irrational and fantastic elements into the lives of adherents, distancing them from the possibility of living more fulfilling, healthy and reality-based lives. It hamstrings man's original strong suit: rational thinking. He also speculates on the future of religion and its role in the lives and society of the animal possessing a \\"God Part\\" or capacity for \\"spiritual cognitive function.\\" He believes that man must come to understand the origins of his inherited, biologically-based religious inclinations and become aware he is born into a &quot;neurological web of deceit.&quot; Only then will he have a chance of offsetting his far-too-often destructive spititual impulse. The 185-page book delineates Alper's lifelong quest to understand religion and the religious drives which pervade all cultures, as well as his personal struggle to arrive at the role religion should play, if any, in his own life. He supports his theories citing the work of numerous philosophers, scholars and scientists as well as religious texts. His ideas rest most centrally on the writings and inquires of Philosopher Emanuel Kant, Psychologists Carl Jung and Jean Piaget, Evolutionary Biologist Edward O.Wilson, and Neurologist Dr. V.S. Ramachandran. The book depicts the author's intent to make rational inquiry into the fact that every human culture regardless how isolated, invariably maintains a belief in some form of a spiritual reality and the implication that this has a universal biological foundation. A screenplay writer by profession, Alper lives in Brooklyn, New York. \\"The \`God' Part of the Brain\\" is his first book.

Learned behavior - (but mother spiders aren't seen teaching baby spiders how to weave a web) 2. Free will - but stereotyped animal behavior is so uniform as to make this unlikely. Why would ALL moths choose to fly to a light? 3. Built-in genetic behavior - the accepted explanation.Moving on to humans, there are many examples of wide-spread, cross-cultural human behaviors. Who teaches children to cry when sad, or smile when happy? And always the smile is the up-turned lip. Of the three possible explanations, built in genetically programmed behavior is the most believable.Alper notes that virtually all humans have interpreted the Universe in a dualistic manner. All human cultures &quot;see&quot; both a physical and a spiritual world. All human cultures have invented gods to explain their world, have directed prayers to them, erected places of worship, invented complex mythologies, sought comfort in belief in life after death, etc. Could it not be that this complex behavior, common to all humans, so similar and stereotyped, is also best explained as the result of built-in, genetically programmed behaviors? Alper calls this the &quot;god part&quot; of the human brain and details evidence for its existence.The book is well researched, with sources documented.

Finally, I feel that I now have a tangible solution to the problem of spirit and God that makes perfect logical sense. And though I am sure that the author's [atheistic] conclusion will probably upset many readers (and based on some of the reviews I've read, this apparently seems to be the case), I think that anyone from skeptics to the religious can benefit from reading this book.

I actually found that the book does a nice job of presenting the foundations of a reasonable theory about the permeating presence of God and religion in human history. Alper's basic idea is that the enduring importance of faith and spiritual apsects of mankind can be attributed to the idea that these aspects are feelings, similar in nature to other emotive constructs, that serve a purpose with regard to man's survival.While he guides us along a fairly speculative journey, his ideas are certainly framed in a scientific manner, and he provides many interesting points to consider. Unlike some previous reviewers, I never felt insulted by his arguments or premise. I was not disturbed by his lack of biological detail, but I do think Alper could have been a little more adament in reminding us that the mechanics of biological evolution are at a different resolution (i.e. the gene level) than the grandiose abstractions that tend to click a little better in a reader's mind.I would also liked to have seen a little more consideration given to less rigid biological perspectives on the theory. Alper places a lot of emphasis on the biologically determined container (the &quot;God&quot; part) but does not adequately qualify his assumptions around what is biologically fixed about the container. His assumption is that we have a religious container, and culture dumps some kind of religion into it. But it could be that the container is a capacity for group cohesiveness (traits which promote human grouping into huge civilizations) and culture dumps the generality of religion into it--or something along those lines. While he does have arguments around his inferred scope regarding cultures that have developed in isolation of one another, we can use a memetic argument which parallels the concurrent development of the eye along isolated evolutionary paths to suggest that perhaps religion repeatedly pops up for reasons that aren't so constrained to such a specialized brain &quot;module.&quot;Ironically, one should certainly consider that if the author is correct, perhaps similar inherited aspects of our brain physiology prevent most from ever believing him."},{"Title":"The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God","review":"I have just finished reading the &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain, and I feel like I have experienced a spiritual awakening much like the ones described in the book.

Reading Caitlin R. Kiernan's \\"Low Red Moon\\" was a similar experience, only, unlike a dream, it can be repeated for enjoyment again and again. This story doesn't just stay with you, it takes up permanent residence in your head and makes you see differently.Although this book is a sequel, of sorts, to Kiernan's novel \\"Threshold,\\" it's quite possible you can read and enjoy it without having heard of the earlier book. However, if you have, it's like adding another dimension on top of our mundane three; it's almost bizarrely bruising to keep running into details -- seemingly the \\"wrong\\" details -- from \\"Threshold\\" (there's that tunnel) -- a strong sense not of parallel universes, but ghostly neverworlds, paths not taken, what-could-have-been bumping up against what-is (or is it?) and even in some cases influencing it. (And then there are some dreadfully unsettling echoes, like just one phrase -- \\"little pig?\\" -- that made me a little sorry I was finishing the novel at night.)It's difficult to write specifically about the plot in a review, not just for fear of spoilers, but because the idea of what might have been and never will be has a metaphorical thrust in the book, as in \\"Threshold.\\" We meet Deacon Silvey, and Chance, and Sadie, from the previous book, but although they remain the same -- or are they? -- their relationships to each other have changed to the point where Chance is eight months pregnant and Deacon has sobered up (his struggle with liquor is beautifully, nerve-wrackingly done). But just as in Threshold, they begin to be pursued by extreme, elemental, ferocious forces, only rather than coming from the depths of the earth or outer space, this dark power wells up from the human heart.The book is heartbreakingly sad, but not tragic. While I was finishing the final pages, there was a sort of tidal crash of mourning that seemed to \\"come out of nowhere\\" (but which had obviously been built up carefully throughout the first pages and first words). There are all kinds of fantastic little details about \\"the real world,\\" beautifully done shards of reality you don't find in most modern \\"realistic\\" novels -- the sense you get is of a real world being created, and cherished; the making, remembering, as an act of love. And this book is really about the power of love, sort of the way Silk was, except that was nearly a negative proof -- about the loss of love, or the failure of the promise of love -- where this book is a positive one -- about what love can do. Trust me on this one-- like \\"King Lear,\\" this story's really about love, and the harm, and healing, and hope, that love bears.This isn't to say the book is weepy, or dull, or slow; on the contrary, it's even more fast-paced than Threshold, filled with all kinds of funny lines and sharp observations and real people. From about about the beginning of Part II on I began to have a Foreboding that Things Were Not Going To Turn Out Quite All Right, accented by the deep bass-notes of sorrow Kiernan wrings out of the plot. It was like the first time I read through \\"The Return of the King,\\" and realized: Even if they get up Mt. Doom, and throw the Ring into the fire, even if they both live, things are....not going to Be All Right here. There is a Price. And yes, I did CRY at one point.* I couldn't help it. I bet when you get there you'll cry too.Kiernan is the enviable kind of writer who keeps getting better and better with each book -- this is her best-written yet -- tight, sharp, exciting, but with all kinds of gentle details and asides and world-building. Debates have already been held about whether or not it's \\"as,\\" or \\"more,\\" frightening than Threshold; for me, it was more heartrending than any of her other books I've read, containing a deep kind of terror and grievous acceptance of the prices we pay (\\"Grief is the price we pay for love,\\" as the Queen said on the Princess' death) that makes it more realistic and adult and about \\"real life\\" than, again, most modern, mundane this-is-the-American-experience-as-we-live-it-right-now \\"fiction,\\" which often seems terrified of the inventive power of fiction itself.In short, it's gorgeous, and harrowing, and one of the books of the year, in any and all genres.*\\"I wish it didn't have to end this way....I wish the story could have a better ending. I wish it could end, 'And then they all left the tunnel, went home and never met another monster and lived happily ever after.'\\"\\"That would be a fine story,\\" Chance tells her. \\"That would be a very fine story.\\""},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"The protagonists of Threshold return in a very different story, an original and chilling take on werewolves. Low Red Moon stands alone; you don't have to have read Threshold to understand it.It's interesting to watch an author learn and develop skills. Kiernan's writing has improved dramatically since her first published novel, Silk; there are still shiny stylistic twists, but there's also a solid, high-tension plot (better paced than Threshold) and well-realized, believable characters.Many things are well done here: the sentence-level writing, the way the dark secrets hidden at the book's center are revealed just enough to make sense, but not enough to lose their effect. Narcissa, the &quot;villain&quot;, is a complex character in her own right. The story's resolution will not please readers who want happy endings, but I liked it.I wanted more of the paleontology, wanted it worked into the story (which it is in Threshold more than in this book) rather than just being a character trait - it's interesting, original and has lots of horror potential.It's really good to know that someone is writing intelligent, stylish New Horror. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"When a psychic tracks down a serial killer and saves a victim most would call it a job well done. But for Deacon Silvey it turns into a nightmare. Asked to do a favor for the Birmingham police, Deacon becomes the target of a dark hunt, facing both the revenge of the old ones and the hopes of another killer to fulfill a dream of ascension. Had he been the only target, Deacon might have been able to stand firm, but the demon with yellow eyes has a ritual to perform - on those that Deacon loves.Deacon is an ex-alcoholic, trying to start a new life with Chance, his very pregnant young wife. When he seeks help with the dark visions that have begun to plague him, death follows his trail. Chance is a practical woman and a scientist - a paleontologist. She barely believes in her husbands powers and now finds she is having visions of her own. She is torn between her own bloody nightmares and her fears that Deacon will succumb to his own demons. A deep wedge is being driven between them and only catastrophe can follow.My first encounter with Caitlen Kiernan was Silk, her freshman novel. While chilling and interesting in its own right, Silk pales beside Low Red Moon, Kiernan's third. The events of this novel would be terrifying on their own, but Kiernan has learned to blend subconscious fears and a modern mythology with echoes of Lovecraft into a concoction as suspenseful and doom-filled as anything I've read in years.Dream and reality crisscross in splashes of blood, characters refuse to follow any stereotype, and the Southern gothic horror story gets an infusion of new ideas. Kiernan displays a command of language that transcends her chosen genre. The reader, of course, is the beneficiary, nose buried in a book that is both too chilling to read and impossible to put down. If this is your introduction to Kiernan, brace yourself, you will soon be hunting up everything she has written."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"The moody and impressionistic &quot;Low Red Moon,&quot; is Caitlin R. Kiernan's third, and best novel yet. This time out she brings back many of the Southern Gothic Birmingham characters from her previous novels and introduces them to an escapee from Lovecraft country, serial killer and psychotic Narcissa Snow. She wants to please and appease folks you would definitely not want to invite to your place.But Narcissa, arrested adolescent that she is, wants to be in with this ghoulish in crowd (they apparently are headquartered in a strange house in Providence) and so she sets off Southward to Birmingham on a killing spree (all the while listening in her head to the voices of the people she killed), and an attempt to steal the baby of eight-month-pregnant Chance, from &quot;Threshold,&quot; who's now married to recovering alcoholic Deacon Silvey. Narcissa wants to give the baby over to the in crowd as a ticket of admission. After many surprises, the chilling finale takes place back north in Lovecraft country as the sun sets and that low red moon rises on Halloween Night, 2001 a night when, as Ms. Kiernan assures us in her note in the front, the moon actually was full.The author expertly blends standard slasheriana (Don't go out for a cigarette, Alice! Why isn't there a police car at the rear entrance? Will you just hear the guy out before punching him in the nose, Deacon? A dark and stormy night? Oh oh!) with her own unique visions and her intoxicating prose style (she writes of &quot;old-fashioned lampposts along the street, gaslights with electric hearts&quot;) and brews up something rich and strange, fresh and piquant. She knows the concoction calls for certain required elements, but her garnishments are what make the difference. Its flavor will leave you spellbound.Notes and asides: On p. 18 you'll learn why Ms. Kiernan has abandoned her trademark technique of running words together. The Low Red Moon, occurring as it does on the last day of the month, was also a blue moon. Not for children under 13."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"I just finished Low Red Moon, and all I have to say is wow! I thoroughly enjoyed Silk, and thought that this one was even better. Kiernan's command of the English language and her skill in description are amazing. I'm not sure what the writing process was like, but I can say how I felt about the reading of this book. It's like a fever dream, and there's always something coming up around the bend. With Kiernan's books, I find myself itching to read the whole thing all at once. I can't wait to see what the next work holds."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan is one of the rising stars of horror, and her literary prowess is once again on display in her novel Low Red Moon. Not only is the story a most unpredictable of sequels to her highly acclaimed novel Threshold: A Novel of Deep Time, it is streaked with deadly slashes of originality. Whereas Threshold was rooted in a neo-Gothic Lovecraftian universe, Low Red Moon is a more conventional tale brandishing a fascinating, intriguing, yet slightly incomprehensible source of evil. We first meet murderess Narcissa Snow sitting in a hotel room that she has remade into a bloody chamber of horrors, arguing with the voices of a lifetime of victims as she waits fervently for a phone call. We are given strange glimpses of a dark fellowship which Narcissa is determined to join, and it soon becomes clear that whatever horror she will unleash in these pages is done in pursuit of that one goal, a desire to belong in a group of indefinable monsters somewhere in a yellow house in Providence.After dipping our toes in the bloody pool of this sadistic killer's persona, the scene shifts to Birmingham, Alabama, where Deacon Silvey and Chance Matthews, the primary characters in Kiernan's earlier novel Threshold, are married and expecting a child. Theirs is a most unconventional of partnerships: Chance is a learned paleontologist and Deacon is an unemployed recovering alcoholic and reluctant psychic. Against his wishes, Deacon finds himself being consulted by the local police on a series of recent murders. Not only can Deacon \\"see\\" the murders as they were committed, he in turn can be seen in those visions by the killer and is made to understand that she comes seeking him.A strange man and teenaged girl only thicken the plot, for they come to Deacon in search of the woman they know is searching for him. Deacon is never sure whom to trust or believe, but he does know that his pregnant wife is in danger as long as this killer is on the loose. I have to admit I found several aspects of this novel confusing, and my enjoyment of the story was limited somewhat by the fact that I simply did not like a single character in these pages. Deacon is an inscrutable man, keeping secrets from the police, his wife, and (when he can do it) himself, and he is constantly on the verge of giving up and retreating back into alcoholism. Toward the end of the novel, some of Deacon's actions and thoughts struck me as remarkable if not incomprehensible, further damaging the rather low opinion I already had of him. His wife Chance is far less complicated but even harder to like, constantly nagging Deacon about his involvement in psychic matters she puts no stock in; if there is love in this relationship, it is not easy to find.As far as the plot goes, I feel as if I'm missing a few pieces to the puzzle. Narcissa Snow is a fascinating, truly disturbing murderess, yet her reasons for all the bad things she did never made complete sense to me, and one possible aspect of her identity felt completely out of place in the context of the novel. The conclusion, for its part, works pretty well, maintaining the darkness which seems to brood over the entire novel. The epilogue does not completely succeed in pulling together some of the disparate storylines of the preceding pages, but it does make an honest, appropriately subtle attempt.Low Red Moon seemed to hang over my imagination like a death shroud, mimicking in some small way the effects of Deacon's constant migraines on his well-being. This is simply a dark tale that likes to skip rocks across the lake of hopelessness. A sense of gloom and doom is appropriate to the tale being told, but a cast of characters who do not, in my perception, share a single spark of life among them made this otherwise compelling read something to be endured as well as enjoyed."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Low Red Moon shows us a writer at the top of her game. Caitlin Kiernan has written consistently high quality books, but here she surpasses all expectation.A dark, and genuinly terrifying tale, weaving the battles against epic evils and the no less harrowing ones against daily life, like alcoholism, and domestic responsibility. I could not put this book down.Also, though technically a sequel to 'Threshold', this story stands so well alone, that I would recommending reading it immediately, and then going back for Threshold, if you haven't read it already.This is the best book I have read this year."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Part of my problem with this book is although I read Silk many years ago, the next book I read by Kiernan was The Red Tree, and that book absolutely knocked my socks off - a five star plus read!!Low Red Moon displays Kiernan's characteristic poetic prose and impressive imagination - it is an indisputably impossible to put down book: provocative and mysterious!The ending however was way over the top, and not wanting to write a spoiler review, simply put: a let down, darker than it needed to be -- but then maybe that's Kiernan's point, that there is no evil that one human will not do to another. So I did struggle with 3 or 4 stars and will settle on 3-1/2!Kiernan's powerful portrayal of communication between a mother and her unborn child was fascinating. I agree with the publisher's review that the dialog between characters was sometimes distracting and tedious - but aside from these two flaws, the power of Kiernan's prose is undeniable. I'll definitely be reading all of her books."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"I tried to take my time and savor this book. The writing is lucid and streamlined, easier to get lost in than some of Caitlin's other writing (for whatever that's worth). I'd recommend reading Caitlin Kiernan's other work first, simply because numerous tidbits from other books make cameo appearances and I always enjoy that sort of thing, it adds another dimension to the story. Not to say that Low Red Moon doesn't stand on it's own- it certainly does, and I'd say this is probably the best novel from Caitlin Kiernan so far.One of the most interesting facets in this book is the portrait of Chance and Deacon's relationship. Their marriage is one of those that seems quite incomprehensible- they hide things from each other, are short with and unpleasant to each other frequently, and generally behave in a extremely believably human fashion. It's the sort of marriage that makes you start psychoanalyzing the two people in it. Why does Chance marry someone who she clearly doesn't respect- and doesn't have much reason to? Why does Deacon stay with someone who denies a huge chunk of his life? It's all quite interesting, and just like life, there are no concrete answers. I might speculate that they're both terrified of being alone, and that Chance kind of enjoys feeling superior to her semi-deadbeat husband, but who knows?Really, the depth of characterization and wonderfully literate writing style make this a must read."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"He's a gifted psychic who gave the police the break they needed to find Mary English, a serial killer who killed fourteen children. Deacon Silvey solved many cases for the Atlanta police before the ugliness he subjected himself to finally wore him out. He was an unemployed drunk living in Birmingham when he met Chance, a young woman on the right side of the tracks who wanted Deacon but only if he gave up the bottle.They eventually married, the geology professor and the recovering alcoholic and they expect their child to be born in a matter of weeks. Their happy life shatters when serial killer Narcissa Snow enters their lives first through a vision and then in physical form. She wants their child to offer up to the monsters in the hope that they will make her one of their own. When she kidnaps Chance, days before the birth Deacon must rely on an otherworldly being to track Narcissa before she can have his wife and child.Caitlin R. Kiernan will appeal to readers who like the works of Poppy Z. Brite. She writes dark fantasy where happily ever after is never guaranteed. The protagonist is a dark and brooding Heathcliffe who can act the hero when the need arises and has the inner fortitude to handle the tough breaks fate throws at him. LOW RED MOON is a haunting gothic urban fantasy that will not easily be forgotten.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"C R. K's sentences wiggle into your brain like big juicy worms through rich soil. There are images within LRM that gnaw with sharp teeth. It is a tale of monsters, dripping blood, rotted houses and rotted minds. The characters, like most real people, may not be to everyone's liking but they are fully formed. I was highly impressed with the portrayal of stress in the relationship between the parents-to-be, Chance and Deacon. There is a raw authenticity between them that I don't find in many horror novels. I would finish the review with some acknowledgment that C R.K is becoming the new so-and-so but that would be an injustice. She is simply---herself.p.s.---I only give the book four stars \`cause I live in the rust and rot of Birmingham. I have been down many of the streets and inside many of the locations she writes about.

So complex and well thought out. Already ordering the next one."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"This is my fifth novel by the author, and it's quite hard to rate. While I thought it was a four-star effort through most of my reading, at the end it just wasn't that good. With her first two novels (Silk, Threshold), the first half was way too slow and then the books picked up quite a bit in the second half and became very enjoyable. While the action starts quite a bit earlier in Low Red Moon, it never quite speeds up like in the other books. It's all very slow and overly descriptive, while nice at first, became quite distracting later on. I just wanted her to get on with the story. That's another problem I had with Low Red Moon: too much atmosphere and not enough plot. With that said, I did think the characters were well drawn. I especially liked that Sadie (from Threshold) was back in this one. The references to characters from Silk were also a nice touch.Overall, Low Red Moon was a decent read. Not as good as I'd hoped, though. I'll settle on giving it 3 and a 1/2 stars, because I do think as a whole it worked better than Silk, but it wasn't all that much more enjoyable than Threshold. I think I prefer Threshold, actually.Here is how I would rate the five novels I've read by this author:Silk (3 stars)Threshold (3 and a 1/2 stars)Low Red Moon (3 and a 1/2 stars)The Red Tree (5 stars) - start here if you're new to her workThe Drowning Girl (5 stars)"},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Married, living in a new apartment, with a child on the way, Chance and Deacon are trying to make a go at a normal life. But when Chance begins to have vivid, violent visions and Deacon, a gifted psychic, is pulled into a police search for a serial killer, their peace and safety are utterly destroyed. Low Red Moon is the second in a loose series featuring these characters, and it's a story of otherworldy forces, approaching madness, and the people that try to survive within this chaos. It has a number of unequivocal strengths: The cast is beautifully realized, and recovering alcoholic Deacon and murderous Narcissa steal the show--a combination of destructive personalities and compelling motivations makes each stand out. The ghouls, vampires, and gods which haunt the edges of Kiernan's world give the plot depth and intrigue. And, as always, Kiernan's prose is rich, artful, and a pleasure to read.But while I enjoy all of Kiernan's novels, some--like Threshold, like The Red Tree--strike me as superb: they are arresting, terrifying, and I return to them again and again. Low Red Moon is not such a book. Rather, like Daughter of Hounds, it is enjoyable, and good, but not quite great. It doesn't seem to contain quite enough. The aspects which haunt the fringes of the text, from the ghouls which construct the fantasy landscape to the characters which tie it to Kiernan's other novels, sometimes distract from or overwhelm the plot at hand--a problem exasperated by the fact that Chance, although apparently the protagonist, lacks agency, and the book's pacing is at first too leisurely and then too rushed, which makes for slow buildup and an abrupt conclusion. Many aspects of the novel shine, but too much in Low Red Moon feels overshadowed or underexplored--as if the heart of the action (and the best of the book) is occurring offstage and, rather than intrigued by the mystery, the reader is simply left disappointed. That not all of Kiernan's novels meet the high standard of her best work is hardly a failing. Low Red Moon is still enjoyable, thoughtful, and artful--just as I would expect from Kiernan. I do recommend it. But it's not my new favorite."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"As much as I hate the cover of this edition, I can't bring myself to rate this book less than five stars for it. Low Red Moon is brilliant book. It's not a scary story, even though parts of it are definitely scary. It's the story of a couple and the people around them in a situation they can't even comprehend. That's what makes it so effective. It's not just there to shock or scare you. It's a story that you can genuinely care about. Some of the events and characters fit into the category of unbelievable and otherworldly, but they blend right in to the gritty \\"real world\\" of the central characters so well that they're just another part of the story instead of something that takes your attention away from it."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan, Low Red Moon (Roc, 2003)When you pick up a book by Caitlin Kiernan, there are some things you know you can expect. Top-shelf writing. Strange houses with dark pasts.

And, yes, you get all of them in Low Red Moon.Deacon Silvey had two careers, one as a psychic helping out the police department, the other, his full-time one, as a drunk. After meeting Chance, the woman who was to become his wife, he left both behind. Now, a police detective calling in an old favor has landed Silvey's name for an unsolved case. Against the protestations of Chance, Deacon goes with the detective to the crime scene and finds the body of a friend of his from the old days. What Deacon sees entangles him in a web that goes far beyond this murder, both in terms of geography and in terms of Deacon's past. Meanwhile, Chance is having bloody visions of her own.If you're already aware of Kiernan's work, then you know the level of quality you can expect. If you don't, some of the references here might confuse you; Kiernan's work is an ever-growing web around a mythology upon which this novel touches. You might want to start with some of her earlier work.

This is simply a brilliant novel, in every way. Though more mature than its predecessors, LOW RED MOON still delivers all those things we've come to expect from her. There is no one writing dark fiction today who has more skill as an author, and I can't wait to see what she does next!!"},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"I think this book is amazing. I couldn't have imagined a better sequel to Threshold, even though the ending left me feeling unsettled, which is good. I will continue to buy this fantabulous lady's books until she can no longer write them, but not from you guys, because you charge too much for shipping and handling! Bye now!"},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"\\"Low Red Moon\\" includes some wonderful characters; well-defined, thought out, and at times, very sympathetic. However, the plot is beyond convoluted. I was especially disappointed by the ending. Its head on collision with my memories of H.P Lovecraft drove me to re-watch the awful interpretation of \\"The Dunwich Horror,\\" produced by Roger Corman in 1970. The ending of \\"Low Red Moon\\" was so similar (albeit, minus the Hounds) that I almost threw the book across the room. It's one thing to build on another author's work but an altogether different thing to use the same plot, ideas, and very world of another author. Bitter disappointment from a writer who can actually write."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"In this sequel to Threshold, Deacon and Chance are married and Chance is pregnant. Sadie is Deacon's friend, but neither remember their affair after Chance left Deacon. Even Chance doesn't remember turning back time in the water tunnel to save Elisa, but instead is again freaked out by her psychic premonitions of raining blood.This story is really about Narcissa Snow, a part goblin child raised by an insane father on the coast of Rhode Island. She is convinced that if she gives the goblins a changeling child, then she will finally be accepted into the goblin community. The child she wishes to give them is Chance's. She travels to Birmingham, committing mutilations and murders along the way. Deacon is caught up in her schemes when Narcissa kills one of Deacon's old friends and the police ask Deacon for his psychic assistance.The best part of the novel is that the author has cleaned up her language. The narrative is strong and sure. The worst part of the novel is that not for one second can you believe that Deacon loves Chance or that Chance loves Deacon. Why did they get married? Why is Deacon sober? Chance seems to hate Deacon and is always convinced that he is about to fall off the wagon. Deacon feels weak and useless. If you have no sympathy for the main characters and no understanding of their situation, then the author has done a very poor job. It is rather depressing that such a good writer has no understanding of human motivations."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Not only does Caitl&iacute;n R. Kiernan tell a good story, she tells a story well--a rare combination in publishing. With Low Red Moon, Kiernan sheds most of her more jarring stabs at stylism (except for an excessive use of \\"and\\"), keeping the pace fast without throwing the reader out of the suspension-of-belief zone. One quality of her storytelling is her ability to sketch her characters to a point, and then let the reader fill in the backstory. Are Deacon and Chance still in love or is their marriage dysfunctional? Were they ever in love? The answers do not matter. The story proceeds just fine regardless whether the reader decides the answers or not. Also, whenever the plot begins to feel a bit too familiar, Kiernan wrenches it into another direction with a well foreshadowed character quirk. If you are new to the writings of this author, then Low Red Moon is an excellent first book."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by Caitlin Kiernan and as much as I love the others (Silk, Murder of Angels & Threshold) this was by far my favorite.Low Red Moon picks up with Chance, Deacon and Sadie a few years down the road after Threshold. Sadie is pursuing her writing with the support of her parents and Deacon is now sober and married to Chance. Adding stress and anticipation to the mix; Chance is pregnant and due to deliver quite soon. But the impending arrival of an unplanned baby is not the problem, of course, the problem is a sadistic serial killer who is zeroing in on Deacon invading his dreams and going after those close to him. As dark as Threshold was, this story is darker and takes us down a rabbit hole with more twists and turns than can be counted.I couldn't put this one down and when I was forced to by interuptions I was counting the minutes until I could get back to it. This read was gripping and had a momentum that I couldn't resist. This book also introduces new characters and more mysterious and dangerous creatures, with hints and glimpses of worlds existing alongside ours but that most people can't percieve... and they are not pretty places. Some things we are better off not knowing and, as in H.P. Lovecraft's tales, learning certain things can bring hapless mortals to the attention of beings it would be better to be unmarked and unnoticed by.Low Red Moon is a perfect example of urban fantasy blended seamlessly with horror. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"In the shadow of Red Mountain Birmingham goes about it's day without seeing the shadows within it. This is a great book in a linked group of books by Keirnan. No need to read them in order, they stand alone. The characters are very strong and engaging. The darkness and menace are excellent.The Lovecraftian / Southern Dark Fantasy / Mind Bending Fiction mix is excellent. The heroes are imperfect and the villains are as well. It's not a simple formulaic story with a made for TV ending. It's a satisfying story for grown ups that feels all too real."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"I read \\"Low Red Moon\\" months ago. It was the first book I'd ever read by Caitlin Kiernan. I devoured the text in a matter of hours, set it down satisfied with the tale, and then the haunting began. Should I permit my mind to wander (as it is wont to do) Narcissa Snow comes to visit. I think about the tragedy and horror that was her life, wonder what if - what if she had been accepted by someone, anyone? What if her mother had been a part of her life? What if the creature that was her grandfather did not exist? Deacon and Chance stop by from time to time to torture me with trying to figure out what makes them tick. It is a true sign, I think, of a great writer when she creates characters so real, so intriguing, that long after their tale is done, you cannot forget them.I have just begun my love affair with Caitlin Kiernan's writing. I won't bemoan the fact that I just \\"discovered\\" her, instead I am delighted that there are so many books already written that I can indulge in. With a new book just released and no signs of Kiernan's vast talent waning, I have many years of reading pleasure awaiting me."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Caitl&iacute;n R. Kiernan has spent a decade writing more engaging fiction than a great percentage of writers currently publishing. By that I mean not to slight other writers but to imply her fiction is not created from formulas that can be browsed casually for entertainment. The reader is engaged. The reader must actively read. The payoff is the richness and depth and detail of the work which is nothing short of astonishing.LOW RED MOON is no exception. It is a superior work. In a line of great works it is her best to date.Chance and Deacon Silvey are married with a baby on the way. Chance is a paleontologist who works hard to keep her life grounded in reality. Deacon is an ex-alcoholic grounded in nothing more than survival and struggling to build a foundation with Chance. Deacon is troubled by migraine-inducing visions he doesn't want that seem to help everyone but himself. Chance has chosen to distance herself completely from this, to believe these visions are no more than a product of Deacon's self-induced afflictions or something else equally easily explainable. Until she begins to experience hallucinations of her own. This alone gives the novel plenty of room for character exploration. The interaction between these two and a small host of minor characters crackles with intensity.But the pivot of the novel is Narcissa Snow. A someone, or more precisely some *thing,* hunting them with a personal agenda that makes the marriage growing pains seem trivial by comparison. Narcissa is a well developed evil that appears to be unstoppable. And if you have read any of Ms. Kiernan's works you know nothing is guaranteed and the price for survival is high.The characters are well drawn and their interaction is a tightly stretched high-wire as each fights personal battles from within and external battles forced upon them.The last one hundred pages are dynamic, gut-wrenching, and emotionally exhausting. It is impossible to finish this book and not be affected by it.Ms. Kiernan's research and attention to detail are well known to anyone who has read any of her previous work. Here in LOW RED MOON she displays this hard work in the most accessible novel she has written to date. If you have yet to read anything by her and were looking for a place to start, this book is your golden opportunity to be introduced to a writer of spectacular talent.If you are familiar with Ms. Kiernan's work it will be hard to not see she is a writer becoming more sure, more solid with each publication."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Caitlin Kiernan has outdone herself yet again! Low Red Moon is a perfect example of her surreal, yet gritty and earthy, fiction. Each character of Low Red Moon is finely etched, so that you *feel* what they feel as the story progresses and the horror mounts. The reader is drawn quickly onward into the madness, never quite sure *who's* madness it is. Deke shows us that our flaws are what make us human, and the reader loves him for that. The tension builds as things unseen are seen, and you fear for each character's fate. The conclusion of this story is heartbreaking, yet uplifting in its humanity. Five Stars for Kiernan's best work to date! If you've never read her fiction before, or want to give a book to someone as a gift, this novel is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"After reading \\"Bradbury Weather\\" in Subterranean magazine, I decided I wanted to have a closer look at Caitl&iacute;n R. Kiernan's fiction. After some consideration, I picked up Low Red Moon from a local bookstore and read it through. I was enthralled, having a harder and harder time putting it down the farther I got into the work.First off, the present tense narrative threw me in the beginning. Modern fiction conditions the reader to read in the past tense so when I started reading the book; it was difficult and slow. However, it worked well with the flashback being in past tense. The changes in tense gave the reader a definite indicator when they were in the story. I overcame the tense issue about 50 pages in and was reading at full speed.Another problem I had, which is entirely with me, was I was trying to define what Narcissa was. At first, taking a hint from the title, I thought she was a werewolf. Then I began to doubt that, thinking that perhaps she was a ghoul. I knew Kiernan had steeped her story in Lovecraftian Mythos and because I knew that, I tried to drop the character into a preconceived hole. Needless to say, the she did not fit in any holes, but she was still an enjoyable and very flawed character.The story is well told over all. The pacing. I enjoyed Detective Downs, Starling Jane and Scarborough Pentecost. The description was overwrought at times, but it did not slow the story too much. Her world was also well thought out and not fully explained - which is good. I liked how she pioneered her own mythos, not falling into the worn ruts that modern fiction and role-playing games have made.I do have to say, I found the ending was too sketchy. I understand why the scenes seem to skip was characters fade in and out of consciousness and action. However, I am interested in exactly how Deacon left the tunnel with the baby. I did not expect it to be an easy thing and with leaving it out of the story, it detracted from it.I would definitely recommend this story to friends interested in fantasy, horror or the Lovecraftian vein (in fact, I already have). Kiernan has a very distinct style, and I look forward to reading future works from her."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Bone, gristle and blood. That is all that Ms. Kiernan has put into this book. Which is why you should eagerly pour your hard-earned into it as soon as inhumanly possible.A story that bleeds off the page, characters who whisper in your ear, and an undefined sense of unease that will keep you up all hours will be your reward. Your only chance for disappointment will be eventually leaving these people, these characers, behind.Someday you may resume your normal life functions. No guarantees. It's only your eternal soul, after all.dethbird"},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"This is the sequel but not quite sequel to Threshold. Those of you that read Threshold will know what i am talking about and those of you that haven't you should. This novel center's around Deacon and Chance Silvey,now married with a baby on the way. All is not good in Silvey world because Deke is a recovering alcholic and spends all of his days trying not to drink. Than one day Deke is called into a investigation to use his Psychic Abilities to try and get a lead on the murder of a previous associate of his. What he finds is not pretty.It turns out that a hybrid monster of a sort is on a killing spree and has her sights set on Deacons baby who she think's will get her admitted to The Hounds(see frank belknap long).This monster that is tracking the Silvey's is also being hunted herself as well. The two trackers are Scarborough and Mary Jane and they have been assigned as agents of The Hounds to track the hybrid monster that goes by the name of Narcissa Snow down and kill her.This story is very well written but not scary in the same sense as Threshold. Ms. Kiernan really is the heir to Lovecraft in every way and is superior in some ways as well. I reccomend this book to anyone out there who is looking for a good horror novel in the same vein as Lovecraft and his circle."},{"Title":"Low Red Moon","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan is a writer whose gift of words often leaves me breathless in both wonder of her skill and envious hope that I could one day possess even half of her poetic brilliance. Low Red Moon is a novel that bewitches the reader from the start with glimpses of the darkness that lurks just beyond the fringes of our world. It takes the reader on a realistic journey of the unreal. Though the soul of the book lies not in the journey itself, but in the characters who take it. Low Red Moon is peopled with bluntly realistic characters who fight to survive in both their everyday world -- Deacon's fight to keep his sobriety is painfully articulate, and Chance and Deacon's marriage under pressure nearly snaps at the breaking point in countless places in the story but their underpinning love always shines through to smooth the jagged edges -- to the fight of the characters to understand and survive a dark world which ensnares them all as the story unfolds. Narcissa Snow is a deliciously evil character, yet poignantly frail at times, giving the book and its inhabitants a realistic balance against its stark and foreboding dark backdrop.Kiernan is an author whose voice rings like the crisp tolling of a bell in an otherwise muddled and bland wasteland of predictable and soulless stories nowadays. Low Red Moon is what storytelling is all about. It is books like this that make me remember just why mankind has the gift of words and communication."},{"Title":"Fetterd Or Free: British Women Novelists, 1670-1815","review":"I read the entire collection of articles as I wrote my dissertation in the early 1990s.

Additionally, Mali can insert relevant quotations from Vico at precisely the right place in his text.

These topics are all addressed in a series of very easy to read essays that takes the reader through the journey of determining what is best.I found this a very good read and one that I will ponder for sometime."},{"Title":"The Koreans: Passion and Grace","review":"I am an independent scholar who doesn't speak Korean but is very interested in ethical issues debated among Korean Christians. Given my understanding of Confucianism in Korea, and the very negative attitudes towards adoption as a result, it seems likely that Christian thinkers in Korea have unique wisdom to offer Christians elsewhere. They must have/still be wrestling with their society's worship of ancestors and the demand on many societal levels to produce biologically related sons. It can be no accident that South Korea is so persistent in cloning efforts.All of this is to explain what I wanted out of Howe's book - a deep look at all phases of Korean society by someone who knows what they are talking about. And I got it. As an outsider to Korean studies, I established the authority of Howe by using a resource available to me in library school - WorldCat. This is a catalog of millions of holdings in public and academic libraries - mainly American. I found this work is held in 460 libraries, including the US State Dept., the National Geographic Society Library, various Air Force Libraries, a couple in Hong Kong Universities, as well as in American universities that have strong Asian Studies programs - Harvard, Yale and UC-Berkeley. This gave me confidence that when this was published, it was regarded as accurate by experts.The fact that it is almost 20 years old concerned me that perhaps it has been superseded, but again WorldCat showed otherwise. Out of over 600 hits for works with the subject: South Korea - social life and customs, this came up at #4 in the list of most held books on the subject. And none of the top three were that much newer than Howe's, or as extensive.The tone of the book is opinionated - refreshingly so. It is a far easier read than so many scholarly works that appear to be toeing some ideological line but are doing it in code. There is clearly the potential to come away with misconceptions based on the author's biased views but the overall accuracy of his views must be high given the kind of libraries that carry it. An example of this is his explanation of the similarities between Korea and their former colonial masters, the Japanese. Given such horrific Japanese abuses such as \\"comfort women\\", it is a bold person who is brave enough or foolish enough to tell Koreans how much they are like the Japanese.I was particularly interested in anything that would touch on religion in the life of Koreans. His extensive section on shamanism was a revelation to me; this is not something I have seen addressed in any of the writings on/or by Christians in Korea. It is likely an area of embarrassment for those who want to advertise the explosion of Christianity in Korea - but its existence must be understood for a complete picture of what is going on in Korea. The author's view of fundamentalists' theology was painfully true - not big on Jesus but sure they do love the Old Testament. It was in this paragraph though, that I found the only error obvious to me. He says that most Christians consider the Book of Revelations heretical which simply is not accurate. Different interpretations are considered heretical by different branches of Christianity but no orthodox Christian rejects Revelations as a whole.One area that is not addressed much is business. This may be a factor of the book's age. Nor, of course, is the impact of the Internet, video games or the nuclear threat of North Korea.I can easily overlook such omissions or minor mistakes in light of the new lines of inquiry he has opened up for me. I also am looking forward to using his bibliography; it only has twenty works, but I can be assured they are well chosen and informative."},{"Title":"The Koreans: Passion and Grace","review":"This guy is remarkably insightful when it comes to the Korean mind.

It is a very high quality picture book. As with other picture books published in the early part of the 1900s, there is a lot of text on each page. The illustrations are just absolutely gorgeous: museum like quality paintings. About every other page is a full color painting with a high level of detail. The other pages are adorned with black line drawings. The book is arranged in chapters. The story is about a brother and a sister who live near a newly constructed train line. The children fall in love with the trains and want to learn all about them. The children get to know the train workers who teach them, in high detail, about the workings of the train. The children go on a train ride in the cab with the engineer, a visit to the roundhouse, seeing a break-down crane train, a visit to the freight yard, and a trip inside a passenger coach. There are similar stories and adventures, which I am not listing here.This book is very detailed yet held the interest of my train loving 3 year-old. I highly recommend it for all young train lovers. I wish there were more books on the market like this one. After reading this, the modern children's books look like very watered down text with lesser quality illustrations.Due to the high level of detail, this book ends up being educational in nature, although written as pure storytelling. It is also not at all boring to for the adult to read to children!"},{"Title":"101 Miracles of Natural Healing","review":"The book 101 Miracles of Natural Healing by Luke Chan takes one into the world of the #1 healing qigong method used in China.

The book makes it so you can begin right away practicing this healing technique for yourself no matter what your physical condition, as well as giving encouragement through the stories. There is a lot of wisdom in each story. The people interviewed talk about what they visualize as they practice, as well as the emotional and physical challenges as they conquer their illnesses.

The challenge for those of us in the West has been finding access to this healing method. Chinese qigong instructors kept their techniques hidden--and they only taught a small number of acolytes their secrets. And the method of instruction was to only teach a few of the moves in the entire form at a time--and a student would have to wait ten or twenty years for the next few moves to be revealed from their Master.I particularly like Luke Chan's flavor of qigong--he (taking a style of qigong he learned from Dr. Pang Ming) teaches whoever wishes the entire form right at the beginning--and he lets YOU be your OWN qigong Master.His website--www.chilel.com--offers CDs and a video (also on DVD) to take you through the movements that make up this style of qigong.Doing this form of qigong (called \\"chi-lel\\") has assisted me in losing weight, overcoming clinical depression, and healing from Gulf War-caused Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Chi-lel qigong is gentle, noninvasive, easy to do, and can be done by anyone of any age, any health condition, no matter where in the world they might live.Come--join the worldwide movement of the family of chi-lel qigong practitioners!"},{"Title":"101 Miracles of Natural Healing","review":"This is a book about Chi Gong, a form of exercise and how it was used to heal 100 different people in China.

This book was published in 1965, barely pre-dating the publication of Venturi's influential \\"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture.\\" Now that I've read both, if I had to recommend one, I would recommend Peter Collins. While Venturi attacks Modernism by simply saying \\"its not complicated enough, I like complex architecture (and therefore you should too)\\" Collins goes much, much more in-depth.The various ideas architects have desperately flung around since 1750 are all traced, dissected, and put into their social contexts. Rationalism, Romanticism, Ecclecticism, Historicism/Archeology, Classics versus Goths, the Moderns, the various analogies to other fields architects have attempted - it is all discussed. The book stops at 1950, but this does not detract from its relevance in 2004, as we can see that architects have continued to explore connections with other genres in order to create their various forms. It is important to realize what we're doing and if it has ever be done before - and - it all pretty much has been. Not to despair though, Collins keeps it an interesting read, if you do not chuckle at his wit every now and then, then your sense of humor is dead. It is important to read this critically, and I found myself only very occasionally disagreeing.One of my favorite chapters, which is almost a six-page long joke, is entitled \\"Architecture and Gastronomy.\\" (and yet - it is not a joke!)The only criticism of the book is perhaps his less-intensive use of illustrations than he might have. Those that he does include however are well-chosen.A very closely related work to this is J. Mordaunt Crook's 1987 \\"The Dilemma of Style: Architectural Ideas from the Picturesque to the Post Modern.\\" Crook makes a book that attempts to do essentially the same thing, but has a slightly diferent perspective. I mention it because I believe these two, Crook and Collins, should be read by any architect worth their salt.Kenneth Frampton writes a fairly interesting introduction to the 1998 edition, hopefully this book will continue to have stamina for future generations of architects."},{"Title":"Spearhead for Blitzkrieg: Luftwaffe Operations in Support of the Army, 1939-1945","review":"After the Second World War German military personnel were interrogated by Americans about their experiences on the Eastern Front. The reasons for this was to provide intelligence for a possible war against Russia. These studies must have recently been made public as there are a number of them released in book form.The author of this book or more correctly the author of a series of documents in 1953 which were made into a book is a former Luftwaffe Lieutenant General.The book is a rather dry discussion of a number of aspects of using aircraft in support of an army. Most of the book is devoted to talking about reconnaissance planes and is rather dry. The rest of the book looks at the use of aircraft for the direct support of army operations. The author indicates a number of things about the tactics of the Luftwaffe in the war. He indicates that the biggest success of the German Air force in the war was the use of planes to prevent movement of troops to and away from the battlefield. The use of places to attack infantry positions in general was not as successful and he is critical of the use of larger aircraft in this role. The editor of the book in fact makes an interesting point about allied operations in Western Europe after the Normandy invasion. By that time the allies had complete control of the skies and &quot;tank killer&quot; aircraft roamed far and wide. It seems that although during the war claims were made that vast numbers of German tanks were destroyed by aircraft the reality is that very few were. This strengthens the authors view that the main role of aircraft was to prevent the supply of troops and their movement.Towards the end of the book the author bemoans the fact that Germany created an air force that was designed to support its army. In Britain and the United States a strategic air forces of heavy bombers was created with the role of destroying the productive capability of the enemy. The author argues that to destroy a factory will destroy far more tanks than can be done by an equivalent use of force on the battlefield. This view was something which was echoed by other Luftwaffe generals including Galland. The reality is however that the Germans had created a strategic air force they would not have defeated France in 1940"},{"Title":"Spearhead for Blitzkrieg: Luftwaffe Operations in Support of the Army, 1939-1945","review":"There might have been some truth in Deichmann's claim, according to A Customer's remark, of skewing possible outcomes in favor of the Bad Guys in WWII.

Father Adam, the easy going, genial and forgiving priest who had cared for his flock for many years, has died and the charge of filling his shoes falls to the brothers of the Abbey. The Abbot has selected a well educated, former secretary to the Papal legate as a worthy candidate, not realising that an able administrator does not necessarily make a compassionate and understanding priest. Father Ailnoth immediately alienates his parishioners with his harsh, unforgiving rule, severely ruffling the feathers of servants and free men alike, so when his body is found, floating in the river, Sheriff Hugh Beringar finds a wall of silence surrounding the apparent murder. Suspicion falls on Cadfael's new garden helper, Benet who came to the town as a nephew to Father Ailnoth's housekeeper. As usual, Cadfael and Hugh solve the not so difficult mystery and, as usual, the setting for the story is what makes it so appealing. Despite the changes in the surroundings and circumstances of today, the people of nine centuries past, are just the same as the people of today, with their jealousies, faults and squabbles."},{"Title":"The Raven in the Foregate","review":"The prose of Ellis Peters is phenomenal in it's own way.

I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was drawn into the world of medieval England that Peters brings to life. \\"The Raven in the Foregate\\" is a quick read, entertaining and mysterious to the fact that there is not much mystery to the case at hand.As usual, Brother Cadfael is drawn into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the newly instituted priest of Holy Cross, Father Ailnoth. While he was alive, Ailnoth was quick to make enemies in the church and in the community; many are glad to see him dead, and many are content to hold their tongues as to the truth of what caused his death on Christmas Eve. Complicating matters are the search for a French renegade who was undercover at Holy Cross in the guise of the nephew of Father Ailnoth's housekeeper. Brother Cadfael must piece together the scant clues and abounding rumors to uncover the truth of Ailnoth's death.\\"The Raven in the Foregate\\" is a well-written mystery, although at times too tidy and predictable. It was a true delight to enter into the world of Holy Cross and medieval England that Peters has crafted throughout her Cadfael mystery series.

Abbot Radulphus appoints Father Alinoth, an outstanding clerk to the bishop, to the parish. No one is more surprised or dismayed than Radulphus when Father Alinoth quickly earns his people's dislike, and then their outright enmity. For Alinoth is a man of total correctness, complete honesty - and no human compassion whatsoever. He strikes noisy children with his staff, he refuses to suspend his devotions to baptise a dying newborn, and he refuses confession and absolution to a young woman who is - in Father Alinoth's opinion - incapable of true repentance, and therefore undeserving of the Church's mercy. When the young woman drowns herself and thus leaves her new baby without a mother, even those members of the community who disapproved of her find Alinoth's rigidity appalling. So no one feels inclined toward mourning when, on Christmas morning, Father Alinoth is discovered dead. Floating in the half frozen mill pond - was it an accident, or did someone strike him and push him in? Brother Cadfael discovers a head wound that makes the latter theory all too plausible.This book's examination of human frailties and human strengths is first rate. None of the characters, Alinoth included, is left without sympathy (even empathy) in the reader's mind; and the ending, when it comes with a characteristic twist, works beautifully.

Once again it is Brother Cadfael's compassionate understanding of human nature that leads to explanation, resolution and, for some of the characters, new hope. Ellis Peters (Edith Parteger) administers a bit of gentle-never malicious-justice even to the insufferable Brother Jerome, in a delightful coincidence that ends the story."},{"Title":"The Raven in the Foregate","review":"\\"Pleasant\\" is a good way to describe the Cadfael mysteries by Ellis Peters. These romanticised renderings of life in twelfth century England, however unreal, make the era seem pleasant enough that you almost want to live there. The countryside is lovely, there is usually a hint of romance in the air, and life moves at a measured, unrushed pace. No pavement, no pollution, no hustle and bustle. Seldom mentioned are the poverty, hunger, disease, and general stench (people rarely bathed). Life, especially in the cloister, is a bucolic idyll.In \\"A Raven In The Foregate\\", Abbot Radulfus returns from a church council with a new priest for the Foregate. Father Adam having recently died, Radulfus brings back Father Ailnoth at the recommendation of Bishop Henry. Ailnoth, however, turns out to be a harsh and stiff-necked young priest and manages to alienate his flock before turning up dead on Christmas morning. There are plenty of suspects, not the least of whom is young Benet, nephew of Ailnoth's housekeeper.With plenty of potential suspects, this would seem to be an intricate and challenging mystery, but ultimately the plot is not as involved as one might wish. The outcome is a happy one, if a bit too neat and satisfactory for everyone involved, but not too hard to see coming.Like most of the books in this series, \\"A Raven In The Foregate\\" is only an average mystery. What makes this and the other Cadfael tales enjoyable is the pleasant world Peters creates and the idyllic, unhurried way in which she tells the tale. These are nice books to read and, on the strength of that I recommend them, especially to those who like a bit of history and romance along with their whodunits."},{"Title":"The Raven in the Foregate","review":"RAVEN makes play with the dual role of the abbey church as the parish church of Holy Cross, which puts the brothers in the odd position of appointing a new parish priest when an incumbent passes on.

This book explores the lives of the ordinary folk of Holy Cross, and just how much damage an ill-chosen shepherd can inflict on the flock.I recommend the audio edition narrated by Stephen Thorne. The Jacobi TV adaptation isn't the same story.This December of 1141, papal legate Henry of Blois must for the second time in a year call a legatine council - a mirror of that in THE PILGRIM OF HATE, now that King Stephen is free and the empress has been driven from Westminster. Once again Henry has turned his coat according to the fortunes of war - small wonder that Bishop Henry seeks to reinforce his own position with his abbots.Abbot Radulfus returns from the council with a priest from Henry's staff to fill the vacancy of Holy Cross. In his wake, Father Ailnoth brings a housekeeper and her nephew, Benet, who is assigned to Cadfael as a lay helper, Ailnoth having implied that Benet might have a vocation.Neither Benet nor Ailnoth turns out to be what was hoped for.Benet not only has no intention of taking vows, but is inexperienced at the kind of chores Cadfael can use him for. However, he's a hard worker and has many virtues that appeal to Cadfael if not Prior Robert. Benet is, in fact, one of the many strayed young hawks of the empress' party to cross Cadfael's path over the years - a bit of a problem, deep in the heart of King Stephen's territory.Father Ailnoth, on the other hand, seems fine in theory - scholarly, if austere - but serious issues arise in his wake in practice. Ailnoth's hellfire sermons and violent temper with boisterous children distance parishioners from the church. (Under Father Adam's tolerant regime, by contrast, the Foregate children used to play ball outside the priest's house.) Ailnoth measures all things by the bare razor of justice, without mercy or generosity - fine for a bishop's clerk, but not a parish priest, and hard to live with even in an ordinary land-owning neighbour. He doesn't even have a knack for picking his battles, having (for example) outraged the Foregate baker with accusations of giving short weight, rather than knowing enough to mention Jordan's adultery.Jordan leads a delegation of parishioners to Abbot Radulfus. Even one of Ailnoth's good points - that he does his job conscientiously - has a dark side: Ailnoth wouldn't interrupt his devotions even to perform an emergency baptism. By the time Ailnoth arrived, Centwin's baby son was dead - and Ailnoth then refused burial in consecrated ground. Then there's the case of Eluned, a beautiful girl who couldn't say no to men. Where old Father Adam was merciful, Ailnoth said Eiluned was *not* genuinely penitent. After Ailnoth publicly turned her out of the church, Eluned was found in the mill-pond; fortunately the next parish treated it as an accident. (Eiluned's grieving mother later says that Eiluned had also defied Ailnoth, refusing to betray the father of her newborn daughter.)As Radulfus says privately, getting nowhere with Ailnoth, \\"A man with every virtue, except humility and human kindness. That is what I have brought upon the Foregate...and now what are we to do about him?\\" The first sign of an answer is Ailnoth's non-appearance at mass on Christmas morning. Cadfael last saw Ailnoth storming along a frost-slick street, and sure enough, searchers find Ailnoth's body trapped under the ice in the mill-pond. Cynric, the old and silent verger, must bury another parish priest.Benet soon finds himself hunted by Hugh's sergeant's for murder. Having tried to contact Ralph Giffard, one of the empress' former supporters in the district, Benet had found someone who'd lost too much at the battle of Shrewsbury to remain on the empress' side. Giffard had told Ailnoth of Benet's approach, and Father Ailnoth would hardly take kindly to being embarrassed by a connection with the empress after Bishop Henry's experiences, any more than Giffard did. But Benet, although an easy answer, isn't the only answer.(Hugh Beringar, who could have found 'Benet' if he wanted to, is fortunately keeping Christmas with King Stephen, since Stephen needs to decide whether to confirm Hugh as sheriff - he's only been acting sheriff since DEAD MAN'S RANSOM. Once Hugh returns, the investigation takes another turn, as the fate of the empress' liegemen in Shropshire has become a concern of the king's for his own reasons.)Cadfael's epitaph for Ailnoth is that 'no blinking it, the man generated grudges wherever he stepped. He may well have made the most perfect of clerks, where he had to deal only with documents, charters and accounts, but he had no notion how to coax and counsel and comfort common human sinners. And what else is a parish priest for?' Radulfus, taking responsibility for installing Ailnoth, pronounces the eulogy - well worth reading. Cadfael's quest for truth here is not for the sake of justice to the dead, but for the living - including Radulfus, who feels a double guilt over inflicting Ailnoth on the Foregate and on having brought him to his death, putting him in a job to which he was never suited."},{"Title":"Education before Verdun,","review":"It is a famous novel written by one of the greatest german novelists. A gripping story about the insanity and futility of war."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"While I know people who have really loved this book, it just wasn't a satisfying read for me. It felt like someone had all these funny stories about what had happened to them, and decided to turn them into a book, embellishing here and there. To me, the plot seemed like an afterthought, a way to string the anecdotes together, rather than the foundation. There definitely were some really funny parts, so it wasn't a worthless read, but I do regret paying full price for the book."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"This book is way too unrealistic. Very dry at places and the humor was just nonexistent. I'm giving this 2 stars because i normally like this author."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"This was one of those books I kept reading just waiting for it to \\"get good\\". Well, I just finished the last page and it never did. Too bad, it had potential... I really wanted to like it!I was on the ice a few years before the author and got a very occasional chuckle from events that I recall happening but overall this book was more fluff than actual story.Less dialogue and more story would have made the book move along faster. There was so much conversation that significant parts of the story were left hanging. What happened with Clarry's new found love interest?I can not recall the last time it took me 3 weeks to get through a 260-page book."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"I was really looking forward to this story - what a great premise - to relocate to Antarctica after being dumped to get a new lease on life.Clarissa has been with Kieran for eight years. On the night she assumes he is going to propose, he instead dumps her. Out of her home, with no job, she moves back with her folks until she and her 2 friends come up with the idea to move to Antarctica to start over.There were a couple parts of the book that were hilarious - particularly the necessities that they packed, and all the mistakes Clarissa made. But there were far too many extended conversations among the three, and I just could not get into the dialogue - as it droned on and on. There were so many other areas that could have been further expanded on, particularly the post-Kieran relationship with Mitchell, and perhaps some background on why she stayed with him so long in the first place.I was really disappointed in the story. In the right hands, it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"Clarissa has lived with Kieran for eight years and thinks he is about to propose. Her best friends Delilah and Kate agree and even throw an engagement party, but Kier fails to give her a ring. Instead he breaks up with her after she quits her job to become a housewife to him. She returns to her mom's place with her tail dragging.While Clarissa mopes, her friends try to cheer her up without success. Her mom wanting her daughter back on her feet and happy gives a brochure on Antarctica to Kate. Before Clarissa knows what is happening she is on her way to Antarctica for employment accompanied by her two buddies. There the male to female ratio is 4:1 with most of the men being single.Though the heroine is in her late twenties-early thirties this is a coming of age chick lit tale. Readers will have to adjust to decisions that flaky Clarissa makes but will find the time worth doing. Antarctica serves as a terrific backdrop even if plunging into the icy water seems cold for even a polar bear. Chick lit fans will appreciate this fine tale of a woman trying to find herself in the frozen Antarctic tundra.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"I just cannot agree with the previous reviewers about the quality of this books. Liz Maverick boggles down her characters in so much boring detail that I get to a point where I just don't care about what happens to any of them.Sure, this is chick lit, but there is so little action going on and so much blah, blah its not worth the price of the book.

So, her and her friends head off to an adventure in Antarctica, where there are no designer shops and nothing is exactly what it seems.Adventures of an Ice Princess is a funny, sassy and thoroughly enjoyable tale that will have you turning the pages and staying up late. Clarissa is a worthy heroine, with intelligence and wit.

This one did not have any guts to it. There was no real plot: somewhat competent woman is jilted and joins her two laid-off friends to an adventure to the Antarctic where she loses all her backbone. She doesn't really grow as a person; her friends do. Her exploits and mistakes would have gotten her thrown off the continent."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"Ever been dumped by your boyfriend and decide to brave Antarctica with your two best friends? I know I haven't, so I was intrigued by the story premise enough to pick up a copy of this book.Clarissa Schneckberg, our main heroine, had just given her notice to her company that she was going to quit and become a homemaker. After all, she was positive that her boyfriend Kieran was about to propose. Instead, Kieran ends up giving her the old heave-ho, insisting that he wanted to see other people. Clarissa is devastated, and decides to head for Antarctica with her two best friends Kate and Delilah.Antarctica turns out to be not quite as easy as Clarissa had hoped. It is downright freezing, she seems to be making ridiculous mistakes, and she just wants to go home. Will things get any better for her? Will the handsome Mitch step in and welcome her with open arms? Will the three girls ever make it in such rough terrain? Find out by reading the book!I'm usually intrigued with a far-fetched story line in a chick lit novel if it's done right, but unfortunately this novel didn't really leave much of a good impression. Too much detail was given to the characters, but not near enough to the story or setting. I found myself a bit bored and annoyed through most of the novel. I had been hoping for an interesting portrayal of Antarctica at the very least, but I didn't even get that. (Granted, there were some descriptions, but they weren't near enough). The characters were endearing though - I did like Clarissa and her friends.Overall, I'd have to sum up this novel as being generally boring with lackluster storytelling. It certainly has a cute and eye-catching enough cover, but unfortunately what is inside doesn't measure up."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"Clarissa's adventures are fun and funny--I laughed out loud several times. My favorite Clarissa moment was when, as a determined team leader for Snow Survival Camp, she valiantly led her blindfolded team to the designated flag. Unfortunately it was the pee flag (no outhouses in a frozen wasteland, folks), which she only discovered after tromping around in yellow snow.I read this book in one sitting. Clarissa and her two best friends, Delilah and Kate, are very likeable. It was worth the price of the book just to see three very girlie girls succeed in a harsh environment. I enjoyed Adventures of an Ice Princess very much and highly recommend it to readers who enjoy women's fiction."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"Adventures Of An Ice Princess should bear the subtitle \\"A Fairy Tale.\\" I've certainly never known people like Clarissa, Kate and Delilah in real life, and many of the situations they get into seem farfetched. And the description of these three friends bringing frivolous clothing and copies of Cosmo while on a tight weight allowance for baggage doesn't ring true, either.While this story is on the silly side, it IS amusing reading. I give Liz Maverick credit for not going the traditional \\"chick lit\\" route at the end, which would be to have all three girls walking off into a glorious Antarctican sunset with their Mr. Rights. The setting is also a plus to those of us who would love to visit Antarctica for real, even if we have to leave our designer boots and sunglasses at home."},{"Title":"Adventures of an Ice Princess","review":"It was very hard to get into this book because the premise of three young women leaving Northern California does not seem plausible as they go on their adventures.

Rider Haggard that I've read, and I've read a good number of them. This is the tale of how Allan Quatermain, hero of 14 of Haggard's books, including &quot;King Solomon's Mines,&quot; met his first wife. It is set against the time of the Great Trek in the 1830s, and is jammed with action, adventure and romance. There are two terrific villains, Dingaan (brother of Chaka) and a Portuguese who's trying to not only kill our hero, but rob him of his wife in the bargain. The book starts out with a thrilling battle scene, and ends with a scene of tremendous emotional intensity. In between there is so much colorful action and movement that you find yourself zipping through the chapters as quickly as you can. The book is a true &quot;page turner,&quot; with great sweep and drive. The supporting characters are either colorful, comedic or memorable. Hans--Quatermain's Hottentot sidekick from many of the other books--is featured here, too, and his is always a welcome presence. What a shame that this book has been out of print for so many years, along with the great preponderance of the other works of this wonderful writer. Haggard has been called the greatest adventure fantasist of all time, and I would tend to agree with that assessment. So do yourself a favor and go to the trouble of seeking this book out. It will reward your efforts!"},{"Title":"Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain","review":"Marie is the first of three historical novels dealing with the fall of the Zulu Empire. Allan Quartermain is just beginning his life and falls in love with Marie, the daughter of a Boer, descendants of the original Dutch settlers in South Africa, who hate the English. Allan on several occasions saves the life of Marie, her father and other Boer's and Marie's father never quite sees him as a friend. Allan interacts with real historical individuals, Dingane, current king of the Zulus and Piet Retief, leader of the Voortrekkers.We see a young Allan Quartermain turn into a man. He gains his Zulu name, Macumazahn, Watcher by Night. We learn why so many people respect him and his judgments. He witnesses an event that changes the course of South African history. We also briefly meet Zikali, the witchdoctor who later influences Allan's life in later in life.H. Rider Haggard wrote about 10 stories about Allan Quartermain, but not in chronological order. Sometimes his spelling of African names and terms changes between books.I enjoyed this novel and even thou this Character is over 100 years old he inspired so many modern day adventure heroes, including Indiana Jones."},{"Title":"Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain","review":"Very similar to the other Quartermain books, but perhaps a bit more sentimental than most.

If you like adventure you are in for stories that cannot be compared."},{"Title":"Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain","review":"Though I read incessantly, this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review of a product for Amazon. But I have so enjoyed reading H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain series that I thought I would share my thoughts about it, in hopes that a new generation of readers (in particular those who are likely to discover him through the Kindle at the astronomically wonderful price of \\"free\\") might be compelled to give these wonderful tales a try and perhaps become lifelong fans.The first Allan Quatermain book written, and the most famous of the tales,King Solomon's Minesis also the first one I read. It was absolutely wonderful, exciting and fun and humorous in all the right proportions, and when I was done I decided to find out a little more about Haggard and the Allan Quatermain series. As such I soon found out that while \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" was the first Quatermain story to be written, in 1885, it was chronologically one of the last in what would become the Allan Quatermain series, and decided to read the rest of them in the chronological order of the character, rather than the order in which they were written. This book, \\"Marie\\", is chronologically the first book in the series, though it was actually written in 1912.In \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" Quatermain is already an older man, having lived a hard life in Africa as a professional big game hunter, the book taking place right around 1880. \\"Marie\\", on the other hand, takes place over the years of 1835-1838, and tells the tale of Allan's first love, Marie Marais, the \\"Marie\\" of the book's title. While I have no interest in ruining the tale for anyone who hasn't yet read it, Allan tells us right in the beginning of his narrative that this was to be a tragic and star-crossed love, so epic and poignant and formative to the young Allan that it would shape the remainder of his life to come. The rest of the book certainly lives up to that promise.Despite ostensibly being a tragic love story, this is also an Allan Quatermain story and written by H. Rider Haggard, so it should come as no surprise to anyone that it has more than its share of action and drama (and melodrama, though not so much as other writers of the time indulged in, or, indeed, as much as Haggard indulged in himself in other books, such asHEART OF THE WORLD: MACDONALD ILLUSTRATED EDITION (Macdonald Illustrated Edition)). There is a desperate and nearly tragic stand against enraged native warriors. There are shooting contests against mad despots with dozens of lives on the line. There is a mad dash across South Africa in hopes of saving the woman he loves from death by starvation and illness due to the pride and mad arrogance of her father and the cruel and haughty man that he chose for her. So yes, while it is a love story, it is one where Allan Quatermain is constantly testing himself against man, nature and fate in order to make himself worthy of the woman he loves and win a place for them in the world. I doubt even the most jaded of adventure hounds could fault this \\"mere\\" love story, or be bored by it. This tale comes to a conclusion that is so poignant and tragic that is almost Shakespearean.Haggard's trademark humor also makes the trek into Allan's past more or less intact. Since this is a tragic love story you can't expect it to be the laugh-riot that the much more light-hearted \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" was, but it does have more than its share of humor, mostly in the form of Allan's delightfully amoral Hottentot companion Hans. Hans is nearly brimming with advice that is logically sound and morally questionable, not to mention wanting nothing so badly as to find and consume mass quantities of alcohol as often as possible. But there is a sort of Zen-like wisdom in the simplicity of Hans' worldview, such as the time that Hans' suggests that Allan and Marie's lives might be simplified immeasurably if Hans' gun should \\"accidentally\\" go off and kill Hernando Periera, Allan's rival for Marie's affections. Allan dismisses Hans too often as a savage, but one is left wondering if Hans' simplified native worldview isn't preferable to Allan's ultimately damning adherence to his British pride and honor.Does the tale have its flaws? Of course, and much more so than were apparent in \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" or others of the earlier-written-but-chronologically-later Quatermain stories. For one thing, everyone except for Marie's father, Henri Marais, and Allan's rival for Marie's affection, Hernando Periera sing his praises so often and so valuably that you occasionally want to yell \\"we get it! He's a hero!\\" at your book, and Periera is portrayed as a creature so cowardly and dastardly that he does everything except twirl his mustache and tie Marie to the train tracks. In \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" and other books, before Quatermain had become Haggard's consummate hero and gravy train he was portrayed much more realistically and less saintly; he is occasionally cowardly, quite vocal about being cowardly, not to mention tired, cautious and somewhat ugly, with a scraggly beard and hair that sticks up every which way. His two redeeming features are his old man's wisdom and his extraordinary shooting ability. The young Allan of \\"Marie\\", however, is clever, brave, honorable to the point of fault, heroic and almost messianic. Either the old Allan writing the tale of the young Allan's exploits or H. Rider Haggard himself in writing the book have started to believe a bit too much of the hype surrounding our intrepid hero, and have lost some of the perspective that showed us Allan's flaws, making him more quirky, realistic and likable. The only other complaint I can think of is that people expecting another \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" might be disappointed that this is a different kind of tale; there are no lost treasures, princes in disguise or deadly Indiana Jones-style traps. But that only makes sense, as Allan couldn't be expected to have experienced similar remarkable adventures in his youth. If he had it would have cheapened the events that happened to him later in his life. But the adventures that he DOES have in this book are interesting and deadly enough in their own right to keep just about anyone happy.Since this book was written in 1912, long before the struggle for Civil Rights or Political Correctness came into their own, I won't beat a black horse to death. But I must at least mention that Haggard's portrayal of the native people of Africa was, for the most part, honorable, respectful and refreshing. While he does occasionally refer to them as \\"savages\\" or the like, and he does use the term \\"Kaffir\\" often, which is now considered a racist pejorative, by and large Haggard treats the Africans with as much dignity and respect as he does any other people. Which is to say some are honorable, some are dastardly, and some are just people, but Haggard refuses to categorize them as a people or use them as a foil against valiant white heroes. Some are good and some are bad and some are heroic and some are horrid, just as it is amongst the British, the Dutch, or anyone else. He writes and describes the natives as individuals and humans above all else, which is no mean feat considering the time he was writing in. Despite the prevalent racial nastiness of the time, Haggard manages to treat the black African characters with as much honor and respect as he does anyone else, even while his characters are repelling attacks from angry mobs of native \\"Quabies\\" and \\"Zulus\\".All in all \\"Marie\\" is an excellent addition to the Allan Quatermain series, a beautiful story of love of survival, and a pulse-punding story of action and adventure, even in a sea of tragedy and melodrama. Above all this book is entertaining, poignant and riveting, well worth the time of any fans of romance, adventure or even pure action. Haggard is one of the largely forgotten gems of English adventure literature."},{"Title":"Trucks (Usborne Touchy Feely)","review":"I can't say enough about the touchy feely book!

So far, there's only one small tear, on one page. He likes to look at the pictures while I'm spooning him yogurt. I like having books around that he will actually use, and this is one of them. We have other books that may only have one picture of one truck on one page - and he gets stuck there and only wants to look at the truck.

Folks familiar with that show will recognize the storytelling style: three- or four-sentence paragraph/chapters, each presenting a new idea, are bounced off each other in very rapid succession. The effect is sometimes ironic, sometimes not. Unfortunately, this device may be better suited to radio than it is to the page, and while there are some powerful moments the book comes off as more of a gimmicky exercise than anything else. The relentless cleverness (although the writing isn't terribly funny) make the book seem pretty far removed from actual human experience. It's also bogged down by an undergraduate sensibility about sex, and by a lot of odd metaphors that don't go anywhere. I can imagine this style being successfully applied to the novel form, but I don't think Goldstein's done it here."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"Anybody who's ever heard this author on This American Life would have high hopes for any novel he writes, but unfortunately Lenny Bruce is Dead just doesn't live up to his potential.However, I recently read his second book, \\"Schmelvis\\", and it's extraordinary. It's not a novel but rather a sort of road trip memoir. It's about a documentary Goldstein worked on about Elvis Presley's Jewish roots (yes, believe it or not, the King was a Hebe) and it is brilliant. He and a film crew, a chassidic jewish Elvis impersonator named Schmelvis and a wacky Rabbi went to Memphis and Israel looking for evidence. Hilarious, touching, fascinating, all at the same time. I'd recommend that Jonathan's fans run, don't walk, and pick up \\"Schmelvis\\". Much more in the spirit of This American life than Lenny Bruce is dead, although his novel does have its moments so you might want to read that as well."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"This novel was sent across the continent to me by my best friend, and it's a perfect example of why we get along so well.Like Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son, Barry Hannah's Geronimo Rex and very few others, the protagonist here is a solitary, emotional boy who can't express his emotions outwardly.His voice is one that moves from narrative to something like poetry without interrupting the feel and flow of the story. Every girl he falls for is guaranteed to be a disaster, but he let's it happen anyway, and you'll fall for them too.I'm not jewish and not from the north, but i felt every word of his mangled thoughts like they were my very own.A STUNNING first novel for Goldstein. I can't WAIT for another!!"},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"I'm a huge fan of everything I've heard of Goldstein's on This American Life and WireTap and the concepts of his other books, which I have not yet read, and had high hopes for LBID. However, I simply didn't get it.I didn't laugh once and I didn't really enjoy reading this book. I feel like I'm missing some piece of context that a lot of people have; maybe it just isn't for me.I am getting ready to read his other books, which I still expect to love."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"This book was not funny or interesting. It is sort of like those columns Larry King used to write..... I want a pastrami sandwich,.....isn't the Godfather a great movie,..........I remember when the Yankees won all the time.... This author must have a lot of friends in the writing business, because this waste of time shouldn't get good reviews. Thank you very very mush."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"If I could give it fewer stars I would. Masturbatory, adolescent stream of consciousness, with absolutely nothing to say. Its only redeeming feature is that it is short."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"I picked it up this book because my friends were raving about it and I had heard Goldstein's hilarious radio pieces on This American Life. The narrative voice makes this novel so original and distinct. Goldstein's imagery made me stop reading at times and just think about the power of language. He is a very talented man. He notices everything so tenderly, from a dirty napkin on a table to a girl's funny face. This is an introspective novel about the reflections a man has when his mother dies. It is fragmented, but it almost has to be. It's so beautiful, I could only take it one paragraph at a time. For those who love literature only!"},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"This was my first foray into the mind of Jonathan Goldstein. The book had its moments. In fact, I they were hilarious moments. I was lmao on the subway, but at other times it was frustrating. I would recommend, but know that this may not be your cup of tea. There are some really slow sections of the book. Also, the book has nothing to do with Lenny Bruce."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"Poignant, hilarious, and original. Jonathan Goldstein, where have you been all my life! Not only did I find myself laughing my head off over the sexual antics of the main character, Josh, but his touching interactions with his widowed father brought a few tears to my eyes as well. Truly unlike anything I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lenny Bruce is Dead","review":"Amazingly clever book. I read it twice and intend to read it again. It says more in what it doesn't say than in what it does. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"The name of this book is misleading. The title leaves the impression that this book will present deep insights into the mind of God on the topic of God and human suffering, when in fact, that is not the subject at all.The title of this book should be \\"How to Walk with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel\\". Mark Atteberry makes it VERY plain and clear at the beginning that this is a HOW TO book, only, and not a book that seeks to answer the WHY questions.The exodus of the Israelites out of the land of ancient Egypt is both the backdrop and the main source of Atteberry's material, which he uses to demonstrate the lessons he wishes to teach. Each chapter contains a mix of biblical scriptures along with his experiences as a pastor/counselor. His biblical discussions were much more helpful to me than his personal experience stories.One of the important things this book drove home in my mind, is that a lifetime walk with God is a guaranteed certainty that the journey will be on a route no one would ever deliberately choose. Be careful what you ask for.....you just may get it!On the other hand, it is an irritating turn-off that Atteberry uses the \\"Devil's gonna get you\\" mentality throughout his book. Living in fear of Satan is not a basis for righteous living. It is more important to live a life motivated by the love of God."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"After reading this book, I knew I must pass it on to others in the Body of Christ who have been deeply wounded and to recommend it to others. From wounds inflicted by unwanted divorce; a child in prison; disappointment in how life has brought sorrow; wherever the path of life took them and they never meant to go -- without exception, each person I passed this book on to has these words \\"Praise God for Mark Atteberry and this book!\\" Some have even stated that if this book had been in their hands earlier, they would have been saved some of the anguish they went through."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I just finished reading this book and loved it. It helps put things into perspective. I would recommend it to anyone who is going through trials in their life.

It is Bible based, uplifting and a rewarding read. I will read it again and again!"},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I have used this book to assist my church ministry in divorce care and in my own walk down the road. It is sound from a biblical perspective and filled with common sense solutions. If you find yourself lost, wandering in the wilderness, grab thus survival guide.It works."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I was so impressed with this book that I went online and bought nine copies to give to friends and family. It is appropriate for anyone dealing with loss. Loss of a spouse, a child or dealing with divorce. I read it in one day. I started on a Saturday morning and could not put it down til late that evening. This is a great book to help deal with pain in life."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I read this book recently. I found it was the same old story written by most religious authors. I did not walk away from this book feeling overwhelmed or in awe.I enjoyed the real-life stories he tells within the book, as I thought they made a bigger impression into why things happen the way they tend to do in life.However, towards the end in the discussion section, I was a little drawn away that he offers no suggestions no how to go about locating or seeking the items/defining moments in your life, so as to answer the questions and progress onwards in your faith journey.I felt that this book might be geared more towards those that have already heard God's call versus those that are seeking Him out. Lost sheep would do better reading another book."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"This book is a practical guide to living through suffering. The first chapter deals with looking at your situation to be clear on \\"who's fault is it?\\" Did you make choices that landed you here; was it someone else's fault; or was it nobody's fault -- just life as it happened. He doesn't bog you down in that -- he just wants you to look at how you got to this point so that you can use those lessons and move forward, even if it's still on that road you didn't want to travel. I find that there is a lot in common here with the Zen teachings that it's not the suffering that causes our problems, it's trying to avoid those sufferings.I, too, am going through a separation now and while I was the one who packed up and left, this road certainly isn't the one I saw myself taking when I took wedding vows over 15 years ago. I can face that and move forward and this book has practical steps of how to get there.The balance of personal stories with the Biblical background of the children of Israel seems just right. I can find myself in the stories and then see how my struggles are thousands of years old and common to humans.GREAT BOOK -- would recommend it to anyone who finds themselves in a place they didn't want to be, can't get out of or want to walk through in a way that glorifies God."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I read Walking with God on the road you never wanted to travel some months back and have kept it out because I refer to sections that I've highlighted when I need help with my impending divorce.I found Mark's words and passages a source of healing and comfort. I hope that I can look back on my experience and email Mark with a success story someday. If you are currently dealing with a huge \\"why did this happen to me\\" situation this book is the one to read and re-read because of the many examples, biblical passages, and words of encouragement are well worth the book's price."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"God is an amazing God! A God of deep relational love even when we feel abandoned because of the path we find ourselves on. No, it's never the path I would have chosen or wished on my worst enemy but I can say it has stretched me and given me insight to how much my Abba Father loves me. Without clinging to His promises and His scriptures I would not have made it. This book helps you understand HOW God will see you through anything you are experiencing. It is NOT a why God is allowing it.......I am so thankful for the author breaking that down right from the beginning. When you feel abandoned due to horrific events and your friends and pastor do not know how to help you......first look to God's word. His scriptures bring healing and peace like nothing else can. And read this book as a road map for finding your way out of despair, grasp the concept of forgiveness (that was the toughest issue for me) and learn to move forward. This book will walk you through the steps, give you encouragement, and the \\"tools\\" you need to put one foot in front of the other in the most difficult situations. My life was turned upside down after a series of tragic life changing events that left most of my christian friends not even knowing what to say....... and most slipped away. If you find your world turned upside down you need to read this book for guidance.....christian guidance that will give you solid grounding when you feel as though you are tumbling down a jagged cliff full speed and the bottom is coming at you fast. I have read several books since my life changing events occurred a little over a year ago and this author has been the most helpful by far."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"Mark Atteberry is the best author I have read dealing with handling the unexpected hardships of life.

My husband was hospitalized with a life threatning problem that was diagnosed; but the doctor's couldn't identify what had brought it about, even after hundreds of blood test and more invasive testing. During our month stay in the hospital, my daughter 'n law, brought me a copy of this book and hoped it would assist me during my husband's crisis. I was so encouraged and lifted up by it's insights into God's message to me that addressed the frustrations, fears, defeat, and numerous questions that were bogging me down daily. My husband did improve after an operation, and continues to deal with the changes that this circumstance brought on. After we came home from the hospital, I bought another copy of the book to return to my daughter 'n law, as the copy I had read was underlined on numerous pages and notations marked in the borders. I am reading the book again, so I can share it's message with others going through terrifying times.

I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I loved this book but we must also consider that the promises of walking with God have specific unpopular truths. Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 2 Timothy 3:12For a review of this book we must also look to the category of \\"unpopular\\" promises. This promise guarantees persecution for serious believers in Jesus Christ. In a church world where many treasure comfort and popularity, this promise is not well-received.This promise is given to those who want to live a life of godliness: \\"who desire to live godly.\\" Godliness is the will of the Lord for His people. \\"But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness\\" (1 Timothy 6:11). Our Lord Himself declared that there is great blessing in having a passion for righteous living. \\"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness\\" (Matthew 5:6a). The blessing is God's pledge to satisfy that heart which yearns for righteousness. \\"For they shall be filled\\" (Matthew 5:6b).Yet, we have seen that fullness of righteousness is not all that is promised to those who want to walk in godliness. Persecution is also promised. \\"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.\\" Notice the comprehensive, inescapable dimension of this promise. \\"All who desire to live godly...will suffer persecution.\\" There are no exceptions. There are no exemptions.All who sincerely desire to follow the Lord Jesus Christ will experience the consequences that He met, as He walked in righteousness. \\"Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you\\" (John 15:20). Jesus was not universally hailed for His righteous path. He was opposed, mocked, conspired against, and betrayed. We need not be startled when measures of similar persecutions befall us.Of course, this promise of persecution is not given to discourage us from pressing on down the path of godliness. Rather, it is offered to prepare us for the difficulties that are guaranteed as we seek to grow in Christlikeness. The Lord even adds gracious encouragements to righteousness, so we will be strengthened to pursue His holy will in this matter. \\"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\\" (Matthew 5:10). Persecutions can remind us that we are headed for heaven. Persecutions can bring us heavenly measures of sustaining grace along the way."},{"Title":"Walking with God on the Road You Never Wanted to Travel","review":"I'm about halfway through this book and I'm enjoying Mark's perspective on life and how to handle potential hurdles."},{"Title":"Strange City: The Future of Neo-Tech","review":"I got about two-thirds of the way through this book before deciding that I couldn't finish it. I was hoping to read a reasonably coherent depiction of the Neo-Tech philosophy, but what I got is a weird, weird, weird! mix of: Ayn Rand; Transhumanism; Right-Wing historical conspiracy theories; ignorantly portrayed ethnic and racial stereotypes; and despite the explicit Atheism, some quasi-religious ideas similar to those of Mormonism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Technological Singularity theory, Christian Rapture/&quot;Left Behind&quot; theology, and even Frank Tipler's Omega Point theory.Now, there is no reason a priori why these elements could not have been incorporated into a mind-bending story, provided that the writer was reasonably competent and had a sense of irony. (Philip K. Dick comes to mind.) But this author (1) is an uncritical Neo-Tech true believer, despite the fact that Neo-Techies aren't succeeding in life better than the rest of us, and (2) clearly isn't literate enough to have any business writing novels, as evident by the pervasive misspellings, lack of punctation, broken sentences, etc. I also have to wonder how much of the novel's weirdness is due to the source material, namely, Frank Wallace's Neo-Tech, and how much is due to the author's particular obsessions. It's not weird enough in the right way even to be unintentionally funny. Definitely not worth buying."},{"Title":"American Academy of Pediatrics: Immunizations & Infectious Diseases: An Informed Parent's Guide","review":"I am so glad I have this book! I use it all the time as a reference book to help me understand the various immunizations & diseases out there--esp since we get a lot of shots due to the fact that we travel the world for my husband's work. Sure, you could look things up online, but there have been so many times when our internet didn't work (or we didn't have it due to the remoteness of our location) and I needed answers now.

The ultimate goal of Yoga in my humble opinion is to experience the core of your personality (Self =God). To accomplish this you must pass through the material layers, which involves transcending the mind through relinquishing the attachments to the outcome of desires.

The book does not offer a \\"path\\" for the reader to follow, nor does it prescribe a method of yoga. The author, an Indian born into an Indian Christian family, and a neuroscientist, fuses his knowledge of these two traditions to relate to the reader an idea of how the brain process, the various stimuli that we as seekers of truth give it through our senses.

I am fascinated both with science (especially neuroscience) and with spirituality (especially Eastern). This book promised to bring togetehr these two subjects in a novel concordance.Sadly, it doesn't. What we get is a mismash of facts, theory, anecdote, and tradition that has neither the logic of good science nor the passion of moving spirituality.

This is the tendency of many books on science and religion and consciousness.The transformative power of spiritual experiences is well known-drug addicts have recovered after them, and hardened criminals have reformed. But is there a scientific explanation for this phenomenon, which Indians call &quot;yoga&quot;? Although Eastern traditions have long pondered this mystery, Western science has tended to dismiss spiritual experiences as whimsy on the part of believers.In The True Path, Mathew draws on his own extensive knowledge of neuroscience to prove the age-old Indian idea that spirituality is a state of mind, a higher form of consciousness. He shows how the latest brain research supports the idea that quieting the neurons that control everyday activities allows for a more spiritual contemplation of life. As this part of the brain slows down, other parts become more freely expressed, promoting relaxation and pleasure in one's surroundings. With scientific evidence that this &quot;pure consciousness&quot; truly exists, Mathew shows how to use meditation, yoga, and other traditional Indian methods of contemplation to achieve this spiritual state of mind. The work makes some important connections about the nature of yoga and emerging neuroscience. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Caas y barro","review":"This story is terribly tragic and dark and beautiful.

I can assure you, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"There have been a lot of books on just how bad life can be to a big city cop, certainly enough to let me know that this wouldn't be the life for me. If you come from even the normal dysfunctional modern family, to get assigned as the author did to one of the hell hole areas in New York City has to be one scary damn way to get started on a career.Of all the books I've read on big city cops, this is the one most blatent, grim (how can people life this way), hard to vizualize and downright scary. It is also the one that confess, if you will, the lengths that the cops will go to in order to get someone off the street.This book says that the police, or at least this individual think little of being the judge and jury combined together to put people away. This gives me two real thoughts: one is that I hope they don't decide to come after me, and second, if the same rules are being applied to death sentences, our whole country is in trouble.Mr. Cea believes that the laws give criminals more rights than the police and you have to take that advantage back. If this is the way the whole criminal justice system is working.... This is an imposing book, well worth reading, but scary."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"Granted, Cea's book isn't terribly lengthy, but I was able to finish it in just a few days because it was so fascinating and well written.

I was rocked into the reality of hell that the author lived through and the people he had to deal with every day had to live through as well. The author made me feel as if I were there voyeristically watching something I definitely should not be witnessing. I read it in two nights, something I would not advise another reader to do, as in any horrific true crime book, it gave me chills and nightmares. The dialogue and prose was so conversational it didn't feel like I was reading, but listening and watching a very noir like film. I absolutely was blown away by this book. There is so much more to tell, and so much I learned about one mans opinion of an over worked and broken justice system, one he tried to fix himself but almost died in the process. Read this book, but not at night - trust me! It was a fascinating and scary slap into a dark dark world. I loved the book and can't wait for the sequel. What happened to the author after the fact?

Unfortunately there is only this one. Attn: Mr. Cea, can you hurry up and write another one? Thanks!The author's writing style makes you feel like you are right there, with him in the car, in the run down bars and in the back alleys of New York City.I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who can handle the language and violence. Beyond that what emerges is a book of complete and open honesty. You can see where every step seems to be a logical next step in policing. Let a heroin junkie go to get info on a perp with a gun. Thats a good move. A gun gets people killed, a junkie just kills himself. But a small step like that leads to him being completely intertwined with the mean streets and he ends up paying for it.No more details than that. Its just too good :)Buy it! You will not be able to put it down.On a slightly different note, it shows how cops are the real backbone of our system, and they get dumped on from everyone. Defense attorneys, the media, even citizens groups - all for their own political gain. That really sucks, because a lot of good people probably get crushed by the system, who were just there doing a good job.

I rate a book on two things that are very important to me. 1.) Does the book suck me into the characters and hold my attention? Do I want to keep reading or can the next chapter wait until tomorrow? 2.) Does the book take me through the story at a good pace and can I follow the book through no matter what kind of time line the author uses. I hate books that jump around to much and it takes until I am 75% through until the story finally makes sense.Having said that, I couldn't put this book down. It was a true story of a cop that had to bend the rules to make justice work. I personally think he was way more corrupt than he believed he was but hey, if the author wants to see himself as a good guy, who I am to judge. This cop as are many, was addicted to the excitement of the streets. The uncertainty of the street fueled him every day. It ran through his blood and gave him life.

I don't like the idea of cops being corrupt and breaking the law trying get justice. Looking at this concept, it doesn't make sense. But when the NYPD are out there on the raw, filthy, dangerous, crim-ridden back roads of this city, those laws don't apply very well.I will always be on the side of truth and justice and try to apply it in my life whenever possible. However, I have also lived in this city all my life, born and raised on the streets of the Bronx during the 1970's , the worst place and the worst time in the city's history. You learn that justice is very gray, not black and white. Cops know this reality everyday. NYPD cops do the best they can with the situation and circumstances they find themselves in. I applaud cops like Robert Cea who have the guts and the courage to seek out this type of \\"New York\\" justice to try and make the streets a little safer for those of us who live here."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"As a sworn police officer I always have to wonder, at what point will America get enough of this garbage? Robert Cea, if his account is to be believed, is a criminal. The fact that he did what he did while wearing a police uniform is irrelevant as far as that's concerned. Men like him are a disgrace to all the officers who actually do their job the right way. I'm sick and tired of hearing the excuses. \\"My pay is low\\", \\"The Job doesn't care\\", \\"Crime was here before I came on, and it'll be here after I leave\\" etc. This man is, by his own admission, guilty of perjury, assault, conspiracy and a host of other crimes. He writes about routinely violating the rights of individual citizens, but that's A-Okay because they're bad people and because he includes the obligatory handfull of lines about his struggles with what kind of man he's turning into. You know what? That doesn't cut it. This book isn't about redemption. It's about Robert Cea making money by entertaining people with an account of his criminal behavior and sexual antics. While performing law enforcement duties I have been cursed, attacked with weapons and all the rest. I've never used it as an excuse to line my pockets or lie under oath. As the old saying goes \\"Adversity does not build character, it reveals it.\\" Robert Cea went to Brooklyn and was faced with a daunting task. In the end his character was revealed and it was non-existant. Don't line the pockets of a corrupt cop. You can find it funny or amusing while you're reading this book in your living room but if you ever got pulled over by a police officer you wouldn't be laughing if it was a man like Robert Cea."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"Coming from a family of police officers I thought this would shed some light on what isn't said at the dinner table. As a rookie cop, Robert Cea believed in by-the-book policing...until he was assigned to a bombed-out precinct in East Flatbush, New York. Soon enough he's bribing snitches, brutalizing bad guys, and raising eyebrows at IAB. Yes, this story has been done before, but the book reads like a greatest hits compilation of hard-boiled cop moments. Cea retired as the fifth most decorated officer in NYPD history and just sold the movie rights so read this book before they mess it up on the big screen."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"I cannot believe that someone as foul mouthed as this author was ever picked up to serve as a policeman. No wonder he turned bad. NYPD must have been desperate. The vocabulary is shockingly filthy and I could not finish the book. buyer beware."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"This was a decent read, but I just couldn't really get in to it all that much. It was enjoyable but probably will not be reading it again."},{"Title":"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","review":"A must read for anyone thinking of a career in law enforcement. A great story that describes the challenges, triumph & tragedy officers endure."},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"Maisel is one of my favorite authors writing for artists. As in his other books, he shows here great sensitivity to artists' challenges. In his typical style, he doesn't pull punches with these affirmations -- it's clear an artist will never be fulfilled unless s/he gets up and WORKS. These affirmations support that process, without gluing up the works with the mystical overtones (mumbo-jumbo?) often associated with affirmations.Arranged alphabetically by subject (Failure, Success, Fear, Anxiety, Inspiration, Day Jobs, Depression, Joy, etc.), each page is devoted to one subject. The page includes quotes from famous artists, a short paragraph to consider, and an affirmation to overcome the challenges and reinforce the positives.One thing I stumble on each time I use this book is the wordiness of the affirmations. These aren't pithy sayings to be glanced at and remembered all day. Most are fairly involved paragraphs in their own right (On Inspiration: &quot;I believe I create for myself when I honor my artist's nature and diligently practice my craft. I will work whether I feel inspired or not: I know that if I labor with an open heart and an open mind, inspiration will come. I am ready to create it, receive it, and be swept away by it.&quot;). I tend to shorten them, pulling out just those points that resonate with me (&quot;I honor my artist's nature and embrace inspiration&quot;). This can be an advantage, though, since it means there can be different affirmations for each person or each situation. It also involves the artist in the creation of the affirmation, making each one uniquely that person's.Highly recommended for living more fully with your artistic self, or as a gift for the artist in your life."},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"Don't be fooled by the deceptively simple title. Affirmations for Artists is a smart, practical and irreverent toolkit for deepening your creativity and enhancing your life. Unlike most of the annoyingly ethereal affirmation books I've read, this one yanks affirmations down to earth, tackles misconceptions and pitfalls, and demonstrates how to use affirmations effectively.The author cuts straight to the heart of the problems artists of all stripes wrestle with and serves up realistic strategies for problem solving. Crafted with wit, grace and no-nonsense compassion, Affirmations for Artists is a generous and elegant book."},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"This book is crammed with affirmations related to the fears and horrors every artist ends up going through at some point. Whereas I am not too keen in affirmations, I found Mr Maisel's words extremely conforting and intelligent. Although the affirmations are inspiring, this is a book with practical advice as well, unlike so many others that adress similar questions. It also contains a lot of quotations from famous artists who apparently went through similar ordeals. &quot;Affirmations for artists&quot; adresses many different kinds of disciplines and is definitely a great gift for an artistically inclined person. If it ever gets translated into Spanish I'm definitely giving it out to my friends."},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"I thought this was a daily affirmation book, but I was mistaken. I also thought it would be geared mostly toward the visual artist, but I was again mistaken."},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"Recently received this lovely book. Each page is on one subject. The messages are very uplifting and positive! The only thing is, well, there are some subjects not addressed that I personally was looking for but, just gives more room to expand in the next book ;)))Highly Recommend ~"},{"Title":"Affirmations for Artists","review":"I believe that making affirmations really help us to achieve our creative goals. Eric Maisel's book is full of affirmations that really work if we work them! I make this book part of my daily reading, and it makes every day start on a positive note."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Tom Wolfe writes about people who have The Right Stuff and people who have The Wrong Stuff. He's wickedly funny and accurate about people who have The Wrong Stuff and respectful but very interesting and observant about people who have The Right Stuff. This bewilders readers who cannot tell the difference between The Right Stuff and The Wrong Stuff. And it deeply offends those who have The Wrong Stuff.Hooking Up has these essays about people with The Wrong Stuff: Hooking Up; In the Land of the Rococo Marxist; The Great Relearning; Ambush at Fort Bragg; My Three Stooges; Foreword: Murderous Gutter Journalism; Tiny Mummies! The True Story of the Ruler of 43rd Street's Land of the Walking Dead; Lost in The Wichy Thickets: The New Yorker and Afterword: High in the Saddle.And it has these essays about people who have The Right Stuff: Two Men Who Went West; Digibabble, Fairy Dust, and the Human Anthill; Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died and The Invisible Artist.Buy this book. This is your chance for an evening of belly laughs if you know the difference between The Right Stuff and The Wrong Stuff."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"After hearing Wolfe praised by William Zinsser, America's foremost writing expert, I decided I would give this book a read. Nothing short of amazing. His essay \\"In the Land of the Roccoco Marxists\\" is an amazing piece of satire, and \\"Sorry--Your Soul Just Died\\" shows why Tom Wolfe is still the master commentator on American culture.The reason why I loved this book was that Wolfe has built up the reputation to say the things that most of us are thinking. If I was to question whether or not the sexual revolution has increased the mean happiness in the United States--A covert Puritan! If I was to praise the virtues of America, it's unprecedented free speech laws and an economy that allows a great deal of personal self determination--A Red Neck! If I was to point out how Academia now resembles a circus--A Midwestern Middlebrow! But when Tom Wolfe says it, people listen.This wasn't as disjointed as previous reviewers made it out to be. The underlying theme throughout the book is that this accelerated sexual revolution is not an event in isolation. In The Land of the Roccoco Marxists, Wolfe talks about how the role of the intellectual since the time of Zola was to mock the views of the bourgeois class. This included mocking their moral convictions. The role of the modern intellectual, from HL Mencken to the literary critics in NY who praised and popularized Joyce, Fitzgerald, and about any other piece of literature designed to challenge the bourgeois morality, played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for this tumultuous revolution we are all still coping with."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"When I see \\"Tom Wolfe\\" on a book my only hesitation is to ask myself how I could have missed reading it before this.And \\"Hooking Up\\" followed that same pattern. I saw, I purchased and I devoured it.Wolfe's non-fiction is as good as his fiction. I found myself quoting the observations on a Harvard entomologist for weeks after I finished the book. And I am still laughing at a wonderful story about William Shawn. (No, I did not confuse this with etymologist. Wolfe's genius is to take an ant expert and make him a giant!)The depiction of a TV crew seeking a gruesome story demonstrated an ability to see inside of our minds.There is nothing like Wolfe's ability to use English at its most wonderful.There is only one problem with anything by Wolfe--it comes to an end. And because of the quality, one long sleepless flight is enough to finish the book. (And I would not leave the plane until I could!)"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Tom Wolfe, best known for his biting social satire and pioneering use of strong, conversational reactions and exclamations in his nonfiction reportage, surveys American social and political mores in this collection of old and new essays and a novella. Wolfe is clever, and he gives us some scathing commentary on American culture. However, the book has two major problems: First, he oversimplifies his targets. Second, there's a mean streak that strikes one as the curmudgeonly rantings of a man fully rooted in a mythical American past.It's easy for Wolfe to make fun of trends in psychology, sociobiology, linguistics, and \\"cultural relativity\\" when he puts them through a definitional strainer so thin that only the barest outline of the original theory remains. Yet, that's what Wolfe does as he dumbs them down, and then calls them bogus. It's dishonest criticism. He oversimplifies deconstructionism, psychoanalysis, biology, multiculturalism, and other topics so much that I continually reacted along the lines of \\"But that's not what those theories say!\\" Additionally, as another reviewer mentioned, his objections are neither original nor aware of recent modifications. However much one detests deconstruction (which he derides as some sort of new Communism), his simplistic approach is not only unfair, but ignores the ways in which it has influenced other political, linguistic, and social \\"discourse.\\" Wolff seems such a Francophobe that one imagines him ordering \\"Freedom Fries\\" to this day. In addition, Wolfe himself has a long and noble history of deconstructing \\"texts,\\" including his own re-workings of the \\"New Yorker\\" in two essays here.For a man who seems to reject the post-modern idea that \\"history is written by the winners,\\" Wolfe spends an inordinate amount of time protecting and promoting his reputation. His reaction to critiques by Mailer, Updike, and Irving, although some of it deserving, comes off as incredibly puerile, and he proclaims that his naturalist reportage (as opposed to their brand of writing) is the style and model for the new century. (At least, he credits Zola, Dreiser and others for their work.) As he gleefully attempts to wittily bring down these \\"Eastern establishment\\" literary emblems; one thinks he doth protest too much. His early pieces on \\"The New Yorker\\" are sometimes clever and quite nuanced, but he spoils the effect by telling us how clever and nuanced these were. After reading Wolfe's enthusiasm for his own work, the pieces no longer meet our heightened expectations.The title piece on youthful sexual practices is well written, but neither very insightful nor particularly useful: Wolfe has a knack for the revealing quote and the economical vignette, but whether these are true or representative is hard to know. At least \\"Hooking Up\\" is interesting and provocative without the defensive or self-promotional aspects of some of his other essays. He also writes some interesting pieces about technology and society, although again, his speculations about the future are just too easy for him to knock down. The essays are so scattered and varied that his sarcasm, exaggeration, and critical satire are often indistinguishable from his own vaunted objective \\"naturalistic\\" reporting. Is he putting us on, or has he really become such a social science \\"Luddite\\" and prude? (I suspect the latter, but maybe, David Bowie-like, his newfound crank-stance is just a temporary persona.) The man who dislikes notions of relativity and subjectivism doesn't appear to recognize that he himself reports the \\"facts\\" from a highly subjective and rightward leaning political ground. Unfortunately, the stream of cheap attacks on the perceived European/leftist/academic intellectual complex drowns out much of the less biased and more genuinely insightful criticism found here."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I have missed Tom Wolfe. I loved the time I used to spend with the reporter dressed in a white suit who spoke with the poet's voice.Unfortunately his battle with the demons of depression has limited the opportunities he allows me to visit. As the old saw says, \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\\" and I welcome the opportunity even a collection of short stories affords. It is not five-star material, but I am grateful for the chance to experience one of America's great journalist's unconventional and outspoken thoughts on our culture.In this collection, Wolfe travels this country, observing \\"the lurid carnival actually taking place in the mightiest country on earth in the year 2000.\\" He focuses his keen eye and applies his sharp tongue to teenage sexual mores and the new sciences of genetics and neuroscience. He profiles William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, and Intel founder, Robert Noyce.The stories may be short, but the satire and the observations that made vintage Wolfe a legend, remain honed. They may not rate five stars, but they offer an opportunity to re-experience a master."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Wolfe was unquestionably the most entertaining pop culture chronicler of the 60's and 70's. He and Hunter Thompson burrowed under the skin of all manner of Californians and other New Americans and put us under there too. Wolfe led the way on a wild, joyous, outrageous trip. Most of Hooking UP, except for the title essay and the Noyce piece, is very superficial. As an admirer of Wolfe, I was uncomfortable for him as I read his savaging of Susan Sontag. Her main sin seems to have been getting more 90's ink than Wolfe. His three line dismissal of Noam Chomsky was also embarassing. Reread Kandy and Pump House instead."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I'm wondering if the raison d'etre of book was to painlessly fulfill a contractual agreement with Wolfe's publisher. I've already enjoyed Ambush at Fort Bragg in Rolling Stone. A friend swears he already read Your Soul Just Died - on-line, no less. Some of the other essays unfortunately feel under-edited and patched together. In spite of all that, I have to say I really enjoyed Wolfe's full-on crankiness in The New Yorker Affair and My Three Stooges. They made me giggle."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"An interesting and compelling assemblage of bits and pieces; both fiction and non-fiction. As always, Wolfe is entertaining. In this case, he is also enlightening."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Excellent masterwork of older man , who writes with an young heart , who sees all contemporary society problems , who understands it in his way - my most favourite writer number one ."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"The book was a grab bag of micellaneous articles which had not been published before. Despite the tease, it had nothing to do with the phenomenon of &#34;hooking up.:&#34; The articles on Silicon Valley was interesting (if you live there), but the rest was absolutely unrelated to anything else in the book. And I have read almost all Tom Wolfe has written. This was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I'm keeping this book for future use. To follow all the avenues Tom opens up will take years, but it will be fun..."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Mr. Wolfe at least gives the reader notice in his preface that this book is basically a rambling free association of his thoughts on the current status of religion, morality, social conscience, transdisciplinary education, and neuroscientific theories in the US. The title is certainly misleading as discussions on \\"hooking up\\" and other sexual mores occupy only a small section at the book's beginning. The vast majority of the book is a detailed account of the development of the computer and certain silicon valley corporations. While somewhat interesting, these stories have little to do with the stated focus of this book. Other parts of the book are poorly organized, erudite hubris, and reading it is like wading through quicksand. I hate to be so negative on it, but I wish I had spent the time I wasted on reading this book on other activities, such as washing my car or cleaning my guns. I enjoyed reading other of Mr. Wolfe's books immensely, but, all in all, this book is a poor presentation of his literary effort and ability."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Its tough to explain hwats these short stories are about rather than just saying they are Mr. Wolfe's observations about life and things told in a very smart way. Its interesting where he attacks some of his peers in the literary world."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"There is something riseable about the boy who doesn't like the way the game is played and picks up his glove (or ball) and stomps off with a pout on his moosh and retires to his Westside duplex or Connecticut McMansion. It's the spoiled child. We, outside the \\"glorious\\" US, are very well aware of the glitteringly attired and succesful Mr Wolfe living in the greatest city in the greatest country in the world. Please. Enough already. Most of us don't want it. Especially the silly patriotism, excessive consumption, selfishness, defensiveness, gloating. We just don't understand. Uh huh. In the game, Mr Wolfe is an ok short stop. But he is a lousy batter, can't steal bases, and is not a team player. He has never hit a home run. He's done a job. He's a second stringer. His book in review is like a high school debate preparation. In my estimation, Mr Wolfe lacks the empathy, generosity of spirit, and imagination to be a great writer. Gerald Murnane or Roth or Shirley Hazzard or Christina Stead are just three that spring to mind that I recommend to Mr Wolfe. Get a grip man!"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"After twenty years, Tom Wolfe is back with another collection of essays of social criticism. Throughout much of the Eighties and Nineties, it seemed that he had been overtaken by the changing times, as every satirist eventually must be. The sprayer of irony one day finds himself drowing in it. His two smash novels pointed to new directions for him.But here is this grab bag of old and new material, picking right up where his last such, 1980's _In Our Time_, left off. He didn't include any of his very witty caricatures here, though-too bad. One of the essays, &quot;My Three Stooges&quot;, a barrel-roll around his literary competition, would have been a good forum for them.That piece, &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; is a terrific rejoinder to his critics in thenortheasternliberalliteraryestablishment. The writers who inhabit the Long Island-Martha's Vinyard-rural New England triangle have been so increasingly irrelevant to the rest of American life that it's all the New York literary taste-makers can do to keep them afloat. This may be the knock-out blow for them, as Wolfe touts the vital but neglected role of reportage in bringing the parade of American life successfully to print.Wolfe's style has remained rather static over the years. He still uses his familiar panoply of ellipses, italics, and repetition, though the pages are not as annoyingly snowy with them as in his earlier days. Mysteriously, he recycled a _lot_ of snappy turns of phrase from earlier books. I mean, verbatim passages of description, &quot;gold chains twinkling in his chest hairs,&quot; &quot;hung their hides over the edge,&quot; &quot;Please God, don't let me look old,&quot; to list a very few, all made memorable appearances in his work decades ago. Plus, the use of tell-tale brand names as punchlines makes some older essays sound stale, as those brands have lost their cachet or stigma over the years.The collection has its strengths and weaknesses, of course, like all collections of anything do. _The Right Stuff_ notwithstanding, Wolfe is not a science writer, and his two essays on sociobiology here feel like oversimplifications. There's surely room for satire in that field, but this doesn't feel like his best work. The horselaugh at _The New Yorker_'s expense is a cute souvenir of Sixties New York, but no more than that. And &quot;Ambush at Fort Bragg&quot; confused a lot of people, perhaps because the story didn't tell them what to think about the events. Just enjoy the characterizations, then. A more detailed acknowledgements section would be useful, showing when and where these pieces are from.But &quot;Two Men Who Went West&quot; is a very interesting tale about the birth of Silicon Valley and its unique corporate culture. &quot;In the Land of the Rococo Marxists&quot; is a richly deserved, exquisitely drawn out sneer at pampered academic radicals, and how they have coped with their side losing the Cold War. &quot;The Invisible Artist&quot; is a surprisingly affectionate account of the career of Frederick Hart. And the introduction to the book, &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is vintage Wolfe, modern mores seen through the uncomprehending eyes of a deftly-detailed ordinary joe.So everything old is new again! The reporter-satirist-novelist-reporter still has a sharp eye for the current scene, even if his style is flash-frozen in time. A must for Wolfe fans."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"OK, let me begin by saying that Tom Wolfe is one of my favorite authors. He does his homework, has an eye for detail and an exquisite (ooh...there's that word!) way of bending the English language to his purposes. So, I'm a fan.However, I found &quot;Hooking Up&quot; to be less than I expected or hoped for. Other reviewers have commented on the dubious relevance of some of the essays, and I agree. The piece on the NY Times was well-written, as usual, but I just didn't care about the topic. It seemed to be a little too shrill, a little too self-serving...but in the end I just didn't care.&quot;Ambush At Fort Bragg&quot; was deadly in its aim, but the sexual content bordered on pornographic (I say this even as I admit that it fit the context of the story) and, frankly, I'm just a tad weary of such things.Mr. Wolfe is at his best when he takes aim at current social, philosophic and scientific issues, and dissects them, layer by layer, exposing the good with the bad. He does this in a number of essays in this collection, and that is the saving grace for this book. If you're a Tom Wolfe fan, by all means - buy the book. If you're not familiar with his work but want to be, there are better choices."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"If you love living in America, if you're thrilled by the raw courage of entrepeneurial effort that explodes into success, and if you refuse to accept the center-left line America's liberal elite wants to hand you, then Tom Wolfe is your go-to guy. He's hard-working, brilliant, and writes like a man playing a burning piano.Although many know him best for his novels like &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, you're missing his best work if you don't read the essay collections like &quot;Hooking Up&quot;. In this volume, we get the true story behind the birth of Silicon Valley, a tale of a great artist no one knows because he possesses actual skill, a novella skewering the television news magazines, and several other gems.If you have a Wolfe collection, add this book to it. If you don't have a Wolfe collection, start one!"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I came to &quot;Hooking Up&quot; after having finished Paul Johnson's &quot;Intellectuals,&quot; another great study of thought and its effect in our society. I've actually met Tom Wolfe at Duke Univ., and was struck by how open and sensible he was. This collection of essays is more than a humorous and hip read: it's responsible. The research and journalism are sound; the depth of humanity displayed in the exposition of it is touching. The defense of Naturalism in &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; is something that one would have thought went without saying, but for the past four decades, hasn't. It is so good to see the inward-looking, self-absorbed writers like Updike falling at last by the wayside. Updike's problem is that he never went out into the crazy carnival of American life and lived, took chances, felt emotion in extremis, or at least spent time with people who live in these states. With Updike and Irving (Norman Mailer was always more of a self-promotion specialist than a good writer), writing is an intellectual parlor game: good for themselves, but not so exciting for the rest of us. It's nice to see Wolfe having the final word here. He's a breath of fresh air. His writing, like his lifetime pursuits, are concerned with us, all of us. He is truly the closest we've had in two generations to a writer who can at least claim pretentions of carrying the mantel of Dickens."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I first read a favorable review of this book in The Wall Street Journal so I bought it because I enjoyed Mr. Wolfe's other books. I then read a New York Times review which wasn't really a review but a political diatribe against the author.After actually reading the book I find that his style and observations so compelling and interesting that I can't believe I was reading the same book as the Time's reviewer.Mr. Wolfe's story about his run-in with Mailer, Updike and Irving is very funny and rings true. The sales numbers tell the story.&quot;The Invisible Artist&quot; is another favorite.I only wish Mr. Wolfe would write a piece about the election fiasco and split in the country.I also wish he would write more material and more often as he is a national treasure.His journalistic based style is similar to that of Neal Stephenson and Richard Dooling. I enjoy those books so much more than Updike's pondering himself."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I don't claim to have any literary pretensions--afterall I read Maxim, visit CollegeStories.com and watch too much reality TV. But I am a fan of Wolfe--ran out to buy Man in Full and I Am Charlotte Simmons. I'm also a closet science geek.That's why I found his essays on neurosciene and the history of Intel to be particularly fanscinating. His ability to coax a story out of facts, notes, factual notes and notes about facts is amazing.On the other hand, not being a lit head and under the age of 40, I found his version of a liteary dance-off with all of his haters to be less than interesting. And not a little chest beating.I vote yes on checking this out from the library. Bonus: there's little chance of running up late fees."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Despite producing some of the best novels, reporting, and essays of the past thirty or mopre years, Tom Wolfe remains underappreciated in literary circles- perhaps because he's never sought to be one of the insiders. His politics are his own, not dictated by the fashions of the New York Review of Books, and his writing owes more to the great novelists like Zola and Tolstoy than it does to the postmodern icons whose work seems to by the standard for literary merit these day.And that's a pity, as few writers can compete with Wolfe when it comes to making important points about culture in a way that's so entertaining. Aphorisms seem to spill out of him like water from a tap. For instance, his reaction to the oft-heard threat that America is falling into some sort of opressive government: \\"Fascism is forever descending on America- but it always seems to land in Europe.\\"This book contains a number of Wolfe's observations of the cultural scene, going back to a brilliant parody of The New Yorker and New Yorker editor William Shawn that appeared in Esquire around thirty years ago. All are showpieces for Wolfe's brilliant writing style and incisive wit.My favorite? Hard to decide between \\"Roccoco Marxists\\" (a discussion of the literary Marxism that lives on in academic and cultural circles) and \\"My Three Stooges\\", which combines Wolfe's serious call for a return to the naturalistic novel with a hysterically funny description of the attacks visited upon him by three of America's supposed literary lions.But really, it's impossible to pick out favorites; it's all very, very good. I enjoyed it so much I went out and found a few more used copies to give to friends whom I thought might appreciate it as well. If you like the sort of witty, thoughful writing that seems to have disappeared in the modern era, you might like it, too."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I've previously enjoyed The Right Stuff and Wolfe's two novels, but I had never read any of his essays or short stories. \\"Hooking Up\\" was an excellent, accessible introduction into these genres. The essays in the book cover a range of topics about modern America including its sexual mores, the rise of technology, art and contemporary novels. He makes many great arguments for the greatness and unique character of America and uses his intelligent wit, knowledge of philosophy and historical facts to make strong cases. His writing, as always, is excellent and the stories were insightful. This collection also includes a novella that is both fun and concise (not always Wolfe's strong suit). I think this is a fabulous book for Wolfe fans like myself, but also good for people who want a quick introduction to him without committing to an 800 page novel. Further, it would be great reading for people interested in American Studies and provides a good starting point for lengthy debates. This is a very good book and well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This book feels haphazard, because nothing unifies the selections. There are essays on the founder of Intel and on the New Yorker (among other subjects) mixed in with a novella and diatribe on three prominent authors. One senses the publisher's desire to get something, ANYTHING, by Wolfe into print before Christmas.The section of the book on the New Yorker is the most disappointing. The two pieces on the magazine are over thirty years old! The editor he mocks is long gone. Who cares anymore? This was disposable newspaper prose, not a work for the ages to be republished decades later.The New Yorker section also illustrates how little Wolfe has grown in the intervening years. He keeps his choice of topics fresh, and he still has an acute eye for detail, but the writing style! All those exclamation marks! The old man in white still writes like the Young Turk he once was! Amazing! And that sneering prose! Still there! But shouldn't we expect some changes in his knockabout prose in the past decades? Furthermore, Wolfe is recycling ideas. In how many books has he compared the dress of doormen to 19th century Austrian colonels or Gilbert and Sullivan characters. It's funny the first couple of times but annoying afterwards. Even within this book he recycles many phrases, sometimes word-for-word. Is it deliberate or just sloppy editing?The novella &quot;Ambush at Fort Bragg&quot; on its own would be three-stars. Mostly it seems to be an excuse for Wolfe to write some porno scenes and to make fun of the people behind TV newsmagazines. But it also illustrates the limitations of his fiction. Unlike Dickens, who also was a reporter turned novelist with a great sense of humor, Wolfe has no affection for his characters. They all are just absurd spectacles for the man in white to mock. Yes, his mockery is funny, but it can wear thin. Where is the compassionate understanding of people that belongs to the greatest novelists? (Of course, Dickens can be mawkishly sentimental -- a sin Wolfe never shares.) Wolfe's characters are too thin to populate great literature. They are all absurd affect and pretension, no heart.Although Wolfe's attack upon Irving, Mailer, and Updike is in some respects petty, but it does allow him to make a case for his style of literature: engaged with its time and place.The usual suspects come in for a bashing (Marxists, the PC crowd, intellectuals, modern artists, etc.). Many of these people deserve to be bashed, but Wolfe has done so long before this book. In short: more recycling.For my money, the essays in the first section are the best. Wolfe shows his wonderful skills as an observer of the American scene. But he also displays his penchant for overstatement. For instance, to listen to Wolfe you'd think that American philosophy was a cesspool of deconstructionism. In fact, deconstructionism exists only at the fringes of philosophy in America. Most American philosophers come out of the tradition of Frege and Russell, not Heidegger and Derrida. Also, Wolfe oversimplifies the debate concerning sociobiology. Yes, many of E. O. Wilson's opponents have been uncivil and thuggish, but some have had legitimate concerns that his sociobiological program is an attempt to give social constructions the imprimatur of biological destiny. Wolfe gives Wilson's critics no credit at all. Wilson simply is portrayed as A Great Man having to do battle with the forces of ignorance and foolishness. My own opinion is that neither Wilson nor his opponents have proven their cases yet."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Wolfe's collection 'Hooking Up' is described as a book that talks about sex, courtship, and the 'hooking up' of males and females in today's society. It's not exactly that. What it is, is a collection of essays and fiction collected by Wolfe and thrown together. Nothing wrong with that, but I want to make sure no one is fooled like I was. That being said, it is a pretty good collection of work. It's divided into five parts.Part 1 (Hooking Up) contains the title essay, one which deals with sex and courtship, then and now. Wolfe doesn't deliver anything new or shocking here.Part 2 (The Human Beast) contains 3 essays. The first deals with the rise of Pentium and the silicon revolution. Wolfe's skill as a journalist is evident here, but the reading is a bit slow. Both of the other essays deal with the digital revolution. It's a topic Wolfe can write about, but not one that is enjoyable to read.Part 3 (Vita Robusta, Ars Anorexica) contains four essays. My favorite piece that I've read by Wolfe is \\"My Three Stooges.\\" Wolfe uses his wit to poke fun at Updike, Mailer, and John Irving, who attacked Wolfe's _A Man in Full_ when it was published. It's a great essay, and you see Wolfe's talents in full. I loved it. There is also his essay \\"The Invisible Artist\\" which contains Wolfe's thought on 'modern art' and the sculptor who designed the sculpture at the Viet Nam Memorial and other works we all recognize, but don't know the artist (and even, as Wolfe points out, may not consider the works art).The next section contains Wolfe's novells \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\", which is the only fiction in the collection, but it's a good story.The final section is 'The New Yorker Affair' in which Wolfe spoofed the New Yorker by doing a profile of their editor. It's a great section.The New Yorker Affair, Ambush at Fort Bragg, and my favorite essay \\"My Three Stooges\\" show Wolfe at his best, and they alone are worth the price of the collection. And I'm sure you'll get some enjoyment out of the other pieces as well."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"A turn of the millennium book by Mr. Wolfe, in which he overstates that the U.S. is the center of the world (as Britain was 100 years ago). One also ponders how much Mr. Wolfe would have changed his outlook after Sept. 11/2001. To some extent there is a bit of prudery and anti-liberalism in this book - or perhaps a lack of tolerance in his tone.There seems to be an underlying glorification of Middle America - and Middle American values (the work ethic, religion). But regardless, Mr. Wolfe is an entertaining writer and is always able to arouse interest in a wide variety of subjects - like the rise of Silicon Valley.His exposure of Updike, Irving, and Mailer in \\"My Three Stooges\\" was hilarious. I rather agree with Wolfe that modern fiction lacks realism and is too insulated. For example, some of Irving's works are populated with outlandish characters - midgets playing basketball, people constantly dressed as clown- bears.\\"Ambush\\" was interesting, but made for uncomfortable reading; I am not sure where Mr. Wolfe's sympathies lie - probably with nobody. As a colleague of mine observed, the military is likely populated with these character types.The New Yorker pieces were hit and miss. Despite Wolfe's criticisms \\"The New Yorker\\" is a far better magazine than most. I appreciated the article, \\"The Invisible Artist\\", on the sculptor Frederick Hart - that was revelation."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I like the way Wolfe writes, and his particular insights on the world around him. I think he connects things well, and I was pleased with how well he described Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, someone I know something about. Past that he inspires the imagination and ways of thinking and understanding the world around us. He'd get five stars, but the end got a little tedious. He spent too much time trashing his critics. He's good, we know it. No need to worry about them. BTW I really enjoyed a Man in Full, and I am Charlotte Simmons. I might disagree with some of the reality, but I do enjoy his way of telling a story."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Is Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese the best journalist that has ever lived?After reading this collection of works from Tom Wolfe, I've put him ahead on points,just.In this book we have nine essay's, a novella and a re-print / recollection of a parody on the The New Yorker Magazine.The subjects covered in the essay's are fantastic.We have an article on Robert Noyce of semi-conductor fame, the co-inventor of the micro chip and founder of Intell.We have an article on the sculpture Frederick Hart.The price of admission is covered with these two bits of writing alone.Then we have a re post to critical articles and comments by John Updyke, Norman Mailer and John Irving regarding Wolfe's novel A Man in Full. In this Wolfe argues that it is possible to write a great story and be popular at the same time, rather than a write a novel that is read by three elitists and then sinks without a trace.And after reading Mr. Wolfe's argument it is very difficult to disagree. Its all about pretension he says and he has no time for it.This loathing of pretension is also apparent in the essay on Frederick Hart, who was shunned by the artistic \\" elite\\" in New York because his work was too representative. Basically because people could actually see what it was he was ignored. The artistic movement had been hi- jacked by the modernists and post- modernists who had created their own little club that you had to conform to or you were out.This is a fantastic collection and is highly recommended to anyone who has an interest in good writing."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Recently in reviewing a couple of the early, influential, and culturally insightful works of the journalist/novelist Tom Wolfe, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flaked Streamline Baby I made the following comments that justly applied to those works but also provided a portent to future literary problems:\\"The subject of \\"Gonzo journalism\\", a journalistic literary trend started in the 1960s, and its most well-known practitioner, the late Doctor Hunter S. Thompson, has received much ink in this space over the past several years. The gist of this journalistic literary trend is that the writer gets \\"down and dirty\\" with whatever he or she is writing about and becomes an aspect of the story, one way or another. Now this notion set the traditionalists who worked under the so-called objectivist theory, \\"nothing but the facts, Jack\\" back on their heels. Of course, we all knew, and know, that this traditional approach was honored in the breech more than the observance and that old Hunter was merely rubbing everyone's face in it. However, Hunter Thompson was not the only one trying to got to \\"edge city\\" in his writing in what now has become, academically translated, called the \\"new journalism\\". The writer under review, Tom Wolfe, also tried in a less zany way to break out of the traditional mold as well.While Thompson was more than happy to tweak \\"edge city\\" Brother Wolfe, by his whole social existence, and by something deep down in his training never really got all the way there. He never really pressed the issue of his own involvement in the story, nor would it perhaps have worked for him, but surely off of this early work he is on to something different from the run of the mill \\"straight\\" journalism of those days. Heck, even Hunter Thompson, argued, and argued strenuously, that most of his attempts at \\"gonzo\\" didn't work either. Here some of Wolfe's entries are brilliant, some much less so but that seems par for the course when one is experimenting with new forms...\\"Well, that was then (back in the 1960s) and now is now and we are confronted in \\"Hooking Up\\", a potpourri of essays, some from back in the days and some \\"fresh\\" with the limitation of Tom Wolfe's version of the now old, very old \\"new journalism\\" that has become something of the standard fare in the 24/7 journalistic world. Here is the \\"skinny\\": one of the best essay in the book , \\"Tiny Mummies\\" is a beautiful send-up of The New Yorker, its then chief editor, William Shawn and the whole pretentious New York literary magazine culture. But that effort dates from back n the 1960s. His title essay on the other hand, is a rather oddball and not particularly enlightening look at where the millennium is heading, or not heading. Most of piece does not stand up very well ten years later.But then it only gets worst. Why? Old Tom has in that barren period since about \\"The Right Stuff\\" gotten cranky and crotchety as he joins the \\"death of communism\\" crowd with an offering of a \\"deadly\\" skewering of American elite college campuses and the equally \\"deadly\\" influence of \\"academic\\" Marxists, deconstructionists, and whatever else is going on in those \\"politically correct\\" precincts. Hardly tough work, although tedious I am sure. There are a couple of good pieces here beside that New Yorker send-up but they are not \\"think\\" pieces, the thing that I admired about Wolfe when he was taking quirky risks to write off-the-beaten path stuff. One is \\"Two Young Men Go West\\" about the remnant of the Protestant ethnic that drove the men who drove the early computer revolution. The other is a novella, \\"Ambush At Fort Bragg\\" an sketch on the \\"inside\\" of the celebrity- making new media, both of the fifteen-minutes-of-famers and the actor-like star news anchors."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"\\"The average electrician, air-conditioning mechanic, or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King blink.\\" (3) So opens this millennial survey of how wired, networked, and tangled American lives became circa 2000. Twenty years since Wolfe's last essay collection, this marks a more sober set of reflections on what now, ten years later, seems an optimistic start to what proved a dimmer decade.Wolfe argues, after the salacious \\"hooking up\\" of the sexy title takes but pp. 5-9 to elaborate, that science and academia, along with the media and consumers, connect in ways that allow affluence to rise and, unsurprisingly, intelligence to diminish for the norm. However, those in charge in Wolfe's world continue to wield power, and his fascination with the elite and how they clash with the proles makes this an engaging, if rather stolid, anthology.The first section, \\"The Human Beast,\\" examines the meeting of men with machines. Silicon Valley's birth comes with paralleling Josiah Grinnell, who took Horace Greeley's advice first-hand and went at least to the Middle West, of Iowa. His eponymous college schooled almost a century later Bob Noyce and classmates, who would spark the semiconductored, transistored post-WWII boom. This connects with an essay on E.O. Wilson's sociobiology, and while the pair move rapidly and neatly past everyone from Teilhard de Chardin to Nietzsche to Richard Dawkins, Wolfe manages to keep the material accessible. He sums up early Wilson: \\"He was a skinny runt, and then for years after that he was a beanpole.\\" (78) Wolfe's prose style has calmed down, but he still keeps an eye out for telling details.On the other hand, other entries here feel already familiar. True, it's always fun to laugh at \\"Rococo Marxists\\" and the silliness of an art world that favors a pile of rust by Richard Serra over realistic figures crafted by Frederick Kirk. Of Kirk's rejection by the cognoscenti: \\"Art worldlings regarded popularity as skill's live-in slut.\\" (137) I agree with Wolfe in both critiques, but in his rush past \\"The Great Relearning,\\" the piece is too brief to do justice to the topic, and \\"My Three Stooges\\" in its lengthy explanation of his book tour for \\"A Man in Full\\" saps the essay before it gets around to the more valuable comparison and contrast of naturalistic fiction with film. \\"Scene-by-scene construction\\" and \\"the liberal use of realistic dialogue\\" share with film the novel's craft; \\"interior point-of-view\\" and \\"the notation of status details,\\" however, show the shortcomings of cinematic narrative. Wolfe defends his subject matter against the attacks of Mailer, Updike, and John Irving spiritedly, but when it comes to his own novella that follows, the interest for me lay more in the dialogue transcribing \\"Florida Panhandle illiteracy\\" and the way that two cameras can set up a sting operation and edit out dialogue than the actual plot of how a sleazy pair of operatives, one a manipulative schlub, one a blonde TV personality, pull off their set-up of three gay-bashing Army grunts who are suspected of killing a soldier at Fort Bragg, NC.Last comes the old Wolfe, a piece that he wrote about Wallace Shawn of the New Yorker despite the magazine's refusal to cooperate officially. Wolfe frames the article for \\"New York\\" magazine with a lively reminiscence of mid-60s journalism that recalls the sting operatives above. \\"I'd heard of skeleton crews before, but this one was bones.\\" (250) The original essay is fine, but for me any appeal lay in how the style that made Wolfe famous played off the more sober air of today's author.To sum up, after having read his previous journalism collections, this one finds Wolfe spanning his usual series of class studies, social critiques, and media send-ups. It's useful to capture the mood around the year 2000. But placed next to his groundbreaking New Journalism, it's a less combative, more unassuming stance."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"The book is a collection of essays covering a variety of topics. One piece concerns the origins of Fairfield Semiconductor and Intel. Following the invention of the semi-conductor the micro-chip emerged. It was believed that the company needed to have an operating structure but not a social structure.Two of the founders at Fairfield, Miller and Noyce, went on to start Intel in Santa Clara near Mountain View. Everyone would have stock options. There would be low partitions separating work areas.Noyce had lived in Grinnell, Iowa. It was a bastion of dissenters. His generation was the end of the line, the last embodiment of the Protestant Ethic.Other essays concern THE NEW YORKER, sociobiology, and realistic novels. The volume is an exuberant display of writerly descriptions."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"If Tom Wolfe weren't already famous, he probably couldn't have found mainstream publication for many of these pieces. That is a compliment. In a world where the word &quot;diversity&quot; has become a catch phrase narrowly applied to a very select number of ethnic groups and political viewpoints, Wolfe has the cachet to put across opinions that would be unacceptable from an unknown, no matter how talented.This eclectic collection is an excellent value -- pulling together new pieces, old gems and fiction. Most valuable in his rerun Tribune pieces lampooning the New Yorker was its context -- the original mission of its founder back in 1925 was to mimic a certain type of British literary periodical. It is hard to believe that this fairly harmless parody caused such a fuss back then -- but evidence that political correctness under another name was already alive and kicking. I would have welcome a P.S. Under Tina Brown, the New Yorker did change radically -- I would have liked to see Wolfe's comment.Leftist academia, touched on in &quot;The Land of the Roccoco Marxists&quot; is an easy and popular target among conservative commentators. Here Wolfe likewise borders just a bit on a rant -- I would have liked to see him expand on the topic even more. I dabbled in Marxist/feminist literary theory in graduate school and am still utterly perplexed by the experience, being otherwise a citizen of the nonacademic, real world.Several years back I remember Wolfe saying his next big book was going to be about the world of higher education. More please."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Tom Wolfe provides much needed social commentary on the beginning of the new American Century and the fact that American &quot;intellectuals&quot; are too busy complaining to notice and appreciate the freedoms and contributions this county had provided to its people and the world. His writing style is excellent in all the short stories in this book. I truely admire Tom Wolfe especially after reading this book."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"From intro to the end of the Vita Robusta section (before the novella), this book should be mandatory reading for all college students in America. Absolutely brilliant essays on America, the future, intellectualism, technology and many other topics.The rest of the book is a novella and a passage about his tirade against the New Yorker. Neither of these is quite as essential in my opinion, but the beginning parts of the book alone are INVALUABLE."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"If you believe enough reviews of this book, you won't read it. That would be a shame. Beginning with the outcry of 'serious literature' champions, including several of his contemporaries, upon publication of A Man in Full, the literary world seems obsessed with deciding what Wolfe should be, rather than treasuring what he is. And that is this: our most accurate social critic of modern America, as dead-on now as he was 40 years ago. Do you wonder about implications of changing sexual mores? Unraveling the human genome? This is a perfect place to begin seeing the future. Don't sell Wolfe short--leave that to the more informed."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I'd read a lot of these pieces in their original magazine form. Some of them have been updated, and I enjoyed reading the updates (the piece on Robert Noyce and Intel has been updated since its 1983 publication in &quot;Esquire&quot;). Some had been published before that I had NOT read. I'd been dying to read the piece on the &quot;New Yorker&quot; after reading ABOUT it. And I really loved it!! The &quot;New Yorker&quot; is so revered, it's delightful to see Wolfe give it some well-deserved and high-spirited criticism. And then some pieces are published here for the first time (I loved the &quot;Rococo Marxism&quot; piece.) &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; does smack a bit of &quot;me thinketh thou doth protest too much&quot;, because Updike, Mailer and Irving had a point. (A MAN IN FULL was a flawed novel). But they are more deserving of Wolfe's criticsim than he is of theirs. I didn't need to read &quot;Ambush at For Bragg&quot; again, having read it in &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; But the &quot;re-runs&quot; were worth having, if it meant having the new and unread stuff. Wolfe is one of the greatest things we've got going in the writing world, and proof of that fact are in these pages."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"The title implies that this is a book centered on the standard practice for college-age coupling these days--hooking up--and the first essay does focus on this bizarre state of affairs. From there, however, Wolfe expands his survey to an all-encompassing assessment of life at the dawn of the 21st century, stressing technology and computers, but also featuring the arts, media, politics, and most significantly, the intellect.Altogether, Wolfe paints a dazzling picture of America in the year 2000, filled with our cultural contradictions and the kind of decadence that we see everyday, but also with truly mesmerizing stories of great men and their creations that will doubtless serve as the driving force for centuries to come. Stories of Bob Noyce, &Eacute;mile Zola, Edward O. Wilson, and Frederick Hart, all resonate beyond Wolfe's castigation of modern intellectuals, John Updike, Norman Mailer, John Irving, Richard Dawkins, and Noam Chomsky.The fascinating thing about Wolfe is that he recognizes the absurdity in our modern culture--perhaps with clearer vision than any other commentator of the day--and yet he remains energetically optimistic. It would seem an irrational optimism given all Wolfe has been through, but his writing is too sharp and ideas too insightful to chalk it up to psychosis.Granted, this is a very pre-9/11 book, and Wolfe's confident tone almost begs the kind of debacle that ensued, but the soul of this work stands today untarnished. Perhaps it is even stronger than when it was first published. Because after America's critics have all been given so much vindication, after they have been crowned victorious in the battle over whether America is the great productive powerhouse or the terrible corrupt gutter, there still remains the question of what America truly stands for. And Wolfe identifies it unabashedly in this book: America stands for innovation, belief, strength, freedom, and even intellect.At the start of this book Wolfe claims that the year 2000 will have been the transition between the first American century and the second of perhaps ten American centuries that will house the great Pax Americana. After the first eight years of this century, one might readily doubt that the 21st century will be another American century at all. But that will only be so if we let go of the energy that makes America what it is--energy that is pulsating out of this book."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Tom Wolfe's &quot;Hooking Up&quot;, written in his usual opinionated style, is in some parts lively and entertaining. It does bog down in places like the long explanation of Wolfe's feud with the New Yorker, which is more interesting to the writer himself than to the general reader.His analysis of the cultural traditions that went into the making of the Silicon Valley mentality, is sharp, deep, and probably accurate.The book includes a long novella which did not engage this reviewer with its theme, characters, or repetitive descriptions.Taken as a whole, Wolfe's book is alternately absorbing in some parts, tedious in others. Three stars."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I have always admired Wolfe's ability to describe the social landscape in artful precision, and these essays (plus novella) are no exception. The parts I found most enjoyable were his takes on the evolutionary-biology-neurology rise, the bio of Silicon Valley's founder, and the fun he had with the New Yorker in his early days. One of the things that makes Wolfe great is his perpetual optimism and wonder about the new. I didn't care for the novella all that much (I'd already read it in Rolling Stone). It's a bit flat. Also the little essay about criticism and Updike, Mailer, and Irving was a bit disturbing. It seems to me that both camps are wrong: the modern novel should not be pigeon-holed; there are many different styles of writing a work of fiction and neither Wolfe or his critics have an appropriate stand to dictate otherwise."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"HOOKING UP is an anthology of some of Tom Wolfe's famous satirical, often nasty, but humorous takes on American society, especially the literary world. He also compares the beginning of the &quot;American&quot; millennium to that of four decades ago. Mr. Wolfe leaves no doubt what he feels and what he believes most of the world thinks of the current American Revolution that centers on tremendous technological progress in genetics, computers, and the neurosciences.The title story is very entertaining and if the reader has a teen or someone in their young twenties ask them about its accuracy. The other twelve short story-commentaries are all enjoyable though Mr. Wolfe's fans have read some of them already. The novella forecasts TV scandals and though it does not quite hook the reader beyond second base (remember this reviewer is from the old school) quite like the rest of Mr. Wolfe's stinging commentaries, the tale seems accurately plausible. Fans of Mr. Wolfe will round the bases (old school) with HOOKING UP.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I enjoyed this. I'd read a lot of the pieces in magazines. The NEW YORKER piece I hadn't, and enjoyed him giving them a proper skewering. The THREE STOOGES piece was a bit much, though. First off, A MAN IN FULL was a very very flawed novel. And the idea that criticism by his contemporaries was soley jealousy is self-serving. The other bizarre thing about that piece, is that Tom Wolfe goes on and on and on and on about how old Mailer, Updike and Irving are, NEVER MIND THAT TOM WOLFE IS IN THEIR SAME AGE GROUP. Wolfe is, in fact, a lot older than Irving. So who is he to knock Irving for his age? Very hypoctrical. But I love Tom Wolfe, and so I do recommend this book, with that one reservation."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"The essay &quot;Two Young Men Who Went West&quot; is worth the price of the book.

Tom Wolfe is not just another clever wordsmith. He is a very deep thinker, with profound insights on subjects as diverse as genetics, politics, neurosciences, intellectuals, history, literature, and the American scene in general. Furthermore, Wolfe's values are serious and solid, far removed from the counter-cultural and artistic and literary frivolities he has parodied in some of his best known works. &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is a mind-stretching collection of some of Wolfe's finest thoughts, and is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This is a collection of essays and one novella written by Tom Wolfe, author of \\"A Man in Full\\", \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel\\" and \\"The Right Stuff\\".Whether you like Wolfe or not, you have to admit that he is one of the best, most widely read, and important authors of the the age. Those who dislike Wolfe simply disagree with his non-left-wing politics.The title essay, \\"Hooking Up\\", is a short take on the current American Culture and its emphasis on sex and unrestrained license. Narcissism on steroids, if you will. Excellent, timely and well-written.In \\"2 Young Men Who Went West\\" Wolfe follows the career of Bob Noyce and others who made Silicon Valley what it is. To me, this would be a dry un-interesting topic, but Wolfe not only made it interesting, he also gave this story context and meaning, no small feat. Read it if you want to have any macro-understanding of the computer revolution.In \\"Digibabble\\" Wolfe takes on those vague theories and the names behind them so popular with the American pseudo-intellectuals that control our culture. Teilhard de Chardin's life and work is explained. One of his great theories was that technological advances would lead to \\"convergence\\", a one-world culture. Unfortunately, Teilhard's credentials as an evolutionist took a hit when he sponsored the Piltdown man missing-link that turned out to be a hoax. But, oh well, he was still right, even though he was wrong, right? Media commentator McLuhan is also given a quick blurb. Then Dawkins (yes, the guy with the current atheist best-seller). Dawkins has the same trouble as Teilhard, really big ideas but they are simply wrong. Dawkins was known for his concept of \\"memes\\" - which sound like Lamarckian intellectual traits. As Wolfe notes, \\"There turns out to be one serious problem with memes, however. They don't exist.\\" This minor problem aside, memes are still an important, earth-shaking idea - just ask Dawkins. E.O. Wilson is the main protagonist/fall guy for the current determinism. You know, the 'man is simply a machine designed by evolution' nonsense.\\"Sorry, but your soul just died\\" is a short essay on the same lines with more of a philosphical basis including a synthesis of Nietzche that is breathtaking in how it takes a complex system and makes it understandable (though not necessarily logical).\\"In the Land of the Rococco Marxists\\" ridicules the current American pseudo-intellectuals. A quote in the article sums it up nicely, \\"An intellectual is a person knowledgeable in one field who speaks out only in others.\\" This essay is spot-on from my time in academia.Other favorite essays include \\"My 3 Stooges\\", a slam against Updike, Irving and Mailer, all of whom criticized Wolfe.The 80 page novella \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\" is an excerpt that was part of Wolfe's preparations for \\"A Man In Full\\" and is a wonderful set-piece about the current drive-by media.The last section of the book was the weakest because it was several old reviews of the editor of the New Yorker magazine in the '60's - something I have so little interest in that I couldn't force myself to read them thoroughly. But this last section is the reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, the brilliant Wolfe gives a wonderful overview (with the exception noted) of current American culture."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This book has a lot of good stuff in it. My favorite observation of Wolfe's, though, is that for poetry to be acceptable in literary circles these days, it has to be obscure, oblique, and hard to understand. Poets are upset these days that they aren't famous like Robert Frost was. Well, that's why. Wolfe is refreshing, to say the least."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"In general I love Tom Wolfe's work especially Man in Full. Quite frankly I found this volume of old essays dull. The essay on the founding of HP was interesting. Much of the rest of the book appeared to be an attempt to make himself feel more important by taking shots at any who criticize him... see My Three Stooges. Ambush at Fort Bragg would be more interesting if I could determine his point of attack. Did he attack the media or the homophobic soldiers? The last portion of the book about his clash with the New Yorker would be a lot more interesting if I was 20 years older and lived in or cared about NYC. I couldn't finish this book and that has only happened one other time. Maybe I'm just not as smart as Mr. Wolfe would require I be to read this book. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Though not as good as Bonfire of the Vanities. It makes for an interesting read and is well worth the effort.

Spurred by his recent monetary success with a &quot;Man in Full,&quot; he even takes revenge upon the hallowed trinity of Mailer, Updike, and Irving.Mr. Wolfe brilliantly targets (yet again) the total unimportance of academic criticism and modern art to the American century. Most interestingly, he delves into the ongoing quest to understand the human genetic code. As always, his satire and wit mask a respect for hard work, common people, and moral behavior.A very nice picture of the ongoing American saga."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I found this collection to be an extremely subpar effort by one of America's foremost essayists.The first essay, \\"Hooking Up\\", is a precursor to Wolfe's awful novel \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\". He is preachy and judgmental about the sexual mores of today's youth. Rather than being a piece of analysis about society at the dawn of the millenium, this essay reads like a diatribe by a grandfather who is horrified at what the kids are up to these days.Next comes a boasting and smug essay about the success of \\"A Man In Full\\". Wolfe keeps saying that he feels it is in poor taste to talk about reviews and sales figures and then goes on to talk about these subjects at length. He then moves on to an attack on Norman Mailer, John Updike, and John Irving. Granted, these authors attacked Wolfe's book first. But what happened to taking the high road? Wolfe smugly discusses his rivals' shortcomings and lack of success. Wolfe finally transitions to a proclamation of how \\"A Man In Full\\" is ushering in a new era for the novel and that he is a modern day Zola.At this point, I stopped reading. If I wanted to listen to preposterous boasting, I would go and talk to a six year old. At least the kid would be amusing.Skip this and read a better collection of essays."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Tom Wolfe is what the incomparable Arthur Koestler would have classified as,'a clever schoolboy'. He assumes an ironic stance, a distancing that permits him the last laugh on everything and one he touches. It's funny if you enjoy a flirtation with the power of that sort of priviledge. And, if you are, like most readers, positioned well below his subjects, its quite a romp.: invigorating, off-the-cuff, and ultra smooth, apt for the world he's both a part of and reporting on. For a dip into the exotic monied classes, it's excellent. Yet in quoting his darling 60s guru, Marshall McLuhan, that 'an intellectual is a person knowledgeable in one field that speaks out in others', he must realise he is thus, defining himself as one who has marked the history of the mid to late C20th. His anxious defence of his literary standing next to Mailers' and Irvings', while establishing his predilection for naturalism in literature, paves the way for his own 'self-righteous indignation' which he derides in the chattering class.It's the weakest essay, re-hashing his well known views on art and literature, which here, seem embarrasing.'Two Young Men went West' charts the rise and rise of Bill Noyce, silicon whizz-child of William Shockley, and spreads before us the genesis of congregational management mentality in corporate life, rife in all sectors of the new conservativist businesses of today. Grinnell was the Valley boy who started the seminar, cheerleader approach with the dreaded mission statements. There is an interesting essay on Edward O Wilson's neuroscience and how it levered Tielhard de Chardin's noosphere notions(that I was enchanted with in the 60s). My favourite piece,'Ambush At Fort Bragg', is a take on the conflation of news, race and military cliches: vintage Wolfe, reality writing about reality TV and its blurred edges."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This reviewer has read much of Wolfe's work beginning with Kandy Kolored and continuing to the present volume. He has frequently been awed and highly entertained with much of TW's output. The book under discussion, however,is not one of his better efforts.Maybe things started to go wrong with the physical appearance of the book. The cover is OK but the nearly invisble page numbers (pale gray) and lack of identification on the copyright page of the original publication date and publication name is inexcusable. What this reader appreciates in any collection are specific dates so that he can fit the information being presented into a better context. &quot;Late twentieth century&quot; isn't good enough.The animus of Wolfe toward New Yorker, John Irving, John Updike, and Norman Mailer was amusing when it originally happened but now reads like last year's news magazines. What you gentlemen share is an unstated fear that you and your work will be ignored or forgotten after your death or retirement. Instead of throwing verbal spitwads at each other why don't you just concentrate on doing the best work you can and let your audience decide on its staying power- if it has any. Also, Mr. Wolfe stop complaining how long and hard you worked on &quot;A Man in Full.&quot; The typical reader (me) only has time to deal with the end product.If any reader has read to this point and feels that this reviewer just went on a tangent, I apologize. Given the limitations on length of expression I'll conclude by saying that this is a typical anthology in that most readers should find one or more entries worthy of their attention. Maybe it will be the novella &quot;Ambush at Fort Bragg.&quot; Or perhaps the essays on Edward O. Wilson and Frederick Hart. Reading them all might lead to a slight case of disappointment.Thank you."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This book is seriously marred by Wolfe's complete lack of understanding of the Internet. He has no grasp of its cultural impact and substitutes sneers for his usual insight (Ok, it's usually snarky insight, but still...)The Fort Bragg piece is also weak. It reminds me of a Made for TV movie. Media opportunism isn't exactly a newsflash."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I am a fan of Tom Wolfe because I have so often put down books of fiction thinking, \\"This ding-a-ling author is just making all this stuff up. It is not informative, nor inspiring and has no relevance to my life.I don't have time for this!\\" With Wolfe I feel like he is a more honest friend, sharing more real experiences. He gives at least some actual clues about aspects of America that affect me, but I might otherwise never see....There are also wonderful references to Nietsche, American and European history, many American novelists, and there is a great prescription on how to write a good novel.BUT I was disappointed in much of these essays. My favorite essay may have been \\"...the Rococco Marxists\\"...and I was surprised that he was not more critical of certain American professors. He may have politely suggested otherwise but ended with the conclusion that \\"all\\" many college professors \\"really want\\" is 'to be aloof from the bourgeois'...Monks want to be aloof like this. Is he saying they are holy monks? These professors enjoy many aspects of celebrity: wonderful long vacations all over the world, fine houses, cars, restauraunts, hotels, a sex life better than the most of us? More importantly they may have profound effects on our very powerful class of lawyers and judges, people in the media, etc. I was left with the impression that Wolfe is more worried about offending his own peer group than speaking honestly about some of these issues.Re: \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\"....Was it really necessary to have one of the villains go on at great length about his fellow villains' heroic deeds at Mogadishu...a retelling of \\"Blackhawk Down\\" ...when they were confronted with damning evidence that the 3 of them had murdered a homosexual in their unit? I think Wolfe might argue 'Yes, that is the whole point...' but it seemed in bad taste, and curious as Wolfe is elsewhere saying some very patriotic things. Surely there was a better way to do this piece. And what is with throwing pies at a miserable jewish insider again? The TV news producer was jewish wasn't he? Is Wolfe running out of funny ideas? Aren't all his jewish friends getting pissed off?....I loved the stories about the Fairchild Semiconductor founders, and the Harvard zoology-Ant-genius who caused such a controversy; I was puzzled that there was not discussion of the old, non-controversial view that man is part genetic traits and part social learning (nurture vs nature) This Harvard professor did not invent 'trait theory'. ....I didn't like \\"The New Yorker\\" parody and related pieces and couldn't finish them... prfairley@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I found it hard to follow his line of reasoning at times. He seems to be against a lot of things, and be the only man who really knows what everything is about. I usually find that a difficult attitude to cope with. And after the introduction, I almost put the book away. Very cliche, everything-used-to-be-better-in-the-good-old-days material. But Wolfe grabbed my attention again by exploring the foundation of current mainstream paradigmes. And he kept my attention, racing through current issues in science, business and art, up to the last two chapters. And by then I was so hooked, I could even forgive him the embarrasing chaper My Three Stooges, in which he (not wanting to brag of course) can't stop telling us what a super-mega-bestseller A Man in Full was. And how he was on the cover of Time Magazine (yes TIME! What magazine again? Oh Time magazine). All this is purely functional information for the story of course, the point being...., eh, the point being, I guess, that he is a better writer than John Irving, John Updike and Norman Mailer. I can even forgive him all that. Why?Because he tells such a damn good and juicy story! Even his bragging makes better reading than most writer's earnest efforts."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"With his customary brilliance and brio Wolfe sums up why none of the fashionable people are celebrating the dawn of the &quot;second American Century.&quot; He says Nietzsche was right in predicting the exhaustion of 19th century moral capital in the 20th. Brotherhoods of slave-hunting barbarians would rise up to take advantage of the moral vacuum, and their wars would make all previous wars seem to be like Sunday-school picnics (these brotherhoods turned out to be of course the Communists and the National Socialists, irritatingly and misleadingly nicknamed &quot;Nazis&quot;.) The slave-hunting brotherhoods were, at enormous cost, eventually defeated, but the moral vacuum remains (if anything it's gotten worse.) Too many on the left failed to properly understand what was at stake (see &quot;In the Land of the Rococco Marxists&quot;) and are now embarassed by the collapse of socialism. It remains to the common, bourgeois middle class to take their prosperity and celebrate the freedom America has provided. Wolfe speculates on what will fill the continuing vacuum. In the witty essay &quot;Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died&quot; he considers the new orthodoxy of neo-Darwinsim and sociobiology and speculates that God can't be abolished, after all. In &quot;The Invisible Artist&quot; and &quot;The Great Relearning&quot; he specualtes on the possibility of a new, more objective art to replace the worn-out modernism of the last century. The Wolfe many of us love is the relentless, unawswerable satirist, and that side shows up in &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; (where he demolishes Updike, Mailer, and John Irving). The book concludes with his now-legendary lampoons of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and a new recounting of the extremes to which it drove his targets (the reaction reached all the way to LBJ's White House.) A highly satisfying read from a national treasure."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This is a collection of essays from the master of realistic fiction that are organized loosely around a few themes. They are of varying length and the two best, \\"Hooking Up\\" and \\"In The Land of the Rococo Marxists\\", are unfortunately much shorter than most of the others. The title essay is excellent but you'll find yourself finishing it after thirty minutes time which is a pity because the man who wrote \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" has volumes to say about the sexual relations of the young in America. \\"In The Land of the Rococo Marxists\\" is a comical look at the Young Turks who basically now own our universities and are of varying ages. How ironic it is that these famous postmodern profs drive Jaguars and conspicuously consume while both decrying capitalism and America? Well, unfortunately, ironic or not, we're stuck with them. They've dug into the academy like hedgehogs. As you probably know, Wolfe can write about nearly anything and do so with flair and panache. We see this here with his exposes of the business world, specifically, in \\"Two Young Men Who Went West\\", the new businesses geniuses of the sixties and seventies are profiled like Bob Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel. In an another piece, he even describes Bill Gates for us. The New Yorker essays are rather dated as he reprints spoofs he wrote in the sixties of their editor, William Shawn, and his dry, boring magazine, but the bizarre reaction to his send-ups do not fail to amaze and entertain. Lastly, I must recommend his \\"My Three Stooges\\" for the way in which it describes the past and future of the American novel while skewing literary heroes like Normal Mailer, John Updike, and John Irving. These three cattily attack Wolfe for varying reasons after the publication of his \\"Man in Full.\\" Here, in this collection, is a man in full and nearly everything he writes is worth reading."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I've been a Tom Wolfe fan for more than 30 years and have always been frustrated by the leisurely pace of his literary production. His major works have been few, and he allowed more than a decade to pass between Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full, the tantalizing and highly successful forays into fiction that have marked the maturation of his career. Apparently Wolfe's publishers, watching financial opportunity dribble away under the weight of writer's block, have been frustrated too, because \\"Hooking Up\\" gives the impression that the author may have compiled it under duress. The book is largely a collection of previously published pieces, some of them very old, patched together with spicy bits of new turn-of-the-millennium type commentary. I tried my best to discern some pattern to the choice of articles that were included, or to the order in which they were presented, but I can see little. There's one piece of short fiction, written very much in the style of his novels, and which is vintage Wolfe, but which loses force thrown in this way as an out-of-context fragment. The rest of the pieces are non-fiction and cover a crazy-quilt of subjects, many of them arcane. However, part of the greatness of Tom Wolfe is that he's never boring, imbuing as he does the most mundane material with intensity, insight and humor. In one essay, for example, he tells the story Edward O. Wilson, an introvert who devoted his early life to the scientific study of ants and went on from there to become a famous (among academics) and highly controversial proponent of biological determinism. In a similar nerdy-heroic vein, other republished essays focus on scientists and sixties technology wizards, foreshadowing Michael Lewis 30 years later in both style and content. Great writers can be petty human beings at times and, disappointingly, this side of Wolfe's nature is apparent occassionally in Hooking Up, most egregiously in \\"My Three Stooges\\". The \`stooges' in this sharp little diatribe turn out to be no lesser personages than Norman Mailer, John Updike, and John Irving, all three of whom publicly attacked Wolfe when A Man in Full appeared in print. Wolfe's inference that they were motivated by jealousy at the runaway success of his book is probably fair enough, although he stoops to the same level himself here, rounding out the spectacle of America's senior literary titans, the \`stooges' plus Wolfe now, behaving like a flock of catty old gossips. The book closes in this same sarcastic mode with Wolfe's gleeful reproduction of hostile parodies he wrote in the 1960's of the quirky people and stuffy culture surrounding The New Yorker magazine. Despite all these limitations, and despite the venomous writer's shop-talk, Hooking Up is a book that I have to recommend, at least to Tom Wolfe fans. Many of these pieces, taken by themselves, still shimmer with his genius and love of life. They're enough to make us hungry for a real book from him again, a project which at one point he promises he's currently at work on. We can only hope it doesn't take him another ten years to produce it!"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Like David Remnick, Tom Wolfe's background was journalism before he ventured into the novel territory. I heard so much about Tom Wolfe and the hooha that he generated (even featured in the Times magazine) when his much awaited novel (which took one decade to write) was released into the market few yrs back. Thru blind faith, I sourced this book &amp; read it, hoping that his work did live up to his name. &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is a book with a mixed element comprises of social commentaries and a novella. Some of them highly interesting, some of them I just couldn't bother with but they all revealed America from the inside out, just as Tom Wolfe did for &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; by showing to us the rot within the American society. Highlights in this book, for me anyway, would be the changes of American society towards the sex issue, when sex is sex, the comparison of phases of intimacy between now &amp; 30 yrs ago; the transformation of Santa Clara Valley into what's better known as Silicon Valley nowadays, the description of two men (Noyce in particular) who brought with them a new corporate culture, invention over brawn which projected America to be the ultimate self-made billionaires' haven; intriguing insight into the research which allows human being to see what the others are thinking and what their minds are functioning to, and questioning the validity of human's soul, whether it's the rite thing to be playing God; the novella about homophobia in the army; lastly, the parodying of The New Yorker being a living dinasour. The whole book is compelling to read, and for Americans that are within their own shorelines, perhaps, what's written here they could live without as they have already known the facts but for us out there who are clamouring to understand the American society better, this book is a revelation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I don't know. I just can't help but feel, as indeed many reviewers do, that Tom Wolfe with this particular publication seems a bit dated. There's no (with the risk of sounding like a nobber) \\"zeitgeist\\" if you will. This was only the second book of Wolfe's that I read, which I guess just makes me unlucky, because all the others which I've read have all been smashing (or at least good).I did also find that this particular book, probably will appeal mostly to an American audience. That dosen't give or take from the books literary quality. It's just an obervation.I wouldn't recommend this book though, unless you're a completist. There are many, much better Wolfe books out there."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This book is really three. I get the feeling Tom Wolfe started and worked on them as three separate books, then time bound them around the \\"turn of the millenium\\" theme to get them to the publisher. This binding avoids the long delay associated with A Man in Full.The three titles might have been - \\"How the Old Perceived Sex of the Young\\", \\"Midwest Boys of Silicon Valley\\", and \\"The Global Village Turns 40\\". \\"Sex of the Young\\" is written in the Bonfire of the Vanities style - showing all the shallowness of human behaviour. \\"Midwest Boys\\" is right out of the \\"The Right Stuff\\" in terms of celebrating triumph. And \\"Global Village\\" is sort of a science will win over art piece with the hidden agenda of journalism winning over literature lurking in there somewhere.In any case, the title \\"Hooking Up\\" only gives you idea of the first book. It is a shame because the best two pieces are the Silicon Boys piece and the de Chardin/McLuhan/E.O. Wilson Global Village/Global Tribes piece.You can see the Tom Wolfe roots in all three pieces in the values of practical, \\"no one is going to do it for you so you better learn how\\" middle America. If you were going to try to tie the three books together, the synopsis would read,\\"Youth sex is getting more casual; midwestern kids created Silicon Valley culture, not MIT; and a Southern kid is on the right track for figuring out human nature with science and brain imaging, not all those social psychologists at Harvard. Perhaps oversimplified a bit, perhaps hyperbolic, but isn't that so Wolfeian? '-)"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"This latest Tom Wolfe collection lacks a central theme, but is nevertheless extremely entertaining. The essays deal with sexual mores, the influence of liberal catholicism and the influence of protestant dissent on the modern world, the mind set of the electronic media and many other matters. The essays are beautifully written. My only criticism of the book, which is itself immensely entertaining, is that it is, what used to be called, &quot;bi-coastal&quot;, in its title essay and so is perhaps a bit more critical of American youth than is perhaps fair. I remember well Dr. Wolfe's comments on &quot;co-eds&quot; and &quot;fox terriers&quot; and whilst I thought it &quot;right on&quot; in those far off days, I do not think that &quot;Hooking Up&quot; covers everyone in the age group, there are now other sub-cultures, but in fairness, Dr. Wolfe does not claim that it does. A superb work!"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Although not every essay will be appreciated equally by all readers, the overall quality of Wolfe's writing is superb, and this book is a great read. One of the most important essays he has ever written is here, &quot;In the Land of the Rococo Marxist...&quot;, wherein he raises a vital question we should all be asking: What did we hear from all the Marxists, pro-Communists, and leftist liberals when Communist died, and all its flaws were revealed forever? Why didn't any of the blind, ignorant people who supported these empty excuses for &quot;civilization&quot;, and who repeatedly excused those &quot;evil empires&quot; (i.e., the Soviet Union and Communist China), have any excuse or apology for the rest of us? Many supposedly-educated people supported those political states for years, ignoring all evidence of their evil and repressive nature, and now that they have been absolutely proven wrong, Wolfe wonders where they are now. He is asking why they have no comment, no excuse, no explanation, and the reader, after reading Wolfe here, wonders also. The author does a fabulous job reviewing some of their now-dead views and leveling proper criticism. His essay on this topic is extremely interesting and relevant. His pieces on the history of Silicon Valley (Noyce), &quot;Two Young Men Who Went West.&quot;, and on &quot;Hooking Up&quot; are both quite good, although for different reasons. &quot;Two Young Men...&quot; gives such a detailed history of the cultural and historical background of the Silicon Valley developments, it is a &quot;must read&quot; for all who are affected by digital technology--which is to say, nearly everyone. &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is an eye-opener for most readers over the age of 25 or 30. I've heard people I work with use that phrase many times, and I thought I knew what they meant; now that I've read Wolfe's piece, I sure have to re-think some of those conversations. Read and learn. Some criticism that Wolfe's pieces in this work are of uneven quality seems unjustified when you consider the extreme high quality of the best and the fine quality of the rest. A very entertaining and informative book, and it is sure to be thought-provoking for most who pick it up."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I agree with the majority of reviewers who point out the uneveness of this collection. Part of me kept asking, &quot;And why NOW are we reading some of these old essays?&quot; But, since I love Wolfe's writing, I could forgive him some moments of indulgence. I liked the Bragg piece and the New Yorker bits and the hooking up essay, but some of the other ones are actually dull in parts -- except for the writing I guess you'd say. When Wolfe is at his best, he can rip others to shreds and keep that grin on his face. At his low point, he fails to stimulate much interest in his current rant. I happen to think he excels at pop culture. I wanted more &quot;hooking up&quot; essays with his trenchant observations about our culture. Instead, we get more of a random selection of good essays that jump all over the map."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I love Tom Wolfe's novels and books yet I had always heard he was a &quot;conservative&quot; but never knew why. His books didn't ever strike me as conservative or liberal but equally critical of both. This books is a collection of articles that will explain why he is called a conservative. Yet you will also see why he is an intellectual (something he would hate being called because he is critical of them).However, whatever your philophy, you'll find find something to agree with and much to contemplate. Also, Wolfe has the ability of taking an &quot;intellectual&quot; arguement (even if it is biased) and making it something easy (even fun) to read... and this is no mean feat. The reader for this tame is also fantastic.My only critisism with the book is that it is a little too egocentric and biased for me to take on regularly particularly when he uses selective logic to favor his views."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Wolfe's unique position as the resident elf of American letters has allowed him the licence to expose the mountains of hypocrisy and hype that form the fabric of our modern and now 'post modern' society, with out ever having had to reveal a point of view of his own. Most of his work is presented with a raconteur's relish. It moves just slightly outside and slightly behind the Next 'New' Thing, taking voyeuristic glee in adjudicating its pretensions and contradictions. The impression, though, is often that of a dilettante rather than a crusader, a writer with gifted perception but lacking a sense of mission. But in his older years he has come on a cause that he has approached with some passion. The state of the novel and his own contribution to it.The centre piece in these essays is the one dealing with his 'Three Stooges', Norman Mailer, John Irving, John Updike. For this he has abandoned all of his trademark irony and journalistic distance. The scathing critiques by America's literary elders on his last novel. 'A Man in Full' has left him on full counter attack.. That is all the more magnetic because the claims on both sides are nothing less than the mantle of Dickens, Zola, Tolstoy, Twain and the future of the novel as realism or aestheticism-- Wolfe's resonant social, morally definitive panorama or aestheticism's metaphysics, ethereal 'exquisiteness' and subjective ethics. Of course this strain has its own illustrious champions, Melville, Henry James, Proust, Joyce. His case is interesting, but inconclusive, as to why these two forms can't coexist. He is clearly sensitive to all the barbs from the literary 'aristocracy' and his essays are personal and at times bitter. Still, the spectacle of these over bred egos taking on one another in the media spotlight must have been irresistible to Wolfe, even if he is one of the participants. Surely he must be able to see a little of his own antiheroes Sherman McCoy and Charlie Croker, though, in all their puffed up self righteousness, in his own indignity.The wide ranging social essays and a novella are braced by his articulate, robust language. One is left with the suspicion, however, that his carefully chosen representations cover issues that are much more complex and nuanced than he gives credit. Anecdotes of such self contained sophistry as post structural literary criticism or 'socio-biology' are easy to lampoon, but a deeper look at the eschatology of middle American culture is never attempted. Wolfe inserts himself as a traditionalist, but in an intellect that is really much too sharp, flexible and transient to represent Middle America. The cast of characters would provide some colourful academic contrasts for any Park Avenue soiree, however. That is where Wolfe shines, as an intellectual vagabond, in an epoch that is providing no end of entertaining subject matter."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"\\"Hooking Up\\" is ace journalist Tom Wolfe's grab-bag examination of life in the 21st century, when \\"hooking up\\" can have a sexual, technological, or philosophical context. I just wish Tom or someone in his office could have been bothered to hook up this book a little better.The review here by \\"poopiepantz\\" says it all: This is like a B-sides collection more than a piece of work in itself. Even the very broad theme of where the world is at the dawn of the 21st century gives way as Wolfe settles scores with old literary foes, offers us a \\"novella\\" in the form of something he cut out of his novel \\"A Man In Full\\", and rounds things out with a recap of the fortnight when he took on New Yorker magazine and won. Ego runs amuk, along with words like \\"fauteuils\\" and \\"tachycardia\\".The book starts well, Wolfe noting the amazing progress of life today. \\"The average electrician, air-conditioning mechanic, or burglar-alarm repairman (lives) a life that would have made the Sun King blink.\\" Much of this, he notes, is tied to the rise of the United States and American values, like entrepreneurship and whiz-bang ingenuity, which may annoy left-wing academics but is widely understood by everyone else.The best essay in this vein, the longest in the collection, is \\"Two Young Men Who Went West\\", an engaging examination of the teetotaler minister who founded Grinnell, Iowa and made it into a distillation of America's pioneer spirit, and the more worldly offspring of the same small town who went further west to help found Silicon Valley. \\"Ironically it was that long-forgotten light...from out of the churchy, blue-nosed sticks...that led the world into the twenty-first century, across the electronic grid and into space.\\"It's not nearly so much fun reading Wolfe singing his own praises, which he does to embarrassing degree. It's not enough to tell you he was featured on the cover of Time magazine. He has to add how the magazine altered its cover's signature typeface to an off-white font, in honor of Wolfe's celebrated wardrobe.\\"Ambush At Fort Bragg\\", the novella, seems an attempt at exploring the red-state/blue-state divide, as a trio of U.S. Army Rangers find themselves ambushed by a hot-shot Barbara Walters-type and her New York Jewish producer. The murder of a gay comrade is the issue at hand, but Wolfe is more interested in the hypocracy of the accusers and the defiant heroism of one of the apparently guilty soldiers. It reads like a \\"Nightline\\" transcript, with a little porno thrown in.I liked Wolfe's take on the \\"New Yorker\\", written in an era when one didn't take on the \\"New Yorker\\" and all the more delightful for that. But Wolfe can't help but give himself a self-admiring intro and postscript.Wolfe is a talented writer, and flashes of that talent appear here to engage and amuse. But his head has never seemed bigger."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I have read ..Stuff\\" and \\"...Acid Trip\\" and, ..Bonfire\\", but had not really kept up with Wolf's writing.This was an UNEXPECTED find! (Okay, it was on the discount table!)This is a GREAT collection, none of which I had read before. Anyone who so brilliantly skewers left wing academic political correctness is a treasured friend!The \\"New Yorker\\" pieces may have been a little too vicious, but it's not like they didn't have it coming!Beyond a viciously delightful read, these essays will often be reread and comfort extracted therefrom.The piece on Silicone Valley does take a little more reader investment, but scores some important points.I have not actually read the novella, but will asap.Until then, I will just explore my own \\"inchoate longings\\"."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I enjoy Tom Wolfe. His writing is sharp and has a power to it that much contemporary writing lacks. Why? Because he works hard to go out and get the background information it takes to tell the truth about something we all share. Most of us do not share the inner-self of a writer who is fixated only upon him- or her- self. That gets boring in a hurry.But in this neat volume we get some wonderful essaygs, a response to the critical savaging Updike, Mailer, and Irving gave &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, a cut scene from the same novel (here it treated as an independent piece and is called a novella), and a sweet telling of some events associated with The New Yorker of the past and present.It is reasonable to like some of the works more than others and it is reasonable to agree with some views and disagree with others. But it is silly to simply bash Wolfe because you would prefer a different writing style. He is a stylist of the first order and has had a positive and energizing impact upon American letters for the past thirty-some years. He is beyond that type of carping.I just wish he would publish more!"},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"The &quot;Rococo Marxists&quot; piece is wonderful (except for his cruel dismissiveness of kids suffering from ADD). So are a lot of other pieces here. The &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; piece is a bit much, though, where he knocks Mailer, Updike and Irving for criticizing A MAN IN FULL. For one thing, it WAS a very flawed novel. The other thing is he keeps getting in digs about how old the three men are, WHEN WOLFE IS IN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS MAILER AND UPDIKE. And Wolfe is a LOT older than John Irving! Irving is in his 50's, whereas Wolfe is in his 70's. So who is Wolfe to call John Irving old? I found that part of the essay, frankly, bizarre."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Wolfe's expose on Protestantism and its controling influence on the semi conductor industry in &quot;Two Young Men Who Went West&quot; is the tight, revealing, and fascinating prose that makes him a master of the printed word. Wolfe's observations appear tongue-in-cheek, but they reveal his deep respect for American culture and the Puritan work ethic--a thoughtful gift for those in the know.It has always amazed this reviewer that most of America's best modern scientists seem evolutionary in their thinking--after pursuing careers in science where painstakingly close observation reveals absolute law every moment.Wolfe has certainly turned a long-neglected stone. He's not the only recent author who has noticed this influence on western thought.Simon Winchester in &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; notes that the Oxford English Dictionary, a work whose first draft took 75 years to complete and still a work in progress, was originally compiled to introduce the world to Christianity. Because the authors (many volunteers which include William Minor, the book's protagonist) attributed England's greatness to God's blessing on industry--the original purpose of all previous English dictionaries. The OED's set out to offer world a blueprint for Protestant culture by introducting the world to the English language. Central to Protestant thought is the cultural mandate: &quot;Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth.&quot; This is the basis of Puritan action and missionary work.How can the modern scientist grope for answers in a world of chance? To whom does he attribute his discoveries?Wolfe responds: &quot;Fortuitous...[in italics] well! How Josiah Grinnell, up on the plains of Heaven, must have laughed over that!&quot; (p 26)Savor the line; enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"Most of the essays here are entertaining and often thought provoking. Wolfe has a keen eye for many aspects of American life.I can not give it 5 stars, though. For someone who makes his living observing others Mr. Wolfe's skin is thin when he is put under the microscope himself. His disdain for Updike is ridiculous when one considers Updike's fiction is a graceful Michael Jordan flying dunk and Wolfe's is still based on descriptions of sounds and accents being spelled out in ALL CAP phonetics on every other page. This collection would have been better if he kept his own personal vendettas out, and stuck with what he does best."},{"Title":"Hooking Up","review":"I can think of no essayist writing in the U. S. today in the class with Tom Wolfe with the exception of the venerable Gore Vidal. As usual, Mr. Wolfe delivers up insightful satire on a variety of subjects: the sexual mores of America's youth, the awfulness of most modern so-called art, the decadence of the \\"literary\\" novel, to name a few. Then there is a short novel AMBUSH AT FORT BRAGG. I totally agree with Mr. Wolfe in his assessment of the artist Frederick Hart called \\"The Invisible Artist.\\" Is is common knowledge now that the \\"art\\" world, that world that Wolfe describes as \\"scarcely a world. . . some three thousand curators, dealers, collectors, scholars, critics, and artists in New York\\" refused to ever acknowledge or even review Hart's beautiful sculptures at both the National Cathedral and the Vietnam Soldiers. (Something tells me that Michelangelo would have given Mr. Hart a fantastic review.) As Mr. Wolfe says so well, Hart was doomed; he had a quality not found in many so-called modern artists, he was skilled.Another great essay is \\"My Three Stooges.\\" Here Mr. Wolfe gets the last laugh on Messers Mailer, Updike and Irving, all of whom attacked A MAN IN FULL as mere entertainment. While I disagree with Wolfe's assessment of some of the writers he lists as having written \\"wonderful\\" novels-- I'm thinking in particularly of WAITING TO EXHALE; I would never call that novel wonderful but a quick, mindless entertaining read-- certainly he is right that some of the Mailer and John Irving \\"stuff\\" is basically unreadable-- I've never known anyone who could have read ANCIENT EVENINGS even if they had wanted to. So Wolfe gets the last laugh on these \\"literary\\" writers. I believe many people would say, however, that Updike's Rabbit is a great character and as American as Huck Finn.But even if you disagree with Mr. Wolfe, he entertains you, makes you smile, and, yes, makes you think."},{"Title":"Carriage Driving, Updated Edition (Classic Edition): A Logical Approach Through Dressage Training","review":"This is the fourth book I have purchased.

Barnum. The authors have done a meticulous job of researching this man's life and work, along with providing hundreds of long-gone pictures and posters covering every inch of Barnum's career. Books of this kind are rare and don't get any better than that!"},{"Title":"P. T.

Barnum: America's Greatest Showman","review":"This excellent book was published as an accompanment to the 3-Hour Discovery Channel Documentary on P.T.Barnam;and what a magnificent book it is.Top quality in every aspect,with over 500 photographs,illustrations and color lithographs and 358 pages.It is not simply a collection of photos,which it is,but it is also a detailed text covering every aspect of the long and accomplished life of one of America's greatest personalities.Everyone,upon hearing of Barnum,immediately associates him with Bailey and the famous Barnum and Bailey Circus.However;Barnum was much greater than that.He was born in 1810,and most of his adult life was spent in developing The american Museum in New York.He was fascinated with the strange and oddities of the world and travelled widely to bring the best of things to be found,back to his museum to put on display for everyone to see,enjoy and be amazed with.Through hard work and adversity,in 1865 and at the age of 55 Barnum has become wealthy and now has a magnificent museum in New York.Then he is hit with a massive fire,losing it all.It is now the early 1870's and Barnum goes off in a totally different direction,though be it,still show business;he enters the world of the travelling Circus and Side Show.Now in his 60's he teams up with others and particularly Bailey,and creates the great circus for which he is so fondly remembered..The book is so extremely well researched and written that the reader is taken through such an amazing journey,that it is impossible to put down.Excellent photographs and details of the performers will bring back to life all that the Circus was known for; before the forces of political correctness and other difficulties and advancements in entertainment;made the Circus a thing of the past ..lost but not forgotten..especially when remembered with this great book and Documentry."},{"Title":"P.

Amply illustrated, often with rare photos, this is a great book for anyone, not just circus buffs."},{"Title":"P. T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman","review":"This book about P.T. Barnum is of outstanding quality. The authors cover the life and accomplishments of Barnum in great detail. The book features even-handed analysis. Barnum's accomplishments and shortcomings are presented in a measured and accurate manner. Barnum is rightly regarded as a great innovator and promoter, but he is shown to engage in \\"humbug\\" and was not afraid to pass of fraudulent materials as genuine on occasion.This book is beatifully illustrated. There are plenty of pictures of Barnum's oddities and natural wonders. Barnum's work had more historical value than most people realize. He collected natural history specimens that the Smithsonian Institute would have been proud to own. Barnum was a resilient individual with a burning ambition to succeed. He built up his entertainment empire on a couple of occasions, such as when a fire devastated his holdings in New York City.The book relays the stories of giants, dwarves, bearded ladies, and other people who made a living in the circus. Barnum made money off of these unfortunate individuals, but he also took good care of his workers and gave them an opportunity to make money in a cruel world that may have left them in the dust of society.This is a very entertaining and well written book with enchanting photographs. The book covers Barnum's early years in New York City all the way through the Ringling Brothers circus days as a juggernaut in the entertainment industry. This book is a delightful and engaging read."},{"Title":"P. T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman","review":"Accompanied the tv show on Barnum. Great pix and text about a remarkable American.

We will be finishing in two weeks. Peter Bolt's book on the big themes of Mark and their connection to greater issues in biblical theology is quite helpful. I was a little disappointed in the way Bolt set \\"religion\\" apart as something problematic that will get in the way of being a true disciple. His reason for doing so was to point out the problems of the religion of Pharisaical Judaism set in juxtaposition to Jesus' teaching in the New Testament. Certainly, \\"religion\\" can be abused, but I don't know if the use of the language in this way is helpful. (Note that the Puritans were completely comfortable with describing true discipleship as right and biblical religion.) Besides that, Bolt was quite helpful in laying out the large themes of the Gospel and my only regret is not reading the book earlier in my preaching series. Certainly recommended to pastors and sunday school teachers as a great resource. The book accomplishes what the author set out to do."},{"Title":"Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line by Line","review":"I'm no lawyer but this is a solid book that provides excellent guidance. Telecom in general is pretty complicated but i've learned that the contracts make the technology piece look like cake sometimes.this is a great book for the IT / sourcing professional who needs to prepare to negotiate with carriers. i think everyone in this space agrees that telecom is a completely unique beast to manage.what's great about this book is that it's precise but not tedious. it's intelligently laid out where you can see how some of the contractual changes are made and see what benefits one can receive from these modifications.i'm impressed with subject matter, the structure and the checklist that summarizes each chapter so i can quickly refresh myself on these new learnings. A must read for anyone conducting a large telecom procurement."},{"Title":"Negotiating Telecommunications Agreements Line by Line","review":"In short, do not spend $100 for this book. It is a basic approach to negotiating the most significant provisions of a telecom agreement. It tells only 1/2 the story when both sides and the thought process are needed to effectively negotiate these important provisions.I've been negotiating telecom/technology deals for 9 years and I must say this book is not worth almost $100.00 dollars. I was given the book by a friend to read and I couldn't believe they would charge $100 for a book that attempts to cover 13 of the most hotly negotiated provisions in telcom agreements in 133 pages (and they didn't use a tiny font).For example, the authors dedicate 5 pages to Limitations of Liability and 1 full page is used to show sample language. They instruct the reader to demand certain changes and show them what to ask for. That's where they leave it. What this does is leave the reader with a false sense of confidence so when the business lawyer on the other side says no and tells them why, the reader has no where to go. That's because the authors didn't lay out the arguments for why the provisions are necessary (on both sides) and under what circumstances either side of the deal could/should compromise. Also missing is from this section (and the book) is leverage. Leverage plays such an important role in negotiating these deals, its amazing these \\"professionals\\" ignore it. Sure, tell the telecom company to uncap liability for confidentiality and indemnification..yeah, they'll just go ahead and do that for you. That's not happening for you unless (1) the telecom co. feels the likelihood of a loss is minimal, (2) you are purchasing a ton of business and/or (3) the telecom co. is desperately in need of sales which means they are probably not worth dealing with. There is so much missing from this book, it cannot be addressed here.Next up, the authors spend only 5 pages discussing indemnification. If you've ever negotiated these deals, you know that between Limits on Liability and Indemnification you could spend weeks negotiating. In fact, deals could blow up on you over these provisions. Again, the authors send the reader out with what to ask for, but don't spend time educating the reader about how to get it. A better title for this book would be What to Ask for from your Telecom Provider. When I see negotiations, it means you better know what the issues are for both sides, why each sides need it, under what circumstances there is compromise or no compromise and your falls back positions. You're not getting it in this book. I'm not sure there is much more to say about this book...it's deficient at best.The author attempts to provide some balance in the 4th paragraph, of the 6 or 7 paragraphs spent discussing AUP (another hot topic for vendors) by discussing why Vendors need AUP. This at least provides the reader with a little of what they are up against. Author goes on to tell you what you should ask for and provides example revisions. The exampe revisions throughout the book are not very helpful. They appear to be just filler taking up a lot of space (therefore less space available for the author to educate the reader). If you are negotiating and drafting you'll know how to incorporate the language. If you are just negotiating, the drafting will be handled by your lawyer. Therefore, this isn't all that helpful. If it was in addition to some indepth analysis and discussion, fine."},{"Title":"Roosevelt's road to Russia","review":"This book demonstrates to anyone not snookered by the FDR myth that: Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the most traitorous President America has ever had. He was completely negligent in the manner in which he conducted the War. And the monumentally tragic decisions he made with respect to post-War Europe and Asia are simply unforgivable.As a pure politician, Roosevelt was out of his league in dealing with Stalin, notwithstanding his assertion to Winston Churchill that:&quot;I know you will not mind my being brutally frank when I tell you that I think I can personally handle Stalin better than either your Foreign Office or my State Department.&quot;Someone should have questioned the man's competence when he uttered the words:&quot;I have just a hunch that Stalin doesn't want anything but security for his country, and I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work for a world democracy and peace.&quot;Stalin had already annexed half of Poland and all of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia when Roosevelt made that remark!With the partitioning (and millions of lives) of Eastern Europe at stake, this man was acting on a &quot;hunch?&quot; Anyone who knew anything about Communism would have known that FDR's hope of appeasing Stalin was wishful thinking. Of course, none of his &quot;learned&quot; advisors (Harry Hopkins, Alger Hiss, etc.) said anything because it would turn out that they were Communist sympathizers.But that doesn't excuse Roosevelt who should have been informed on who and what he was dealing with. After all, there were ample voices outside of government telling the administration that it was playing with fire by cuddling up with Uncle Joe Stalin. But Roosevelt just turned these voices off by labeling them &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;pro-fascist.&quot;The Bolshevik Revolutionary himself (Lenin) had said years before:&quot;We are living not merely in a state, but in a system of states; and it is inconceivable that the Soviet republic should continue to exist for a long period side by side with imperialist states [e.g. America, Britain]. Ultimately one or the other must conquer. Meanwhile a number of terrible clashes between the Soviet republic and the bourgeois states are inevitable.&quot;Exactly what part of this did Roosevelt not understand?Additionally, assessments from one of FDR's military advisors stated:&quot;Russia's post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one. With Germany crushed, there is no power in Europe to oppose her tremendous military forces. It is true that Great Britain is building up a position in the Mediterranean vis-&agrave;-vis Russia that she may find useful in balancing power in Europe. However, even here she may not be able to oppose Russia unless she is otherwise supported.&quot;That FDR was mesmerized by Uncle Joe and wanted to keep him happy is beside the point. As the most powerful man in the world with the greatest military force behind him, why did Roosevelt ignore the Communist threat? Why was he giving Stalin so much with so few conditions?In fact, Roosevelt seemed to go out of his way to assist Stalin, giving him things without a request from the Soviet dictator and even in his absence! Roosevelt apparently thought he was exercising wise foreign policy when he stated:&quot;Of course, it's just the thing for the Russians. They couldn't want anything better. Unconditional surrender [of Germany and Japan]. Uncle Joe might have made it up himself!&quot;And in stating the following, it wasn't the first time that FDR would make Churchill part of his act in cozying up with Uncle Joe:&quot;Trouble is, the Prime Minister is thinking too much of the post-war, and where England will be. He's scared of letting the Russians get too strong.&quot;That Roosevelt was good at schmoozing with other politicians is beyond doubt. However, in making the above statement, he showed his utter incompetence in dealing with Russia effectively and realistically. If FDR had understood the Russian threat even half as well as Churchill did, the ensuing enslavement of Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain would have been averted.As a learned man of history, Churchill understood the threat of a Russia occupying Eastern Europe. Consequently, he had been promoting a plan for an allied invasion through the Balkans in order to occupy Eastern Europe. At the time Churchill made his proposal, Germany was still on Russian soil. An attack up through the Balkans would have enabled American, English and French forces to occupy Eastern Europe before Russia:&quot;The paramount task before us is, first, to conquer the African shores of the Mediterranean and set up the naval and air installations which are necessary to open an effective passage through it for military traffic; and, secondly, using the bases on the African shore to strike at the under-belly of the Axis [Balkans] in effective strength and in the shortest time.&quot;However, it was not to be. Stalin didn't like the plan. Consequently, Roosevelt did not like the plan. As America's General Clark would later comment:&quot;A campaign that might have changed the whole history of relations between the Western world and the Soviet Union was permitted to fade away ... Not alone in my opinion, but in the opinion of a number of experts who were close to the problem, the weakening of the campaign in Italy in order to invade Southern France, instead of pushing into the Balkans, was one of the outstanding mistakes of the War ... Stalin knew exactly what he wanted ... and the thing he wanted was to keep us out of the Balkans ... It is easy to see, therefore, why Stalin favored ANVIL [Normandy Invasion].&quot;May Truth be redeemed and this man (FDR) dethroned from his mythic throne in the annals of history."},{"Title":"Roosevelt's road to Russia","review":"This excellent exposition of FDR's relations with the Soviet Union makes us think... of the obvious. We think of Saddam defying the civilized world, we think of North Vietnam using the Kissinger treaty to overrun the south, we think of Anna Nicole with a case of Nesquick--Franklin would certainly try to charm Stalin and he would lose. That America tried to shmooz the communists instead of confront them certanly prolonged the cold war. If Frankin had not thought he could grin the reds into an decent deal, millions would have been free sooner. Crocker gives us Roosevelt's idiotic attempt at such idiocy a full hearing, and finds him a jackass."},{"Title":"How to conduct spiritual warfare: As I see it!","review":"This is a thin book--less than 100 pages, done in a now obsolete style, with lots of subtitles, big print and bold exclamations that are somewhat cryptic in their meaning. &quot;Cryptic&quot; fairly explains the overall text: the author does not clearly explain her points nor are they logically organized, thus raising questions rather than giving information. It was a difficult book to understand, tho there were a few valuable observations here and there. Most readers new to Spiritual Warfare would have difficulty understanding the author's points. Many Scriptural references were given but not further explained or quoted, apparently requiring the reader to have a Bible handy. Further, the author made the unforgiveable error of referring to material in her other books, but not giving it, thus leaving the reader with questions wondering what she is talking about, or having to buy another book or two to find out what she is referring to.I was not impressed with the overall organization of the text. The author wrote out a lot of thoughts with little regard for logical organization, and the publisher apparently only embellished the manuscript with large and bold type for emphasis here and there and then published it. For example, many of the various sections have no true introduction or summary, or organization in between. Introductory material is put in the middle rather than at the beginning.While the book was not quite money wasted, I think the author and publisher could have done a lot more to better clarify and organize the material and to expand on it. However, we do applaud the author's obvious enthusiasm in the Faith. Were that more were similarly endowed in the Spirit."},{"Title":"How to conduct spiritual warfare: As I see it!","review":"The author presents our authority and responsibility in Jesus very well.

On the back cover Robin Blaser asks the reader to \\"take care of this book,\\" because it is \\"important and amazing.\\" That lovely judgment seems to me to be, if anything, an understatement.

Telling a love story between a man and a woman from the point of view of their dog may sound like a strange idea, but Yael Hedaya takes it completely seriously in her novella &quot;Housebroken&quot; and creates an utterly touching tale.The man and the woman (their names are never mentioned) would just have gone home to their separate beds after a nice evening out if it had not been for the stray dog they found in the street. The woman takes both the dog and the man up to her flat; both visitors end up living with her. The lovers' treatment of the dog is like a barometer of their love; Hedaya makes brilliantly clear how carelessly people usually go about the difficult business of loving each other.There is no sentimentality whatsoever about Hedaya's storytelling. Both the characters and her way of describing them and their behaviour are utterly contemporary. There are two more novellas in the book, which are equally fascinating. Yael Hedaya is a real find. I found her characters unforgettable - it somehow feels as if I really knew these people..."},{"Title":"Housebroken: Three Novellas","review":"In my opinion, one of the best new writers to emerge on the scene."},{"Title":"Carrier Air Group Commanders: The Men and Their Machines (Schiffer Military History)","review":"Noted aviation historian and photographer Bob Lawson has produced a multi-faceted, well-illustrated and absolutely first-class history of all the officers who led U.S. Navy carrier air groups or wings - the CAGs.The list of the officers who have served as CAGs reads like a who's who of naval aviation -Jimmy Flatley, David McCampbell, \\"Jig Dog\\" Ramage, Frank Ault, Bob Elder and Jim Stockdale, to name just a few. Their exploits are legend and are well-covered in this book.After relating the development of naval aviation from 1900 to the 1990s, Lawson discusses the genesis and evolution of the CAG billet before jumping into the meat of the book, profiles of over 40 of the Navy's most notable CAGs. These first-person reminiscences give the reader a very human look into the world of these men as they relate highlights from their \\"CAG tour\\".Lawson then caps off the book with a section of color photographs and artwork depicting the various \\"CAG birds\\" flown by these men.Lawson's book is obviously a labor of love. The many fine personal reminiscences he solicited are complemented by a stunning collection of rare photographs of the men along with color profiles of their aircraft. Anyone interested in the development of naval aviation in the 20th Century should have this book on his shelf.

Unfortunately, the formatting is so horrible that it's distracting from the content. First of all, the font size is ridiculously large --- like reading something written in front size 16. The lines are not always even, and the text is full of inappropriate hyphenation, typos, etc. The pictures aren't always clear, and the figure legends are printed in font size 6 or so --- TINY.You might expect formatting errors with some of the public domain books available for free download, but for the price of this book, the publisher certainly SHOULD have been able to hire a proofreader. Inexcusably sloppy work."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"This is not a book for the average reader, nor is this review aimed at such. Norman Douglas wrote about places he lived, and we are fortunate that his masterpiece, South Wind, shows off his unequalled flair for capturing in prose the Mediterranean vistas, hillsides and small villages of his favorite island, Capri. Thrown in for good measure is a delighful and wickedly urban - one might better say Catholic (or even Roman) in the best sense - view of the foibles of humankind. Douglas spent much of his adult life in exile for sexual behavior, perhaps peccadillos, perhaps worse: his novel certainly does nothing to assuage bourgeois respectability. In it's day, 1917, South Wind was deliberately risque. There is even a murder mystery, though Douglas pays only a very discreet nod to that genre.But it's for the prose depictions of the Mediterranean landscapes, done in glorious and unforgetable language, that we read South Wind. The passages conveying the timelessness of the great grotto are simply magisterial. If you think Durrell captures the Mediterranean better than any other English writer you have not read Douglas. Do not lump Douglas, because of his subject matter in this book, with Firbank: South Wind is emphatically better than the verbal high-jinks of Firbank, whose over-indulgent books never convincingly connect with reality. Douglas, by contrast, can write as telling and visually acute a piece of descriptive prose as Mark Twain.A dated book for most, an unforgettable book for the connoisseur. If you appreciate the prose of South Wind there are several other equally well-written examples of his work in the travel books, especially Siren Land, Fountains in the Sand, and Old Calabria."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"Norman Douglas (1868-1952) spent a good part of his life abroad and Capri was the adoptive home of his last years. In 1911, he had already written a travel book on the Island and Sorrentine Peninsula (Siren Land), but in 1917 he issued his first novel \\"South Wind\\", that became one of the most popular reads during WWI (it is stated that many soldiers had it in their backpack).It has been defined as a conversation-novel without a plot, and its characters actually do nothing else than exchange their ideas and opinions (on the flow of existence, moral, comparative theology, aesthetics, fanaticism, medicine, cooking) as typical of Rablesian prose or what could have taken place in a respectable London club. The voices mix and tangle, endlessly and obsessively interrogating themselves with humor and intellectual disenchantment. But \\"South Wind\\" is before all else the discovery of the South, the Mediterranean, the profane art of living, modelled on ancient Greece, that Italy and Capri in particular seemed then to embody.An Anglican Bishop Mr Thomas Heard, on his way back from Africa (imaginary Bampopo) to England, visits for a short stay the Island of Nepenthe (Capri), where his cousin is staying. He will stay only a few days, but long enough to change his northern pruderie in a empathic attitude toward the worlds vices (\\"the frolicsome perversity\\"), starting from a crime he involuntarily peeps upon. The novel is full of characters: Denis, the caste poet worried by the possibility of sinning, the smiling completely pagan Italian priest Don Francesco, the \\"evil\\" Muhlen, the sceptic and artistic count Caloveglia, the \\"extravagant\\" Mr. Keith, \\"owner of one of the most beautiful villa's in Capri\\", the cousin Meadows, Miss Wilberforce an funny alcoholic that undresses in public, the rich van Koppen, the Russian mystic Bazhakulov, halfway between Rasputin and a bolschevic with his tribe of followers, Mrs. Steynlin a still appealing middle age matron that entertains a relation with a young Russian, Mr. Ernst Eames a commentator of the ancient history of Nepenthe written by a seventeenth century Italian historian. All these characters are actually inspired by people Douglas met in Capri during those roaring years as he states later on in his memory books. The Scirocco, the South Wind sweeps the Island, and everyone starts behaving strangely, or exactly like they feel like, which is the reason why the went to Nepenthe in the first place, and Bishop Heard is caught up in a spider web of distinguo and doubts until the wind strips away his moral imperatives in favour of Nepenthe's \\"pantheistic hedonism\\" and makes him \\"swim in the air\\".The roots of this novel can be traced to the concept of \\"Reverse Conversion\\" or the more modern \\"Going Native\\" that was popular in those times and is often used by D.H.Lawrence, James Hilton and others. (D.H.Lawrence used Norman Douglas as the model for his Aaron in \\"Aaron's Rod\\"). Part of the plot is borrowed from Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Marble Faun\\" as has been interestingly pointed out by Edmund Wilson. However, if we want to read it in the historical context it was written in and explain its lasting success to the 1930's, we must take into account that it was intended (Fussell) as \\"a rebuke to the winds of war that were gathering in the North of Europe\\", \\"a plea for youth and tolerance to the nations that were starting a suicidal war\\", but it is also a celebration of the ideas liberally generated and exposed. These ideas were those discussed in that period in the intellectual milieu and are still popular today among young people.Even if this is an \\"antiquarian book\\", I enjoyed it very much. As I said of \\"Siren Land\\", best read on a terrace overlooking \\"The Piazzetta\\"."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"I hope that this gem of a book is reprinted soon. For all those who cannot wait, wend to the Strand bookstore on Broadway and 12th in NYC, and check out the Modern Library section; a few copies may still linger. Like its title, the book sweeps over the reader in a sort of halcyon gale of language. Read once, the book must be re-read just so that one can retrace the plot. When not totally high on language I got glimpses of two of the most vivid characters in literature -- Mr. Keith and Count Calovaglia -- and that what it was - a glimpse. Like the South Wind of the title, the book leaves the reader terribly thirsty for more -- more of the island, more of the people, more of the flora, more of the rocks, for crying out loud. It has the sense and immediacy of an impressionist painting. In the 1924 Modern Library copy I possess, Douglas has an introduction in which he enumerates the islands that inspired the locale in the book. I am still considering an island hopping vacation to the Mediterranean."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"The copyright notice for this book says: \\"the text in this book has been downloaded from the internet and has been extensively edited and typeset.\\"I bought this book with the intention of reading the original text, not an \\"extensively edited edition\\".The book also says: \\"Copyright 2006\\".

I wanted to read the original text, and I do not recommend this inferior reproduction.The publishers should be ashamed of this product."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"As the previous reviewer notes, South Wind is an excellent work of fiction. It is Norman Douglas' most highly acclaimed work. This reprint edition however, suffers from abominably poor transcription and proofreading. Letters are missing from words and spaces are sometimes inserted where they don't belong. In some instances a return character or two is omitted in dialogues. I would guess that I have spotted over a hundred errors. They do not undermine the quality of the story, but do make it harder to read. This book is in the public domain and so is available on the web in HTML format, possibly with fewer errors. That said, I am glad to have a printed version of this book. Reading or printing it from the web would be a cumbersome enterprise.EDIT: 2008, The book description now says that it was published in 2007. It's possible the errors have been corrected, but I don't know. Used copies in other bindings should be available, and Amazon lists at least one other contemporary reprint paperback edition."},{"Title":"South wind;","review":"Published in 1917 and based on the author's expereince on Capri, this rather long winded novel failed to interest apart from the occasional witty observation. Very little plot and characters that are observed well but with little meaningful or interesting interaction between them. Some people will definitely be amused by some of the eccentric characters but at over 400 pages long this alone is not sufficient to maintain interest. The murder on page 360 was after a long slog. Read it if social history about foreigners living on a small island circa 1900 in the mediterranean (the fictitious island of Nepenthe in the book) is your special interest. However, I suggest reading Compton Mackenzie's \\"Vestal Fire\\" which I found a much more amusing insight to expatriate life on Capri."},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Story","review":"Wonderful easy to read chapter book dealing with everything from the Mayflower and Speedwell to Squanto in a very realistic, historical manner. As a first grade teacher, I have found this book to be both interesting for young readers as well as informative. It differs than other \\"Thanksgiving\\" books in that although it is most sympathetic to the abilities of the reader, it provides a very compassionate, \\"adult\\" look into our history.

It is an excellent resource for the home and the classroom!END"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Story","review":"I was just at a huge retail bookseller yesterday looking at Thanksgiving books that I could read to my homeschooled Kindergartener. There is a large selelction of bland books about thanksgiving. The wise child will say, \\"But, WHO are we thanking?\\" after reading most of those books. THIS book answers that question...GOD! Yes, while it seems politically incorrect, the truth is that the first settlers to our country WERE religious pilgrims, seeking a safe haven from religious persecution. This book is a gem in a PC sea of bland, corny thanksgiving day books for children. Children will enjoy the simple story; those just getting into chapter books will enjoy feeling successful reading a 'big kid' chapter book; and they will enjoy seeing how God blesses the faithful when they endure through trying times and complete hard work. This is a great book that your early elementary aged children will enjoy and can become a traditional read aloud for your family on the holiday!"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Story","review":"This is an excellent \\"history book\\" for listeners as young as first grade, maybe even Kindergarten if the child is accustomed to chapter books. It tells the story of the arrival of the Pilgrims, and the times leading up to the first Thanksgiving. There are five chapters, and illustrations on most pages. The story is told in a manner that is full of historical detail, and yet also delightfully simple. We follow three Pilgrim children--Giles, Constance, and Damaris Hopkins--and read of their experiences travelling on the Mayflower, building a settlement in New Plymouth, first being afraid of and then befriending some Indians, and finally sharing a feast together, each thanking God in their own way.

I was very disappointed. As someone who has used Word, Excel and PowerPoint for the better part of 20 years, it offered me nothing new. And considering I never use Outlook, there was nothing there for me either.On the other hand, if you are just beginning to learn these programs, this is a MUCH easier read than the technical manuals that comes with the software package. 561 pages cover everything you could possibly want to know about these four programs. A 24 page Index and a 26 page Content Section give you plenty of options on how to look up things which makes it much easier that trying to find something in the Yellow Pages. The whole book is written in a lighthearted manner which makes it easy to read.The book is laid out in Parts. Each part covers a particular program - Part 1 - Word, Part 2 - Excel, etc. Inside each part are chapters. The beginning of each chapter describes in an outline form what is found in that chapter so you don't have to hunt through the whole book to find what you want to do. There are graphics showing what the author is talking about and boxes which give great tips. There are even specially marked sections (with a little \\"Batman\\" figure!) with even more tips.For those of you needing a helping hand on Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Outlook, this is the book that will help you achieve your goals.

Now I realize the kids are paying for these trips out of pocket (or their parent's are) but come ON!

I loved all of the side plots which if you read my other BSC reviews you'll notice I am not usually a fan of, I loved the character friction when it was there, I even loved her descriptions of places.

She was on a helicoptor that crashed, but her adventures mainly focused on walking back to where they were supposed to be. What really bugged me about this story is that there was almost NO plot. The whole plot is: The baby-sitters go to Hawaii. They do stuff. They come back. That's what most Super Specials are about, but other ones are written better and the adventures are actually realistic (since when do 13-year-olds act in commercials by pretending that they're 18, and having everyone believe them?).

I thought I knew everything there was to know about living in pain but after reading her book I realized that she has given me so much insight as to how to live even better.

Figures for the United States on chronic pain, for example, show that at least one American in ten suffers from chronic pain with its considerable impacts on employment, social participation, finance and intimate relationships.Books like Dr Martha Cleveland's Chronic Illness and the Twelve Steps, which offer practical help, have a large potential market. Millions of people have chronic illnesses, and those millions have people who care about them and stand alongside their loved ones seeking solutions.This book outlines the Twelve Step journey and the way it develops emotional resilience to manage chronic illness. It describes, for example, the Steps asking the person to make a complete inventory and deal with the hurts of the past. Dr Cleveland is detailed in her analysis of emotional pain; how to identify it, how to remedy it, how to maintain a healthy emotional life.The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the AA program were founded by Episcopal priest Sam Shoemaker. Fr Shoemaker is credited with the idea of twelve steps as a way of making spiritual resources available to people addicted to alcohol. This book is one of several that AA World Services Inc. have approved that adapt the Twelve Steps for diseases and addictions other than alcoholism. The sub-title of this book promises a practical approach to spiritual resilience in the AA tradition. I, however, would disagree that this book is about spiritual resilience, as its emphasis on emotional pain and healthy emotions is more to do with emotional resilience.The near reduction of the concept of a Higher Power to faith in one's own projections illustrates the change of emphasis. Much more can be made of a Higher Power that transcends our own life without infringing the boundaries of the AA teachings of a Higher Power.I have been collecting and reading dozens of books on chronic pain and chronic illness over the past year. Cleveland's book is one of the most practical of these books on managing and \`healing' chronic illnesses. she outlines the steps clearly without sacrificing depth of engagement. Drawing on her own experience of chronic illness and her practice as a therapist, she shows when encouragement is needed, and when sheer grit is the only way through.As one who writes on chronic pain and spirituality out of my personal knowledge of chronic pain, I consider this book will be highly useful for people with chronic illnesses and those who care for them."},{"Title":"Chronic Illness and the Twelve Steps: A Practical Approach to Spiritual Resilience","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much. The 12 steps used in recovery programs have helped millions of people in a variety of situations. This book doesn't quite make the transition from the 12 steps to chronic illness. Although the basic premise, that we can look at and heal emotional pain, and find spiritual serentity, is good; the path isn't laid out clearly. It's too sketchy, nebulous, and intangible.Cleveland writes, &quot;Ask your fear what it needs from you.&quot; If this works for you, great. I just found it frustrating. She has some good ideas. It was just hard for me to fish them out."},{"Title":"Chronic Illness and the Twelve Steps: A Practical Approach to Spiritual Resilience","review":"This book is very good and links well to the 12 steps of AA.

Some of the laws contain substanial subdetail, so you get even more lists than this suggests.For a young person interested in leadership, this book is a helpful abstract on ideal qualities, habits, and actions of leaders. I saw no serious problem with the lists.I rated the book down one star because the examples sometimes didn't quite work the way they should with the lists. As a result, the list can leave you with an incomplete sense of the concept. For example, Law 9 is &quot;consistency can often be as valuable as accuracy.&quot; The example given is of a hypothetical employee who has been with the company a long time, and is always wrong. Eventually, Elbaulav (the person's name) becomes the CEO's assistant. The CEO asks his advice, and then does the opposite. I don't think that's going to help anyone understand why this rule is a good one. Consistency is valuable because it creates and reinforces a sense of certainty that inspires trust and useful action.Here are two other examples of the laws in the book:Law 40 &quot;You need to read people and situations as accurately and quickly as you read books.&quot;Law 54 &quot;SERVICE equals PROFITS - People Returning Often For Insured Total Satisfaction.&quot;Obviously, there's a lot to learn from other books to be able to implement these laws. But that's okay, it gives you a goal.If you have seen good leaders, you will not need this book.

This book describes friendship in how it should be, that no matter how different two people are, sometimes the opposites make the best friends.

The illustrations, though simple, get the point across perfectly. My favorite character was Bill, allthough I also liked Mama. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"It's been a pleasure to share these stories with our children and now our grandchildren!"},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"I remember reading this book over and over and over again as a child. I never was able to get the others in the series, but I loved this one and I still remember it today (at 27 years old, no less). I actually flipped through it a few days ago as funny as that sounds, but that's how much I loved the book. It's imaginative and silly, and any child who's curious about the rest of the world wouldn't help but want to check out some books on Egypt from their library after getting through with this!"},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"This pair of critters and their book is bound for CLASSIC status, if not there already. Go ahead, resist this book if you can. Succinct, emotionally honest peek at friendship, courage and creativity ---delivered directly and humorously. At times children want a book read and re-read and. . . if you're a parent, you know. Well, you won't mind reading this 50 times in a row."},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"Love these stories! Bill & Pete are a great team. Highly recommended; go for entire series! dePaola is a great author/illustrator."},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"My mother read this book to me as a child and I loved it. It was always so exciting and funny to me, especially the picture of Bill popping out of the bad guy's bathtub. Even now it makes me laugh!I also used to take this book with me when I babysat and would read it to kids before bed. I never met a kid who didn't like Bill and Pete. It's the perfect mix of adventure and wit, and a great tale of friendship.Will it raise your child's IQ by a huge margin? Probably not. Is that what bedtime stories are for? Not really.Will they remember this book twenty years (and beyond) later with fond memories, and then read it to their own children? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"This is my five year-old daughter's favorite book. It's the right mix of silliness (a bird for a toothbrush?!) and adventure.

Pete rechristens him &quot;Bill&quot;. Exotic locations and a warm humerous story make this book and it's sequel, &quot;Bill and Pete Go Down the Nile&quot; two of our favorite preschool picture books. Unfortunately, the third book, &quot;Bill and Pete to the Rescue&quot; is a bit rambling and not in the same class."},{"Title":"Bill and Pete","review":"(Spoilers ahead)I am surprised this is a 5 star book on here?? I have been an avid reader my whole life but just found this at the library the other day. The book seems very rambling to me. William the alligator starts off with his mom buying him a bird (Pete) for a tooth brush. Then he goes to school for the first time, memorizes the alphabet perfectly on the first day, memorizes how to write the letters perfectly the second day, and then on the 3rd day they memorize how to write their name. \\"William\\" can't spell his name so Pete the Bird tells him to use Bill instead. (I found that annoying)! Then Bill & Pete sees a man steal other little alligators who will be \\"made into alligator purses\\". Then Bill is stolen. Then he escapes, crawls into the kidnappers tub & scares him - and the man runs away naked. Then Bill & Pete goes home and everything is just fine.I didn't enjoy this book at all and it seemed very, very dumbed down compared to all the other great children's literature out there (such as \\"I took the Moon for a Walk\\", Little Golden Books, \\"Cordoroy\\", and even Arthur). I was just left with a \\"so-what??\\" feeling after reading it, and felt the storyline was ADD'ish."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"I am a self proclaimed \\"Dessert Queen\\"-I love to cook and bake, but my favorite course is dessert.

I have had it for over 10 years and actually had it spiral bound because the binding fell apart due to using it so much!The recipes are all easy to follow, include lots of photos, which I love, and they always turn out the way the end product looks in the book. My children have made some desserts out of this book, such as Bittersweet Chocolate Torte, and been given rave reviews! I believe there is only one recipe which I have made in this book which I did not like, so far, and I think that's amazing over the course of over 10 years.I have given friends and relatives this book because it has such a fantastic compilation of great recipes all in one place.

I am actually online today to order copies for my three young children since I use so many of the recipes as my personal specialties. I know by the time they are old enough to really need them this book will be out of print so I'd better do it now. The recipes are not so difficult, I usually do them with three children helping.

I got it for my highschool graduation in 1992. Before I received it, I didn't decorate very much; I just made all kinds of hearty brownies, chocolate/carrot/cheese/apple/caramel/orange chiffon cakes, pies, bars, cookies, bread, etc. So this book showed me how to make lovely chocolate curls and my first Chocolate Curl Cake, or my first elegant Strawberry Charlotte.The tiramisu recipe in this book is my favorite. I don't like any other tiramisu, authentic or not. Try it and you'll agree! I double the recipe and place it in an upside down glass cake dish (which is made to be used both ways, as a punch bowl and as a cake dish). If you double the recipe it resembles more a British trifle than a Tuscan one (which is flatter I believe)."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"This is my first dessert cookbook and I love it!

The recipes are fabulous and so are the pictures! It's even fun to sit down and just look at it - and think of what you are going to make next time you want dessert. Everyone who has tried the things I've made has loved them. This book is very creative, with lots of very interesting and good ideas and ways to add that extra-special touch to your creations. And - by looking at the pictures you would think that these recipes were very difficult and complicated, but they are NOT! If you can read, you can make anything in this book. Not one recipe we have tried (and we've made quite a few) has failed yet.There is the most delicious recipe in here for cream puffs! Everyone who has tried them has declared they are better than the famous, acclaimed cream puffs you get at the Wisconsin State Fair! The Baklava is also delicious, as well as the coffee angel food cake and the little tiny cookies called \\"Sweet and spicy Peppernuts.\\" (No nuts in them, but they do have pepper! Great taste! They are just as small as nuts - you make them the size of a 1/8 teaspoon. The batter mixes up so quickly that it doesn't make it take a terribly long time in the long run to form all these tiny little balls, and they taste so good that it's worth it!)I highly recommend this cookbook to everyone who loves dessert! There is something for everyone - Cakes, Pies, Cookies, Frozen desserts, and the wonderful feast for the eyes as well as the mouth: Special desserts. You will love this book!"},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"The illustrations are enough to motivate even the most reluctant cook.

How many can you say that you actually use more than once. I've owned this book for many years and when I am looking for a \\"no brainer\\" to make dessert, I grab this book first. I have made so many of the desserts in this book, each one has come out excellent, exactly like the picture shows. The full color pictures make it a breeze. This is the perfect book to give to everyone you know.

Perfect for the first timer."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"I bought this book for the extremely helpful pictures! Not only do they show the final product, but they also show many of the individual steps.It's a great book for beginning chefs, and I think that on the whole, the recipes are OK and the presentation could use a little work, but I'm overall very pleased. The pages are thick and the paper is of high quality."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"I bought this book beacause of the beautiful chocolate cake on the cover ( I am a card carrying chocoholic). As I flipped through the book, I realized that each recipe had at least one picture of the finished product. Several had multiple pics essentially visually walking you through the recipe prossess.The recipes that I tried were simple; I made the Peach Custard Pie and the Bannana Souffle'. The crust for the pie was so simple to make and tasted exellent. The recipes also seem to work with improvisation; the peaches I bought for the pie were not sweet or tasty and they were hard, so I cooked them down in a sugar sauce to make them taste good, and the pie still turned out well. I also did that to the bannanas for the souffle' will wonderful results.This book has tips on garnishing, basic dessert sauces, deorating, crusts, and different types of dough, basic frostings, basic cake recipes, the best time of year to buy fruits. I could go on, but this review would be two pages long.There are also some semi-homeade recipes in here also.I will take away one star because the useful hints are in a separate section in the back of the book and not with the recipe that you are using. I would reccomend that you review the section in the back before baking, and if there is anything that you need to know, you can read it at that time."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"This book has desserts in almost every category you can think of (cakes, pies, cookies, tarts, mousses, fruit, frozen...) and pictures for every one of them. There are step-by-step instructions for both the recipes and special serving tips (how to make chocolate butterflies, for instance). The back has a section on basic skills, equipment, and recipes, and an index to all of the desserts. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to cook or eat... especially sweets."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"My 10 year old son brought this book home from the school library and we've had a great time trying several of the recipes. There is a big range of desserts and we've gotten lots of compliments on what he's made!"},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"I was searching for a cookbook mostly focused on desserts for a family friend. She is recently learning how to cook so I wanted to get her something with lots of picture to make everything clear for her. I've found this book, I own a good housekeeping step by step cookbook. Initially I thought this book probably doesn't have enough pictures per recipes (because step by step didn't have it) but I was wrong. I saw almost all recipes came with at least one picture and often multiple pictures to show you step by step process (like a true step-by-step book). In addition, the desserts were very sophisticated and the book covered wide range of topics. Now I'm thinking about buying myself one copy.If you are still skeptical you can take a peek on google books, it'll sure change your mind (too bad Amazon doesn't have an inside look for this book).Edit: Now that I actually have a hard copy, I must say how truly amazing book it is. The sneak Peek I had from online doesn't do justice. It's much better than that. The presentations were cleaverly done yet very doable. I often find myself saying, why didn't I think of that earlier. This book deserves more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"I admit I was sceptical when getting this book, but I have yet to be disappointed! Clearly written recipes, accessible ingredients, beautiful pictures for every dessert you can imagine. No, this is not French pastry quality, not does it pretend to be.

My favorite so far is the sour cream peach streusel pie, but I'm sure a lot more will follow after I try more."},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"this book is amazing!it has sooooo many different desserts u can make, and has pictures for every single recipe, which is important for me to know what i'm making is supposed to look like!I'd definitely recommend this book, it is a must have for people who love 'la dolce vita'!I'm getting hungry from just thinking about the desserts in this book!!!!have fun bakin'!"},{"Title":"Good Housekeeping Illustrated Book of Desserts","review":"This is one of my favorite cooking books of all time!!

My own kids called me Mom for years, especially when they wanted a \\"Mom\\" thing. It took them several years to break themselves of the habit because I never disabused them of what they called me--either Mom or Dad would be just fine. This book is one of the finest stories of a gay man who understands himself, his world, the limitations that it would put upon him, and how he must become his \\"own man\\" in order to truly find fulfillment and happiness. Woven throughout the story are his religion, his concept of family, and certainly his place in a complicated world. As the author of an autobiography that carries much of the angst that this story embodies (See: Worth the Room: An Autobiography of Survival and Service, iUniverse 2004) I can promise the reader a book that will not be put down easily. Read it!"},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I read Quinn's \\"Metes and Bounds\\" last year and loved it. I was looking forward to \\"Back Where He Started\\" and wasn't disappointed. I LOVED this book. I felt like I was the main character (Chris Thayer)throughout the entire novel. A well written story with some tragedy, hurt, healing and finally love. I can hardly wait to read Jay Quinn's next novel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn has a gift for creating three-dimensional characters who become so visual on the written page that they seem like people out of a scrapbook from our own past. He tells a story that keeps our interest in a page-turning mode until the conclusion and along the way he manages to render some very fine prose and metaphors and always encourages us to become involved not only in his story but in some self-introspection.BACK WHERE HE STARTED is a tale of a poor kid Chris who happens to be attractive and whose life changes when he meets the Man of his Dreams Zack, a man whose is recently widowed and is left to raise three children - Trey, Andrea and Schooner. For 22 years Chris and Zack have a near perfect 'marriage' and while Zack continues his successful profession, Chris becomes the mom to the kids. When Zack abruptly ends his relationship with Chris in favor of marrying his pregnant associate Alicia, Chris' life turns upside down and he is faced with losing everything - despite the fact that Zack has provided for Chris' life monetarily under the guardian ship of Trey, the oldest son.Chris mourns then rages at his new single status, but with the complete support of his well-raised children he takes a big breath and begins a life alone. In time he meets Steve, a hero with a big heart and a passion for the sea and the land around where Chris has relocated - the beach of Emerald Isle off North Carolina. Steve and Chris eventually bond and are accepted by Steve's extended family and Chris' children and begin a second life together. Along the way we meet Chris' friends - a psychiatrist and his wife who provide work for Chris, the Catholic priest of the parish, Chris' children's mates including a touching 'coming out' of Chris' youngest son Schooner for whom Chris provides a loving atmosphere for the pairing, Chris' decorator friend, the local vet, etc. Chris and Steve weather a hurricane that not only secures their bond but also leads to open windows on each other's lives.It is refreshing to read Jay Quinn. He avoids most of the melodrama that can seep into a tale of this sort and he manages to provide a manual about family and parenting that is as sound as to be found in any book. Some quirks can become wearing - for some reason Quinn's constant emphasis on smoking borders on a commercial for cigarettes and in a time when smoking is a proven medical problem it is not only not additive to the story (must everyone smoke?) but also mildly annoying. This reader kept expecting some revelatory sidebar of having one of the characters die of lung cancer!But small issues aside, BACK WHERE HE STARTED continues Quinn's reputation as a fine writer of well molded and deeply felt fictional novels and just makes us eager for the next one! Highly recommended. Grady Harp, June 05"},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"As a gay guy who lives near the setting of the book (Jacksonville, Onslow County, NC), it was great reading about local spots. The locals are very much like those in the book...outwardly conservative with a liberal streak.\\"Chris\\" is a wonderful character. I felt a kinship with him immediately. As a gay Catholic, I wish I had his faith. He's a well-rounded character I've been looking for (in a book & in a partner).The only quip I had with the book was that I was surprised at the abrupt ending. I would've loved to have seen an \\"Epilogue\\" about where \\"Chris\\" and \\"Steve\\" were a year or two down the road.Thank you Jay Quinn for a great summer read. I'm a devoted fan now."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"This novel seemed like such a good idea. Maybe it just tried to take on too much--aging, religion, abandonment, gay parenting, homophobia, loss of a pet, loss of homes, biological and created families, starting over, gay marriage, bisexuality, pregnancy--and so it didn't go deeply enough into any one of those things. Everything ended up being too easy, which would be fine in a book that was written with a lighter tone, but this clearly wasn't meant to be a light read and has no humor. Although the way everyone seems to always end up dressed in someone else's underwear is unintentionally (I guess?) amusing.What put me off the most was the feminization of Chris, not a good thing when all of the biological females in the book are one-dimensional. Chris is a MAN, and a man can be just as nurturing and appealing if he's not constantly called \\"mom\\" or treated like something less than his lovers (Zach and Steve).And the dialogue never rang true, especially when Steve and Chris lapsed into what I assume is supposed to be \\"working class\\" dialect, but was never consistent.The themes of the book are all good; the story just didn't do them justice by finding neat little solutions for everything."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"So ... imagine that you're a 40-something gay man who just spent the last 22 years raising your partner's kids. You just get the last one off to college and your husband suddenly announces that he's running off to marry his (female) secretary. You have no job and basically no job skills except changing diapers and cleaning scraped knees.Interesting premise for a book, no? (And notice there isn't one crystal snorting LA screenwriter to be found! What a pleasant change of pace for gay fiction.) The main character, Chris Thayer attempts to rebuild his life after having his house and home snatched away from him by his husband's midlife crisis. He buys a beach house (with the palimony agreement his former husband sets up), buys some furniture, gets a job, a new church, a new dog, and a new, younger boyfriend. All that within a year or so.\\"Back Where He Started,\\" is what I would call a \\"beach read.\\" These are books that I consider not necessarily bad, but are just shallow enough to be enjoyed while baking in the sun, listening to your iPod, and admiring the scenery at a Lake Michigan beach.The premise is indeed interesting, but the characters and the execution are all a little unbelieveable. The book is set in North Carolina, and though I don't know very much about the state, I know this: that's where Jessie Helms is from. How is it then that everyone, from his employer, to his priest, to the entire extended family of his new boyfriend absolutely loves this man? Other than two annoying kids who spraypaint his house, he seems to have the perfect life, and sets it up in under a year.After 22 years of marriage, he simply starts over. Quickly. Oh, and he gets to have mindblowing sex (every time) with some young fisherman, who turns into his new boyfriend.The book does have a few points to make about being a real individual inside of a marriage and how we define and decide our roles within those marriages. But for the most part, it's just a light book that you might enjoy while sunning yourself over in Saugatuck, P-Town, or whatever beach you frequent.If you're really looking for an interesting book that deeply examines relationships between men, I might suggest \\"Comfort and Joy\\" by Jim Grimsley, or \\"Separate Rooms\\" by Pier Vittorio Tondelli."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Indeed it is difficult to find books written that reflects my age group, my experiences and my present time of life. It gives me hope that at my \\"mature age\\" that life does go on after 40. Too many times, authors write for the teenage and young adult age group and not for my own (39+). Thank you Mr. Quinn for writing a truly enjoyable book, one that I identifed with, one that I will treasure for many a year to come and which is a personal classic.Please continue to write for the older reader. If anyone knows of any well written books where the main character is 40+ and it is a well written, realistic book then let me know at [...] - DC."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I finished \\"Back where he started\\" in a day. I find it absorbing and ultimately uplifting. I do not know why but Chris reminds me of an older Tiger from \\"Metes and Bounds \\" even though they are 2 totally different persons. I love the character of Tiger and was disappointed that he was not the protagonist of \\"Metes and Bounds\\". The beginning of \\"Back where he started\\" is captivating and simply tugs at my heart. How do you cope when your spouse wishes to kick you out after you have given 22 years of your life to him and his family? It is already hard in a man-woman relationship. It's even more so in a gay marriage which is not sanctioned by law or church. Chris' predicament is heartbreaking. Luckily Quinn did not fall into the easy trap of the typical gay romance tragedy. Chris managed to pick himself up. He retained the love and respect of his \\"children\\". He found a job and even love. Does it sound sappy, like some reviews claim ? Not so for me. Life is already depressing enough. I wish to secure a bit of cheer from fiction and \\"Back where he started\\" definitely meet my expectation and more. It is a rewarding experience to read that a 48 year old gay man could have a fresh start and find happiness despite all the odds. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn tells us on every page, through the character of Chris, what a great mom he is, how pretty he is, how good his butt is, how he did the best he could, sacrifice, martyrdom and constant constant self congratulatory rhetoric. I found the concept of the story fascinating, but the writing sophomoric and its purpose to make everyone else in the book secondary to the greatness and grace of Jay Quinn. The dialogue is completely unrealistic and comes off silly. Mr. Quinn should never take up screenwriting. I had to keep reading just to laugh out loud every time he had another character tell him how fabulous he was. It gets ridiculous. It is a surface novel which screams 'love me' at the top of its lungs. I kept imagining one of Charles Busch's characters saying his lines. It's that corny. Too bad. If he weren't so wrapped up in himself and his need for approval, Jay Quinn might allow himself to go deeper and actually turn out to be a good writer."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I didn't. The story seemed interesting, but I just didn't like the writing-and a lot of it didn't ring true, many of the things the characters said sounded false, and 'written', not like anything an actual person would say-especially the exchange between the main character and his ex's wife-it all seemed phony-while the story arc was entertaining, none of it seemed real. So overall, not recommended."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"In seeing the possibility of gay marriage or civil partnerships becoming a reality, Jay Quinn has written a novel imagining a common scenario which breaks down many traditional heterosexual marriages. Chris Thayer has been performing the typical maternal duties of a housewife with a man and his three children for twenty two years. Now that the children have grown and departed, the \\"husband\\" leaves Chris for a younger woman. It is a novel whose central character is a gay man, but it is atypical in that he is not at odds with his family. Instead, his family is his life. Chris is also a devote Catholic who is able to situate himself comfortably within his church and community while still being completely open about his sexuality. Over the course of the novel, he embarks on a journey to discover his own self-worth both within and without his family. Refreshing, uplifting and surprisingly sexually explicit without being pornographic, BACK WHERE HE STARTED is a thoroughly engaging read. Jay Quinn is one of those rare writers who can express real optimism in a novel, offering happiness to his characters while making you feel that it is truly deserved."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Back Where He Started is an admirable book about desertion and mid-life crisis. Having moved out of a long term relationship into the dating scene myself in my mid 40s, I can testify that it is scary and difficult. Quinn captured this feeling of dispossession and uncertainty very well. The fact that faith was an anchor during a turbulent storm was totally acceptable and credible to me.However, this book suffers a bit from its good intentions. Like too many gay novels, Chris (the hero) leads an almost charmed life. Almost immediately after leaving his home in Raleigh and moving to the NC coast, he meets a perfect man after making a snap decision to turn into a vet's office. He moves from the vet to the tender-hearted, sincere and very sexy redneck vet assistant. Come on! I wish life was that perfect and easy. What happened to all the less-than-perfect men that one meets on the road to recovery?So, in retrospect, Mr. Quinn has written a novel about a difficult time in life. The novel is well written and a fun read. It includes some great sex without being at all pornographic. But it is still, at heart, flawed by its lack of realism."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I admit I was only able to get to about page 100 before giving up on this well meaning but--for me at least--boring book. I like the fact that the protagonist is over 40 and the story is not set in a big city, but I didn't particularly like or care much about any of the characters in the book--which is problematic in a book where the characters (to paraphrase Jon Lovitz as Harvery Fierstein) just want to be loved.I agree with a lot of the negative criticism in other reviews: the main character just seemed too feminine, the dialogue was unrealistic and a lot of the catholic stuff was just off putting.The plot also was way too obvious in many places; for example, when Chris is so worried what the priest will say to him, how can there be any doubt the priest will surprise him and be great?The main reason this all bothers me, and why I'm writing this review, is that I think the author has some talent. All that potential is just wasted in this silly, dull book."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I admit to be a fan of Jay Quinn. His writing is excellent and you do get the feel of being at the beach!Quinn knows how to tell the tale of rejection, moving on, connecting with the family, forgiveness, and looking toward the future. He remembers to tell the reader that everyone in your life is family, in one way or another.I look forward to reading more of Jay Quinn's novels. \\"Back Where He Started\\" is a great follow up to \\"Metes and Bounds\\"."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I am shocked and disappointed that several reviewers have allowed their anti-religion or anti-sex-roles prejudice to cloud their judgement of this absolutely wonderful, eminently readable, extraordinarily moving novel. I am not a Catholic nor do I have a particularly strong faith, however the depiction of Chris as a devout Catholic who understands the failings of his church and prays for the mistakes it makes touched me deeply. Jay Quinn has said that he wanted to show a gay man of faith in a positive way, and should not be docked points because of a reader's bad experiences with the church or lack of religious faith. In the same way, it reveals more about a reviewer's narrow-mindedness than it does anything else when he criticizes the fact that Chris sees himself as a \\"wife\\" and nurturer of his children. Not every gay man has to be \\"versatile.\\" So what if there are times when the admittedly annoying and even offensive question \\"Who's the husband? Who's the wife?\\" happens to be true? If you can't accept that there are gay men who feel comfortable in this role, get over it!Back Where He Started tells a story that is truly unique to gay fiction, that of a middle aged gay man with grown children he has raised facing the same kinds of problems at the end of a long term relationship that straight people experience, but which are rarely if ever depicted in gay novels. I was profoundly moved by Chris's relationships with his children, especially his adult gay son Schooner. I was thrilled by his rediscovery of love, and turned on (and moved) by the sex (which Quinn somehow manages to make both deeply erotic and deeply romantic). The book brought me to tears many times, but they were tears of joy.If I have one criticism, it is that all the characters smoke. I realize that this novel is set in South Carolina, and not in California where I am from and where only 1/4 of the adult population smoke, but it disturbed and disappointed me that every one of the intelligent and educated people in this novel do something so stupid and life-threatening and truly unnecessary as the smoking habit is.But I won't allow my own strong feelings about this matter to lower my 5 star rating. People are not perfect, and I can't expect the protaogists of the fiction I read to be. This novel, however, is about as close to perfect as I can imagine a novel to be.I highly recommend it to gay readers who want a different kind of gay novel, and to straight readers who may not understand that being gay is about who we love and the families we form, and not just about sex."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"It's good to read a gay-themed novel where the charcters are not 25 to 40 years old, living in a gay mecca and fabulously gorgeous and successful. The story is nicely paced, although the first half is far more engaging than the second.Reading the book requires a certain suspension of disbelief, however. I live in the south and have spent much time on NC's Outer Banks, and I regret to report that the social and familial tolerance and warm-fuzziness that abounds in the story does not exist as it's pictured -- by any means. You just don't find it in such abundance in real life -- especially there. This is fiction so you just let go of that, but there were times when I found it so sappy and cloying that I ended up skimming over large passages. (I felt the same sort of thing when I saw the film \\"Big Eden,\\" where nearly every character of every stripe is pulling for the gay protagonist -- a situation which would never exist in a million years in reality.)That said, it's nonetheless an entertaining read even if it's not great \\"lit-tra-chah.\\" I did find tons of typos, which I often see in Alyson publications. They need to hire more thorough proofreaders.This is one I'll pass along to a friend rather than retain in my own library. It's a half-step above being a \\"beach read,\\" but, for me, not a keeper."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn has given us characters that seem real and full of life. The premise is out of the ordinary for the typical gay novel, but is handled very, very well.After 22 years of being the husband of Zack and \\"mother\\" to his children, Chris finds himself replaced. The story of his new life and his relationship with his \\"children\\" forms the basis of the book. I hate it when reviews give away plot points and story details, so I refuse to do that. Just know that it evolves beautifully and makes you wish that these were people you could visit with frequently.Read it - you'll be very glad you did."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn's latest novel, \\"Back Where We Started\\", is good for the soul -- it provides, at least for a few moments, an escape from the current \\"culture war\\" battles that take up so much media time and space in our country. Quinn creates a place where good triumphs over evil, where honesty trumps lies, and where people are judged by actions rather than labels -- in short, a place that is far more imaginary than real. But on a long hot summer day, an imaginary place is just where I want to be.\\"Back Where We Started\\" is unlikely to win a prize for originality. With the exception of the gay theme, it follows a familiar formula: jilted lover moves away to start life anew. Enter hunky (but sensitive) local stud, nurturing friends and presto -- healing, revelation and a new (and better)life. Also, Quinn's writing can sometimes detract from the moment. The use of colloquial language is inconsistent and often inappropriate. This is especially true when applied to the main character Chris, whose best moments are often diminished by a need to bring out a \\"white trash\\" element in his speech. That is too bad, because the story is largely one of growth and personal acceptance for this character; who, after 22 years in the tony Oakwood District of Raleigh, NC, is unlikely to be spouting backwoods dialogue.However, the biggest distraction in this novel is its poor editing. The amount of typos, grammatical errors and mixed sentences get in the way of the author's flow and hamper the storyline on many occassions. Alyson Books should be ashamed.Why then four stars? Quite simply, because Quinn is a great storyteller and this is a story I want to believe."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"This was a terrific read. I hadn't read a Jay Quinn novel before, but I will most definitely read additional titles soon, I have already purchased \\"The Beloved Son.\\" This book was so enjoyable as the author chose a plot none like I have ever read in a novel of this genre. Our lead character , Chris, falls in love with Zack (a recently widowed bi-sexual man) who has three children. When Zack and Chris (a young gay man) come together, Chris becomes the surrogate Mom to Zacks kids, to the extent where they refer to Chris as Mom. Lo and behold after twenty-two years of being together, Zack begins a relationship with a woman and leaves Chris to start a new life. Zack's kids so love Chris that they lean towards supporting Chris in his new life rather than their father in his. The novel is a true study of family relationships. There are lots of emotional moments throughout the novel(it choked me up several times, and that rarely ever happens to me). Anyway, I loved this book. I read it while in Hawaii and my partner read it immediately afterwards, he loved it as well and together we highly recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned the fact that the constant mentioning of the Roman Catholic church is distracting, I urgently disagree. I believe that Mr. Quinn referred to the Catholic church so often is because it is part of Chris Thayer's nature and character. It is a part of Chris, an important part that helped shape him as a human. Why not refer to it since it makes Chris who he is?I also would like to state that the plot was awesome, it provided me with a vision of yes, a gay man can find happiness later on in life and attain a dream - a loving relationship. Being later on in my years - though I am still younger than the character Chris (haha) - it privided me with hope, reassurance, and vindication to wait for the perfect person for me.Thank you Jay Quinn for writing an insightful, often funny, often sad, but refreshing novel. For all you purists out there, I try not to give away any of the plot in my reviews - allow the reader to judge the book after they read it."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Here's why \\"Back Where He Started\\" matters: We need novels that remind us of our spirit. Unlike many gay novels, the protagonist of \\"Back Where He Started\\" is older, has raised a family, and goes to church. Quinn reminds us that life can throw us a curve ball at any minute, yet it's the important things like family and spirit which sustain us through those moments and help us move forward. That said, \\"Back Where He Started\\" is far from a heavy read. I found it to be charming, witty, romantic, and highly engaging. Chris's struggle to start over both touched and inspired me."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Although I understand where some people are coming from with their 'disappointed' reviews, and I missed the apparent typos(thank goodness) I still found this an engaging, swift moving and at times, a highly emotional read-and I finished it in a couple of days, very satisfied, even if the ending was a bit over the top.Perhaps this is a book for the romantic escapist, not a reader who wants a reality check. In a film, Myrna Loy's character says(and I paraphrase), \\"Who says movies should be more like life? I think life should be more like the movies.\\"I think life should be more like this book."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"For someone like me, who had to start over in his late forties, this book has a strengthening and moving power -- all the more so since I am still in the process of that start-over in my late fifties! I found this a compelling book, with a nice mixture of drama, humor and sex. Yes, some scenarios were too good to be true, but I subscribe to the poet William Wordsworth's idea of a willing suspension of disbelief. The book brought me to tears that had been building up within me. The ending was masterful. In addition, some of the imagery was truly poetic, requiring re-reading and pondering. This book gives a whole new take on the idea of motherhood and family. I look forward to reading other of Jay Quinn's books. One word to the publisher, though: there seemed to be some typos that need to be corrected."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn's writing has certainly deteriorated from \\"Metes and Bounds\\" (2001) to this book. OK, \\"Metes\\" had some flaws, but it didn't blatantly advertise for silly stereotypes such as \\"husband and wife\\" or \\"top and bottom\\" role-playing in a male2male/gay/whatever you call it longterm partnership and wasn't written like a Rosamunde Pilcher novel (although Ms. Pilcher is certainly a nice lady, but her novels are written for ladies wanting to read a book full of romance and stuff)!"},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"As in his novel METES AND BOUNDS Jay Quinn has written another story where much of the action takes place at the North Carolina shores. At 48 the narrator Chris Thayer, when we meet him, is packing up his things and moving out of a fine home in Raleigh after living 22 years with the same man, one Zack Ronan, after having raised his three children. In fact, Chris is the only \\"mom\\"-- that's what two of the grown children call him from time to time and the other one Schooner calls him all the time-- these children have ever known. Zack's wife had committed suicide just after the baby Schooner was born.Mr. Quinn seems to say that gay children have no more hangups growing up in a household with two men than do those who are raised in straight homes. We know that psychological studies bear that out. What all children need is love and acceptance of which Chris has plenty of both to offer. The novel has a lot going for it. Mr. Quinn understands the way some of these people speak and gets the language right. Someone is as \\"sharp as a tack.\\" Another person would \\"talk to a stump.\\" Someone else is no \\"bigger than a minute.\\" The book is quite a page turner and you'll genuinely like most of the characters. (All right. You proably won't care for Zack, who for the most part is a real cad, and his therapist daughter, seeped in psychobabble, can get a little tedious.)My problem with this book is that parts of the plot and some of the characters are somewhere way beyond the rainbow. With the exception of two stupid juveniles who are bad spellers, homophobia is practically nonexistent-- and this in the state that gave the world Jesse Helms. There is not an AIDS case within a thousand miles. Chris attends a nice Catholic church where the priest is totally accepting of his \\"lifestyle\\"-- for lack of a better word-- and has books by Bill Moyers and Bishop John Spong although Father Fintan confesses that he has not read everything in his library. The sex between Chris-- \\"Little Bit\\"-- and his macho \\"husband\\" Steve whom he calls \\"Big Man\\" is beyond description every time. Everyone at a family reunion Steve takes Chris to is completely okay with Steve and his \\"wife\\" and some of them, including an aging matriarch, say so. A more believable scenario would have been the \\"don't ask; don't tell\\" version where country folk love a male relative's \\"roommate\\" but never say aloud what everyone knows about the relationship. Finally, I do not believe that any woman whose husband drives a pickup truck-- I grew up in East Tennessee and think I understand such an animal-- is \\"praying\\" for her youngest son to be gay.Certainly we've come a long way since THE LORD WONT MIND and CITY OF NIGHT and it's refreshing to see Schooner and his lover Frank go off to Massachusetts to get married-- the time is post 9/11 and just before the last Presidential election. But surely this North Carolina unfortunately does not exist anywhere outside the pages of this novel. Oh that it did."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"\\"Tell me, Zack. Am I just half of a person? Do I need a man to make me whole? Or am I just a piece of ass that needs plugging to operate like a housekeeper and a mother?\\" Poor Chris Thayer, a conservative Catholic from a white trash background, gets the short end of the stick in every way when his boyfriend of 22 years, Zack, dumps him for a younger woman.Chris retreats to a fabulous beach house in the Southern Outer Banks of North Carolina, where everyone loves him. He attempts to heal his broken pride by taking a job answering the phone, while proving to Zack's three grown children that he will always be there for them. Trey, the oldest, becomes Chris' personal investment banker. I thought that was a nice touch. The book keeps you interested in how Chris will find love again. At first I thought he was going to be happy with Heath, the handsome vet who helps him deal with the pain of losing his dob, Beau. But that was not to be. A little later on, Chris buys a new dog from a handsome guy called Steve, a good ten years younger and 100 pounds bigger than tiny little wizened Chris. Jay Quinn succeeds in writing for us sort of a gay, upscale version of Douglas Sirk's 50s masterpiece ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS with Chris as Jane Wyman, reduced to life on the shelf without her husband, and Steve is Rock Hudson, the outdoorsy, Thoreau loving extrovert who makes her feel like a woman, to the shock of her grown children. If you've ever seen ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS, nothing here will surprise you, but I realize having read the whole book that Quinn is not interested in surprise or even conflict. He wants to show a commmunity in which a gay man can express maternal feelings and be praised for it by just about everyone within shouting distance. People complain about the Catholicism, but come on, it's just there to build up Chris' character and to show why he is the type of motherly guy that he is. My chief difficulty with the story is its sometimes inane dialogue. You will not have heard lines like this since the heyday of Carole Bayer Sager:\\"I looked at him and said, 'Big man. You great big-hearted man, where did you come from to sew up my heart and make me believe in love again?'\\"The compliments people give Chris come faster and faster, till by the end of the book they're on the average of six or seven in a page, sometimes in a single paragraph. Everybody loves Chris."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"The atheists and secularists among us will probably turn after reading Southern writer Jay Quinn's overly melodramatic, but gorgeously written novel, Back Where We Started. Steeped in unapologetic and unrepentant histrionics, the story tells of Chris Thayer, a middle-aged, and severely religious gay man, who remakes his life in profound ways. But this isn't just your normal tale of mid-life self-discovery, because Quinn, in creating Chris, has written such a thoughtful, deep, and reflective character that most readers when they finish the book will be left with a weighty sense that they have just met someone very special. The author imbues Chris, with almost saint-like and iconographic sensibilities; he's easily the most complex, adorable, and multi-and faceted \\"Mum\\" one is ever likely to meet.Weaving the powerful themes of gay marriage, love and family, parenting, and endurance through faith, Quinn shows what can happen when years of investment in a life that you thought was stable and steadfast can be suddenly pulled out from under you. Chris has been leading a happy, contented life, but after twenty-six years his long-term \\"marriage\\" to his partner Zack Ronan is finally over. Having raised Zack's three children and supported him through his highflying career, Zack, ambitious and selfish, has reverted to the other side of his bisexual nature and has married his secretary, who is now pregnant.Coming from working class roots a housing project in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Chris is the epitome of a self-made, self-educated man, who following the suicide of Zack's wife, stepped in and sacrificed most of his adult life to raise and be a mother to Zack's three children, Trey, Schooner, and Andrea. The kids spent their lives affectionately call him \\"Mum\\" and doting him just as much has he spoiled and doted on them. Chris is of course, absolutely devastated at Zack's abandonment. He hears his life \\"rushing ahead to its conclusion without him\\" and given a choice he doubted he'd ever have moved on.Determined to maintain his dignity and composure, and armed with the trust fund that Zack has set up for him, Chris begins to face the second act of his life. But the fund won't support him forever, so Chris needs to get a job, and also find a new place to live. Life does go on and Chris relocates to North Caroline beach community of Emerald Isle, eventually settling into the beach house purchased from part of the proceeds of the sale of the abode he adoringly shared with Zack for all those years. His new home brings with it lots of new and exciting experiences, and his constant positive outlook and his deep and spiritual faith constantly keeps him buoyant and optimistic.Chris steadily becomes involved with the life of the community, eventually finding a job and becoming involved with the patchwork lives of his neighbors: a young husband-and-wife psychiatric couple expecting their first child, the local Catholic Church priest, a hunky, affable veterinarian, and an even more hunky rowdy, rough diamond fisherman. We watch him steadily growing into something new, \\"someone that belongs more to him.\\"As Chris embarks on his journey of self-discovery, he self-reflects on the life that has gone before and what had made him willing to abandon his own career - his own self - to a man and his motherless brood. He bought into the myth, and tried to live a life of an upwardly mobile mommy with three perfect kids, a handsome and affluent husband, and a properly genteel giant of a hunting dog. It was all an artifice. And it was Zack, after all, that had thrown it all away. But with his new home, Chris soon learns that seeds of love sewn in youth can create wonderful results when nurtured properly. His marriage to Zack bought out Chris's role as a \\"mother\\" and it's not surprising that he retains the lion's share of the children's loyalty, and the realization that his children are his life's work, the part of his journey towards self-acceptance.As an exploration of what it means for a gay man to be middle-aged and rolling with the punches, Back Where He Started is truly groundbreaking. But the story is also inventive for it's depiction of Chris's faith - it doesn't present his ardent Catholicism in any conflicted way; he's neither blindly accepting of the church's many flaws, nor is he radicalized out of his connection to it, but rather he is searching within it.This gorgeously written story is most notable for it's depiction of family. For good or ill, family forms us all, gay and straight. The family depicted in this novel is hardly perfect: They're contentious and arguable, they harbor hurts and bad memories, and they also have pet resentments. But they fundamentally love each other. As their loyalties shift, their emotional needs also shift and change, but Chris is always at their center, constantly remaking and nurturing them. This is a very traditional, conventional human story, yet also one that is absolutely extraordinary.

I started reading on the plane and the time flew by, pun intended. After arriving, I found that I couldn't put the book down, and because of the time change, I stayed up late at night reading chapter after chapter, somehow hoping that things would work out for Chris. He put his life on hold to raise someone else's children, and denied himself personal growth that most achieve by interacting with the world at large. I would liken this novel to a feel good movie- after reading, you have a smile on your face and it is a welcome break from the real world, where life just doesn't work out so neatly and lovely. Be advised that at times, one has to suspend reality while reading this book because too many things work out just too perfectly. But this is a great work of fantasy, for how things could be, good versus evil, turning the other cheek, moving on after a failed relationship, etc. Chris was a pretty pathetic person in the beginning and at times I wasn't sure if I wanted to hug him or slap him. One thing is for sure, no matter what your personal viewpoints are, Chris will do or say many things that will annoy you! But his viewpoints make the reader think about a number of issues and justify his position.The one reviewer who didn't care for the book must have been younger....those of us who are 40-or-more something grew up in a different era, where people who were \\"that way\\" were only talked about in hushed whispers, if at all. The old attitude in the south was that there are no gay people and if there are, polite people do not discuss such things, end of story. The universal acceptance, especially \\"down at the beach\\", is not a reality. But then again, when gay men take an all-gay cruise to be totally accepted, that isn't much of a reality either, only a temporary escape from the day to day grind of a life lived in the face of homophobia and ignorance. And when was the last time you saw a Hollywood movie or television show that had any semblance of reality?I was very fortunate to have met the author on one occasion and he writes very much like he talks! He has a particular style of story telling that is very southern and engaging. I have read all his books, but I would imagine that non-southerners might have a tough time with some of the prose. I do admit that I encountered more typos and grammatical errors than I am accustomed to, but I also noticed that some of the sentences, upon a second read, were not really in error but were just colloquialisms or staccato speech of a very southern variety; it is up to the individual reader to decide if this manner of speech is charming or distracting. The smoking was a prevalent theme, however, this too is sadly another case of art imitating life, especially in the Carolinas. The religion was omnipresent, and I did feel like at least on some level, it represented a hidden anti-promiscuity agenda. And for straight readers, please take this book for what it is- a work of fiction about one man's journey; not all gay men are so easily swayed by a younger woman, although youth does have a strong appeal in some segments of the gay community. Also, not all gay men want to imitate the heterosexual marriage ideal of 2.5 children and a station wagon (even if the wagon happens to be a Mercedes or BMW). Chris is not ashamed of his sensitive, nurturing, feminine nature or his passive sexual proclivities any more than his butch lovers are ashamed of their own assimilated mannerisms. While some may say that this image perpetuates stereotypes, one has to remember that stereotypes exist because for some segment of a given population, the stereotypes hold true. I think the message to be taken from this novel is that everyone is different, with lives that revolve around different priorities and desires, and that life can drastically change in the blink of an eye and the strong adapt and grow. The book is full of symbols that seem to have been lost on some readers. For example, the dog's death also symbolized the final gasp of the 22-year \\"marriage\\". Some people become very attached to pets, and they really are part of the family.Visiting the outer Banks today, one would be hard pressed to find Chris' world of desolate beaches and barren barrier islands. The area still exists but has become overrun by tourons and transplants. From my experience, not even the hordes of transplants can change the limited viewpoint of the locals.I have read everything that Jay Quinn has published and enjoyed each and every work for its unique outlook and incorporation of southern sensibilities. The wide range of comments are a tribute to the author's talent and ability to be thought provoking. I anxiously await the next release from Jay Quinn."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"I really wanted to like this well-meaning tale of middle-aged man trying to rebuild his life after he's dumped by his boyfriend of twenty years for a Joan Collins character.

But the worst part of it is nothing happens. Nothing! Unless you count having Catholicism rammed down your throat by a bunch of one dimensional bores being terribly nice to one another. Then, to add insult to injury, in the final pages one character refers to the sex of her unborn twins by saying \\"one nice package and one tiny little t***.\\" I can't recall having ever read such an ill-judged and tasteless piece of imagery.I wish that, like the title character, I was back where I started - before I'd ever picked this up."},{"Title":"Back Where He Started: A Novel","review":"Finally, a story without young pretty boy twenty somethings with drug problems who live in the big city.

I wanted to identify and root for Chris - the middle-aged, gay character who is suddenly single after an almost 25-year relationship, but half-way through the book, Chris began to grate on my nerves. While the author creates and fleshes out some interesting characters and gives great attention to dialogue, the novel misses the boat in terms of conflict. Chris is too good and too loved by all - and he hardly struggles internally with being deserted by his partner, and having to start all over again; He manages to get back up on his feet a little too easily.The religious aspect of the book didn't bother me so much - it was refreshing to read about a gay character with a strong Catholic faith - I just found it far-fetched that Chris was accepted so easily by the priest he meets and the church he joins. (not to mention that the priest was able to find Chris a job so quickly).I admire Quinn's writing and I still would like to read his other works, but this particular novel is probably geared to those that like their stories conflict-free and happily tied up like a Lifetime Television Movie for Women."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"This book, written just after World War II, tries to explain what makes anti-Semitism attractive to anti-Semites, the effect of anti-Semitism on Jews, and the ultimate causes of anti-Semitism.In Sartre's view, \\"By treating the Jew as an interior and pernicious being, [the anti-Semite] affirm[s] at the same time that [he] belong[s] to the elite.\\" In other words, every person is a king so long as he/she has someone to look down upon. This seems like a perfectly plausible interpretation of mid-century antisemitism; it seems to me, however, that today's Arab Jew-hatred has more concrete causes.Sartre's description of Jews is a bit narrow. He writes that \\"the Jew considers himself the same as others. He speaks the same language; he has the same class interests, the same national interests; he reads the newspapers that the others read, he votes as they do, he understands and shares their opinions.\\" And according to Sartre, these \\"inauthentic\\" Jews seek to avoid any trace of \\"Jewish traits.\\"Perhaps an accurate description of the most assimilated Jews in France in the 1940s- but certainly not of more religious Jews, or even of most American Jews (though I do know some who seek to avoid overly \\"Jewish\\" physical traits). Few of Sartre's generalizations are true of (for example) the most insular Hasidic sects, and some are equally untrue as to America's more liberal Jews.Finally, Sartre argues that anti-Semitism is the result of capitalism and of social classes, because anti-Semites seek to unite the bourgeiousie and the proletariat. Given the existence of anti-Semitism in communist and precapitalist societies, this view seems to me implausible."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"I have read this book at least three times and I believe it provides some of the greatest insight into the jewish condition that has ever been committed to print. Sartre's understanding of the position of the jew in modern society is unparalled,as are his observations of the mind of the anti-semite. This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the true nature of the phenomenon of psychological anti-semitism within the context of modern society."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"90% of this book is great in examining the mindset of the anti-semite and the Jew that wants to assimilate but can't because of the anti-semite. Sartre is brilliant when he talks about the anti-semite's passion for the Jew (which explains why many anti-semites from Farrakhan to Christian Identity movements call themselves &quot;the real Jews&quot;), the assimilated Jew's overcompensation, the historical roots of anti-semitism, and the liberal democrat's damaging and weak defense of Jews on the basis of their common humanity at the expense of their Judaism (As the Napoleaonic position stated = &quot;To the Jew as a man everything, to the Jew as a nation nothing&quot;).Where the book fails is when Sartre tries to gauge the mindset of the Jew that doesn't want to assimilate and the mindset of the Jewish people as a whole. He claims that society makes Jews Jewish and that there is neither a national nor a religious identity holding them together. This was before Israel was a fact of life and when many Jews wanted to assimilate without a trace of guilt over the fact. Most of the Jews that he knows aren't particularly fond of the religious dimension of their lives and he reflects that. He is also erroneous when he characterizes an &quot;authentic&quot; Jew as someone who has thrown off universalism. Judaism believes in universalism but not at the expense of Chosen People status. Of course, what Sartre sees as a problem - Jews trying to assimilate but being pushed into being Jewish, Judaism sees as evidence of being a Chosen People.Sartre's ignorance about religious Judaism aside, this is still an excellent book in the cause of multiculturalism and pluralism. He argue that ultimately anti-semitism is not a Jewish problem but a problem in his native France and that as long as anti-Semitism exists, no one is secure. He takes 150 pages to make the argument and some of the roads he takes to get there are questionable but it's still an excellent book in that respect."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"There is an Anti- Semitic review in this page in which the following mistakes and errors are made. The writer of the review says that Sartre is Jewish. He is not and so far as I know none of his ancestors were Jewish. The Anti- Semitic reviewer says that the 'Torah teaches hatred of Gentiles' This is outrageous, and stupid. The Torah teaches that every human being is created in the image of God, and that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. The Torah teaches that every human being is of infinite value.As for the Sartre book Sartre does understand a great deal about the attitude of assimilated Jews. However he does not know or understand Jews whose Jewish identity is not formed by ' the other' but rather formed positively through belief in their own heritage.I too think that Anti- Semitism takes different forms at different times, and it is difficult to understand the present kind of radical fundamentalist Islamic anti- Semitism in the same terms as one understands the Anti-Semitism of the extreme left.But with all this there is the point that Sartre was fundamentally sympathetic to the Jewish people and to the sufferings caused by the evil of anti- Semitism."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"This book is an excellent study on some of the origins of hate. Although Sartre may have wished to examine more the role of socialization as the fundamental root of prejudice, he does a good job in exposing the numerous \\"sins of omission\\" in religion and the media in causing hate, in this instance, the horrors of the Holocaust. He does so also with extreme rhetorical skill when he asks, for example: \\"Why were the concentration camps not in the news\\"?, or when he speaks of \\"Christian propaganda that the Jews killled Jesus.\\" (It was the Romans.) Certainly, the world has advanced since then, (or so it seems) as evidenced in part by the late Pope John Paul II's apology for the role of Christianity in the Holocaust. And certainly that propaganda had nothing to do with what Christ taught, to do things for the \\"least of these\\" and to \\"love Thy neighbor.\\" We can still see I think some of these forces at work today, especially in regard to extreme poverty throughout the world. It is as if \\"class\\" has become a new \\"blind spot\\". Why do we rarely hear about the one billion (referred often to as the \\"bottom billion\\") who go to bed starving each night, making each day merely a struggle to survive? What is it about our educational system and the media, that seem to block out such atrocities? We need to change all that, so that our minds (and hearts) are more open to the struggles of so many in the world."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"Sartre's work is still a classic. His insights are provocative and pointed. I am especially impressed by his comments on what is now called universal human rights. Sartre is concerned that in stressing our common humanness we forget that there are important difference that should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"To the question, \\"Why be an antisemite,\\" Sartre answers: \\"Because it's fun!\\"Still, as this work shows, the thrill of destructive and irrational behavior has its consequences: no one is safe if Jews must fear for their lives.Perhaps the best part of the book is Sartre's characterization of antisemitic discourse. One might think that antisemitism is an opinion like any other. If it were, many antisemitic arguments would be logical, perhaps to explain why Jews are, as a people, just too different or too unhelpful to society at large, and explaining why something needs to be done about it. In addition, most antagonism to Jews would be the results of actual provocations.Sartre convincingly shows that the majority of antisemitic discourse is quite different, consisting instead of taunts and threats. \\"Never believe,\\" cautions Sartre, \\"that the antisemites are unaware of the absurdity of their replies.\\" It's all part of the fun, given that their adversaries are the ones who believe in words and thus oblige themselves to use words responsibly.This is a perceptive study and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"Imagine the value of a book on anti-Semitism composed by a non-Jew, a deep-thinker, a philosopher, a man living in France in 1944 during a period of fierce Jew hatred; imagine what ideas this book could impart. This is the value of Jean-Paul Sartre's short, but information-filled volume, his indictment of society.Characteristics of an anti-SemiteAn anti-Semite, Sartre explains in perhaps his most insightful insight, is an individual who hates Jews because he refuses to think. He is afraid of and threatened by thinking. Thinking requires the recognition that ideas change and grow. A thinking person never knows exactly what is true because he recognizes that ideas vanish like vapor; they develop and change as he gains new knowledge. But the anti-Semite needs to have an ossified never-changing world, a world set in stone, a stone that he can lean on, a stone that supports him, that holds him up. He cannot deal with knowing that what he understands today will change tomorrow.It is easier for him to blame the Jew for evil, and speak of ridding the world of Jews to remove the evil, than seeing the true problems of society, thinking how to resolve them, and working to do so. Vaguely, without real thought, for he is unable to define \\"evil\\" or \\"good,\\" he argues that the harmony of his life will be reestablished once the Jew is removed. His thoughts are vague and totally negative and destructive.His notion of Jews is not based on ideas; \\"it is...a passion.\\" Not only Jews, but even his conception of the world is based on passion. He has no real understanding of history and no real experience with Jews. His hatred is similar to irrational faith because he is \\"impervious to reason and to experience.\\"His passion disallows him to see anything good in the Jew. Just being a Jew, he feels, ruins the Jew and everyone around him. A Jew fowls everything that he does, even the air he breaths. When a Christian and a Jew work and create side by side and produce the same object, the Jew's production is tainted, infected, soiled, and besmirched, even though it looks, smells, and feels the same.The anti-Semite admits that the Jew is intelligent and hard-working; \\"he even confesses himself inferior in these respects.\\" But he thinks that his irrationality is better than the Jew's intelligence because it is not contaminated with Judaism. Thus, he needs the Jew so that he can feel better, more than mediocre.The origin of anti-SemitismThere is nothing in the history of any nation that justifies anti-Semitism. The ancient myth that Jews killed Jesus cannot, or should not, be the reason for modern anti-Semitism. The Romans crucified Jesus. Even if the myth is accepted, people should recognize that we cannot punish the current generation of Jews for deeds committed by a few two millennia in the past.Current anti-Semitism, Sartre insists, is based upon what Christianity did to the Jews. The Church forced Jews to become money lenders so that Christians could avoid the sin of usury. This bred the still-persisting notion that Jews have and control money and take advantage of non-Jews for personal gain.\\"It is society, not the decree of God, that has made him a Jew and brought the Jewish problem into being.... In this situation there is not one of us who is not totally guilty and even criminal; the Jewish blood that the Nazis shed falls on all our heads.\\"Other Sartre insightsSartre also discusses related subjects: What about people who are not anti-Semites but who do nothing to help Jews? These people, says Sartre, are not human beings, and may be unconscious anti-Semites. Are Jews a race? No, because Jews in different countries differ in looks and habits. What is a Jew? The Jew is what Christians have made him. What keeps Jews Jewish? Persecution and other bad treatment of Jews by non-Jews do not allow them the chance to forget being Jewish. What is Jewish history? Most Jews know little more of the history of Judaism than how their ancestors were persecuted. What has anti-Semitism done to the Jew's thinking and his behavior? Sartre spends half his book describing the many adverse ways that Jews have been affected. He adds that non-Jews have also been affected by not allowing Jews to contribute what they can to improve society.\\"What must be done,\\" the French philosopher ends his book, \\"is to point out to each one that the fate of the Jews is his fate. Not one Frenchman will be free so long as the Jews do not enjoy the fullness of their rights. Not one Frenchman will be secure so long as a single Jew - in France or in the world at large - can fear for his life.\\""},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"If Sarte himself could read these reviews he'd see them as a case in point for his entire book. Just look at the anti semetic comments on this very page. Oh, and Arabs might be semites, but the term Anti semitism has nothing to do with them. Get it now? We don't need to get into the ambiguity of the term, everyone knows what it means. This book is excellent a must read for anyone who wants to understand the mind of the anti-semite. Amazon should be ashamed for authorizing and publishing the hate found in the other reviews."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"This great understanding of hatred is truly a universal theme not limited to the Jew.Sartre's key point is that hatred is a creation of the hater not rooted in fact but an imaginary fantasy that gives the hater a sense of superiority over that which he hates.As he writes if no Jew exists the anti semite would need to create one. It is this creation of false myth, real or in fantasy, to give power to the anti semite that leads to mass hatred death camps,ongoing hatred.Sartre further states that once you hate one man it becomes natural then to hate all Jews or mankind.Anti Semites have a preconceived notion of a Jew even before meeting one ie: Jews all have horns.This passion is anti democratic and racist and does not permit the \\"other\\" to freely choose however he wishes to define himself since in Sartre's philosophy one is born into a state of nothingness till he freely creates and chooses an identity from objects and phenomena existing in outside reality.This book is not a statement on Jewish \\"superiority\\" , since Judaism never claims to be superior but a distinct worldview recognizing a creator and different roles for different nations.Hostile anti semitism theological, political, racial, economic and so on is often based on the conflict between universalism and parochialism.The Jew's uniqueness and aloofness is often a choosen path of protection from universalism. Universalism like hatred can also destroy Jewish continuity.Jewish choice is rooted in freedom of will and respect for all living beings. It is the triumph of individualism and group identity in the face of what Sartre calls the mediocre conforming mass unthinking man.Why Jew's continue to live as Jews is the key question.Are the doors of acceptance truly open? must Jews change and if so why?Sartre wrote this in the late 40's and fully understood the Nazi horrors. These days the question becomes one of promoting individual thinking rooted in diversity and respect for lifestyles different from the confirmist's simple and homogeneous uncomplicated simple view of reality.Studies now show that people are indeed born with genetic predispositions which throws questions on Sartre's tabula rasa."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"Jean-Paul Sartre wrote ANTI-SEMITE AND JEW shortly after World War II. Not surprisingly, it was the specific form of anti-semitism of the preceding years that formed the basis for the views and positions expressed in this book. Times have changed and the expression of anti-semitism has changed with it. We are now more likely to see virulent anti-semitism from Islamic rather than Christian societies and from the political left rather than the right. Yet many of Sartre's observations are relevant nonetheless with only a bit of tweaking to modernize them.Anti-semitism, according to Sartre, is not merely an opinion, but rather a stance towards the world and the society in which Jews live. In a passage relevant today, Sartre asserts that the existence of anti-semitism precedes any facts used to justify it. One cannot help but think of the excuse - and that is what it is - an excuse, of criticizing Israel over the occupied territories as a basis for anti-semitism. Yet Israel offered to return those territories in exchange for peace and was rebuffed. Clearly, Sartre's analysis should be with us still.Further, as the anti-semite adopts his stance in order to portray the Jew as a non-belonging Other, the anti-semite will rarely think or act on his own. Again, could this be more relevant today, in which one almost longs to hear critics of Jews making an original accusation, not out of any desire to further the prejudice, but for the more simple reason of hoping against hope that some pebble of originality might be seen in a prejudice that should long ago have hit the ash heap of history? But no, it is the same old, same old, time and time again.In contrast with the anti-semite, Sartre places the democrat. Some excellent points are made via this comparison. The democrat is a feeble defender of the Jew because, although the anti-semite hates the Jew as a Jew, the democrat defends the Jew on the more ambiguous grounds of being a man and a citizen. The democrat lacks the passion of the anti-semite, leaving the Jew with passionate enemies but only tepid defenders. It does not take a genius to figure out which side will make all the concessions and Sartre is correct when he argues that half of the battle against anti-semitism would be won if the friends of Jews brought the passion and perseverance to the cause as the anti-semite brings to his.Sartre is on his weakest grounds when he inappropriately advocates socialism as the answer to anti-semitism and he quickly devolves into inconsistencies. Sartre openly advocates laws that prohibit statements tending to bring discredit to any Frenchman, including Jews. But then, on the very next page, Sartre states that political action can never be used against the freedom of citizens! Often it is amusing to watch socialists flop over their own ideas and make fools of themselves. This humor is blunted, however, when it is presented not as pure theory but as a means to address a serious issue.Despite Sartre's misguided politics and abstract theorizing, his analysis of anti-semitism is still often spot on and still relevant to this day. Some of the statements one hears about Jews are nothing short of unbelievable and should be tackled head on. ANTI-SEMITE AND JEW is useful for such purposes."},{"Title":"Anti-Semite and Jew [Hardcover]","review":"I'm still not sure why he wrote this book or what his main point is. Perhaps its because I don't have a clear enough understanding of Satre, his background, or his era to grasp what he's trying to say in this work. I underlined various points that I thought might reveal a conclusive theme, but still am not convinced I've comprehended his point clearly.He talks about treatment of the Jews in different countries in various time periods. He says the Russian government considered the Jews in Russia and Poland to be unassimilable, but favored them as a means of stirring up dissention among the Polish people. As the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the first step, according to Satre, was to prohibit Jews from using the same swimming pools as everyone else.He affirms, what to me seems to be common sense and evident on his face, i.e., \\"there is no French truth or German truth; there is no Negro truth or Jewish truth. There is only one Truth, and he is best who wins it.\\" Although I'm not sure what he means by \\"winning it.\\""},{"Title":"101 Needlepoint Stitches and How to Use Them: Fully Illustrated with Photographs and Diagrams (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"This is a great and easy to use book by the extremely knowledgable needleworker, Hope Hanley.

The examples are clear, and include suggestions for best use. I like to suggestions about materials, canvas, and needles."},{"Title":"101 Needlepoint Stitches and How to Use Them: Fully Illustrated with Photographs and Diagrams (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"I bought this book because I am spending some time travelling away from home and far from my collection of embroidery books. I wanted a needlepoint (aka canvas embroidery or canvaswork) reference book that didn't cost too much or take up too much space.The book fulfills my needs. It has clear diagrams and useful instructions. However, if I were beginning canvaswork, or wanted something inspirational (or even just attractive) I would not buy it.The main problem is that it is a victim of its age (published in 1964 and last revised in 1975) and this affects it in three ways.First, the book is afflicted with black and white photos (or perhaps I should describe them as \\"grey\\"). In many cases the pattern of the stitches is hard to discern through the surface fuzz. The photos show the stitches executed in thick wool (occasionally in light and dark shades) and it takes a keen eye to discern what the final appearance would be.Secondly, the author states she intentionally does not show stitches in combination - although this is one of the great delights of today's canvaswork. And although it does describe 101 stitches, the book unfortunately leaves out the gorgeous and flexible Rhodes stitch, a star in many modern designs. I'm guessing Mary Rhodes had not yet published information about her development of that stitch when this book was written.Lastly, the book was produced at a time when all canvaswork was done in wool, and stitches were required to completely cover the canvas. The work was mostly used for utilitarian purposes such as cushion covers, and whole projects were often limited to the use of one or two stitches. Now we stitch with a variety of threads including cotton and silk floss, metallics, novelty threads and pearl cotton (and, yes, sometimes even wool!). We leave sections of the canvas bare (it comes in a variety of colours and can also be hand-painted by the stitcher), and we combine many stitches (including adaptations of crewel work) in ravishing combinations. We add beads and other items, and our creations run the gamut from useful to entirely decorative. Canvaswork offers a wide range and variety of design styles, offering the opportunity to stitch abstract, pictorial and repeat patterns, alone or in any combination.I should also note that beginners may be disappointed to find no introductory discussion of canvas types or the use of frames, although these subjects are sometimes mentioned in connection with individual stitches.In summary, this book serves a limited audience. It is unsuitable for beginners and I cannot imagine even experienced canvasworkers wishing to purchase it except in limited circumstances such as mine."},{"Title":"101 Needlepoint Stitches and How to Use Them: Fully Illustrated with Photographs and Diagrams (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)","review":"Good book for beginners.

Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate. Paul explains a \\"rough shadow\\" and a \\"roper\\". The first follows a subject in such a way as to be noticed (a \\"smooth shadow\\" keeps far away from the subject). A \\"roper\\" tries to befriend the subject in a casual way to gain their confidence. The \\"roper\\" will admit to illegal or unethical acts in order to draw out a similar confidence from the subject. [You may encounter this in your workplace.] Selma is friendly with a wealthy man; some of his nephews and nieces regard Selma as a fortune hunter! The shadow is the boyfrined of the niece who dislikes Selma. The complication is that Selma's husband Bill died a year ago of food poisoning, and some gossip that his wife took advantage of this to poison him!Selma's deceased husband is exhumed; test show arsenic. Selma also had been buying arsenic until her husband died. A bottle of this arsenic was found hidden by the barbecue grill where Selma's husband got sick. \\"The prosecution's evidence always seems convincing,\\" Mason said. Who else could have a motive to murder except the spouse?Perry's client listens to bad advice, and acts foolishly by flying to El Paso. Perry arrives, and is able to salvage her mistake, and turn it around (Chapters 9 & 10). Chapter 13 tells how Perry uses a polygraph expert to prove Selma's innocence. One example of this was in the Sam Sheppard case; family members proved they had never heard Dr. Sam Sheppard say anything indicative of guilt. [Erle Stanley Gardner kept up with current events.] But courts won't allow a polygraph test to determin guilt. \\"It's very, very possible to frame a person for murder,\\" Mason said.On the last day of the trial we learn that Selma Anson has just married Delane Arlington, who found the bottle of poison. A spouse cannot testify against another spouse. But Perry says Delane will testify voluntarily! Lt. Tragg testifies that the police found no bottle of poison (clearly marked) when they previously searched the whole area of the barbecue grill. The manufacturer of this poison (used in taxidermy) testified it was freshly manufactured within three months. The owner of the taxidermy supply store identifies the customer who bought this poison. Once all the facts are learned, Perry's client is found not guilty by the Judge. The customers who bought this poison are arrested for evidence tampering; and you know what's next."},{"Title":"Children of the Earth...

Don't read this book.If, however, you enjoy reading, if you like puzzling over plots and taking notes, if you like realistic characters with realistic problems, if you like words and sentences, if you like books...read \\"Open Secrets.\\"Munro is \\"great literature.\\" I suspect that in a few hundred years, Hemingway stories will have withered away under scrutiny and our past century will belong to names like Tobias Wolff, Grace Paley, and Alice Munro. She really is that good. And I think it points to something problematic about the quality of primary education Americans receive that a college student would find Munro's stories too complicated for an undergraduate literature class.And while I'm ranting...What is it with disparaging a book - comparing it to a talk-show - because it's written by a woman, with women characters doing womanly things? If a book is about women, does that disqualify it from being great lit? Does there have to be a war complete with trenches before it wins accolades? I also shy away from the term, \\"women's literature.\\" Why categorize it so? Some people create a new category of literature to put their women into, so that they don't have to defend them from the pinheads who mindlessly laud the \\"classics\\" tooth and nail. Forget it! Viriginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Alice Monro are great authors and compete against any male writer...Anyway...\\"Open Secrets\\" is an amazing book. Right off the top, she hits us with \\"Carried Away,\\" where a small-town librarian falls in love with an unseen correspondent, only to have him die in a factory accident before she ever meets him. Of course, that's where the story really starts. Plagued by longing, the librarian marries another man. Years later, she runs into her deceased lover who introduces himself to her for the first time...or is it really him?It's a complex story, peopled with multi-dimensional characters. Love is at the heart of the story, and \\"Carried Away\\" manages to both disparage and glorify the strength of that peculiar emotion.I'd go on, but suffice to say, the stories in \\"Open Secrets\\" are engaging, complex, interesting, and great."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"It astounds me that some people find Munro's prose boring; hypnotic is the word I'd use.

What they're about, in my view, is the strange and slippery role that time and memory play in our lives, and in that sense they join the tradition of Proust and Wordsworth. Munro is fascinated by experiences of disorientation or dislocation in which one no longer knows quite who one is, and by our stubborn attempts to make those moments fit into the narratives of our lives. But she also knows that those are the experiences that allow us to change, to get somewhere: the moments when we risk all because we have nothing to lose. Her small towns are about as folksy and harmless as Twin Peaks, because gaps keep opening in the dull fabric of their inhabitants' existence. Read beneath the surface, don't be fooled by the prosy, matter-of-fact tone, and you'll find that these are some weird and compelling stories indeed."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"I don't recognize Munro's work in the reviews (editorial and customer) I've read here. Are these stories about women? Are they heavy and soporific? Not in my view. For the most part, I see loving, humorous looks at a piece of geography and its inhabitants, stories which are beautifully written, tightly woven, relaxed, and full of delicious discoveries about people and places. Lots of short stories end with a bang and then they are... over. Not Munro's. Hers never glib, never lazy. They are daring, warming, readable and re-rereadable."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"The best story in this collection is \\"Carried Away,\\" and it, like many of the others, jumps around in time, and from character to character, revealing slowly what exactly it might be about, and then about-facing and revealing that it is about something else entirely, and then about-facing again, then again, until, finally, on the last page, one realizes that the story itself has been modeled after the very complexity of any group of lives as they move among one another, never quite knowing one another's whole story, or their own.I've never read another writer quite like Alice Munro, and I don't expect I will anytime soon. This book is so its own that it resists the capsule review entirely, and must be experienced on its own terms, story by story."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"In &quot;Open Secrets&quot;, Munroe tends to delve deep beneath the surface of women's lives. The stories contain intimate descriptions of feelings that many women try to hide, or even deny. The stories are classified as being &quot;short&quot;, however the emotions that are brought forth through these words tell a tale that may soothe the soul for a lifetime. In &quot;A Real Life&quot;, Dorrie is depicted as a sort of wild woman who shoots rabbits for food and fur, yet still remains dignified; in &quot;Open Secrets&quot;, Maureen is a woman who marries her much older husband because she truly loves him, despite his stroke, but does he love her; finally, in &quot;The Albanian Virgin&quot;, Charlotte and her strange husband Gjurdhi are presented, both live eccentric lives and leave a distinct impression on those that they meet. &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is a book made for women who want to explore their souls, and are not afraid to find what lies within. Once again, Alice Munroe has truly captured what is is to be &quot;woman&quot;!"},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"I love taking a look around and wondering what the people around me have been through in their lives, what drives them, where they are going. This book gives you snapshots into peoples lives. You find out what motivates them, where they have been, and where they are going. The best part is, they aren't all that special! They are normal everyday people, people you could come across in the grocery store. Its a wonderful read, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"In \\"The Albanian Virgin\\" Munro contrasts an everyday life of a modern woman with a rather timeless, adventurous tale of another woman who got lost in Albania - and she romantically opts for the latter's life. This story and the \\"Jack Randa Hotel\\" seem to me pretty artificial and contrived, whereas Munro seems at her best in \\"Open Secrets\\" , \\"Vandals\\" , and \\"A Wilderness Station\\" - here the lives of common women take on a mysterious, sometimes demonic quality, the pressure of taboos and fears can become overwhelming.In all these stories some aspects are taken up repeatedly: women in their relationships to men, women full of possiblities when they are girls, but then they have to adapt themselves to the world, which is shown as run by men, women tortured by fantasies and taboos. Often the men are presented rather unfavourably and women as the ones who are active or superior yet dependent on men. The sense of reality is mostly extraordinary, but sometimes the stories seem to me to be a bit too vague and myterious (e.g. \\"Spaceships have Landed\\")."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"This was my first time reading Alice Munro. I stuck with it to the end, but wasn't thrilled with it. A bit confusing. Perhaps I'd try another to compare."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"As I write (Nov 2012), Alice Munro (born 1931) has just published another collection -- \\"Dear Life.\\" For my tastes, no one has produced more interesting short stories in English since Joyce and Hawthorne. You sometimes hear Munro compared to Chekov, but her stories are stranger, and her organization of them into books is more ambitious (not that Chekov had such publication available to him). \\"Open Secrets\\" (1994) is more than a collection of stories -- it straddles the divide between collection and novel. Some characters from some stories show up, in minor parts, in others, and some stories seem to share the same setting -- eastern Canada -- though not always at the same time. Described broadly, the subject matter of the stories is conventional enough -- erotic and family entanglements -- but the working out of that subject matter is highly individual. For one thing, in this book, the stories are longer than the typical short story, and the first, \\"Carried Away,\\" starts in 1913, and ends in the 1970's, and in its odd way, it gets in World War 1, a flu epidemic, and industrial accident, and romantic fantasies. It doesn't come to any standard-romance conclusion, and it's absolutely fascinating. Also long, and with a broad historical sweep AND a double plot is \\"The Albanian Virgin\\" -- an ambitious construction that turns certain romance tropes on their heads and unapologetically plays fast and loose (or does it?) with point of view. Another amazing multi-generational construction is \\"A Wilderness Station,\\" which is part murder mystery, part history, and part anthropology -- as well as being an epistolary tale. The other stories are shorter but equally challenging to one's notion of what a short story should be -- \\"A Real Life\\" is a charmer, and \\"Open Secrets\\" is a fascinating portrait of a young woman's marriage to an older man, that ends with an amazing sense of previously unforeseen possibilities. The writing throughout is pitch perfect for each story -- she's too good a dramatist to have an identifiable \\"Munro style\\" -- but what challenges the reader is the way she presents the consequences of actions and leaves it too the reader to make what he or she can of them. Her people surprise us, and themselves. You'll notice that I haven't gone into much detail about the stories -- you need to read them for yourself. I've never read a dull Munro story."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"I own all of Munro's collections, and Open Secrets is one of her most important collections for a number of reasons. First of all, it contains a number of her most interesting stories. The magnificent World War I era ghost story \\"Carried Away\\" is in this volume as well as other deserving stories mentioned in other reviews. Also, the phrase \\"open secrets\\" itself is a valuable tool for interpreting Munro's fiction. She often focuses on \\"open secrets,\\" the aspects of small town life which are acknowledged but not articulated. The difficulty of her work lies in articulating what has previously not been said, especially so precisely.In this volume, Munro also develops her theory of different planes of reality existing simultaneously. Once see how the ending of \\"Carried Away\\" (included in at least one collection of \\"Best Short Stories of the Year\\" anthologies) depends upon two different versions of the plot are presented for the reader to resolve.This is a sophisticated collection firmly placing Munro among the leading fiction writers of the late twentieth century. It offers many hours of reading pleasure, esp. if you enjoy interpretation of multiple levels of meaning.I'm excited to see she has another collection available next November. Alice Munro remains one of my favorite writers working today."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"Alice Munro was one of those author's whose name I kept hearing and seeing and yet I never seemed to read. I finally picked up Open Secrets and am now desperate to collect her other stories and novels. Though definitely geared toward women-readers, as all the stories in this collection include women and girls as main characters, anyone who enjoys someone like Margaret Atwood or Jane Hamilton will enjoy Munro."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"In these not-so-short stories, whole lives seem to be revealed. I must have read \\"The Albanian Virgin,\\" \\"Open Secrets\\" and \\"Carried Away\\" half a dozen times each over the past few years--and each time I get something new out of it.She does not fall in line with what we are told a short story should be. Some people may find this maddening; I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"Many of these books are published in other collections. One could wish Munro had written more so we'd have fewer collections and more originals. However, every piece of writing is worth reading and rereading, so go ahead, buy."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"This book contains eight short stories written by Alice Munro, a gifted short story writer. I read them all and was sadly disappointed that they did not capture me as much as I'd hoped. My favorite stories were CARRIED AWAY and A WILDERNESS STATION. I really liked her clever usage of 'letter writing' as letters were intertwined into the stories. I also found some great lines in her stories, but it wasn't one of those \\"I can't put this book down\\" books. To use one of the phrases in her book she is 'a cut above the ordinary' and so I would recommend the book for those in the mood for short stories. You'll take away a little something from the story called OPEN SECRETS, too. I think amazon.com recommended this book for me. It's probably because I read 'Interpreter of Maladies'--a much better collection of nine short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri.As Alice wrote in the short story, THE REAL LIFE: '...torn between pleasure and agony, hope and suspense. The things that could go wrong multiplied'. And that is how it was when I only found pleasure in three of her stories."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"I forced myself to keep reading. Taken as a group, these stories had the effect of a big ol' midwestern family reunion; congenial, good folks, but the talk is about the weather, and about someone's car, now what year was it? and the weather last year ... you are getting sleepy .. and the weather tomorrow ... 'til you no longer remember a thing. It's mind-numbing. From &quot;Spaceships Have Landed&quot;: &quot;Each of them was called Tom. The Two Toms. A Tom was a noun to them, not just a name. It was not male or female. It meant somebody brave and clever...&quot; Instead of compressing details, Munro spreads them out. Her use of words is sedative. &quot;They gave up - Eunie's parents did. They sat down in the kitchen without any light on. It was between three and four o'clock. It must have seemed as if they were waiting for Eunie to come and tell them what to do. It was Eunie who was in charge of that house, and they probably could hardly imagine a time when it had been otherwise.&quot; Maybe one at a time - instead of together - is the way to read these interesting, kind-hearted, and slow-moving stories."},{"Title":"Open Secrets","review":"I really wish that college English professors would quit trying to force-feed us this crap just because they like it. If you genuinely care for it, great, but don't try to stuff it into me under the guise of &quot;great literature.&quot; The stories are all long, boring, and you really do have to take notes just to follow the so-called plot. Even professors with doctorates in English have to take notes to follow it. It seems that every story is about some woman with sexual and/or social problems, and you get to read for about 50 pages the story of how the woman sleeps with all the guys and wanders around looking for meaning in life. It has about as much meaningful content as a day-time talk show, and it's a heck of a lot more complicated."},{"Title":"The stuffed owl: An anthology of bad verse","review":"This is not just a collection of any old bad verse. McGonagall for one is not represented. Nor are the forgotten poetasters \`...the semi-literate, the nature-loving contributor to the county newspaper...the hearty but ill-equipped patriot, the pudibond but urgent Sapphos...' to take a sample of the disregarded from the anthologists' preface. The main qualifying factor for inclusion in The Stuffed Owl is solemnity. It may be that now and again Wyndham Lewis and Lee deviate slightly from this criterion, and I wonder whether in Boston churches they still sing\`Ye monsters of the bubbling deep/Your Maker's praises shout/Up from the sands, ye codlings, leap/And wag your tails about'but a fairer sample of the \`target' style would be e.g. Elizabeth Barrett Browning's\`Will you oftly/Murmur softly?' or \`Our Euripides the human/With his droppings of warm tears'; or Crabbe's \`Brother, there dwell, yon northern hill below,/Two favourite maidens, whom \`tis good to know,/Young, but experienced'.The very greatest can be found here at their less-than-greatest. The title of the book is itself a quotation from Wordsworth. Toweringly great poet though he was, he lacked, as everyone knows, any sense of the ridiculous whatsoever. He really did cite\`...the umbrella spread/To weather-fend the Celtic herdsman's head' as an instance of spreading decadence. One inclusion that seems to me marginal is from Resolution and Independence, the celebrated question to the old leech-gatherer, betraying that William had not been listening to a word the old fellow said\`My question eagerly did I renew/How is it that you live, and what is it you do?' Say what you like, I still find nothing absurd in it and I still think this is one of his greatest poems. How this got into The Stuffed Owl is obvious - the whole scenario was more than Lewis Carroll could take, and it inspired him to perhaps the most hilarious parody (along with Housman's Fragment of a Greek Tragedy) I have ever read, the White Knight's tale of the aged aged man a-sitting on a gate.The funniest things in the book are not so much the poems themselves as the commentaries. These are mainly the work of Wyndham Lewis and Lee, but there is some Olympian demolition by Macaulay of a certain Robert Montgomery (1807-1855) who specialised in obsequious piety. The anthologists themselves contribute a wonderful preface, the captions over the extracts, and, maybe best of all, the index. From this you can easily access, say, \`Leeds, poetical aspects of'; or \`Oysters, reason why they cannot be crossed in love'; or \`Trains, rapture of catching'.How they must have enjoyed doing it all! It appeals quite inordinately to my sense of humour, and perhaps it will to yours."},{"Title":"The stuffed owl: An anthology of bad verse","review":"This collection is much more interesting *and* funny than a more recent anthology of bad poetry, because it draws so heavily on great poets--Wordsworth, Byron, Poe et al. Laughing at semiliterate amateurs is a cheap shot. The wonder is the follies of the talented, and Stuffed Owl displays these. The introductory matter and editorial comments are also brilliantly funny, and the index--yes, the index--is a scream.

The editors find that bad poetry was merely tiresome before mid-seventeenth century, where the anthology begins. It ends with Tennyson, so as not to offend living poets, and only includes distinguished poets--those who have been rewarded with reverence or royalities by their contemporaries. The editors insist that bad poetry in their anthology be grammatical and innocent of the faults of craftsmanship. Poetasters are out. The inflated, flouncy diction of Victorian poetry is their special target. The title of the work gives a taste of what bathos it contains. Written by William Wordsworth, \\"The Stuffed Owl\\" of the title is a sonnet, whose subject is the sole object comforting the ailing Miss Jewsbury. The work is arranged chronologically by author with a subject index."},{"Title":"The stuffed owl: An anthology of bad verse","review":"These poems were chosen from American and English Literature to signify the worst in a history of pratfalls as exhibited by some of the big names. \\"If you glance at History's pags, in all lands and eras known, you will find the buried ages far more wicked than our own; as you scan each word and letter you will realize it more, that the world today is better than it ever was before.\\"Poe's \\"Eulalie' was chosen: \\"I dwelt alone in a world to moan,And my soul was a stagnant tide,Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride --Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.\\"Longfellow's 'Excelsior' goes thusly: \\"The shades of night were falling fast, as trough an Alpine village passedA youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,A banner with the strange device, Excelsior!...There in the twilight cold and grey, lifeless, but beautiful, he lay, And from the sky, serene and far, A voice fell, like a falling star, Excelsior!\\"\\"Something to love, some tree or flow'r,Something to nurse in my lonely bow'r,Some dog to follow, where'er I roam,Some bird to warble my welcome home,Some tame gazelle, or some gentle dove:Something to love, oh, something to love!Some to love, oh, let me see!Something that's filled with a love for me;Beloved by none, it is sad to live,And 'tis sad to die and leave none to grieve;And fond and true let the lov'e one prove.Something to love, oh, something to love!\\"'A Lesson for the Proud'\\"The scheme is tried; and shall it prosper too?Yes; what can't steam and gold united do?Near the commencement of Victoria's reign,Both sea-chiefs started on th' Atlantic main;While all the merchantmen they met and pass'd,Long looks of wonder on the heroes cast;Their proud, majestic march, their stately air,Their god-like prowess, and their length of car,Made gazers all, with great reluctance, seeTheir own comparative nonentity.\\"Wordsworth wrote: \\"Yet, helped by Genius -- untired Comforter,The presence even of a stuffed Owl for her can cheat the time.\\" The Capricorn edition has eight cartoons from the works of Max Beerbohm. There is a subject index and an author index. A bit of nonsense, but D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee must have had fun chosing what they considered the worst of the lot. Of course, everyone has his own opinion and, what's bad for someone may be good to someone else and vice versa.

We usually spend class time explaining DiSC and the theories behind it. This book could be easily used as pre-work to save class time during any training or consulting intervention involving behaviors, conflict, communication, team-building, management or leadership development.I found this book light reading with virtually every sentence applicable to the real world.

A publication for the masses who have been exposed to DISC behavior concepts, assessments, profiles, &quot;tests&quot;, and tools is sorely needed.
