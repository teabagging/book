An examination of the Iraqi English reading classes shows that communicative methodology has not been implemented into the classroom practices to enable the students to be proficient readers. The current reading instruction does not consider the use of an interactive model of reading, nor does it teach reading strategies. Thus, with such practices, students are unlikely to become proficient readers. Based on such factors that influence English language teaching in Iraq, this study was conducted. The study investigates the current practices of reading instruction in Iraqi high schools and how effective these practices were when compared to the best practices of communicative language teaching. The results revealed that the actual practices in Iraqi high schools were less effective in producing successful readers who could actively interact with the text in order to achieve comprehension. Finally, recommendations for improvement are proposed. The proposal presents a six-hour lesson plan to be considered as a model of practices that may be incorporated into the English language classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TFXIbwAACAAJ&dq=Communicative+reading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3ds Max 8 Bible","description":"If 3ds Max 8 can do it, you can do it too...

All major U.S. combat operations from World War II to the early years of the Iraq War are covered, including previously classified missions and several Medal-of-Honor-winning operations. Authors George Galdorisi and Tom Phillips (both veteran U.S. Navy helicopter pilots) highlight individual acts of heroism while telling the big-picture story of the creation and development of modern CSAR. Although individual missions have their successes and failures, CSAR, as an institution, would seem beyond reproach, an obvious necessity. The organizational history of CSAR, however, is not entirely positive. The armed services, particularly the U.S. Air Force and Navy, have a tendency to cut CSAR at the end of a conflict, leaving no infrastructure prepared for the next time that the brave men and women of our armed forces find themselves behind enemy lines. The final chapter has not yet been written for U.S. combat search and rescue, but in view of the life-saving potential of these forces, an open and forthright review of U.S. military CSAR plans and policies is long overdue. Beyond the exciting stories of heroic victories and heartrending defeats, Leave No Man Behind stimulates debate on this important subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BNSQm05eFy4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just What The Doctor Ordered (Silhouette Special Edition)","description":"THE DOCTOR'S SYMPTOMS  Dr. Matt Dennis never considered himself a family man until he was mistakenly assigned to a rural clinic and forced to live in Liz Rawlins's home.

With the arrival of global television networks, mass-media coverage and multinational sponsors, cricket has become big business and India has become the economic driving force in the world game. For the first time a developing country has become a major player in the international sports arena. This fully updated and revised edition of Mihir Bose's classic history is a unique account of the Indian cricket phenomenon. Drawing on a combination of extensive research and personal experience, Bose traces the development of the Indian game from its beginnings as a colonial pastime to its coming of age as a national passion and now a global commercial powerhouse. This illuminating study reveals Indian cricket's central place in modern India s identity, culture and society. Insightful, honest and challenging, Bose tackles the myths and controversies of Indian cricket. He considers the game in terms of race, caste, politics, national consciousness and ambition, money, celebrity and the media, evoking all the unpredictability, frustration and glory that is the magic of Indian cricket.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6gyAAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Meat Science","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PTZzQEACAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Meat+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionnaire de Poche Larousse Francais Italien et Italien Francais.

The house wasn't particularly fancy, but with lots of hard work Suzette was able to turn it into a home that was important to her, a home that represented her new found independence. Little did she know that the City of New London, desperate to revive its flailing economy, wanted to raze her house and the others like it that sat along the waterfront in order to win a lucrative Pfizer pharmaceutical contract that would bring new business into the city. Kelo and fourteen neighbors flat out refused to sell, so the city decided to exercise its power of eminent domain to condemn their homes, launching one of the most extraordinary legal cases of our time, a case that ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court. In Little Pink House, award-winning investigative journalist Jeff Benedict takes us behind the scenes of this case -- indeed, Suzette Kelo speaks for the first time about all the details of this inspirational true story as one woman led the charge to take on corporate America to save her home.

This contrasts sharply with mainstream scholarship which dates Sargon to the 23rd century BC. Bristowe defends the earlier dating from the cylinder and then argues that Sargon was the Biblical Cain. Her Cain-Sargon theory received support from British Israelites and proponents of Christian, and a sequel titled Cain An Argument was subsequently published in 1950.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CzxODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Blonde Is an Island","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=42dwHAAACAAJ&dq=No+Blonde+Is+an+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide Women Travel 4: A Rough Guide Special (Rough Guide Travel Guides)","description":"The Rough Guide to Europe on a Budget is the ultimate guide to exploring this fascinating continent on a shoestring, with coverage of all the top sights, the clearest mapping of any guide and handy hints on how to save money.

Pike--the most controversial American clergyman of modern times. Based on prodigious research into private letters and unpublished documents, as well as exhaustive interviews, it is a biography so candid that the book itself is bound to be controversial. The authors are utterly frank about the bishop's turbulent personal life--his three marriages, his sexuality, his alcoholism, the suicides of his oldest son and of an intimate associate, the temptation of his celebrity, his complex relationship with his mother, and his terrible death in the wilderness. They have thoroughly investigated his notorious experiences with \\"psychic phenomena\\"--arriving at their own startling and provocative conclusions. Nevertheless, this book is neither an expose nor an apologia. It is an honest, dramatic, and compelling testament to an extraordinary and vital personality--to the colorful and courageous Christian witness of Bishop James A. Pike, whose advocacy of social justice and whose search for faith--restless and unorthodox as it was--had an astonishing impact on the contemporary church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gT37DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+death+and+life+of+Bishop+Pike&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rediscovering America: The Making of Multicultural America, 1900-2000","description":"Tracing the development of multicultural America over the course of the twentieth century, this diverse history highlights the political, cultural, social, and cultural contributions of women, African Americans, Native Americans, immigrants, and others on the margins of traditional history.

Denise Pope, veteran teacher and curriculum expert, follows five motivated and successful students through a school year, closely shadowing them and engaging them in lengthy reflections on their school experiences. What emerges is a double-sided picture of school success. On the one hand, these students work hard in school, participate in extracurricular activities, serve their communities, earn awards and honours, and appear to uphold school values. But on the other hand, they feel that in order to get ahead they must compromise their values and manipulate the system by scheming, lying, and cheating. In short, they do school, that is, they are not really engaged with learning nor can they commit to such values as integrity and community. The words and actions of these five students - two boys and three girls from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds - underscore the frustrations of being caught in a grade trap that pins future success to high grades and test scores. Their stories raise critical questions that are too important for parents, educators, and community leaders to ignore. Are schools cultivating an environment that promotes intellectual curiosity, cooperation, and integrity? Or are they fostering anxiety, deception, and hostility? Do today's schools inadvertently impede the very values they claim to embrace? Is the success that current assessment practices measure the kind of success we want for our children?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bXZveOOa22kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And It Was Good","description":"Book #1 of The Genesis Trilogy. This special reissue of a classic work of spirituality from the author of A Wrinkle in Time offers life-transforming insights on the rich heritage of the Bible and shows how the characters of this ancient text are relevant for living the good life now. Includes a new reader's guide. In the first book of her Genesis Trilogy, beloved author Madeleine L'Engle casts long, loving, and perceptive glances not only at the created universe but also at its Creator. L'Engle often crafted stories that dealt with the complexities of the universe, navigating time and space, religion and science, with uncanny ease and insight. This skill--most famously demonstrated in A Wrinkle in Time--is showcased in this nonfiction work, And It Was Good, through her ability to see the connection between Made and Maker at every level. She examines the vast beauty, order, and complexity of our world with enthusiasm and reverence, illuminating the characteristics of God, the first poet. Madeleine L'Engle possesses the same ambidextrous skill of storytelling as other literary giants, including C.S. Lewis and George MacDonald. Her fictional stories appeal to generations of readers, and are equally embraced in both the secular and religious markets. But it is her ability in her nonfiction to engage with the historical text of the Bible through a dynamic unpacking of protagonists, antagonists, and matters of faith that establishes The Genesis Trilogy as a highly treasured collection of spiritual writings. And It Was Good beautifully approaches both the biblical text and creation itself with an intelligence and sensitivity that appeals to all seekers looking for a fresh communion with God in the natural world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r72mDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hold My Hand I'm Dying","description":"A compelling story, full of adventure, set against the move to freedom in Africa.

This superbly written book gives a complete account of Luftwaffe operations during the last twelve months of the fighting in Europe including the dramatic Bodenplatte (or 'Baseplate') offensive over the Ardennes in December 1944. In this comprehensive examination of Hitler's air force, Dr Alfred Price examines its state from May 1944 to May 1945, analysing not only the forces available to it, but also the likely potential, and impact, of new aircraft and weapons systems. He also assesses the Luftwaffe's High Command's performance and the effect of Allied attacks and operations. In doing so he rejects a number of long-standing myths, clarifies the impact of the jet and rocket fighters, and demonstrates that the Luftwaffe performed as well as could be expected under the harsh circumstances of fighting a losing war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N2CqCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As a Thief in the Night: The Mormon Quest for Millennial Deliverance","description":"Belief in the approaching Millennium dominated early Mormon theology and behavior.

The most important place in American nuclear history are the Marshall Islands an idyllic Pacific paradise that served as the staging ground for over sixty US nuclear tests. It was here, from 1946 to 1958, that America perfected the weapon that preserved the peace of the post-war years. It was here with the 1954 Castle Bravo test over Bikini Atoll that America executed its largest nuclear detonation, a thousand times more powerful than Hiroshima. And it was here that a native people became unwilling test subjects in the first large scale study of nuclear radiation fallout when the ashes rained down on powerless villagers, contaminating the land they loved and forever changing a way of life. In Blown to Hell, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Walter Pincus tells for the first time the tragic story of the Marshallese people caught in the crosshairs of American nuclear testing. From John Anjain, a local magistrate of Rongelap Atoll who loses more than most; to the radiation-exposed crew of the Japanese fishing boat the Lucky Dragon; to Dr. Robert Conard, a Navy physician who realized the dangers facing the islanders and attempted to help them; to the Washington power brokers trying to keep the unthinkable fallout from public view . . . Blown to Hell tells the human story of America s nuclear testing program. Displaced from the only homes they had known, the native tribes that inhabited the serene Pacific atolls for millennia before they became ground zero for America s first thermonuclear detonations returned to homes despoiled by radiation if they were lucky enough to return at all. Others were ripped from their ancestral lands and shuttled to new islands with little regard for how the new environment supported their way of life and little acknowledgement of all they left behind. But not even the disruptive relocations allowed the islanders to escape the fallout.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U-tIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Help Daddy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5E5IzwEACAAJ&dq=We+Help+Daddy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moonlight and Lovesongs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Choosing Survival: Strategies for a Jewish Future","description":"Considers the survival of Judaism in the United States and Israel","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zJnmCwAAQBAJ&dq=Choosing+Survival:+Strategies+for+a+Jewish+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roots of Phonics: A Historical Introduction","description":"A classic in the literacy literature is back in print with new exercises so that teachers can understand phonics before teaching them to students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zUsLAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Roots+of+Phonics:+A+Historical+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good medicine;: Memories of the real West","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_ecTAAAAYAAJ&dq=Good+medicine%3B:+Memories+of+the+real+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The first book of jazz","description":"An introduction to jazz which focuses on its historical development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nNM3GwAACAAJ&dq=The+first+book+of+jazz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Language of Argument (10th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Taffy's Foal","description":"When ten-year-old Nancy leaves her grandmother's Kentucky farm and her horse Taffy to live with her father and her new mother in Chicago, she must learn to overcome her shyness with schoolmates, feel that she belongs at home, and to accept the death of her mare as well as rejoice at the birth of a foal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NyFUAAAAYAAJ&dq=Taffy%27s+Foal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color-blind Justice: Albion Tourgee and the Quest for Racial Equality From the Civil War To Plessy V. Ferguson","description":"Civil War officer, Reconstruction \\"carpetbagger,\\" best-selling novelist, and relentless champion of equal rights, Albion Tourgee battled his entire life for racial justice. Now, in this engaging biography, Mark Elliott offers an insightful portrait of a fearless lawyer, jurist, and writer, who fought for equality long after most Americans had abandoned the ideals of Reconstruction. Elliott provides a fascinating account of Tourgee's life, from his childhood in the Western Reserve regionof Ohio (then a hotbed of abolitionism), to his years as a North Carolina judge during Reconstruction, to his memorable role as lead plaintiff's counsel in the landmark Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson . Tourgee's brief coined the phrase that justice should be \\"color-blind,\\" and his career was one long campaign to made good on that belief. A redoubtable lawyer and an accomplished jurist, Tourgee wrote fifteen political novels, eight books of historical and social criticism, and several hundred newspaper and magazine articles that all told represent a mountain of dissent against the prevailing tide of racial oppression. Through the lens of Tourgee's life, Elliott illuminates the war of ideas about race that raged through the United States in the nineteenth century, from the heated debate over slavery before the Civil War, through the conflict over aid to freedmen during Reconstruction, to the backlash toward the end of the century, when Tourgee saw his country retreat from thegoals of equality and freedom and utterly repudiate the work of Reconstruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BUq3uhZiG68C&dq=Color-blind+Justice:+Albion+Tourgee+and+the+Quest+for+Racial+Equality+From+the+Civil+War+To+Plessy+V.+Ferguson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery","description":"\`An incisive synthesis of developments in North America, the Caribbean and Latin America.

In Kant's own words, its aim is to identify and corroborate the supreme principle of morality, the categorical imperative. He argues that human beings are ends in themselves, never to be used by anyone merely as a means, and that universal and unconditional obligations must be understood as an expression of the human capacity for autonomy and self-governance. As such, they are laws of freedom.

The Supernanny method gives parents the know-how to tackle any problem area, be it mealtime, bathtime, bedtime, bedwetting, homework, sibling rivalry, aggressive behaviour or a child who just won't do what he or she is told. In an era where parents are bombarded with conflicting or guilt-laden messages at every turn, and sometimes obey their kids' commands rather than the other way around, this is an upbeat, back-to-basics approach to restoring harmony and authority in the home. Jo has a magical way with children, but her methods are simple and can and do work for anyone: regular routine, consistency, verbal warnings, time out after misbehaviour, and rewarding good behaviour with lots of attention. your ten-month-old won't sleep through the night, or your two-year-old is out of control, Jo knows what to do and can show you how to do it. For anyone who doesn't feel in charge at home, this is a godsend of a book full of brilliantly commonsense advice - the only parenting book you'll ever want.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9lknKQAACAAJ&dq=Supernanny:+How+to+Get+the+Best+From+Your+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asgard stories: Tales from Norse mythology","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YAzvhlNc000C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Happy Lion Roars","description":"The happy lion was unhappy--he was living all alone in his house and lonely.

The preeminent-and often the only-female correspondent on the scene, she broke new ground for women in the male preserve of journalism. Her wartime dispatches, marked by a passionate desire to expose suffering in its many guises and an inimitable immediacy, rank among the best of the twentieth century. A deep-seated love of travel complemented this interest in world affairs. From her birth in St. Louis in 1908 to her death in London in 1998, Gellhorn passed through Africa, Cuba, China, and most of the great cities of Europe, recording her experiences in first-rate travel writing and fiction. A tall, glamorous blonde, she made friends easily-among the boldface names that populated her life were Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and H. G. Wells-but she was as incapable of settling into comfortable long-term relationships as she was of sitting still, and happiness often eluded her despite her professional success. Both of her marriages ended badly-the first, to Ernest Hemingway, publicly so. Drawn from extensive interviews and with exclusive access to Gellhorn's papers and correspondence, this seminal biography spans half the globe and almost an entire century to offer an exhilarating, intimate portrait of one of the defining women of our times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=83DHziZQZ_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Power and Colonial Control: The Royal Air Force 1919-1939 (Studies in Imperalism)","description":"Between the world wars the main task of the RAF was to crush tribal rebellions against British rule.

First published in 1731, Prevost's story proved to be hugely influential, its passionate and tragic mode inspiring a number of operas and ballets, while the compelling character of Manon prefigures a host of 19th-century Romantic heroines.

Drawing on over 35 years of personal experience as a WCG minister, teacher, & former presenter on The World Tomorrow telecast, Dr. David Albert chronicles events in the lives of now-deceased Pastor Generals Herbert W. Armstrong & Joseph W. Tkach leading to sweeping change. The author examines original writings & teachings of Herbert Armstrong on Old Testament dietary laws & sacred days concluding that, despite Armstrong's protestations to the contrary, these were derived from the laws of Moses & are therefore not required of Christians today. Albert treats early New Testament church history, particularly the Jerusalem Conference of Acts 15, in considerable detail & contends that the apostolic decision to loose Christian converts from the law of Moses was not fully understood in the Worldwide Church of God until recently. Fully supportive of recent changes, Albert concludes that literal interpretations of the \\"national/ceremonial\\" ideal of the Old Covenant work against the New Covenant character ideal found in Christ. Partly autobiographical, DIFFICULT SCRIPTURES is well illustrated with anecdotes revealing the human side of crisis & change in a church striving to free itself from legalism.

Financialization over the past three decades has created a structure that lacks resilience and supports absurd volumes of trading. The finance sector devotes too little attention to the search for new investment opportunities and the stewardship of existing ones, and far too much to secondary-market dealing in existing assets. Regulation has contributed more to the problems than the solutions. Why? What is finance for? John Kay, with wide practical and academic experience in the world of finance, understands the operation of the financial sector better than most. He believes in good banks and effective asset managers, but good banks and effective asset managers are not what he sees. In a dazzling and revelatory tour of the financial world as it has emerged from the wreckage of the 2008 crisis, Kay does not flinch in his criticism: we do need some of the things that Citigroup and Goldman Sachs do, but we do not need Citigroup and Goldman to do them. And many of the things done by Citigroup and Goldman do not need to be done at all. The finance sector needs to be reminded of its primary purpose: to manage other people's money for the benefit of businesses and households. It is an aberration when the some of the finest mathematical and scientific minds are tasked with devising algorithms for the sole purpose of exploiting the weakness of other algorithms for computerized trading in securities.

There are a number of thoughtful people who think so. Mel Hurtig, however, believes there is still a chance to reassert Canadian independence. But first, Canadians need to understand how much has been lost. Our politicians are not telling us. Our business leaders certainly are not telling us. And our media definitely are not telling us. The border dividing Canada and the United States has never been more fragile. Canada is vanishing. The evidence is available to those who know where to look for it. It can be found in reports published by Statistics Canada, the OECD, the World Bank, the United Nations and its affiliated organizations, and by a variety of research organizations including the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

Traditionally Orthodox Jews, believing the scripture to be the word of God, have rejected homosexuality in accordance with this interpretation. In 1999, Rabbi Steven Greenberg challenged this tradition when he became the first Orthodox rabbi ever to openly declare his homosexuality. Wrestling with God and Men is the product of Rabbi Greenberg s ten-year struggle to reconcile his two warring identities. In this compelling and groundbreaking work, Greenberg challenges long held assumptions of scriptural interpretation and religious identity as he marks a path that is both responsible to human realities and deeply committed to God and Torah. Employing traditional rabbinic resources, Greenberg presents readers with surprising biblical interpretations of the creation story, the love of David and Jonathan, the destruction of Sodom, and the condemning verses of Leviticus. But Greenberg goes beyond the question of whether homosexuality is biblically acceptable to ask how such relationships can be sacred. In so doing, he draws on a wide array of nonscriptural texts to introduce readers to occasions of same-sex love in Talmudic narratives, medieval Jewish poetry and prose, and traditional Jewish case law literature. Ultimately, Greenberg argues that Orthodox communities must open up debate, dialogue, and discussion precisely the foundation upon which Jewish law rests to truly deal with the issue of homosexual love. This book will appeal not only to members of the Orthodox faith but to all religious people struggling to resolve their belief in the scriptures with a desire to make their communities more open and accepting to gay and lesbian members. 2005 Finalist for the Lambda Literary Awards, for Religion/Spirituality","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xOmU5q1x8HsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lone Wolf and Cub, Volume 17: The Will of the Fang","description":"The epic journey of Ogami Itto and Daigoro continues in this stunning volume!

Although some of the book is dated, its conviction that \\"the church's meaning lies in its fulfillment of the sufferings of Christ\\" and that \\"every part of its history is intelligible in terms of the Passion\\" remains perceptive and challenging. Examining Scripture, doctrine, and history, Ramsey paints an intricate portrait of the church as an example of Christ's death and resurrection. He explores Eastern orthodox doctrine; explains the purposes and preconditions of the Reformation; and calls for a renewal of liturgical worship and reconciliation within the communion of the saints. Originally published in 1936 while he was serving as sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, this was Ramsey's first book. After more than seventy years, its wisdom concerning the relationship between Catholic and Evangelical, and the underlying complementarities and tensions which characterize the Anglican tradition, remains theologically sound and biblically astute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RACb6TICT4QC&dq=The+Gospel+and+the+Catholic+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddhist Epistemology (Contributions in Philosophy)","description":"Provides a clear and exhaustive exposition of epistemology and logic in the Buddhist philosophical tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G-cAoYoJSnYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The meantime","description":"Most of us go through life with a vision of what the ideal relationship is supposed to be, yet too often our longing for a soul mate leads to disappointment and heartbreak.

Jung's early business of flying marijuana into the United States from the mountains of Mexico took a dramatic turn when he met Carlos Lehder, a young Colombian car thief with connections to the then newly born cocaine operation in his native land. Together they created a new model for selling cocaine, turning a drug used primarily by the entertainment elite into a massive and unimaginably lucrative enterprise-- one whose earnings, if legal, would have ranked the cocaine business as the sixth largest private enterprise in the Fortune 500. The ride came to a screeching halt when DEA agents and Florida police busted Jung with three hundred kilos of coke, effectively unraveling his fortune. But George wasn't about to go down alone. He planned to bring down with him one of the biggest cartel figures ever caught. With a riveting insider account of the lurid world of international drug smuggling and a super-charged drama of one man's meteoric rise and desperate fall, Bruce Porter chronicles Jung's life using unprecedented eyewitness sources in this critically acclaimed true crime classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nUyvoQEACAAJ&dq=Blow:+How+a+Small-Town+Boy+Made+%24100+Million+With+the+Medellin+Cocaine+Cartel+and+Lost+It+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appleton & Lange's Review of Surgery","description":"Appleton's rich beginnings found their source at Lawrence Institute, the university in the woods, on the Fox River.

(Examine the Evidence)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No Laughing Matter","description":"An uproarious and frank memoir of illness and recovery, No Laughing Matter is a story of friendship and recuperation from the author of the classic Catch-22. It all began one typical day in the life of Joe Heller. He was jogging four miles at a clip these days, working on his novel God Knows, coping with the complications of an unpleasant divorce, and pigging out once or twice a week on Chinese food with cronies like Mel Brooks, Mario Puzo, and his buddy of more than twenty years, Speed Vogel. He was feeling perfectly fine that day but within twenty-four hours he would be in intensive care at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital. He would remain hospitalized for nearly six months and leave in a wheelchair. Joseph Heller had Guillain-Barr  syndrome, a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition that can leave its victims paralyzed from head to toe. The clan gathered immediately. Speed sometime artist, sometime businessman, sometime herring taster, and now a coauthor moved into Joe's apartment as messenger, servant, and shaman. Mel Brooks, arch-hypochondriac of the Western world, knew as much about Heller's condition as the doctors. Mario Puzo, author of the preeminent gangster novel of our time, proved to be the most reluctant man ever to be dragged along on a hospital visit. These and lots of others rallied around the sickbed in a show of loyalty and friendship that not only built a wild and spirited camaraderie but helped bring Joe Heller, writer and buddy extraordinaire, through his greatest crisis. This book is an inspiring, hilarious memoir of a calamitous illness and the rocky road to recuperation as only the author of Catch-22 and the friend who helped him back to health could tell it. No Laughing Matter is as wacky, terrifying, and greathearted as any fiction Joseph Heller ever wrote.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grand Design: A Simply-Stated, User-Friendly Guide to Living in the Universe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Something to Remember: A Family's Journey Through 20th Century America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Karaoke No More","description":"When karaoke calls, get ready to steal the show.

Profoundly Disturbing examines the underground cult movies that haveunexpectedly and unintentionallyrevolutionized the way that all movies would be made. Called \\"exploitation films\\" because they often exploit our most primal fears and desires, these overlooked movies pioneered new cinematographic techniques, subversive narrative structuring, and guerrilla marketing strategies that would eventually trickle up into mainstream cinema. In this book Joe Bob Briggs uncovers the most seminal cult movies of the twentieth century and reveals the fascinating untold stories behind their making. Briggs is best known as the cowboy-hat wearing, Texas-drawling host of Joe Bob's Drive-in Theater and Monstervision, which ran for fourteen years on cable TV. His goofy, disarming take offers a refreshingly different perspective on movies and film making. He will make you laugh out loud but then surprise you with some truly insightful analysis. And, with more than three decades of immersion in the cult movie business, Briggs has a wealth of behind-the-scenes knowledge about the people who starred in, and made these movies. There is no one better qualified or more engaging to write about this subject. All the subgenres in cult cinema are covered, with essays centering around twenty movies including Triumph of the Will (1938), Mudhoney (1965), Night of the Living Dead (1967), Deep Throat (1973), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Drunken Master (1978), and Crash (1996). Accompanying the text are dozens of capsule reviews providing ideas for related films to discover, as well as kitschy and fun archival film stills.

The setting is 1845. Eleazar, a Protestant minister, leaves his native Ireland with his wife and two children to emigrate to America. Like the Old Testament Moses, with whom Eleazar comes to identify through the course of the novel, Eleazar has committed a justifiable murder and is forced to leave his home. After landing in Virginia, the family travels west toward what Eleazar believes is the Promised Land of California. While in the Colorado desert, however, he experiences a profound epiphany. He understands for the first time how the prophet Moses was tragically torn between fire and water: between the burning bush, with its power to bring him into contact with the voice of Yahweh, and the banal demands of the Hebrew people in exile, who depended on him to touch his stick to the rock and bring forth water. Eleazar, Exodus to the West parallels the lives of the two misfits-the Irish minister in the American West and the Hebrew Moses in exile in the desert after leaving Egypt. Tournier sets before us timeless issues and tantalizing questions from our mythological past: Moses' personality and peculiar relationship with God, fundamental contradictions between the Old and the New Testaments, and our own intimate bond with the eternal symbols of fire and water.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zPMJnNslmjEC&dq=Eleazar,+Exodus+to+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cultural History of the English Language","description":"This book presents a new interpretation of the history of English. Access to large corpuses of English has allowed scholars to assess the minutiae of linguistic change with much greater precision than before, often pinpointing the beginnings of linguistic innovations in place and time. The author uses the findings from this research to relate major historical events to change in the language, in particular to areas of linguistic inquiry that have been of particular importance in recent years, such as discourse analysis, stylistics and work on pidgins and creoles. The book does not attempt to chronicle changes in syntax or pronunciation and spelling, but is designed to complement a corpus-based study of formal changes. The story of English is brought up to the late 1990s to include, amongst other things, discussions of Estuary English and the implications of the information superhighway.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cot9AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Graces: Child's Book Of Good Manners","description":"The regrettable fact is that the subject of manners is not much discussed anymore, and good manners seem practiced even less. But good manners are a prerequisite for the growth of moral character; they are the habits of conduct and behavior by which we express in the most ordinary circumstances our fundamental respect for others, whether parents, friends, colleagues, or strangers. Fortunately, Karen Santorum has produced for parents and teachers a wonderfully rich and instructive anthology to help instill good manners in our children and stand against a decline of civility and a coarsening of our common life. Under such headings as  Honor Your Mother and Father,   Please and Thank You,   No Hurtful Words,   Good Behavior in Sport,  and  Showing Respect for Country,  Everyday Graces features stories and poems that will develop and enrich the moral imagination. This marvelous anthology features classic selections from such well-known authors as Hans Christian Anderson, Beatrix Potter, Mark Twain, Frances Hodgson Burnett, C. S. Lewis, Max Lucado, and Arnold Lobel, as well as forgotten gems that deserve a new hearing. Mrs. Santorum writes that this anthology grew out of the frustration of not being able to find a book on manners that instructs through stories rather than by rules of dos and don'ts. She and her husband tried and tested many of these selections on their six children. Each of the selections is briefly introduced with a thoughtful commentary at the close, producing an informality and intimacy that is inviting and infectious. Find out why Everyday Graces has become a beloved feature in homes, schools, churches, and libraries across America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xwYLAAAACAAJ&dq=Everyday+Graces:+Child%27s+Book+Of+Good+Manners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kit Carson,: A portrait in courage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7YphmQEACAAJ&dq=Kit+Carson,:+A+portrait+in+courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Survival","description":"Transformative justice seeks to solve the problem of violence at the grassroots level, without relying on punishment, incarceration, or policing. Community-based approaches to preventing crime and repairing its damage have existed for centuries. However, in the putative atmosphere of contemporary criminal justice systems, they are often marginalized and operate under the radar. Beyond Survival puts these strategies front and center as real alternatives to today s failed models of confinement and  correction.  In this collection, a diverse group of authors focuses on concrete and practical forms of redress and accountability, assessing existing practices and marking paths forward. They use a variety of forms from toolkits to personal essays to delve deeply into the  how to  of transformative justice, providing alternatives to calling the police, ways to support people having mental health crises, stories of community-based murder investigations, and much more. At the same time, they document the history of this radical movement, creating space for long-time organizers to reflect on victories, struggles, mistakes, and transformations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2iRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thirteenth House","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_uq8QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Thirteenth+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Macbeth; (Macmillan's English classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PtA0AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sustaining the Forest, the People, and the Spirit","description":"Documents and describes the Menominee Indians' tribal practice of sustainable environmental development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bkukaYB70VsC&dq=Sustaining+the+Forest,+the+People,+and+the+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Swing: Mastering the Principles of the Game","description":"Not since Ben Hogan in the 1950s has a dominant player so thoroughly addressed golf's central enigma: how to develop and repeat an effective swing, the only way any player can hope to truly improve.

For players at all levels, Price now reveals the game's essential elements -- from grip and set-up and downswing, to the short game and effective putting -- in both theory and practice. Drawing on his own influences, remarkable experiences, and intense study, his program combines both athletic and mental requirements, and offers all golfers the lasting rewards of long-term improvement -- the promise at the heart of the game.

These bodily responses can indicate the steps for interpreting a dream. Theories about dreams differ and give contradictory interpretations. Dr. Gendlin derived 16 questions from the many existing theories to aid you, the dreamer, in the process of interpretation. In this book, Dr. Gendlin teaches you to ask the questions so that your body can respond. You learn to recognize how it feels when a question is about to lead to a breakthrough. You learn to let the question complete itself so that the dream opens and you know without doubt what it is about. The first stage is learning what the dream is about. But this alone may not tell you anything you did not know before. The second stage is getting something new from the dream for your own development. The method developed by Dr. Gendlin solves what was, until now, an insurmountable problem: People could not interpret their own dreams because they always imposed their usual biases on them. Gendlin shows you how to open yourself to a new step.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3UPTVaZD0TkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barcelona","description":"With rare and unrivaled access, bestselling coauthor of Soccernomics and longtime Financial Times journalist Simon Kuper tells the story of how FC Barcelona became the most successful club in the world and how that era is now ending FC Barcelona is not just the world s highest grossing sports club, it is simply one of the most influential organizations on the planet. At last count, it had approximately 214 million social media followers, more than any other sports club except Real Madrid CF and by one earlier measure, more than all thirty-two NFL teams combined. It has more in common with multinational megacompanies like Netflix or small nation-states than it does with most soccer teams. No wonder its motto is  More than a club.  But it was not always so. In the past three decades, Barcelona went from a regional team to a global powerhouse, becoming a model of sustained excellence and beautiful soccer, and a consistent winner of championships. Simon Kuper unravels exactly how this transformation took place, paying special attention to the club s two biggest stars, Johan Cruyff and Lionel Messi, who is arguably the greatest soccer player of all time. Messi joined Bar?a at age thirteen and, more than anyone, has been the engine and standard-bearer of Barcelona s glory. But his era is coming to an end and with it, a once-in-a-lifetime golden run. This book charts Bar?a s rise and fall. Like many world-beating organizations, FC Barcelona closely guards its secrets, granting few outsiders access to the Camp Nou, its legendary home stadium. But after decades of writing about the sport and the club, Kuper was given access to the inner sanctum and the people behind the scenes who strive daily to keep Barcelona at the top. Erudite, personal, and capturing all the latest upheavals, his portrait of this incredible institution goes beyond soccer to understand FC Barcelona as a unique social, cultural, and political phenomenon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8-EAAAQBAJ&dq=Barcelona&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruins of Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands","description":"Many Japanese people consider themselves to be part of an essentially unchanging and isolated ethnic unit in which the biological, linguistic, and cultural aspects of Japanese identity overlap almost completely with each other. In its examination of the processes of ethnogenesis (the formation of ethnic groups) in the Japanese Islands, Ruins of Identity offers an approach to ethnicity that differs fundamentally from that found in most Japanese scholarship and popular discourse. Following an extensive discussion of previous theories on the formation of Japanese language, race, and culture and the nationalistic ideologies that have affected research in these topics, Mark Hudson presents a model of a core Japanese population based on the dual origin hypothesis currently favored by physical anthropologists. According to this model, the Jomon population, which was present in Japan by at least the end of the Pleistocene, was followed by agriculturalists from the Korean peninsula during the Yayoi period (ca. 400 BC to AD 300). Hudson analyzes further evidence of migrations and agricultural colonization in an impressive summary of recent cranial, dental, and genetic studies and in a careful examination of the linguistic and archaeological records. The final sections of the book explore the cultural construction of Japanese ethnicity. Cultural aspects of ethnicity do not emerge pristine and fully formed but are the result of cumulative negotiation. Ethnic identity is continually recreated through interaction within and without the society concerned. Such a view necessitates an approach to culture change that takes into account complex interactions with a larger system. Accordingly, Hudson considers post-Yayoi ethnogenesis in Japan within the East Asian world system, examining the role of interaction between core and periphery in the formation of new ethnic identities, such as the Ainu. He argues that the defining elements of the Ainu period and culture (ca. AD 1200) can be linked directly to a dramatic expansion in Japanese trade goods flowing north as Hokkaido became increasingly exploited by core regions to the south. Highly original and at times controversial, Ruins of Identity will be essential reading for students and scholars in Japanese studies and will be of interest to anthropologists and historians working on ethnicity in other parts of the world.

David Mitchell follows his eerily precocious, globe-striding first novel, Ghostwritten, with a work that is in its way even more ambitious. In outward form, Number9Dream is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister s death and his mother s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.

One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per day on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find. Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called \\"incremental development and continual review.\\" Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Advanced Mathematics, second edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. In Advanced Mathematics, topics from algebra, geometry, trigonometry, discrete mathematics, and mathematical analysis are interwoven to form a fully integrated text. A rigorous treatment of Euclidean geometry is also presented. Word problems are developed throughout the problem sets and become progressively more elaborate. With this practice, students will be able to solve challenging problems such as rate problems and work problems involving abstract quantities. A graphing calculator is used to graph functions and perform data analysis. Conceptually-oriented problems that prepare students for college entrance exams (such as the ACT and SAT) are included in the problem sets. This set contains a student text, answer key and test forms. A solutions manual is sold separately.

Tuchman s classic histories of the First World War era During the fateful quarter century leading up to World War I, the climax of a century of rapid, unprecedented change, a privileged few enjoyed Olympian luxury as the underclass was  heaving in its pain, its power, and its hate.  In The Proud Tower, Barbara W. Tuchman brings the era to vivid life: the decline of the Edwardian aristocracy; the Anarchists of Europe and America; Germany and its self-depicted hero, Richard Strauss; Diaghilev s Russian ballet and Stravinsky s music; the Dreyfus Affair; the Peace Conferences in The Hague; and the enthusiasm and tragedy of Socialism, epitomized by the assassination of Jean Jaur s on the night the Great War began and an epoch came to a close.

Everything has a spirit: the willow tree with leaves that kiss the pond, the stream that feeds the river, the wind that exhales fresh snow . . . And those spirits want to kill you. It s the first lesson that every Renthian learns. Not long ago, Daleina used her strength and skill to survive those spirits and assume the royal throne. Since then, the new queen has kept the peace and protected the humans of her land. But now for all her power, she is hiding a terrible secret: she is dying. And if she leaves the world before a new heir is ready, the spirits that inhabit her beloved realm will run wild, destroying her cities and slaughtering her people. Naelin is one such person, and she couldn t be further removed from the Queen and she wouldn t have it any other way. Her world is her two children, her husband, and the remote village tucked deep in the forest that is her home, and that s all she needs. But when Ven, the Queens champion, passes through the village, Naelin s ambitious husband proudly tells him of his wife s ability to control spirits magic that Naelin fervently denies. She knows that if the truth of her abilities is known, it will bring only death and separation from those she loves. But Ven has a single task: to find the best possible candidate to protect the people of Aratay. He did it once when he discovered Daleina, and he s certain he s done it again. Yet for all his appeals to duty, Naelin is a mother, and she knows her duty is to her children first and foremost. Only as the Queen s power begins to wane and the spirits become emboldened even as ominous rumors trickle down from the north does she realize that the best way to keep her son and daughter safe is to risk everything. Sarah Beth Durst established a place of dark wonder in The Queen of Blood, and now the stakes are even higher as the threat to the Queen and her people grows both from within and beyond the borders of Aratay in this riveting second novel of the Queens of Renthia series.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zlI8DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buddha in the robot","description":"Dr. Mori explores Buddhism through his perspective as a robot engineer.

Myerhoff's unfinished projects, including her final talks on storytelling, ritual, and the \\"culture of aging and Yiddishkeit,\\" offer a magisterial summary of her life's work. \\"The beauty of Stories as Equipment for Living is the quality of being a compilation of rescued fragments, bits and pieces of a great master's writing and thinking that were coming towards synthesis but had never reached a finished form prior to her death. This collection is an examination of the place of narrative in human life, the synthetic nature of culture and the constant search for visibility particularly by those relegated for one reason or another to the margins. A thought-provoking book worthy of extended reflection.\\" ---Jack Kugelmass, Professor of Anthropology and Director of Jewish Studies, University of Florida \\"Stories as Equipment for Living achieves a nice balance between preserving Myerhoff's work in its original form and reconstructed contexts, but presenting it in a manner relevant to readers a generation after her death. The book documents Myerhoff's growing involvement with Jewish culture, the actual process of anthropological work through field notes, and the picture of how she always was bouncing the fine details of this combined professional and personal venture off the 'big questions' of anthropology in its broadest sense.\\" ---Harvey E. Goldberg, Professor of Sociology and Anthropology, Hebrew University, Israel \\"These essays capture the rhythm of Barbara Myerhoff's words and her vivid and distinctive train of thought, bringing the reader into the classroom of one of anthropology's finest lecturers. As an anthropologist with a poet's gift for language, she utilizes the tools of ethnography and extraordinary powers of observation---a remarkable 'ethnographic eye'---to explore the outward expressions and inner lives of the Fairfax neighborhood of L.A. These stories are not only glorious introductions to the study of culture, but provide in their revelations a reason for studying it. They are required reading for anyone passionate to know what an anthropologist can teach us about communities and ultimately about ourselves.\\" ---Steve Zeitlin, Director, City Lore: The New York Center for Urban Folk Culture \\"Master of the third voice, the voice of collaboration, Myerhoff is at once a consummate listener and inspired storyteller. This book offers a rare and luminous opening into the working process and wisdom of one of the great anthropologists of the twentieth century.\\" ---Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Professor of Performance Studies at New York University and coauthor of They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood in Poland Before the Holocaust \\"Myerhoff and her collaborators have given her 'Hasidim,' her disciples old and new, a final and precious gift.\\" ---Jonathan Boyarin, The Robert M.

With incredible detail (as well as numerous architectural plans and drawings), author and architect Heino Engel describes everything from room functions and the flexibility of partitions to the influence of human anatomy on Japanese units of measure. Rather than exploring why the traditional Japanese house is built the way it is, Engel delves into the practical information: what the Japanese house is and how it is built. This book is not simply a description of the features of the Japanese house, but \\"an invitation to probe the possibilities of utilizing this architectural achievement of the Japanese...in modern living and building,\\" according to the author, who further believes that the unique details of the Japanese house are better suited as a pattern for contemporary housing than any other form of residential structure. With a new foreword by architect and professor Mira Locher, Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, this updated hardcover edition brings this popular work to modern readers--in hopes that they may find ideas to adopt into their own home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g95SzQEACAAJ&dq=Measure+and+Construction+of+the+Japanese+House+(Contains+250+Floor+Plans+and+Sketches+Aspects+of+Joinery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bush Versus the Environment","description":"Since becoming president, George W. Bush has walked away from the Kyoto Protocol, pushed for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, undermined protections for endangered species and wilderness, and retreated from his campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide. But the president s agenda reaches deeper than these well-known policies. In Bush Versus the Environment, Robert Devine shows how the White House is quietly undermining the entire system of environmental safeguards that has developed over the past thirty years. The administration's tactics include: -Encouraging lawsuits against the federal government that challenge existing environmental laws, and then feebly defending the cases in court. -Ignoring science that doesn t support the president's goals, and pressuring government scientists to produce the results the administration wants. -Using fuzzy math to overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits of regulations that protect human health and the environment, which can lead to the elimination of much-needed rules. These are just a few of the administration s strategies, which are being pursued beneath the radar of a public that overwhelmingly supports environmental protections. Bush Versus the Environment is a compelling and important look at one of the most important issues facing America today, one that will have consequences that last long after Bush has left office.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rV1CRhFpUdwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biography - Humphry, Derek (1930-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","description":"In response to the escalating need for up-to-date information on writers, Contemporary Authors?

Commercial versions were rare and very expensive. Using common tools and easy-to-come-by parts, Cashner showed the average shooter how to fashion his own home-built scouts from a variety of tried-and-true, battle-tested military actions. His versions stayed true to Col. Jeff Cooper's original concept of accuracy and durability as the overriding criteria for such weapons, and to qualify as a poor man's rifle, he made sure his scout rifles were affordable to those on a limited budget. Many things have changed in the firearms world since 2003. The increased popularity of scout rifles  along with the skyrocketing prices for what were once cheap surplus rifles  convinced Cashner to update the original book to meet the needs of today's shooters. This revised how-to guide contains a variety of long-eye-relief scope-mounting hardware that wasn't even on the market when Cashner completed the first book, as well as information on the newest scout rifle scopes; revised prices for rifles, parts and ammo; and some additions and modifications requested by readers. Each of his creations meets the basic specifications of a scout/utility rifle yet costs less than a quarter of what the commercial models would have.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hqe6kgEACAAJ&dq=Poor+Man%27s+Scout+Rifle:+A+How+To+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nuts: Sweet and Savory Recipes from Diamond of California","description":"When the people at Diamond of California, the world's leading marketer of nuts, decided to create a cookbook, they scoured their archives, developed dozens of new recipes, and turned to some of America's best loved chefs, cooking teachers, and food writers for more.

Daily canoes and trains of sweating bearers carry tribute to his island capital, Mexico-Tenochtitl n, while squadrons of ruthless warriors enforce his will. Gold, silver, cotton, jewels, and precious feathers change hands in his markets. The temples run with the blood of human sacrifices. All seems well, but Montezuma is troubled. Mysterious strangers have appeared in the East. Are they men or gods? Visions and rumors disturb his dreams. The soothsayers he turns to for guidance give him only enigmatic answers, and he knows he cannot trust his advisers---especially his chief minister, the unscrupulous Lord Feathered in Black. Yaotl, the chief minister's slave, is troubled, too. He was ordered to escort a sacrificial victim up the steps of the Great Pyramid, but the victim ran amok, uttering a bizarre and sinister prophecy and leaping to his death before the War-God's priests could cut out his heart. Then Yaotl learns that the emperor's soothsayers have vanished. The emperor senses a connection between these two events and orders Yaotl to find it---on pain of death if he fails. But it soon becomes clear that whatever the connection is, Yaotl's own master will stop at nothing---including murder---to keep it secret. To get to the truth will take all Yaotl's wits and will to survive. It will lead him into confrontations with the peril destined to overwhelm the whole Aztec world and with a monster from his own past - and into the hands of a sadistic killer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=97t5PvutgGYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Gay Erotica 2006","description":"Full of surprises, a collection that will satisfy every wicked taste ranges from a tale of awakening inner dominance to one man's journey through exploration in the seafaring world of sailors.

Because it was impossible to include every program in the book, and because these programs are constantly changing, Island Press welcomes suggested changes and additions to the profiles. While Island Press is not the official \\"author\\" of the book, we are eager to receive new or updated information to be included in the next edition. Drawing from this information, Island Press has created an online listing of programs that were not profiled in the book. To submit your contribution, either fill out the postcard included in the book itself, or e-mail the name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of the \\"contact person\\" for that program; someone will contact that person for further information as the second edition is developed. If you would like to correct an error or to provide specific \\"update\\" information, please e-mail that information or return the card included in the book. Following is a description of how the book was researched and the profiles compiled: The research process began with a list, drawn up by career center staff at University of California at Santa Barbara, of 412 environmental programs, departments, and schools within universities across the country. The list was based on a literature search, queries over the Internet, and contact with environmental professionals and associations. Certificate-only programs were not included. Selection preference was given to programs mentioned repeatedly by environmental professionals, and to those drawing a more diverse student body. Postcards requesting information and course catalogues were sent to all 412 programs. A survey was mailed to faculty representing each program. Of the 412 graduate programs queried, 156 programs completed and returned their surveys. Each completed survey was reworked into a profile. Schools that did not respond to the mailing were contacted twice by phone to remind them to return the survey. To supplement this information, and to ensure that the most noteworthy programs were included in the guide, additional profiles were compiled for a select number of key programs that failed to return their surveys. These latter profiles were based on literature review and personal interviews. In all, each program was contacted three times  once by mail and twice by phone  to encourage them to submit their surveys, and to verify and update information. The absence of a particular profile, or segment of a profile, reflects no editorial judgement on the part of the authors. Rather, if a specific program was not profiled, the most likely explanation is that the program in question did not return its survey. If you have information on other graduate environmental programs, please pass that information on to us, so that we can include them in future editions of the guide. Most of the information provided was accurate as of November 1994  the date by which the surveys were completed  and some follow-up verification was conducted during the summer of 1996, before the book went into production. There are an ever-expanding number of programs in the environmental field, and existing programs are constantly evolving. Readers should therefore expect to continue to encounter ongoing changes in names, titles, and phone numbers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cBcmUFb2QX8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cambridge Companion to Oscar Wilde","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Western Dominance and Political Islam: Challenge and Response","description":"Sayeed explores the kinds of resistance Western hegemony has provoked in the Middle East and shows that, although Islamic fundamentalism cannot provide a viable alternative to Western political, cultural, and economic systems, some of the major Islamic ideas can do so.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p-ACeRAH5J0C&dq=Western+Dominance+and+Political+Islam:+Challenge+and+Response&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet British Columbia (Lonely Planet British Columbia & the Canadian Rockies)","description":"Lonely Planet's British Columbia & the Canadian Rockies is your most up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Unlike the only previous edition, published in 1928, it contains full annotation, pertinent information on the authors and works commonplaced, and a rationale for dating the entries. Thus it is now possible to show that most of the four hundred seven passages were entered when Jefferson was a young man, between the ages of fifteen and thirty. As such, they reflect the range of his literary interests from his school days to about the time of his marriage and involvement in politics. As one of the few surviving documents from Jefferson's early years, this notebook assumes special importance as a source of insight into the least known period of his life. In the introduction the editor presents reasons for thinking that the commonplace book was more to Jefferson than a literary sampler and was in some respects a deeply personal notebook with direct connections to the emotional events and preoccupations of his formative years. In addition to the text and annotation, the book contains a register of authors and an illustrated essay on Jefferson's handwriting that provides the rationale for assigning approximate dates to the entries of the commonplace book.

The art of the theater commanded special attention. The text in this volume is a loose collection of essays by Oskar Schlemmer, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and Farkas Moln r (who in an illustrated essay shares his vision of a total theatre space), with an introduction by Bauhaus leader Walter Gropius. Originally published in German in 1924, Die B hne im Bauhaus was translated by A. S. Wensinger and published by Wesleyan in 1961. It was prepared with the full cooperation of Walter Gropius and his introduction was written specially for this edition. From Bauhaus experiments there emerged a new aesthetic of stage design and presentation, a new concept of  total theater.  Its principles and practices, revolutionary in their time and far in advance of all but the most experimental stagecraft today, were largely the work of Oskar Schlemmer, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and their students. Profusely illustrated and startling in its typography (the work of Moholy-Nagy), the 1924 volume quickly became a collector s item and is now virtually unobtainable. Those interested in the stage, the modern visual arts, or in the bold steps of the men of genius who broadened the horizons of aesthetic experience will appreciate that this translation is available again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iv79BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad: Book One","description":"The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad means Way of the Eternal.

No wonder suffering patients preferred the vegetable preparations and cooling liniments of Dr. Still. Times were ripe for practitioners such as Dr. Still. Medicine was in transition, and doctors were questioning the use of massive doses of drugs such as calomel and opium. With common sense and caution Dr. Still steered a middle course between the harsh measures of the time. His reputation for cures spread and his practice prospered.

Written by a gifted teacher and respected valuation authority, Damodaran on Valuation offers systematic examination of the three basic approaches to valuation - discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation, and contingent claim valuation - and the various models within these broad categories. Using numerous real-world examples involving both US and International firms, the book illuminates the purpose of each particular model, its advantages and limitatations, the step-by-step process involved in putting the model to work, and the kinds of firms to which it is best applied. Among the tools presented are designed to: * Estimate the cost of equity - including the capital asset pricing model and arbitrage pricing model * Estimate growth rates - with coverage of how to arrive at a weighted average of growth rates by blending three separate approaches * Value equity - focusing on the Gordon Growth Model and the two-and three-stage dividend discount model * Measure free cash flow to equity - cash flows that are carefully delineated from the dividends of most firms * Value firms - including free cash flow to firm models, which are especially suited to highly leveraged firms * Estimate the value of assets by looking at the pricing of comparable assets - with insight into the use and misuse of price/earning and price/book value ratios, and underutilized price-to-sales ratios * Measure the value of assets that share option characteristics - including a comparative look at the classic Black-Scholes and simpler binomial models. Supported by an optional IBM-compatible disk, which consists of spreadsheet programs designed to help users apply the models highlighted in the book, Damodaran on Valuation provides practitioners involved in securities analysis, portfolio management, M&A, and corporate finance with the knowledge they need to value any asset.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vle7wAEACAAJ&dq=Damodaran+on+Valuation,+Study+Guide:+Security+Analysis+for+Investment+and+Corporate+Finance+(Wiley+Professional+Banking+and+Finance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiking the Southwest's Canyon Country","description":"The beautiful landscape of the Four Corners Region and other Natural Monument areas come to life through an indispensable hiking guide covering trails suited for all skill levels, complete with maps, itineraries, and color photos.

It began in 1970 as a mere gathering of Texas road gamblers who rendezvoused at Binion's Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas each spring. Today it has become a cultural phenomenon, attracting exhaustive national television coverage, legions of fans, and thousands of players, from legendary professionals to amateurs with little experience outside of their home games. And with good reason. The prize money for the 2005 tournament was more than the purses of the Masters, the Kentucky Derby, and Wimbledon combined. Professional poker players themselves, authors Jonathan Grotenstein and Storms Reback combine interviews, firsthand accounts, and extensive archival research into a comprehensive and highly entertaining look at this incredibly unique experience, recounting its history through the breathtaking and sometimes brutal hands played at the Horseshoe's tables. They introduce colorful and seemingly fearless characters who, over the tournament's thirty-five-year history, have been lured by huge paydays and the chance to play against the best in the world, including the legends:   Veteran road gamblers like Doyle Brunson and Amarillo Slim, whose success at the tables helped push poker into the national spotlight   The troubled poker savant Stuey \\"The Kid\\" Ungar, who would eclipse his unlikely debut at the World Series with an even more improbable comeback   And many others like \\"Poker Brat\\" Phil Hellmuth, who proved that you didn't need to be old or from Texas to master the game, and Chris Moneymaker, the man with the impossible name who parlayed $40 into $2.5 million All In is a no-limit look at the phenomenal transformation of poker from a vice hidden in shady back rooms into the hottest game on the planet. Where some of the World Series's simple charms have been lost, they have been replaced by a complicated human drama, huge in scope, where luck and skill forge an exciting and unpredictable intersection. Simply put, there is nothing else like it in the world. \\"If my old pal Benny Binion were still with us, he'd wet his britches seeing that his little publicity stunt in 1970 between a few Texans became a tournament with over $25 million in prize money. If you've ever played a hand of Texas Hold'em, you won't want to miss this book.\\"  Amarillo Slim Preston, 1972 World Series of Poker champion and author of Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People \\"Reading this book is like having Johnny Moss, Doyle Brunson, Amarillo Slim, and every single one of the World Series of Poker champions over to the house for dinner, a beer, tall tales, and a fine game of No Limit Texas Hold'em.\\"   Phil Gordon, coauthor of Poker: The Real Deal and cohost of Celebrity Poker Showdown","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=evfshFCaxFgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonderful fool: A novel (Tut books : L)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vtTgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Wonderful+fool:+A+novel+(Tut+books+:+L)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When eight bells toll","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OmbUvgEACAAJ&dq=When+eight+bells+toll&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neural Mechanisms of Color Vision: Double-Opponent Cells in the Visual Cortex","description":"Dr. Conway mapped the spatial and temporal structure of the cone inputs to single neurons in the primary visual cortex of the alert macaque. Color cells had receptive fields that were often Double-Opponent, an organization of spatial and chromatic opponency sufficient to form the basis for color constancy and spatial color contrast. Almost all color cells gave a bigger response to color when preceded by an opposite color, suggesting that these cells also encode temporal color contrast. In sum, color perception is likely subserved by a subset of specialized neurons in the primary visual cortex. These cells are distinct from those that likely underlie form and motion perception. Color cells establish three color axes sufficient to describe all colors; moreover these cells are capable of computing spatial and temporal color contrast - and probably contribute to color constancy computations - because the receptive fields of these cells show spatial and temporal chromatic opponency.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2S2gBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krinkelt-Rocherath: The Battle for the Twin Villages","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZvvAAAAMAAJ&dq=Krinkelt-Rocherath:+The+Battle+for+the+Twin+Villages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nirvana - The Lyrics","description":"Most Nirvana songs are well known and this collection includes all of their commercially released titles, plus a selection of their B-side singles and a handful of rare tracks to round out the collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nX4_2TddHEsC&dq=Nirvana+-+The+Lyrics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON OF THE NEW TESTAMENT and Other Early Christian Literature","description":"Described as an \\"invaluable reference work\\" (Classical Philology) and \\"a tool indispensable for the study of early Christian literature\\" (Religious Studies Review) in its previous edition, this new updated American edition of Walter Bauer's W?rterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments builds on its predecessor's staggering deposit of extraordinary erudition relating to Greek literature from all periods. Including entries for many more words, the new edition also lists more than 25,000 additional references to classical, intertestamental, Early Christian, and modern literature. In this edition, Frederick W. Danker's broad knowledge of Greco-Roman literature, as well as papyri and epigraphs, provides a more panoramic view of the world of Jesus and the New Testament. Danker has also introduced a more consistent mode of reference citation, and has provided a composite list of abbreviations to facilitate easy access to this wealth of information. Perhaps the single most important lexical innovation of Danker's edition is its inclusion of extended definitions for Greek terms. For instance, a key meaning of \\"episkopos\\" was defined in the second American edition as overseer; Danker defines it as \\"one who has the responsibility of safeguarding or seeing to it that something is done in the correct way, guardian.\\" Such extended definitions give a fuller sense of the word in question, which will help avoid both anachronisms and confusion among users of the lexicon who may not be native speakers of English. Danker's edition of Bauer's W?rterbuch will be an indispensable guide for Biblical and classical scholars, ministers, seminarians, and translators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4gyfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HMS Beagle (Voyages S.)","description":"This is Charles Darwin's chronicle of his five-year journey, beginning in 1831, around the world as a naturalist on the H.M.S.

With his characteristic upbeat style, Dr. Twerski explains: -The seemingly illogical compulsion of overeating and its connection to low self-esteem -The origins and evolutions of low self-esteem and how to identify common problems of a negative self-image -How to rely on yourself, instead of food, in times of stress, anger, and fear -How to deal with friends and family members who may contribute to and unhealthy self-image and eating habits -How to find the courage to change the life-long habits and where to get outside help in the form of therapy and support groups With Dr. Twerski's straightforward and honest approach, losing weight is redefined as gaining a sense of self and banishing diets forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0naty2avKzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Bible - NKJV (New King James Version) - Concordance - Giant Print Center Column Reference Edition - Words of Christ in Red - Blue Bonded Leather - 993b (Leather Bound) (NKJV)","description":"The Premier Collection edition of Thomas Nelson's NKJV Classic Verse-by-Verse Center-Column Reference showcases the highest levels of design and craftsmanship: a supple goatskin leather cover, raised spine hubs, durable edge-lined binding, premium European Bible paper, beautiful art gilded edges, three satin ribbon markers, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KLZywwEACAAJ&dq=Holy+Bible+-+NKJV+(New+King+James+Version)+-+Concordance+-+Giant+Print+Center+Column+Reference+Edition+-+Words+of+Christ+in+Red+-+Blue+Bonded+Leather+-+993b+(Leather+Bound)+(NKJV)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counting Raindrops Through a Stained Glass Window","description":"\\"The surest way to ruin a relationship is to marry the man you love.\\" At least that's what Vanella Morris believes; she's seen the crazy things that marriage makes people do.

Not since Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals has a book so thoroughly and effectively explored the full range of emotions that exist throughout the animal kingdom. From dancing squirrels to bashful gorillas to spiteful killer whales, Masson and coauthor Susan McCarthy bring forth fascinating anecdotes and illuminating insights that offer powerful proof of the existence of animal emotion. Chapters on love, joy, anger, fear, shame, compassion, and loneliness are framed by a provocative re-evaluation of how we treat animals, from hunting and eating them to scientific experimentation.

When he marries a pious woman and fathers a daughter, he is determined to educate his progeny to be  free.  The ultimate proof of his daughter s unfettered liberty? That she become his secret lover.

Joan Lisa Bromberg's book documents the history of the American magnetic fusion reactor program. It is also a lively account that will inform interested citizens of limited technical background who are concerned with the nation's energy strategy. The book carries the story from the program's inception under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to its operations under the then-new Department of Energy in 1978. Fusion concentrates on the four federally funded laboratories where most of the money has been spent (about $2 billion so far): Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Princeton. It recounts the crucial experiments along the way - the ones that succeeded, the ones that failed, the ones that showed \\"promise.\\" And it explains and diagrams the various magnetic configurations and devices that were developed and tested: the \\"stellarator,\\" the \\"pinch,\\" the \\"mirror,\\" the \\"tokamak.\\" With the government and the public constantly looking over the scientists' shoulders, it is no surprise that research directions were heavily influenced by extrascientific pressures: \\"the major decisions in fusion research have always emerged from a medley of technical, institutional, and political considerations.\\" The intermingling of science and politics is demonstrated in specific detail. The magnetic fusion reactor project is, of course, ongoing. Latest target date for producing commercial power: 2050. Estimated total cost: $15 billion. Dr. Bromberg has written extensively on topics in the history of modern science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC&dq=Fusion:+Science,+Politics,+and+the+Invention+of+a+New+Energy+Source&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Victorian Village","description":"From New York Times bestselling author Sheila Connolly, The Secret Staircase is the third Victorian Village Mystery which finds Katherine Hamilton discovering a long-dead body on a hidden staircase.

Even two recent murders aren't enough to discourage her: after she helped to solve them, she put them behind her. Now comes the time to make real plans, and her first goal is to renovate the Barton Mansion on the outskirts of town. Luckily, it's been maintained in good condition in the century since the wealthy Henry Barton lived and died there. So the only substantial change she's planning is to update the original kitchen so that it can be used to cater events in the building. But when the contractor gets started, he discovers a staircase that had been walled in years earlier. And of course, given the way Kate's luck has been going, there's a body on the stairs. After the first shock, Kate is relieved when the autopsy reveals that the man had died around 1880. Unfortunately, it also reveals that he had not died a natural death he had been murdered. And the questions remain: who was he and what was he doing there? So Kate and Carroll Peterson, who Kate had drafted to sort through Henry Barton's papers, start a hunt to identify the man and why he died at the Barton Mansion.

Michael McCarthy, historical battlefield guide This book tells the story of the battle for Goose Green the first crucial clash of the Falklands War through the eyes of the commanders, both British and Argentine, from brigadier to corporal. It follows in detail, with the aid of maps, the fourteen hours of vicious infantry as both sides struggled for the tiny settlement of Goose Green. The book explains how 2 Para came close to failure as the battalion fought over open ground, in daylight, without adequate fire support against prepared positions. Controversial questions such as: Was it an unnecessary battle? Why did London overrule the brigadier commander s reluctance to attack? Did Col. Jones s solo charge, which won him the Victoria Cross, decide the issue? are discussed frankly. The author, himself a former infantry officer, has had the full support of the Parachute Regiment, and has assembled the views and comments of over forty-five veterans of all ranks who fought there.  The Falklands War showed British military personnel at their best and most innovative under the most testing of conditions, and the Battle of Goose Green was one of the classic actions . . . The author has made an impressive job of reviewing the important factors, the events and decisions that led to the battle.

Not realizing that, excepting a few praiseworthy individuals, these exhibitors were only superficially concerned with the qualities of use and companionship, an unfortunate dog owner would accept the sight of trophies or ribbons as the credits of an expert. Growing numbers of people and dogs continued to emphasize the advantages of proper dog-behavior and when, in 1935, The American Kennel Club instituted its obedience trials, the competition necessary to focus attention on results and improvement of methods was provided. And something else was observed. It was evident that thorough obedience training does more than assure a dog s response to his master s command; capacities for learning and emotional stability could be increased and integrated as permanent qualities of character. Recently, leading magazines of both general and specialized nature have made the public aware of the trained dog s potential, and of the recreational possibilities of dog training as a hobby. Interest in dog-training classes and other activities where dogs are dignified by usefulness, rather than merely looked at, is evidence that the dog-training public has outgrown the  make a game  and  tid-bit tossing  techniques that, by not being founded on positive and proper motivations, demonstrate the inadequacy of the master, thus promoting failure of response at those times when control is most needed, as well as contributing to the dog s feeling of insecurity. Dog owners of perspective have come to want the type of obedience upon which a blind person might stake his life, and the emotional stability that is vital to dogs in the presence of small, unpredictable children.

Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She s a product of the  burg,  a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase should be interesting and could also be extremely dangerous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z66WDwAAQBAJ&dq=1+FOR+THE+MONEY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Garden's story,","description":"By Mary Garden and Louis Biancolli.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_oQsAQAAIAAJ&dq=Mary+Garden%27s+story,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Exam with CD-ROM, Fifth Edition: Higher Score Guaranteed (Kaplan GRE Premier Program (W/CD))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w0ln1aJ5xGIC&dq=Kaplan+GRE+Exam+with+CD-ROM,+Fifth+Edition:+Higher+Score+Guaranteed+(Kaplan+GRE+Premier+Program+(W/CD))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethan Allen: The Treasury of American Traditional Interiors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uAD8HAAACAAJ&dq=Ethan+Allen:+The+Treasury+of+American+Traditional+Interiors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Samurai AD 200-1500 (Elite)","description":"War played a central part in the history of Japan.

The most ambitious plan was developed in 1923 by John Nolen, who believed that an interconnected system of preserves and parks would enhance the city's development and attract tourists for generations. His initiative failed miserably at the polls, however, because it threatened the conflicting notion of paradise held by hundreds of investors, who were profiting from the greatest real estate boom in the nation's history and feared that planning would curtail speculation. As Stephenson points out, a half century would pass until a series of ecological disasters in the 1970s finally compelled city officials to adopt an environmentally sound development plan that reflected Nolen's original vision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y19PAAAAMAAJ&dq=VISIONS+OF+EDEN:+ENVIROMENTALISM,+URBAN+PLANNING,+AND+CIT+(URBAN+LIFE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Banana-Tail","description":"A little brown monkey eats so many bananas that his tail turns yellow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mOHHAAACAAJ&dq=Banana-Tail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lyndon Larouche and the New American Fascism","description":"Investigates the political and personal make-up of a politician whose allegiances have shifted over the years from the far left to the extreme right and explores LaRouche's cult following and his vision for the nation's future","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JBR5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Lyndon+Larouche+and+the+New+American+Fascism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds (Campaign)","description":"Osprey's Campaign title for one of the most important campaigns of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). Agincourt is one of the most evocative names in English military history. Henry V's forces were tired, hungry, and faced a French army three to six times more numerous. However, they possessed several advantages, and English success resulted from the combination of heavily armoured men-at-arms with troops armed with the infamous longbow - the havoc this weapon wreaked was crucial. Using original fifteenth century evidence, including the surviving French battle plan and the accounts of men present in both armies, this title discusses the lead-up to the battle, the tactical dispositions of the two forces and the reasons for the ultimate English success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4wUvgAACAAJ&dq=Agincourt+1415:+Triumph+against+the+odds+(Campaign)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homosexuality: The Use of Scientific Research in the Church's Moral Debate","description":"How prevalent is homosexuality? What causes it? Is it a psychopathology? Can it be changed? Questions like these often accompany discussions of homosexual behavior. For answers we naturally look to scientific studies. But what does the scientific research actually show? More important, what place should this research have in shaping the church's response? Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse help us face these issues squarely and honestly. In four central chapters they examine how scientific research has been used within church debates--in particular within Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal contexts. They then survey the most recent and best scientific research and sort out what it actually shows. Next they help us to interpret the research's relevance to the moral debate within the church. In a concluding chapter they make a strong case for a traditional Christian sexual ethic. Church groups considering these complex issues will find helpful discussion questions at the end of each chapter. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the church's debate over homosexual behavior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-HUnQEACAAJ&dq=Homosexuality:+The+Use+of+Scientific+Research+in+the+Church%27s+Moral+Debate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rosa Mundi,: And other stories,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3h47AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Bartlet's White House: An Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the West Wing","description":"The West Wing has been one of the most talked-about and critically acclaimed series in the UK, and in the US it is NBC's biggest hit drama show in years, Inside Bartlet's White House is an unofficial and indispensable guide to the show, diving deep into the world of American Politics and searching for the truth and integrity behind the Bartlet administration.

Reginald Hill  raised the classical British mystery to new heights  when he introduced pugnacious Yorkshire Det. Inspector Andrew Dalziel and his partner, the callow Sgt. Peter Pascoe (The New York Times Book Review). Their chafing differences in education, manners, technique, and temperament made them  the most remarkable duo in the annals of crime fiction  (Toronto Star).

If Alison Girling, former principal of England s Holm Coultram College, died in an avalanche in Austria, why has her skeleton been unearthed on campus? While no love is lost between conservative detective Andrew Dalziel and the entirety of Liberal Arts, his attention to the grim discovery must be paid. But when he and Peter Pascoe scour the ivory tower for answers, they discover that the shady faculty and creepy student body have more to bury than just one corpse. Try two and counting. As Pascoe is sidelined by an old college flame, Dalziel s suspicions of academia are becoming dire. Because the deeper he digs for secrets, the dirtier they get in this  steadily, edgily amusing . . . dark comedy  (Kirkus Reviews).

Charlie Gere s account of growing up in the World s End area of West London during the Cold War combines local history, cultural history, memoir, and a strong sense of the apocalyptic. Once a rundown part of Chelsea at the wrong end of the King s Road, the World s End has long been a place for bohemian writers and artists, including Turner, Whistler, Beckett, Bacon, and Bacon s muse Henrietta Moraes, all of whom evinced an appropriate apocalyptic sensibility. After World War II, in which the area suffered severe bombing, it became a center of the counterculture that emerged from what Jeff Nuttall called  Bomb Culture,  formed by the threat of nuclear annihilation. The famous boutique Granny Takes a Trip opened there in 1966, joined later on by Hung On You, Puss Weber s Flying Dragon Tea Room, and the commune Gandalf s Garden. The area also featured trepanning aristocrats and pet lions, among other eccentricities. In the 1970s, the World s End was the center of punk rock. Gere s parents arrived as part of a wave of gentrification, and Gere, born and brought up there, witnessed its social and cultural evolution. As an adolescent, he was traumatized by the prospect of nuclear war. He has lived long enough to see the World s End now bearing the marks of out-of-control neoliberalism and its grotesque accompanying inequality. But this too shall pass as worlds end.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PagvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Glorious Adventures of Cyl Ulenspiegl","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aTFSAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Glorious+Adventures+of+Cyl+Ulenspiegl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Jesse: A Story of Youth, Illness, and Medicine","description":"The story of a young man's illness and confrontation with death as seen through the eyes of his father.

The book is an exposition of Wittgenstein's early conception of the nature of representation and how his later revision and criticism of that work led to a radically different way of looking at mind and language. It also explains how the unpublished manuscripts and typescripts were put together and why they often provide better evidence of the development of his ideas than can be found in his published writing. In doing so, the book traces the development of a number of central themes in Wittgenstein's philosophy, including his conception of philosophical method, the picture theory of meaning, the limits of language, the application of language to experience, his treatment of private language, and what he called the \\"flow of life.\\" Arguing that Wittgenstein's views are often much more simple (and more radical) than we have been led to believe, Wittgenstein on Mind and Language provides an overview of the development of Wittgenstein's philosophy and brings to light aspects of his philosophy that have been almost universally neglected.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TEDnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Wittgenstein+on+Mind+and+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the American Bar","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPUUAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You!

Yet his reign has a significance in English history out of all proportion to its brief six-year span. In this lavishly illustrated book, Diarmaid MacCulloch underlines the significance of Edward's turbulent and neglected reign. He takes a fresh look at the life and beliefs of the young king and of the ruthless politicians who jostled for power around him and analyzes the single-minded strategy for bringing in the Protestant revolution. Although the regime collapsed in apparent failure and disgrace on Edward's death in 1553, the story does not end there; a second half-sister, Elizabeth, succeeded Mary and brought Protestantism back to the official Church, though in a subtly different form. The tensions between her vision of the Church and that of the dead boy king continued to haunt English religion. MacCulloch traces the strange afterlife of Edward's reign, its surprising connections with the civil wars which convulsed the British Isles a century later, and the effect it still has on English life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2MW_wAEACAAJ&dq=The+Boy+King:+Edward+VI+and+the+Protestant+Reformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lexis: Larousse De La Langue Francaise","description":"Riche de 76 000 mots du vocabulaire courant ou sp cialis , mais aussi classique et litt raire, le Lexis est le plus complet des dictionnaires en un volume.

As the field grows, there is a pressing need to understand the smaller and more recent immigrant communities. Emerging Voices fills this gap with its unique and compelling discussion of underrepresented groups, including Burmese, Indonesian, Mong, Hmong, Nepalese, Romani, Tibetan, and Thai Americans. Unlike the earlier and larger groups of Asian immigrants to America, many of whom made the choice to emigrate to seek better economic opportunities, many of the groups discussed in this volume fled war or political persecution in their homeland. Forced to make drastic transitions in America with little physical or psychological preparation, questions of  why am I here,   who am I,  and  why am I discriminated against,  remain at the heart of their post-emigration experiences. Bringing together eminent scholars from a variety of disciplines, this collection considers a wide range of themes, including assimilation and adaptation, immigration patterns, community, education, ethnicity, economics, family, gender, marriage, religion, sexuality, and work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WrZd10nU7n4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Models, Metaphors, and Maps for Applying Theoretical Perspectives to Practice","description":"This first edition theories-based book for human behavior provides students with three key tools for theory-by-theory comprehension: models, metaphors and maps.

David Frum helped make international headlines when President George W. Bush s 2002 State of the Union address linked international terrorists to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But that was only one moment during a crucial time in American history, when a president, an administration, and a country were transformed. Frum worked with President Bush in the Oval Office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, and studied him closely at meetings and events. He describes how Bush thinks what this conservative president believes about religion, race, the environment, Jews, Muslims, and America s future. Frum takes us behind the scenes of one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, with revealing portraits of Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. Most significant, he tells the story of the transformation of George W. Bush: how a president whose administration began in uncertainty became one of the most decisive, successful, and popular leaders of our time. Before becoming a White House speechwriter, David Frum was a highly regarded author of books and political commentary and an influential voice on the pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard. His commentary has been described by William F. Buckley as  the most refreshing ideological experience in a generation.  Now, in The Right Man, we see Frum as a front-row observer and participant. Not since Peggy Noonan s account of her time in the Reagan White House has an insider portrayed a sitting president with such precision, verve, honest admiration, and insight. The Right Man will command international attention for its thoughtful account of George W. Bush in the midst of his greatest challenge. It will be an essential reference for anyone seeking to understand who our president really is and how he is likely to lead us in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LzGi031PvHIC&dq=The+Right+Man:+An+Inside+Account+of+the+Bush+White+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Catholic Funeral","description":"In a revised and expanded edition, this simple pamphlet continues to guide us in dealing with death and arranging in advance for funerals.

Since then, scores of clergy, funeral directors, and parishioners have used this guide to address what needs to be done.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uPwyEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Catholic+Funeral&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zll-wojXCP0C&dq=Revelation+and+Reason:+The+Christian+Doctrine+of+Faith+and+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CIA Catalog Of Clandestine Weapons, Tools, And Gadgets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eve and Christopher","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VY4JNAEACAAJ&dq=Eve+and+Christopher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside the Cocaine Cartel: The Riveting Eyewitness Account of Life Inside the Colombian Cartel","description":"In a fictionalized warning to the Free World, former CIA and Mossad intelligence agents race to stop the secret sale of the old Soviet Union's arsenal of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons to fanatical international pariahs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nRpczTmMlKAC&dq=Inside+the+Cocaine+Cartel:+The+Riveting+Eyewitness+Account+of+Life+Inside+the+Colombian+Cartel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Decision Making: 20 Winning Strategies for Women","description":"Offers practical advice about making decisions, and tells how to weigh options, consider alternatives, stand by one's decisions, and avoid being forced into a hasty decision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dEkMBh5hy9IC&dq=The+Art+of+Decision+Making:+20+Winning+Strategies+for+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frames of Mind","description":"First published in 1983 and now available with a new introduction by the author, Gardner's trailblazing book revolutionized the worlds of education and psychology by positing that rather than a single type of intelligence, we have several--most of which are neglected by standard testing and educational methods.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wxj6npSaykgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Muslim Identity: Speaking for Ourselves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kINVPQAACAAJ&dq=The+American+Muslim+Identity:+Speaking+for+Ourselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boss Tweed's New York","description":"At the height of his power in New York City around 1870, William Marcy (Boss) Tweed's hands were everywhere in the city government and party politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KpiuTWhykCgC&dq=Boss+Tweed%27s+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 8: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1862-1865 (Covered Wagon Women 8)","description":"The overland trails in the 1860s witnessed the creation of stage stations to facilitate overland travel.

They also sped up the process of mail delivery to remote Western outposts. Tragically, the easing of overland travel coincided with renewed conflicts with the Cheyenne and other Plains Indians.

The public policy considerations underlying original enactment of the provision in 1867 are not specifically stated. However, it may be inferred from the President's Tax Expenditures Budget of that year that the provision was intended to reduce income tax liabilities for taxpayers in special circumstances which have a significant bearing on financial capacity to pay an income tax. Under present tax rules, the special circumstances include both uninsured personal losses and personal losses following partial insurance reimbursement. In either case, the result is to make the government a coinsurer of losses to nonincome-producing property held for personal use. Statistics indicate that the personal casualty and theft loss deduction does not serve an ability-to-pay function for low income taxpayers unable to afford the cost of insurance. Most of the taxpayers in the sampling used for the report were in the higher income levels and sustained a loss with respect to uninsured or underinsured personal assets. Moreover, 27 percent of the loss property in the sample cases consisted of ornamental trees and shrubbery and miscellaneous personal property, the loss of which does not significantly affect financial capacity for income tax purposes. The regulations of the personal casualty and theft loss deduction are difficult to apply, and there is a high-error rate among those who claim under this provision. Personal casualty and theft loss cases are seldom settled on the basis of the loss computation rules of the regulations. Compliance with the literal requirements of the regulations decreases at successive stages of the appeals process, reflecting the fact that settlement of contested losses is reached by negotiation on the basis of litigating hazards. Finally, inequities result from the computation-of-loss rules and the netting requirements of the regulations which result in different tax treatment to taxpayers who have suffered like economic losses to uninsured or partially insured personal property.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wb5FAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By the City of the long sand;: A tale of new China,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0w4bmsTiGPYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The True Story of Mary, Wife of Lincoln","description":"The true story of Mary, wife of Lincoln : containing the recollections of Mary Lincoln's sister Emilie (Mrs. Ben Hardin Helm), extracts from her war-time diary, numerous letters and other documents now first published.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kLVYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+True+Story+of+Mary,+Wife+of+Lincoln&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keynes's 'General theory': A retrospective view","description":"This antiquarian book contains Arthur Cecil Pigou s 1950 economic treatise,  Keynes's General Theory - A Retrospective View . This fascinating monograph will appeal to those with an interest in modern economics, and is not to be missed by collectors of such literature. John Maynard Keynes (18831946) was a British economist whose contributions to economic theory have provided the foundation for modern macroeconomics and governmental economic policies. He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and his ideas became the basis for the school of thought known as 'Keynesian economics' and its various offshoots. Arthur Cecil Pigou (18771959) was an English economist and lecturer, who was pivotal in the formation and development of the University of Cambridge s school of economics. Many vintage texts such as this are becoming increasingly rare and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now, in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition.

As the bathroom line was too long, she headed to the street to take a leak. Jong squatted just behind some junked furniture on the curb of the sidewalk, and her pee trickled down like wet paint on a wall. Being a photographer, she had her Yashica T4 with her, and turned around to her suspect puddle to capture what she thought looked more like blood in a murder scene than pee. Since that fateful urination, Jong has captured her tracks through New York, Miami, Shanghai, and Mexico, the countryside, woodside, and seaside, under moonlight and opposite sunset. Since then, Jong has amassed a sizeable body of work, a collection of images that fuse documentary, landscape, and fine art photography and portraiture into a uniquely personal statement. The work, exhibited at various galleries, is all gathered in Pees on Earth; a collection of images that are at once challenging, provocative, intriguing, courageous, amusing, and beautiful. These images capture not only Jong s rebellious exuberance, but also offer a comment on what constitutes the personal and the political. Pees on Earth is a statement about the ownership of self, of sensuality, of humanity, and of womanhood all expressed with beauty and a great deal of humor. There s a sigh of relief on every page of Pees on Earth. Jong s photographs assert her place on the planet and, because we all share the act, they assert ours too. It is a manifesto for our collective existence, a cry for all sentient beings:  I am! I pee!

Roediger has brought together some of the most important black writers throughout history to explore the question: What does it really mean to be white in America? From folktales and slave narratives to contemporary essays, poetry, and fiction, black writers have long been among America's keenest students of white consciousness and white behavior, but until now much of this writing has been ignored. Black on White reverses this trend by presenting the work of more than fifty major figures, including James Baldwin, Derrick Bell, Ralph Ellison, W.E.B. Du Bois, bell hooks, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker to take a closer look at the many meanings of whiteness in our society. Rich in irony, artistry, passion, and common sense, these reflections on what Langston Hughes called \\"the ways of white folks\\" illustrate how whiteness as a racial identity derives its meaning not as a biological category but as a social construct designed to uphold racial inequality. Powerful and compelling, Black on White provides a much-needed perspective that is sure to have a major impact on the study of race and race relations in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7omPKIohZSgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Instinct For Bliss -","description":"Twelve stories on people in search of fulfillment.

These new uses for information serve to highlight our need to protect di?erent aspects of information. Cryptology may be broadly de?ned as the scienti?c study of adversarial information protection. Cryptology has traditionally dealt with the co- dentiality of information, but innovation in using information produces new requirements for protection of that information. Some are longstanding and fundamental - how do we guarantee that information is  authentic ? How do we guarantee that information is timely? How can we produce bits that have the same properties as  money ? Each of these questions has been grappled with in the cryptologic research community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CiKqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Six decades in Texas;: Or, Memoirs of Francis Richard Lubbock, governor of Texas in war time, 1861-63.

More often than not his inner compass pointed west or southwest. The future lies that way to me, he explained, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side. In his own imaginative way, Thoreau was imitating the countless young pioneers, prospectors, and entrepreneurs who were zealously following Horace Greeley's famous advice to go west. Yet while the epic chapter in American history opened by these adventurous men and women is filled with stories of frontier hardship, we rarely think of one of their greatest problems--the lack of water resources. And the same difficulty that made life so troublesome for early settlers remains one of the most pressing concerns in the western states of the late-twentieth century. The American West, blessed with an abundance of earth and sky but cursed with a scarcity of life's most fundamental need, has long dreamed of harnessing all its rivers to produce unlimited wealth and power. In Rivers of Empire, award-winning historian Donald Worster tells the story of this dream and its outcome. He shows how, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Mormons were the first attempting to make that dream a reality, damming and diverting rivers to irrigate their land. He follows this intriguing history through the 1930s, when the federal government built hundreds of dams on every major western river, thereby laying the foundation for the cities and farms, money and power of today's West. Yet while these cities have become paradigms of modern American urban centers, and the farms successful high-tech enterprises, Worster reminds us that the costs have been extremely high. Along with the wealth has come massive ecological damage, a redistribution of power to bureaucratic and economic elites, and a class conflict still on the upswing. As a result, the future of this hydraulic West is increasingly uncertain, as water continues to be a scarce resource, inadequate to the demand, and declining in quality. Rivers of Empire represents a radically new vision of the American West and its historical significance. Showing how ecological change is inextricably intertwined with social evolution, and reevaluating the old mythic and celebratory approach to the development of the West, Worster offers the most probing, critical analysis of the region to date. He shows how the vast region encompassing our western states, while founded essentially as colonies, have since become the true seat of the American Empire. How this imperial West rose out of desert, how it altered the course of nature there, and what it has meant for Thoreau's (and our own) mythic search for freedom and the American Dream, are the central themes of this eloquent and thought-provoking story--a story that begins and ends with water.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6WZ57o5Kcy0C&dq=Rivers+of+Empire:+Water,+Aridity+and+the+Growth+of+the+American+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranger in a Strange Land","description":"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time.

The title poem of this collection records Richard Cecil's quest for the tombs of the famous dead. At first the search leads him on a tour of famous European tombstones  the grave of Chateaubriand in St. Malo, the shared tomb of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Pere-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, Yeats's old Celtic cross in Sligo  but gradually it expands into areas where all the tombs have been erased by time or vandalism  the tombs of Seneca and Lucan, and all of the great dead poets whose names have been lost. These once famous, now unknown poets lead Cecil to consider those graveyards full of anonymous dead  the civil war soldiers buried under tiny stones with numbers instead of names inscribed on them. Are they more anonymous than the once famous, now forgotten \\"great\\" dead? Though Cecil is wryly aware of his own obscurity, his poems are strangely optimistic and life-affirming. His reply to Emily Dickinson's question: \\"I'm Nobody  are you / Nobody, too?\\" is an enthusiastic yes! In Search of the Great Dead conveys the joy of being Nobody and the shy, almost buried hope that someday (after death), he might become Somebody.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6u5TMG0RBzAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lexiwine/Wine Dictionary English-French/Lexivine/Au Service De LA Vigne Et Du Vin Francais-Anglais","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ethics Of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government (Public Affairs and Policy Administration)","description":"\\"Rosemary O Leary s The Ethics of Dissent offers a novel take on rule breakers and whistle-blowers in the federal government.

These public servants are dissatisfied with the actions of the organizations for which they work, but often choose not to go public with their concerns.

New to the Third Edition: New examples of guerrilla government showcase the power of public servants as well as their ethical obligations. Key concepts are connected to real examples, such as Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to sign the marriage certificates of gay couples, and Kevin Chmielewski, the deputy chief of staff for operations at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who led environmental groups to the wrong doings of EPA Administrator Scott Prewitt.

After a trail of fake paintings of astonishing quality led federal agents to art dealers, renowned experts, and the major auction houses, the investigation inexplicably ended, despite an abundance of evidence collected. The case was closed and the FBI file was marked  exempt from public disclosure.  Now that the statute of limitations on these crimes has expired and the case appears hermetically sealed shut by the FBI, this book, Caveat Emptor, is Ken Perenyi s confession.

Concentrating on the instability and fluidity of Shakespeare's texts, her book discusses what happened to a manuscript between its first composition, its performance on stage and its printing, and identifies traces of the production system in the plays we read. She argues that the versions of Shakespeare that have come down to us have inevitably been formed by the contexts from which they emerged; being shaped by, for example, the way actors received and responded to their lines, the props and music used in the theatre, or the continual revision of plays by the playhouses and printers. Allowing a fuller understanding of the texts we read and perform, Making Shakespeare is the perfect introduction to issues of stage and page.

The Gospel of Mark, the second book in the A Whole New World series, leads us into the heart of a whole new world of insight and transformation right where we are.

While most Irish Catholic immigrants who poured into the region in the nineteenth century were poor and illiterate, John and Sarah Dooley were affluent and well educated. They brought sophistication and capital to Virginia, where John established one of the largest hat manufacturing companies in the United States. Noted for their business acumen and community service, the Dooleys became leaders in business, education, culture, and politics in Virginia. A bellwether of the South during these tumultuous times, the Dooleys' fortunes would rise and fall and rise again. Mary Lynn Bayliss recounts the family s history during their prosperous antebellum years, John and his sons  service in the Confederate army, John s exploits as leader of the Richmond Ambulance Committee, and the loss of the entire Dooley retail and manufacturing operations during the final days of the Civil War. After the war the Dooleys  son James, a leading Richmond lawyer and philanthropist, devoted half a century to developing railroad networks across the United States, and became a key figure in the industrialization of the New South. He and his wife, Sallie, built Maymont, the famed Gilded Age estate that remains a major attraction in Richmond.

But in Shaq Talks Back, Shaquille O'Neal for the first time talks frankly about his childhood, his life, his rivalries, and his career, culminating in a dramatic, behind-the-scenes account of the Los Angeles Lakers' drive to the NBA Championship. At seven feet one inch tall and 330 pounds, Shaq has always faced outsized expectations, even as a child when he towered over other kids. Shaq Talks Back is the story of how potential became reality-- how someone expected to be a champion finally learned to become one. Beginning with his memory of crying on the court after the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers, Shaq takes us back to his younger days in Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, then to Georgia and finally to Germany, where he began to harness some of his height and strength. From there, he recounts the remarkable progress of his basketball career, changing from a big but inexperienced teenager to a dominant college and professional player. Shaq talks about: * Playing at Louisiana State University for the unpredictable coach Dale Brown * Signing the biggest rookie contract ever with the Orlando Magic-- and going to the NBA Finals for the first time * What happened next: dissention, disappointment, and his decision to leave for Los Angeles * The dysfunctional Lakers who were never able to win the big games * Dealing with egos as he finds the right chemistry with Kobe Bryant, Phil Jackson, and new additions to the team * Rivalries with Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and others * The trouble with free throws... * \\"Bling-bling\\" and women: the larger-than-life world of NBA players off the court * Inside the Lakers' comeback from the brink against Portland and the drive to the NBA championship Funny, insightful, opinionated, and unexpectedly moving, Shaq Talks Back is the true voice of the NBA's best player.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=plSOAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Little Patchwork Quilts: With Full-Size Templates (Dover Quilting)","description":"Patterns for quickly worked \\"quiltlets\\" (about 16 inches by 20 inches): Drunkard's Path, Gwen's Tulip, London Stairs, more.

This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \\"Four Books\\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Federal Income Tax: Examples and Explanations (Examples & Explanations)","description":"In addition to the wide range of quality textbooks specially created for paralegal programs, Aspen Law & Business also offers a number of law school resources that you may find suitable for use in your course area.Each book in this popular series offers a winning combination of text, examples, and explanations as it guides students to a more thorough understanding of the subject at hand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ro9FAQAAIAAJ&dq=Federal+Income+Tax:+Examples+and+Explanations+(Examples&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More I Learned About Flying From That","description":"The column \\"I Learned About Flying From That\\" has run continuously since 1939 & has consistently ranked as one of Flying magazine's most popular features.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion, Science and Naturalism","description":"Articulates a metaphysical position capable of rendering both science and religious experience simultaneously and mutually intelligible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQFlWi6q29AC&dq=Religion,+Science+and+Naturalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Methods in Educational Research: From Theory to Practice (Research Methods for the Social Sciences)","description":"Methods in Educational Research Methods in Educational Research is designed to prepare students for the real world of educational research.

In the first sequence, Marc Antony had just disemboweled himself, knowing they had lost the war against Octavian and believing that Cleopatra was dead. Hugging his corpse, Cleopatra castigates Octavian and history for its betrayal of her, recalling variously how she had herself delivered to Caesar in a roll of carpet, and bore his child (Caesarion); the twins and third child she bore to Marc Antony; the bitterness of the recent military defeat. At this point Diomedes, variously described as an informer and her official chronicler, intercedes, admitting that this version of the story is not true to the brilliant, accomplished woman who was the true Cleopatra really was. Telling of how he betrayed Cleopatra, by altering the histories of her reign and allowing Caesar and others to destroy or change her scrolls, he begins again with the story of Cleopatra s flight from Pompey (the Roman leader who was placed in charge of Cleopatra and her brothers and sisters after Ptolemy Auletes, her father and ruler of Egypt, died). The girl queen (Cleopatra inherited the throne as a teenager) sneaks with several faithful servants out of the palace into a wagon, accompanied by a group of brightly costumed gladiators, on her way to Ascalon. She and her supporters carve the words Queen of Kings  (Cleopatra s motto in real history) into the boards of the wagon in which she is traveling, and leave it behind when they reach Rome. When they are beset by pirates, Cleopatra stages an elaborate show using some costumes the young gladiator Apollodorus, who has become part of her retinue, helped her buy. She convinces the pirates that she is Isis (a myth which was in reality part of her statecraft). She makes an alliance with them and is taken in peace to Cilicia. The third and longest version of the Cleopatra story is a delightful interlude in which Cleopatra goes live with the Amazons. Cleopatra is at war with the Ruling Council of her husband and brother Ptolemy (she was, historically, forced to marry her brother because she could not rule alone as a woman). The Ruling Council has sent an envoy to summon her to Alexandria to make peace, but when she realizes it is a trap, she flees with her retinue. She arrives in Pelusium, a trade center on the Mediterranean, where many merchants have been stranded by bad weather, and where, as if by magic, she sees a replica of the cart, carved with the words Queen of Kings,  she left behind in Rome. Chased by the reception committee  of the Ruling Council, she escapes on the back of a magical bull. He carries her across the Mediterranean to the land of the Amazons, who take her in. The Amazons welcome her into their society of women, eschewing marriage and traditional female roles to live as warriors and hunters. They sing her the stories of their joining the Amazons and of the many myths that surround them. She meets a group of aged poets, kidnapped by the Amazons to write verses for them, because they love poetry and music. She learns that one Amazon, Orthea, is in love with a god who has the power of extreme heat and cold, and who caused an earthquake that day. The Amazons go to bed, falling into each other s arms and making love. Though initially disgusted, eventually Cleopatra falls asleep in the protective (and erotic) embrace of Hippolyta, the Amazons  queen. The next day, the Amazons go to battle a group of rebellious male warriors who charge the Amazons and seek, ultimately, to follow the Sirens. Charging them on their horses, driving cattle at them, the Amazons battle the men. One of their prized poets, however, in an act of suicide, surrenders himself to the Sirens, who devour him before everyone. This breaks the spell and the men cease their clamoring to get to the Sirens. Cleopatra sees Orthea consummating her passion for the god, which kills her.

Such is the pattern revealed by this historical mosaic. --From the Preface Weaving historical source material with his own incisive analysis, Jack Beatty traces the rise of the American corporation, from its beginnings in the 17th century through today, illustrating how it has come to loom colossus-like over the economy, society, culture, and politics. Through an imaginative selection of readings made up of historical and contemporary documents, opinion pieces, reportage, biographies, company histories, and scenes from literature, all introduced and explicated by Beatty, Colossus makes a convincing case that it is the American corporation that has been, for good and ill, the primary maker and manager of change in modern America. In this anthology, readers are shown how a developing \\"business civilization\\" has affected domestic life in America, how labor disputes have embodied a struggle between freedom and fraternity, how corporate leaders have faced the recurring dilemma of balancing fiduciary with social responsibility, and how Silicon Valley and Wall Street have come to dwarf Capitol Hill in pervasiveness of influence. From the slave trade and the transcontinental railroad to the software giants and the multimedia conglomerates, Colossus reveals how the corporation emerged as the foundation of representative government in the United States, as the builder of the young nation's public works, as the conqueror of American space, and as the inexhaustible engine of economic growth from the Civil War to today. At the same time, Colossus gives perspective to the century-old debate over the corporation's place in the good society. A saga of freedom and domination, success and failure, creativity and conformity, entrepreneurship and monopoly, high purpose and low practice, Colossus is a major historical achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cX9zJctCAqkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Topping from Below","description":"An explosive, erotic novel about two sisters, each of whom embarks upon a voyage into the heart of evil and a game with a seductive man who knows no rules or limits.

You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanesand now of world financial meltdownStrauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor.

By focusing on the lives and personalities of individual entrepreneurs, W. David Lewis and his contributors hope to explore the interaction between technology, government regulation, and entrepreneurship. Each essay in the book focuses on a particular airline executive, such as Eddie Rickenbacker, Robert Six, and Donald Nyrop. Lewis has been careful to give a variety of perspective: Airlines of various types are represented -- large and small, scheduled and unscheduled. Some of the executives profiled were known for having adversative relationships with federal regulators, whereas others wholeheartedly accepted regulation and thrived under it. There have been public calls for a return to airline regulation, and Lewis thinks it is not inconceivable that regulation may ultimately return if problems continue and conditions deteriorate further. But, he say's, it is well to remember that deregulation occurred because there were flaws in the regulatory system it replaced. This collection of essays -- scholarly and well documented but written in a lively style suitable for specialists and nonspecialists alike -- provides a long-range perspective on the issue of airline deregulation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oapOdk8aV0EC&dq=HISTORY+OF+ACCOUNTANCY+IN+USA:+THE+CULTURAL+SIGNIFICANCE+OF+ACCOUNTING+(HISTORICAL+PERSP+BUS+ENTERPRIS)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing to Live: How to Defeat Suicide Through Congnitive Therapy","description":"Discusses the decision to commit suicide, presents strategies to overcome the crisis and get help, and offers a guide for concerned family members and friends","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IqUpPx0oIn0C&dq=Choosing+to+Live:+How+to+Defeat+Suicide+Through+Congnitive+Therapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Home Office: Planning Your Workspace for Maximum Efficiency","description":"Offers advice on home office setup and design, including information on computers, online services, furniture, storage needs, lighting, electrical requirements, acoustics, and heating and ventilation","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EZXzAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Home+Office:+Planning+Your+Workspace+for+Maximum+Efficiency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Famous Roman Orations","description":"Marcus Tullius Cicero was a Roman politician and lawyer, who served as consul in the year 63 BC. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.His influence on the Latin language was so immense that the subsequent history of prose, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century, was said to be either a reaction against or a return to his style. According to Michael Grant, \\"the influence of Cicero upon the history of European literature and ideas greatly exceeds that of any other prose writer in any language\\". Cicero introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary (with neologisms such as evidentia, humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia) distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbPXtAEACAAJ&dq=Famous+Roman+Orations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voodoo That You Do (Pat Gallegher Mysteries)","description":"The second book in the Pat Gallegher Mystery Series.

This book examines traditional prejudices against women's political participation as well as efforts to overcome these prejudices during a revolutionary era. It inquires into the shifting male hierarchies that kept some men out of politics, admitted others to a limited citizenship, and privileged a few men with leadership authority. It also assesses the impact of the founders' gender bias on modern American politics. The gendering of American poltics began as a compromise between traditional patriarchal ideals that subordinated all women to male authority and revolutionary norms that recognized women's capacity for independence, reason, and patriotism. That compromise was manifested in the doctrine of republican womanhood which perpetuated women's exclusion from citizenship but afforded women sufficient educational opportunity and family influence to raise citizens and educate statesmen for the new republic. The gendering of American politics was concluded by a second compromise. The founders often expressed a desire to exclude disorderly men from public life and empower a few heroic men to exercise great leadership powers, but they generally settled for granting weak citizenship to most white family men and supporting elite government by accomplished gentleman legislators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=muM9K1IwyEIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer and the English Reformation, 1489-1556, (Heroes of the Reformation)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aeoiAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Desk Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ARtAPwAACAAJ&dq=Oxford+Latin+Desk+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Butcher of St. Peter's (Medieval West Country Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Jewelry","description":"The spectacular jewels of ancient Egypt, long buried in desert tombs, are revealed in all their exotic beauty in this superb survey.

Amarnath Amarasingam analyzes the reactions of diasporic Tamils in Canada at a time when the separatist Tamil movement was being crushed by the Sri Lankan armed forces and revises currently accepted analytical frameworks relating to diasporic communities. This book adds to our understanding of a particular diasporic group, while contributing to the theoretical literature in the area. Throughout, Amarasingam argues that transnational diasporic mobilization is at times determined and driven as much by internal organizational and communal developments as by events in their countries of origin, a phenomenon that has received relatively little attention in the scholarly literature. His work provides an in-depth examination of the ways in which a separatist sociopolitical movement beginning in Sri Lanka is carried forward, altered, and adapted by the diaspora and the struggles that are involved in this process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZdTZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Speed: Today's Fascinating High-Tech World of Formula 1","description":"The Science of Speed David Tremayne.Subtitled: The Hi-Tech World of Formula 1.

Thereafter her existence was a story of connivance and stratagem, a succession of unlikely twists and turns. Intimately involved in the mysterious Lockhart affair, a conspiracy which almost brought down the fledgling Soviet state, mistress to Maxim Gorky and then to H.G. Wells, Moura was a woman of enormous energy, intelligence, and charm whose deepest passion was undoubtedly the mythologization of her own life. Recognized as one of the great masters of Russian twentieth-century fiction, Nina Berberova here proves again that she is the unsurpassed chronicler of the lives of Soviet  migr s. In Moura Budberg, a woman who shrouded the facts of her life in fiction, Berberova finds the ideal material from which to craft a triumph of literary portraiture, a book as engaging and as full of life and incident as any one of her celebrated novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hLMMnkZ0q6MC&dq=Moura&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preface to Critical Reading","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ogrcvgEACAAJ&dq=Preface+to+Critical+Reading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Thinking about Critical Periods","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yMa_oAEACAAJ&dq=Critical+Thinking+about+Critical+Periods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book Publishing Industry","description":"This volume provides an innovative and detailed overview of the book publishing industry, including details about the business processes in editorial, marketing and production.

After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens as he later put it, \\"it was clear my people needed me\\"). They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item. Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, I'm a Stranger Here Myself recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth. The result is a book filled with hysterical scenes of one man's attempt to reacquaint himself with his own country, but it is also an extended if at times bemused love letter to the homeland he has returned to after twenty years away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1wexZSh8QawC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorians and ancient Greece","description":"Focuses on Victorian culture, assessing the immense influence the ancient Greeks had on British classical education, the images and themes of George Eliot's writings, Christian sensibility, decorative arts, and English playing fields during the nineteenth","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HUYTAQAAIAAJ&dq=Victorians+and+ancient+Greece&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas (Mdr's School Directory Texas)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PFAFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Texas+(Mdr%27s+School+Directory+Texas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Moviemaking: Animation and Live-Action, from Silent to Sound, Black-And-White to Color (Voyages of Discovery)","description":"Presents the history of the film industry, from the earliest moving images to computerized special effects in 1993.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C6A1OgAACAAJ&dq=The+History+of+Moviemaking:+Animation+and+Live-Action,+from+Silent+to+Sound,+Black-And-White+to+Color+(Voyages+of+Discovery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Race Narratives: A Study of Race, Rhetoric and Injury (Critical America Series)","description":"\\"An immensely valuable ocntribution.

She recounts the day-to-day realities of living in a city under siege, where food has to be consumed or thrown out because there is no way to preserve it, where eventually people cannot sleep until the nightly bombing commences, where packs of stray dogs roam the streets (and provide her own dog Salvi with a harem) and rats invade homes. Through it all, al-Radi works at her art and gathers with neighbors and family for meals and other occasions, happy and sad. In the wake of the war, al-Radi lives in semi-exile, shuttling between Beirut and Amman, travelling to New York, London, Mexico and Yemen. As she suffers the indignities of being an Iraqi in exile, al-Radi immerses us in a way of life constricted by the stress and effects of war and embargoes, giving texture to a reality we have only been able to imagine before now. But what emanates most vibrantly from these diaries is the spirit of endurance and the celebration of the smallest of life s joys.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d1o3IDmF6XcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon's Teeth I (World's End)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sMl1AQAACAAJ&dq=Dragon%27s+Teeth+I+(World%27s+End)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morrison R.

'What, me hide?' But if you ask women whether men hide, they immediately know what you mean.\\" from Where Men Hide Where Men Hide is a spirited tour of the dark and often dirty places men go to find comfort, camaraderie, relaxation, and escape. Ken Ross's striking photographs and James Twitchell's lively analysis trace the evolution of these virtual caves, and question why they are rapidly disappearing. Ross documents both traditional and contemporary male haunts, such as bars, barbershops, lodges, pool halls, strip clubs, garages, deer camps, megachurches, the basement Barcalounger, and Twitchell examines their provenance, purpose, and appeal. He finds that for centuries men have met with each other in underground lairs and clubhouses to conduct business or, in the case of strip clubs and the modern rec room, to bond and indulge in shady entertainments. In these secret dens, certain rules are abandoned while others are obeyed. However, Twitchell sees this less as exclusionary behavior and more as the result of social anxiety: when women want to get together, they just do it; when men get together, it's a production. Drawing on literary, historical, and pop cultural sources, Twitchell connects the places men hide with figures like Hemingway and Huck Finn, Frederick Jackson Turner's theory of the American frontier, and the mythological interpretations of Joseph Campbell and Robert Bly. Instead of blaming the disappearance of the man-cave solely on feminism, simple fair play, or the demands of Title IX, Twitchell believes this evaporation is due as well to the rise of solitary pursuits such as driving, watching television, and playing videogames. By blending together anecdote, research, and keen observation, Ross and Twitchell bring this little-discussed and controversial phenomenon to light.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PaZDDpxlMDAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glitter of Gold - An Avalon Western","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sCnQAAAACAAJ&dq=Glitter+of+Gold+-+An+Avalon+Western&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The unknown Brahms: His life, character and works","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fsEQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+unknown+Brahms:+His+life,+character+and+works&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Kind of Wonderful","description":"Happiness can be found where you least expect it . . . ________ When the love of your life says you're not The One, what next?

He recounts tales of daring voyages in the Antarctic's dangerous seas and of the men who had to survive for months in this treacherous terrain. These stories of humans struggling to overcome the elements are paralleled with the lives of the very humanlike penguins. Naveen fell in love with penguins sixteen years ago, and ever since they have held a strong place in his mind--whether he is counting their numbers on the icy shores of the seventh continent or studying their behavior as they go through their hectic and productive lives. We see that their natural and healthy lives, unfettered by the clamor and clutter of our workaholic existence, can teach us much about ourselves. Penguins don't spend time reasoning, planning, pondering, or worrying. They're very, very busy, with lots of work to do and little time to do it. The penguins in this delightful and informative book emerge as distinctly resourceful and beguiling personalities. While penguins amuse and intrigue us, their comically deceptive exterior belies the reality that they may have mastered survival a bit better than we have, and watching them may change our relationship with the earth--and with each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bjjHGwAACAAJ&dq=Waiting+To+Fly:+My+Escapades+With+The+Penguins+Of+Antarctica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Libraries in America 2000 (Congressional record)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uYk5bM0MUIUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Minister's Wife","description":"She never expected to be a minister s wife.

In many ways, this is the story of a generation's passage through the 1960s from innocence to experience, from euphoria to disillusionment. But Sanders has found a language that captures the transcendence of ordinary lives while never reducing them to formula. In his hands, the pattern of American boyhood that was made classic by writers from Mark Twain to Tobias Wolff is given a powerful new charge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DbC0euTdbnUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fisher Price Busy Town Lift the Flap (Fisher-Price Little People Mini-Flap PlayBooks)","description":"Young readers can lift the flaps to learn about opposites, counting, feelings, shapes, and colors.

THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FnH9nk998foC&dq=Kansas+Irish&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action!","description":"he year is 1798.

For two hundred years, the constitutionality of capital punishment had been axiomatic. But in 1962, Justice Arthur Goldberg and his clerk Alan Dershowitz dared to suggest otherwise, launching an underfunded band of civil rights attorneys on a quixotic crusade. In 1972, in a most unlikely victory, the Supreme Court struck down Georgia s death penalty law in Furman v. Georgia. Though the decision had sharply divided the justices, nearly everyone, including the justices themselves, believed Furman would mean the end of executions in America. Instead, states responded with a swift and decisive showing of support for capital punishment. As anxiety about crime rose and public approval of the Supreme Court declined, the stage was set in 1976 for Gregg v. Georgia, in which the Court dramatically reversed direction. A Wild Justice is an extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at the Court, the justices, and the political complexities of one of the most racially charged and morally vexing issues of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SWQV5jG5rz0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remote Viewing Secrets: A Handbook","description":"Remote viewing is not simply using psychic ability to obtain information. It is using scientific protocol to develop and extend that ability so that ordinary people can learn to do what \\"psychics\\" do. This book teaches you how to teach yourself. McMoneagle believes that anybody can be trained in remote viewing (no psychic gifts required). However, it requires a huge commitment and a highly disciplined mind. Using the analogy of martial arts, McMoneagle sees RV training in levels, starting with white belt where viewers can expect to see a gestalt (an overall impression) of a target. By the time readers reach the red-black belt great master, McMoneagle claims they will have gained \\"a near-perfect union of one's paranormal talent blended within extant reality. People who reach this level no longer have to think about it, they simply do.\\" Although readers won't become great masters by reading this one book, McMoneagle does provide a comprehensive training program as well as important chapters on the ethics, protocol, and applications of remote viewing. McMoneagle is the authority in this area. He learned remote viewing in the U.S. Army--he was Remote Viewer #001 in the Army's Stargate program--and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his contribution to various intelligence operations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n4ZcjHyEuzIC&dq=Remote+Viewing+Secrets:+A+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farmer-riverworld","description":"From award-winning author Philip Jose Farmer comes his most famous science fiction work: the first combined edition of the first two Riverworld novels, To Your Scattered Bodies Go and The Fabulous Riverboat.

They are miraculously provided with food, but with not a clue to the possible meaning of this strange afterlife. And so billions of people from history, and before, must start living again. Some set sail on the great river questing for the meaning of their resurrection, and to find and confront their mysterious benefactors. On this long journey, we meet Sir Richard Francis Burton, Mark Twain, Odysseus, Cyrano de Bergerac, and many others, most of whom embark upon searches of their own in this huge afterlife.

Based on years of research in over 450 manuscript collections and oral histories, as well as numerous personal interviews, this biography follows Johnson, the 'human dynamo', from the Texas hill country to the White House. In these pages, Johnson emerges as a man of towering intensity and anguished insecurity, of grandiose ambition and grave self-doubt, a man who was brilliant, crude, intimidating, compassionate, overbearing, driven. Gracefully written and delicately balanced, this singular biography reveals both the greatness and the tangled complexities of one of the most extravagant characters ever to step onto the presidential stage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hfeaPwAACAAJ&dq=Portrait+of+a+President&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minds at War","description":"The First World War cast its shadow over the 20th century.

God designed men to be dangerous, says John Eldredge. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a \\"nice guy.\\" It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0p_3DcMR5okC&dq=Into+The+Heart+Of+The+Wild&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jordan's Near Side","description":"Essays on current events (e.g. Paul Wellstone's plane crash) as observed from an attitude that eternity begins in the \\"here and now\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AN7dPQAACAAJ&dq=Jordan%27s+Near+Side&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decision, Probability and Utility: Selected Readings","description":"Decision theory and the theory of rational choice have recently been the subjects of considerable research by philosophers and economists.

Yet the game that Julian devised to relieve the boredom--the game of Takers and Returners--was to affect the lives of all the children who took part in it. Julian was fifteen, and thirteen?-year-old Ellen had always thought she might marry him someday--that is until Mother explained that first cousins could not marry. Julian still had a kind of fatal fascination, though. It made you want to follow his leadership. Otherwise, they would never have let the game get out of hand the way it did, for it was an un usual, frightening game, and one of which the adults would not have approved. In this skillfully written suspense story, Carol Beach York provides an atmosphere so full of tension and anxiety that it becomes almost un?bearable, and the reader soon realizes that it is also a story of evil and that the game the children play is one no one can win.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZFQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1, 2, and 3 John (LifeChange)","description":"See Who God Is and What Love Is Who is God?

In Women in the Middle Ages, Frances and Joseph Gies reclaim this lost history, in a lively historical survey that charts the evolution of women s roles throughout the period, and profiles eight individual women in depth. We learn of Hildegarde of Bingen, an abbess who was a noted composer and founded two monasteries; of Eleanor de Montfort, a 13th century Princess of Wales who was captured by Edward I and held as a political prisoner for three years; and women of somewhat more modest means, such as the spouse of an Italian merchant, and a peasant s wife. Drawing upon their various stories, talented historians Frances and Joseph Gies whose books were used by George R.R.

His is the sceptical, enveloping intelligence that calculates the price that's paid in the struggle to change personal fortune and reshape history, whether in a dentist's office in suburban New Jersey; a tradition-bound English Village in Gloucestershire; a church in London's West End; or in a tiny desert settlement in Israel's occupied West Bank.

A century later, Bishop Estate controlled nearly one out of every nine acres in the state, a concentration of private land ownership rarely seen anywhere in the world. Then in August 1997 the unthinkable happened: Four revered kupuna (native Hawaiian elders) and a professor of trust-law publicly charged Bishop Estate trustees with gross incompetence and massive trust abuse.

Along with separate chapters devoted to each New Testament writing, there are chapters explaining how this collection of texts emerged as uniquely authoritative witnesses to the church s faith; why they were recognized as canonical whereas other early Christian writings were not; how the four canonical Gospels are related to one another, including a discussion of the Synoptic Problem; how the Jesus traditionhis teachings, stories from his ministry, and the accounts of his suffering, death and resurrectionoriginated and developed into Gospels written in narrative form; and how the Gospels relate to Jesus Christ as he was and is.

It was nearly one a.m. by the time he crawled into bed. Chiara was reading a novel, oblivious to the television, which was muted. On the screen was a live shot of St. Peter s Basilica. Gabriel raised the volume and learned that an old friend had died   Gabriel Allon has slipped quietly into Venice for a much-needed holiday with his wife and two young children. But when Pope Paul VII dies suddenly, Gabriel is summoned to Rome by the Holy Father s loyal private secretary, Archbishop Luigi Donati. A billion Catholic faithful have been told that the pope died of a heart attack. Donati, however, has two good reasons to suspect his master was murdered. The Swiss Guard who was standing watch outside the papal apartments the night of the pope s death is missing. So, too, is the letter the Holy Father was writing during the final hours of his life. A letter that was addressed to Gabriel. While researching in the Vatican Secret Archives, I came upon a most remarkable book   The book is a long-suppressed gospel that calls into question the accuracy of the New Testament s depiction of one of the most portentous events in human history. For that reason alone, the Order of St. Helena will stop at nothing to keep it out of Gabriel s hands. A shadowy Catholic society with ties to the European far right, the Order is plotting to seize control of the papacy. And it is only the beginning. As the cardinals gather in Rome for the start of the conclave, Gabriel sets out on a desperate search for proof of the Order s conspiracy, and for a long-lost gospel with the power to put an end to two thousand years of murderous hatred. His quest will take him from the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, to a monastery in Assisi, to the hidden depths of the Secret Archives, and finally to the Sistine Chapel, where he will witness an event no outsider has ever before seen the sacred passing of the Keys of St. Peter to a newly elected pope. Swiftly paced and elegantly rendered, The Order will hold readers spellbound, from its opening passages to its breathtaking final twist of plot. It is a novel of friendship and faith in a perilous and uncertain world. And it is still more proof that Daniel Silva is his generation s finest writer of suspense and international intrigue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XTi2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tannenberg: Clash of Empires 1914 (Cornerstones of Military History)","description":"1.

At a time when reported incidents of \\"recovered memories\\" had become widespread, these accusations were not unusual. What captured national attention in this case is that, under questioning, Ingram appeared to remember participating in bizarre satanic rites involving his whole family and other members of the sheriff's department.

As she listens to Lucy through the thin walls of her dilapidated building, S.H., aka  Minnesota,  transcribes her neighbor s bizarre and increasingly ominous monologues in a notebook, along with sundry other adventures, until one frightening night when Lucy bursts into her apartment on a rescue mission. Forty years later, S.H., now a veteran author, discovers her old notebook, as well as early drafts of a never-completed novel while moving her aging mother from one facility to another. Ingeniously juxtaposing the various texts, S.H. measures what she remembers against what she wrote that year and has since forgotten to create a dialogue between selves across decades. The encounter both collapses time and reframes its meanings in the present. Elaborately structured, intellectually rigorous, urgently paced, poignant, and often wildly funny, Memories of the Future brings together themes that have made Hustvedt among the most celebrated novelists working today: the fallibility of memory; gender mutability; the violence of patriarchy; the vagaries of perception; the ambiguous borders between sensation and thought, sanity and madness; and our dependence on primal drives such as sex, love, hunger, and rage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cj5qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Army 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War: 2 Republican Troops (Men-At-Arms Series, 237)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mind-Bending Puzzles: A Bundle of Bogglers to Baffle Your Brain","description":"Puzzle Paragons will find themselves in paroxysms of pleasure when they peruse Terry Stickels's Mind-Bending Puzzles.

However research has shown that application of this powerful technique in many companies is limited due to a lack of statistical knowledge required for its effective implementation. Although many books have been written on this subject, they are mainly by statisticians, for statisticians and not appropriate for engineers. Design of Experiments for Engineers and Scientists overcomes the problem of statistics by taking a unique approach using graphical tools. The same outcomes and conclusions are reached as through using statistical methods and readers will find the concepts in this book both familiar and easy to understand. This new edition includes a chapter on the role of DoE within Six Sigma methodology and also shows through the use of simple case studies its importance in the service industry. It is essential reading for engineers and scientists from all disciplines tackling all kinds of manufacturing, product and process quality problems and will be an ideal resource for students of this topic. Written in non-statistical language, the book is an essential and accessible text for scientists and engineers who want to learn how to use DoE Explains why teaching DoE techniques in the improvement phase of Six Sigma is an important part of problem solving methodology New edition includes a full chapter on DoE for services as well as case studies illustrating its wider application in the service industry","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p7pCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warrior Women and Popular Balladry, 1650-1850","description":"Masquerading as a man, seeking adventure, going to war or to sea for love and glory, the transvestite heroine flourished in all kinds of literature, especially ballads, from the Renaissance to the Victorian age. Warrior Women and Popular Balladry, 1650-1850 identifies this heroine and her significance as a figure in folklore, and as a representative of popular culture, prompting important reevaluations of gender and sexuality. Dugaw has uncovered a fascination with women cross-dressers in the popular literature of early modern Europe and America.

And yet, their physicians typically ask them to sift through stacks of educational pamphlets and paperwork on cataracts.

More than two million copies in print! The premier resource for how to deliver results in an uncertain world, whether you re running an entire company or in your first management job.  A must-read for anyone who cares about business.  The New York Times When Execution was first published, it changed the way we did our jobs by focusing on the critical importance of  the discipline of execution : the ability to make the final leap to success by actually getting things done. Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan now reframe their empowering message for a world in which the old rules have been shattered, radical change is becoming routine, and the ability to execute is more important than ever. Now and for the foreseeable future: ? Growth will be slower. But the company that executes well will have the confidence, speed, and resources to move fast as new opportunities emerge. ? Competition will be fiercer, with companies searching for any possible advantage in every area from products and technologies to location and management. ? Governments will take on new roles in their national economies, some as partners to business, others imposing constraints. Companies that execute well will be more attractive to government entities as partners and suppliers and better prepared to adapt to a new wave of regulation. ? Risk management will become a top priority for every leader. Execution gives you an edge in detecting new internal and external threats and in weathering crises that can never be fully predicted. Execution shows how to link together people, strategy, and operations, the three core processes of every business. Leading these processes is the real job of running a business, not formulating a  vision  and leaving the work of carrying it out to others. Bossidy and Charan show the importance of being deeply and passionately engaged in an organization and why robust dialogues about people, strategy, and operations result in a business based on intellectual honesty and realism. With paradigmatic case histories from the real world including examples like the diverging paths taken by Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase and Charles Prince at Citigroup Execution provides the realistic and hard-nosed approach to business success that could come only from authors as accomplished and insightful as Bossidy and Charan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=07jVCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rosey Little Christmas / Jingle Bell Bride (Harlequin Duets, No. 64)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8WBYAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Rosey+Little+Christmas+/+Jingle+Bell+Bride+(Harlequin+Duets,+No.+64)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics in Historical Perspective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uqbvAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Philosophy+of+Quantum+Mechanics:+The+Interpretations+of+Quantum+Mechanics+in+Historical+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Oxford Book of Food Plants","description":"The Oxford Book of Food Plants is a beautifully illustrated compendium of facts about the plants we grow in our gardens and use in our cooking.

Reformer. Iconoclast. Dealmaker. Dentist? Jerry Argovitz has worn many hats in his remarkable life, both inside and outside of the world of sports. As a player agent representing and advising some of the biggest names in the game, Argovitz challenged the NFL both at the negotiating table and in the courtroom, earning a reputation as one of the most powerful men in professional sports. He successfully negotiated the first milliondollar guaranteed contract in NFL history, wrote the language for career-ending insurance policy underwriting for Lloyds of London, and brokered the deal that brought Heisman Trophywinner Herschel Walker to the upstart USFL as a junior, which opened the floodgates for all underclassmen to follow. As the owner of the Houston Gamblers of the USFL, Argovitz helped to implement several rules which were subsequently adopted by the NFL, and served as a principal figure in a lawsuit against the NFL that proved the league was guilty of Sherman Antitrust violations. Now, Argovitz has a plan to reform the corrupt world of college sports, a plan he will share in this eye-opening book.

But there was, in fact, no UFO crash with dead alien bodies. What really happened on that fateful day is much more sinister. The persistent rumors surrounding the UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico, are part of a bigger conspiracy -- one orchestrated and fostered by the government itself as a smokescreen to bury a truth that is much darker, and disturbingly, far more believable. Now, through never-before-revealed testimony from military whistleblowers, eyewitness intelligence reports, and an astonishing body of corroborative evidence, Nick Redfern lays out a shockingly plausible new theory on the Roswell incident: that the crash-site discovery of prototype military aircraft would expose a damning secret -- a highly confidential, U.S. government-sanctioned program to conduct medical experiments on deformed, handicapped, disfigured, and diseased Japanese POWs, exploited as \\"expendable\\" victims by their captors. An important account that forces us to take a closer look at both the Roswell story and post-war American history, BODY SNATCHERS IN THE DESERT casts a startling, new light on a shocking conspiracy more than half a century in the making.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aYic0WQY3DcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackjack","description":"A revised and updated edition of the blackjack player s bible with complete information on the odds, betting strategies, and much more  A significant contribution to the literature of blackjack . . .

The young lady of the story -- fifteen years of age in 1848, the year of the journal -- narrates in a fresh and endearing voice a year in the life of a Victorian family, offering a window into the lifestyle of the time; along the way she even includes recipes for dishes she learns from the family cook over the course of the year (authentic 19th-century recipes the author discovered in the course of her research). But the story, deceptively simple at first, soon takes on an air of suspense, as her parents leave on a journey, and her father writes with the news that her mother has taken gravely ill; soon thereafter the little girl -- identified only by the nickname \\"cygnet\\", or young swan, in the diary -- finds a letter among her mother's belongings leading her to question her own parentage. The text of the journal is framed by a present-day narrative, in Caroline's own voice, detailing the discovery of the actual diary, and Caroline's own attempts to discover the truth behind this enigmatic story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2nysGwAACAAJ&dq=Primrose+Past:+The+1848+Journal+of+Young+Lady+Primrose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mind-Bending Puzzles: More Bushels of Brilliance to Boggle Your Brain","description":"Try any of these 150 word, number, and logic puzzles, and you'll encounter some surprising new ways to analyze, observe, and decide.

Reissued for the 40th anniversary of the original publication--with a new introduction from the author--Salman Rushdie's widely acclaimed novel is a masterpiece in literature. Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India s 1,000 other  midnight s children,  all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts.

A central role is played by periodic orbits, of which many have been computed numerically. This is the second volume of an attempt to explain and organize the material through a systematic study of generating families, the limits of families of periodic orbits when the mass ratio of the two main bodies becomes vanishingly small. We use quantitative analysis in the vicinity of bifurcations of types 1 and 2. In most cases the junctions between branches can now be determined. A first-order approximation of families of periodic orbits in the vicinity of a bifurcation is also obtained. This book is intended for scientists and students interested in the restricted problem, in its applications to astronomy and space research, and in the theory of dynamical systems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sh_wCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spotsylvania County, Va Atlas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YVRiKAAACAAJ&dq=Spotsylvania+County,+Va+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listen & Learn: 101 Japanese Idioms","description":" A memorable experience.

The conceptual history of cognitive science remains for the most part unwritten. In this groundbreaking book, Jean-Pierre Dupuy one of the principal architects of cognitive science in France provides an important chapter: the legacy of cybernetics. Contrary to popular belief, Dupuy argues, cybernetics represented not the anthropomorphization of the machine but the mechanization of the human. The founding fathers of cybernetics some of the greatest minds of the twentieth century, including John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Walter Pitts intended to construct a materialist and mechanistic science of mental behavior that would make it possible at last to resolve the ancient philosophical problem of mind and matter. The importance of cybernetics to cognitive science, Dupuy argues, lies not in its daring conception of the human mind in terms of the functioning of a machine but in the way the strengths and weaknesses of the cybernetics approach can illuminate controversies that rage today between cognitivists and connectionists, eliminative materialists and Wittgensteinians, functionalists and anti-reductionists. Dupuy brings to life the intellectual excitement that attended the birth of cognitive science sixty years ago. He separates the promise of cybernetic ideas from the disappointment that followed as cybernetics was rejected and consigned to intellectual oblivion. The mechanization of the mind has reemerged today as an all-encompassing paradigm in the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science. The tensions, contradictions, paradoxes, and confusions Dupuy discerns in cybernetics offer a cautionary tale for future developments in cognitive science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gDoiEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mechanization+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"View from a height","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k1tmBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Doc's Double Delivery / Down-Home Diva (Harlequin Duets, No. 65)","description":"Duets 2-In-1 by Bonnie Tucker\\\\Jennifer LaBrecque released on Oct 25, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UgDb3ZpozFkC&dq=The+Doc%27s+Double+Delivery+/+Down-Home+Diva+(Harlequin+Duets,+No.+65)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games","description":"The head of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics organizing committee describes how he assumed the leadership of the troubled organization and turned it around to present one of the most successful Olympic Games ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rUjc5iLgZhMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lad, a dog","description":"\\"Lad: A God\\" was first published in 1919.

Are these simple accidents--as the \\"bloody fool  theory has it--or are they inevitable? The psychologist Norman F. Dixon argues that there is a pattern to inept generalship, and locates this pattern within the very act of creating armies in the first place, which in his view produces a levelling down of human capability that encourages the mediocre and limits the gifted. In this light, successful generals achieve what they do despite the stultifying features of the organization to which they belong. A classic study of military leadership, On the Psychology of Military Incompetence is at once an original exploration of the battles that have defined the last two centuries of human civilization and an essential guide for the next generation of military leaders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=luoHDAAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+psychology+of+military+incompetence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Coal","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MIDWINTER OF THE SPIRIT - A NOVEL OF PSYCHIC DELIVERANCE.","description":"Reverend Merrily Watkins finds herself replacing a retiring exorcist who is determined to make the transition as unpleasant as possible Diocesan Exorcist: a job viewed by the Church of England with such extreme suspicion that they changed the name.

It includes episodes as romantic and dramatic as any in fiction: the purchase by the author's great-grandfather of a peasant girl with whom he had fallen in love; the desperate sledge journey in the depths of winter made by her grandmother to intercede with Tsar Aleksandr II for her husband; the extraordinary courtship of her parents; and her Scottish granny being caught up in the abortive revolution of 1905. Eugenie Fraser herself was brought up in Russia but was taken on visits to Scotland. She marvellously evokes a child's reactions to two totally different environments, sets of customs and family backgrounds, while the characters are beautifully drawn and splendidly memorable. With the events of 1914 to 1920 - the war with Germany, the Revolution, the murder of the Tsar and the withdrawal of the Allied Intervention in the north - came the disintegration of Russia and of family life. The stark realities of hunger, deprivation and fear are sharply contrasted with the adventures of childhood. The reader shares the family's suspense and concern about the fates of its members and relives with Eugenie her final escape to Scotland. In The House by the Dvina, Eugenie Fraser has vividly and poignantly portrayed a way of life that finally disappeared in violence and tragedy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XeE6df9a84kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fault-Tolerant IP and MPLS Networks","description":"Design and deploy high availability IP and MPLS network architectures with this comprehensive guide Includes a detailed overview of the IP/MPLS forwarding and control plane protocols, including OSPF, IS-IS, LDP, BGP, and RSVP Analyze fault-tolerant IP/MPLS control plane architectures with the explanations in this book Develop a clear understanding of various high availability aspects of IP/MPLS networks Learn how to seamlessly deploy IP/MPLS control plane restart mechanisms Master the application of fault-tolerant control-plane architectures in designing and deploying highly reliable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WNvItwEACAAJ&dq=Fault-Tolerant+IP+and+MPLS+Networks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The School of Whoredom (Hesperus Classics)","description":"Bawdy and thoroughly risqu&#eacute;, this 16thcentury masterpiece is the work of Pietro Aretino, widely regarded as the originator of European pornographic writing.

It examines the gender, class, social, and cultural factors that influenced this disparity. It aims to uncover both why and how five hundred and thirty one third class passengers died on the night of April 14th 1912. A key area of focus is the difficult relationship between the ship s authorities and the men of the third class, and the extent to which this determined the fate of passengers during the rescue efforts. The introduction asks  Who were the third class passengers?  and uses ethnic and economic backgrounds to suggest the third class belonged to the  Old Immigration  wave of migrants, rather than the contemporary  New Immigration  of the first and second. The first chapter concerns the exclusion of third class narratives in the  popular story  of the Titanic. Chapters two through seven determine the whereabouts of the third class during every stage of evacuation, and flags the discrepancies in testimonies from both the British and American inquiries.

Establishing shot: New York City, present day. Zoom in on a run-down tenement building, somewhere west of Times Square, the home of Roy Milano, a thirtyish, divorced typesetter who lives for the movies. In fact, by pursuing the legendary uncut print of Orson Welles s The Magnificent Ambersons, Roy has become something of a minor celebrity among the fellow misfit film fanatics he caters to in his homemade newsletter, Trivial Man. But there s nothing trivial when Roy s old rival Abner Cooley shows up with a check in his hand and the words  Someone is trying to kill me  on his lips. With his mother ailing, Roy needs the money as badly as Cooley needs someone to head off a trigger-happy stalker who s determined to put both him and his controversial new screenplay into permanent turnaround. And though Roy does his best, like many a private eye before him, he quickly finds his head turned by an enticing distraction. Not a femme fatale, but a flick. Roy is all but powerless to resist an e-mail from a mysterious fan that lures him with the promise of an elusive treasure as fiercely sought after by the celluloid cognoscenti as the Ark of the Covenant was by Indiana Jones. It s Jerry Lewis' famous unreleased drama, The Day the Clown Cried. But when he arrives at a rendezvous too late to save a dying man, Roy realizes he s stumbled into a dangerous race to possess a piece of cinema history. To catch up, he ll have to match wits with a rogues  gallery: a bored and bitter superstar comedian, a hot-shot producer turned drugged-out has-been, a ferocious German actor who likes to role-play off-camera, a mercurial director with a scary sense of humor, and a hard-bitten cop who s mad about movies. Meanwhile, Roy will be tempted by the wiles of three fetching femalesand tormented by a single-minded psychopath with more faces than Lon Chaney. He ll even go on location, pursuing and being pursued from the mansions of the Hamptons to the harbors of Maine, the boulevards of L.A. to the canals of Amsterdam. No one s ever gone to this much trouble just to see a movie. But for Roy, the reward far outweighs the risk.

Entertainment Weekly Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria took up residence on Dragonstone.

Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold.

Taking a wholly different perspective on Ernst and alchemy, however, M. E. Warlick persuasively demonstrates that the artist had a profound and abiding interest in alchemical philosophy and often used alchemical symbolism in works created throughout his career. A revival of interest in alchemy swept the artistic, psychoanalytic, historical, and scientific circles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Warlick sets Ernst's work squarely within this movement. Looking at both his art (many of the works she discusses are reproduced in the book) and his writings, she reveals how thoroughly alchemical philosophy and symbolism pervade his early Dadaist experiments, his foundational work in surrealism, and his many collages and paintings of women and landscapes, whose images exemplify the alchemical fusing of opposites. This pioneering research adds an essential key to understanding the multilayered complexity of Ernst's works, as it affirms his standing as one of Germany's most significant artists of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SdZv1YuT4nEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Pregnancy Quick Guide: Women of Color","description":"By the best-selling authors of the Your Pregnancy series, medically sound and succinct information for the woman who needs detailed information on a specific concern --The facts about the frequency of sickle-cell disease, multiples, Tay-Sachs, thalassemia, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and hypertension during pregnancy in women of color -- Explanations of how these conditions are tested for, diagnosed, and monitored throughout pregnancy -- Information on premature birth and how you can protect yourself --Suggestions for staying healthy throughout pregnancy, including detailed information on diet and exercise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-G2ROa4NYJMC&dq=Your+Pregnancy+Quick+Guide:+Women+of+Color&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traitors & True Poles: Narrating A Polish-American Identity, 1880-1939 (Polish and Polish American Studies)","description":"It s 1849, the year John Huffman s father is sentenced to London s Whitecross Street Prison.

Grab a copy of The Handbook and you'll be ready to wade into a San Francisco cocktail party, a Grateful Dead reunion concert, or an Ivy League classroom and take on liberals on their home turf.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M75_om39mBsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ex8vaG6m4RMC&dq=Economics+of+Natural+Resources+and+the+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life","description":"Drawing on his own personal experiences and those of others, the author explains how to overcome seemingly insurmountable problems and challenges and advocates living life fully with gratitude, zeal, and curiosity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t2sl6mVP-lQC&dq=Nothing+Is+Impossible:+Reflections+on+a+New+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayal in central Europe; Austria and Czechoslovakia: The fallen bastions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Polishing the Petoskey Stone: Selected Poems","description":"\\"Luci Shaw is someone who knows the world-the oldest definition of a poet. Her animating intelligence descends into the concrete facts of our existence to discover the divine force that shapes the world and maintains its being. Her poetry recapitulates that intimate naming by which man defines himself-the first role God assigned to the human creature.\\" Harold Fickett, author of The Holy Fool \\"Longtime readers of these poems will renew old acquaintances and pick up a sheaf of new friends besides. New readers will welcome her gifts of Word-crafted icons by which we behold the Glory, see the Holy.\\" Eugene H. Peterson \\"Polishing the Petoskey Stone is a wonderful compilation of many of the richest of Luci Shaw's poems, both old and new. It's wonderful to see growth in her understanding of the joys and tragedies of life as they can be expressed in poetry. I sense a new, and perhaps harsher, view of reality which is always redeemed by the never failing love of God.\\" Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time Luci Shaw is the author of many books, including God in the Dark, Listen to the Green, and Writing the River. A speaker, teacher, poet, editor, and writer, she lives in Bellingham, Washington.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BCbwrhk4OKMC&dq=Polishing+the+Petoskey+Stone:+Selected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],I={key:0},P={key:1};function x(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",I,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const q=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-c628cb55"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/22.md","filePath":"glossary/22.md"}'),J={name:"glossary/22.md"},_=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(q)]))}});export{W as __pageData,_ as default};
