For many years numerous preachers have taught the doctorine of a world-wide flood in Noah's time that brought about a cataclysmic end to all life on the planet. However, we need to ask ourselves a couple of questions before blindly accepting such a teaching as being true.First, is this view point really Biblical ? Can such a claim accurately be documented in God's word ?Second, is there any evidence in history or science to back up such a claim ?Finally, we must flip the coin and ask ourselves, \\"Is there any information in the Bible, science, or history to suggest that the flood of Noah was NOT a worldwide flood\\" ?The author of this short, but informative book will present you with plenty of information that may possibly make you reconsider your viewpoint on the entire subject of Noah, and the theory of a world-wide flood. The author combines Hebrew word study, scriptures, history, and science to come to the presented conclusions in this book. I feel this is a must read for SERIOUS and in-depth Bible students."},{"Title":"Get a Grip on Philosophy","review":"This introduction to philosophy is most valuable for its Introduction and its final chapter. The Introduction identifies two enemies of philosophy as she was and perhaps can be again. One enemy is the technocrats, led by the arch-technocrats Plato and Aristotle, who turned philosophy away from the pure speculative wonder of the presocratics and made her the handmaiden of organised religion and then of science. The second enemy is the philistines, who pragmatically subvert philosophy in the interest of big business and its unthinking consumers. The final chapter describes the wretched condition of current philosophy, which has no contact with the concerns of the ordinary person in the street and is rapidly disappearing up its own analytic fundament. The prescribed cure is a return to speculative, imaginative, wonder-inspired, and relevant philosophising. In between these sections we get an interesting potted history, including postmodernism. Turnbull exaggerates the extent to which current philosophy fails to connect with ordinary concerns, and he fails to exemplify the sort of philosophy he wants to see, but his book, refreshingly for such a work, has definite 'attitude'."},{"Title":"Get a Grip on Philosophy","review":"There is a lot that Turnbull says that I don't agree with, but he does a very good job of explaining his point of view. His is a biased but still very useful summary of the history of philosophical ideas. A beginner should find it useful because of it's brevity and clear explanation of some difficult concepts. But a beginner should never rely on this book alone because Turnbull has a a very specific point of view that he makes very clear.He despises analytical philosophy and Wittgenstein (as do I, for reasons that would take at least a chapter of a book). He also interestingly divides modern philosophers (that is, starting with Descartes) into &quot;technocrats&quot; and &quot;philistines&quot; (the pragmatists). Kant and Hegel for instance would be technocrats with differing degrees of romanticism. Of course there is a world of difference between Kant and Hegel as everyone knows, but it's instructive to listen to Turnbull enumerate the similarities.And therein lies the attraction of this book for someone like me who Turnbull would probably recognise as having technocratic leanings (Kant's my philosophical hero). He clearly enjoys the arguments even of people he does not agree with. Though I daresay he also trivializes or distorts the arguments of some of the philosophers he mentions. Plus he shows really bad taste in saying Heidegger was one the few true philosophers of the 20th century, though he gives cogent reasons for saying that. But still it rankles me that he doesn't acknowledge Heidegger's procedural debt to Husserl.Most importantly though, he tackles many of the 20th century philosophers, whose names we often hear but whose views are often presented as an indigestible melange. Even if his summaries seem idiosyncratic, they are far more useful than the outright worship or denigration one or the other side of certain philosophical debates seems to heap on the modern philosophers (analytical philosophers are not philosophers, so it is ok to hate them without fear of error). So I really found his summaries of Derrida, Foucault, Adorno, Marcuse and even Heidegger interesting enough to make we want to find arguments from other sources to either support or disprove his analyses of these thinkers.His main interest really is ethical philosophy, which explains his disagreements with the &quot;technocrats&quot; and his clear dislike of the &quot;philistines&quot; (even if his choice of name here wasn't already indicative of what he thinks of them). Maybe this is why one reviewer complained that the book was mainly just religious opinion. It is of course one of our modern diseases that we cannot divorce ethics from religion (Nietzche's perhaps ill-considered attempt having driven him mad), but this book is certainly not religious unless you consider Turnbull's meanderings about the &quot;goddess of philosophy&quot; to be religion.So read the book if you are philosophically inclined. It has its own rewards."},{"Title":"Get a Grip on Philosophy","review":"A delightful book.

It reads like a comic book...but don't let that fool you.For those of you new to philosophy, who doesn't have an axe to grind? Religion has always been both and enemy and an influence to Philosophy, and Turnbull reflects this in his own angstful way.

He seemed fairly evenhanded to me except in the matter of Jesus Christ where he gives a stock line that \\"we know little about the life of the historical Jesus\\" and then credits Gnosticism with great influence on fledgling Christianity. This is old Liberalism which modern scholarship has left behind. (See NT Wright and EP Sanders for the Jewishness of the New Testament.) One sentence seems to say Paul preached Gnosticism (when he actually vehemently opposed it) but I suspect it's a case of juxtaposition.Rather disturbingly, at the end of his book Turnbull says we have to go back to the beginning of philosophy, to its pre-Socratic days.

This wouldn't be so frustrating if the author did not fail to offer an even remotely coherent and articulate position by the end of his extended diatribe, but he does fail. Miserably. This book is *not* an accurate, unbiased introduction to the world of philosophy. It is instead an *extremely* biased interpretation of the history of philosophy with the intent of defending some sort of vague metaphilosophical position. The author tears away at modern analytic philosophy as it is practiced in today's universities, but this utter tripe is proof-positive that the \\"technical\\" style of philosophy today is much-needed in order to avoid the ambiguous, irrational and muddled kind of thinking that all too many of us have been (or, in the author's case, still is) guilty of. For God's sakes, if you're going to take on the form and style of philosophy that practically *is* modern philosophy, at least be clear about what you're trying to say! And it is clearly dishonest to avoid pointing out from the start that this is more an opinionated book about metaphilosophy (how philosophy should be practiced) than it is an introductory text about philosophy.This is a self-righteous and bitter piece of work. I can't help but wonder if Mr. Turnbull once had aspirations to make it into the academic world, only to be shut down for lack of talent or ability. Regardless, this is not a book for anybody who is looking for an overview of the history of philosophy or philosophy in general. There are plenty of good books out there for that purpose; _Get a Grip on Philosophy_ is absolutely not one of them."},{"Title":"Get a Grip on Philosophy","review":"Anyone interested in Philosophy will not learn from this book.

So does the image of the orphanage as a giant warehouse packed to the rafters with filthy children cowering under the harsh glare of psychotic social workers. Kenneth Cmiel's \\"A Home of Another Kind: One Chicago Orphanage and the Tangle of Child Welfare\\" does much to refute this view. Certainly, some orphanages were cesspools that mistreated their charges, but most genuinely tried to assist the children under their care. Cmiel's book, through the use of a plethora of source materials--including orphanage records, government documents, and personal interviews-- successfully charts the changing course of child welfare by looking at the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum from its founding in 1860 to its reorganization as a research center in 1984. Most importantly, he uses his findings to trace the changing attitudes regarding the care of dependent and delinquent children in the country at large.The author discovers that the early years of the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum, from 1860 to roughly 1900, were a time of private, religion based assistance. The people that ran the institution on a daily basis were Protestant, wealthy, and female. They lived near the asylum, which meant that they took a personal interest in the condition of the institution and the children living there. The women running the orphanage also helped raise the funds necessary to operate the building on a yearly basis. Children chosen to live in the asylum came from working class families undergoing some sort of catastrophic upheaval, disasters that left one or both of the parents needing someone to watch their offspring while they put their family back together again. As a result, children in the orphanage during the early years of its existence rarely lived there very long. Progressive ideas about childcare, which began in earnest after 1900, sought to change the practices of the asylum by creating a unified network of facilities dependent upon citywide umbrella organizations that disbursed both funds and the latest social service theories. While successful in some areas, these Progressive ideas failed to gain power over Chicago area orphanages and asylums because privately owned facilities refused to give up control.The Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war period saw public funding increase from a trickle to a flood. With the boost in public funding came rules and regulations that severely curtailed the traditional authority of the private managing boards. The Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum, now known as Chapin Hall as a result of a new facility built with donated funds, gradually turned over control of the organization to the professionally trained staff. The institution also went on the public dole, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). With public money came new responsibilities, primarily rejecting dependent kids in favor of delinquent children with a host of emotional and physical problems. Chapin Hall became a \\"residential treatment facility\\" staffed with dozens of highly trained professionals working intensively with the youths. When the state government began a policy of \\"deinstitutionalization\\" in the 1970s, a policy that sought to remove as many children from public orphanages and asylums as possible, Chapin Hall failed to respond to the new reality and closed after running deep deficits for several years. The institution reopened as a children's research center under the ownership of the University of Chicago.Cmiel's book is a wonderful work because it succeeds in personalizing the history of the Chicago orphanage. The author consistently brings to the foreground the personal elements of social history that are often lost in lengthy descriptions of changing policies, power struggles, and theories on childcare. The reader gains a very real sense of what it was like to live in an asylum. For instance, Cmiel describes how the children living in the orphanage in the late nineteenth century, both male and female, had their heads shaved in order to prevent lice. And the descriptions of youths with serious mental and emotional problems in the later years of the orphanage, children abandoned by their parents and left to languish at Chapin Hall for years, brought tears to the eyes of this reader. It is rare for a history book to elicit this sort of reaction. Arguably the most surprising element in the book concerns the process of deinstitutionalization, and who started that process. Conservatives usually shoulder the blame for closing down hospitals, mental asylums, and other shelters. But Cmiel's research points the finger at liberals coming into power in the 1970s. They supported reducing the number of children in institutions with programs designed to keep kids at home or in small group houses scattered throughout the city. It was only later that Republicans signed on to the policies when they too discovered the amount of money the state would save in the process. It seems there is enough guilt to go around for both parties.It is difficult to find problems with Cmiel's study due to the excellent research and strict parameters of the study. Yet there are a few areas that could use additional explanation or elaboration. For example, at several points in the narrative the author contends that Catholic facilities eluded Progressive efforts to exert financial and operational control far longer than most of the city's other institutions. Not until the DCFS pumped massive amounts of money into privately controlled facilities did the Catholics turn over control. Why were Catholic operations impervious to the earlier Progressive attempts to unite Chicago's childcare institutions under a broad operational umbrella when others were not? Was Catholic unity the reason these asylums resisted change for so long? Or was it something else? If it was the latter, could the Protestant organizations like Chapin Hall have done something similar and thus explored other options to keep control of their institution, if even for awhile longer?"},{"Title":"A Home of Another Kind: One Chicago Orphanage and the Tangle of Child Welfare","review":"This book takes you back to the mid 1850's when a couple women decided to open up a daycare for children who were left to fend for themselves due to a working single parent (or other...) and had no other resources to care for their baby or small child. Eventually this daycare grew & grew along with the awareness of this resource and the desperate need for it...and it evolved into the Chapin Hall for Children Orphanage where I spent 5+ yrs as a child.This book uses the lens of the beginning of this daycare through the end of the orphanage, in 1984 and beyond, to explore the journey of the ever changing views about what children need and how to provide it. The institutions had become dependent on DCFS funding and if they were to survive to continue it's mission of providing children with much needed care, they had to conform to rapidly changing rules and demands. Eventually, DCFS decided to do away with orphanages and institutions...From my perspective, this book gives an institutional context that created the circumstances for much of the emotional chaos I experienced at Chapin Hall.While the author takes a peripheral look at the similarities and differences of other similar institutions and 'child welfare' providers, he does not delve into the damage wreaked on those trapped within the tumultuous climate. He provides lots of details (names, dates, details, etc...) but very little insight from the children's perspective.I found it to be engaging and interesting institutional history of a place that played a vital role in our emotional development."},{"Title":"A Home of Another Kind: One Chicago Orphanage and the Tangle of Child Welfare","review":"Child Abuse by the Stateby Patrick QuinnChild welfare work consists of one party taking over some or all of the process of rearing children when another party, usually in the nuclear family, has failed in some egregious way. Since the nuclear family is one of the most important components of any civil society, this is extremely important work.Children whose families fail them in some catastrophic way -- either through abuse, neglect or abandonment -- eventually become adults, and often prove to be formidable social nuisances. And the ability of any society to deal with such children is all the more crucial given that such problems seem to be pretty durable over time. Concern with exceedingly poor child rearing dates at least as far back as ancient Sumeria, and probably farther.America's approach to child welfare work has undergone a dramatic shift over the past 100 years, but the nature of the work done has remained fundamentally the same. When families are unwilling or unable to raise their children -- for whatever reason -- the rearing process must be assumed by someone else. What has changed in American child welfare work over the course of the 20th century is who that someone is. In the past, child welfare work was almost entirely private. Today, the assumption of the rearing process is handled almost entirely by government.It is time to consider the likelihood that this transition was a tragic mistake.Does gross ineffectiveness bother you? In 1995, a Chicago Tribune report revealed that the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), the state child welfare bureaucracy, did not know the whereabouts of more than 20,000 of its wards. Think about that for a moment: The physical location of roughly half of the children under the direct responsibility of the state was unknown to the state's bureaucrats.Does fiscal insanity bother you more? In Illinois, DCFS has been under fire almost constantly since its creation via legislative fiat in 1964. A steady stream of exposes has uncovered blunder after blunder: children sleeping on the floors of DCFS offices, a group of children housed without supervision in a local motel with regular access to adult movies, children actually dying while in the state's care. The state finally gave in to the immense political pressure that comes with such tragic and chronic embarrassments and went on a knee-jerk spending spree, with the help of some changes in state Medicaid laws. In the early 1990s, the DCFS budget soared more than 300 percent. Today, that budget is well over $1 billion. The clearest result of all of that spending is that children in the system now have a lot more people to &quot;care&quot; for them.Imagine a troubled child trying to adjust to a new group home. Now, after all that spending, that same child of limited coping abilities is expected to adjust to a new set of &quot;parents&quot; every 8 hours, along with numerous ancillary workers. And since all of those bloated budgets need to be justified, those who work in the system have been turned into paper jockeys. As a therapist coworker once told me, &quot;I got into this field to try to help children, but 60-70 percent of my job is paperwork.&quot;Or perhaps you are particularly bothered by arbitrary power. Now, imagine combining arbitrary and largely unstoppable power with the pseudo-sciences of psychiatry and social work. That mix is what exists in much of child welfare work. I have had the utterly enervating experience of witnessing this combination of forces used to dismantle children psychologically and spiritually.One of the group homes where I worked was set in a quiet residential neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. One of the boys, Shannon, was a model child, not just in our institution, but among all of the neighborhood children as well. Shannon was utterly reliable. We allowed him free reign in the neighborhood, gave him an allowance, let him join the local YMCA, and even sent him shopping when essentials ran out.One day, some psychiatric social workers from the state visited the home, a &quot;private&quot; contractor with the state. Their putative function was to act as a kind of meta-authority within the system, looking into special cases, or performing investigations of problems, and so on. They were interested in Shannon because of his unique situation. Altogether, he had nine family members in the custody of the state, including two younger brothers who lived with him at our home, and his oldest brother, who had just been convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in Arizona. Shannon didn't know his oldest brother, but the social workers thought it appropriate to probe his thoughts on the sentencing, and in the process to review his situation to see if any changes were warranted.For reasons known only to themselves, the workers began suggesting to Shannon that they would separate him from his two younger brothers at the home by placing him elsewhere. Most likely, they were simply under pressure to change his &quot;treatment plan,&quot; which is the name given to the state's plan for dealing with individual wards. Treatment plans represent an effort to quantify the services given to wards (e.g., length of stay in the system), as well as to specify the nature of the services rendered (e.g., foster care vs. institutional settings, medication vs. behavior modification). Since treatment plans are tied to state budgets, there is constant pressure to tinker with them, a process that often does not consider a child's best interests. From the vantage-point of those actually raising Shannon -- me and my co-worker -- there was absolutely no reason to move him.Not surprisingly, Shannon was bothered greatly by the suggestion. As I've said, he was a sweet, good little kid. But every human has a touchy spot, and the thought of separation from his brothers, understandably, was his. Loving and watching over his two little brothers -- was a responsibility Shannon had understandably (and proudly) bestowed upon himself, given the condition of his family.So he became combative with the workers. Not violent, mind you; just angry enough to raise his voice to the complete strangers who were proposing to shatter what was left of his life. In response, they had him summarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Shannon, the good kid, was no more.As justification for their move, the social workers engaged in a bit of revisionist history. As it turned out, Shannon had the swimming ability of a rock, and about a week earlier had nearly drowned at the YMCA. He was revived on the pool deck, and was fine after a short observation. The social workers decided to call this a suicide attempt. Suddenly, Shannon was a depressed youth suffering from suicidal ideation.And of course, on the psychiatric ward, he was medicated for the first time in his life. When he began having nightmares (presumably from the drugs, as is so often the case) he was tagged as suffering from a psychotic episode. And, his (perfectly sensible) refusal to cooperate at all at the hospital was taken by the social workers as &quot;evidence&quot; of their having made a keen diagnosis, and as justification for their intervention.Such is the circular, arbitrary reasoning of psychiatric social work.Monolithic WelfareOne of the most troubling aspects of all this is that child welfare work in America is a monolith. The problems I've been describing are systemic and nationwide. Just as public education has withered the private school sector, so too has the government's role in caring for delinquent and dependent children reduced the options for such children. Sure, there are a few largely private organizations that have endured the state's takeover of child welfare work. Boys Town, one of the largest and most famous, accepts only about ten percent of its income from the state. But these institutions are the exception. The rule for children whose families don't function for them is the labyrinth of public and quasi-public homes and agencies that the government has created, including the perennially troubled juvenile court system.Even the &quot;private&quot; homes like I worked at are funded and controlled by the state. One group home that I worked for called itself a private organization, but it received nearly 80% of its operating income directly from the state and was thoroughly controlled by the state, right down to the minute detail of what the children could have on the tops of their dressers. Even the option for children that is furthest removed from the state -- foster homes, private homes where children are placed by the state -- is tightly regulated by government bureaucrats.And the results are what one might expect of government bureaucracy. Child welfare bureaucrats constantly claim that resources are too scarce. But in reality, inefficiencies and politics are squandering resources that desperately need to be utilized. In Illinois in 1991, for example, DCFS admitted that of the 14,000 foster homes it had licensed, only 6,000 were in use at any time.Given all of this, it is more than worthwhile to"},{"Title":"Alan Turing: Life and Legacy of a Great Thinker","review":"This book celebrates the 90th anniversary of the birth of Alan Turing by bringing together a large set of essays on topics as diverse and colourful as the work and life of the man himself.

Highly recomend."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"I got this book many, many moons ago when I first became interested in Japanese history. I was studying kendo -- I was younger and healthier at the time. I read the book eagerly at that time.I just re-read my old copy. The book is easily available at Amazon.com. It's not a bad read at all. However, there are a few historical inaccuracies.First, the author forgot about the custom of \\"alternate attendance,\\" where a daimyo had to spend every other year in Edo and he had to leave his wife and children as hostages to the Shogun at his Edo residence. The author begins the book with Lord Asano's legitimate daughter riding with Oishi in Ako. He goes on later with a description from Lord Asano's viewpoint about how this is his first time coming to Edo. The author also discusses how Lord Asano looks forward to his wife coming home with him. That didn't happen during the Tokugawa reign; both the wife and the daughter would have had to remain in Edo.Second, there is a description about how archery is prohibited because of Shogun Tsunayoshi's laws about preventing cruelty to animals (it would be forbidden to pluck feathers for making the arrows). And yet there are several scenes where samurai use archery in fighting each other and one of the ronin has set up an archery school.Third, when Kira's house is attacked, he \\"buckles on his sword belt.\\" Japanese swordfighters did not have sword buckles the way European swordfighters did. Japanese swordfighters put their swords underneath their obi sashes.Fourth, there is a bit of confusion about the role of Mimura, who is described as a \\"servant.\\" He was portrayed as following Oishi to Kira's mansion the night of the attack. In truth, Mimura Jurozaemon participated in the attack and committed seppuku afterward. He is buried at Sengakugi Temple. He was a low-ranked samurai and may very well have been a servant as such.There may have been a few other minor errors. But these are the three I remember.Other than the technical errors, which I found a bit distracting, as a work of fiction, it's well-written. It's told mostly from Oishi's viewpoint, though the author uses the viewpoints of others, including Kira and some of his allies. As an original sort of feature, Kira is portrayed as \\"an excellent swordsman\\" rather than as a doddering old man who doesn't know one end of a sword from the other. I found this quite refreshing. There's a wonderful scene when Hara Soemon comes upon Oishi carousing drunkenly in a teahouse. Hara is outraged. There's another interesting story about a ronin (not one of the Ako ronin) who was hired to be one of Kira's spies.This is a work of fiction. There are various rather heated arguments among scholars and others about the actual history of the Ako ronin incident. Enjoy this as a stirring tale rather than as a true historical document."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"i am a fan of historical fictions so it was a matter of time before i read this book. The book did not strike a chord with me in the sense that it stressed duty and honor since honestly, while I enjoy samurai lore, I feel these guys are pretty darn stubborn and could avoid a lot of the dilemmas they face were they to be humble and suffer some humiliation.However, thats exactly what samurai do not do, for they are a proud class, and this book really captures their devotion and commitment to their ideals. Good read but I wasn't engrossed in the story."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"Very good over all. Well told and the author successfully gets into the minds of the 47 ronin and what motivates them. It would have been desirable if we got to know their arch-enemy Kira and perhaps even the Shogun himself better. The publisher (Tuttle) continues to exhibit its allergy to including an index (typically for them, there is none). In spite of these issues, it was a good read."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"This is a novelized version of a famous historical even, the revenge of the 47 ronin. It was enjoyable reading but I felt it could have moved at a faster pace. I also felt that it should have been geared more toward a younger audience since this type of story would probably be popular with middle school age boys. It would have been more engaging in the way of foreshadowing if the chapters had been given names instead of just numbers. Since it's a novel based on an actual historical event the author should have made some delineations and given actual facts for each major development in the story. Maps and drawings would have also been helpful."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"I managed to pick up John Allyn's \\"47 Ronin Story\\" for a discount price, and recently finished my reading of it. It went pretty fast, and it was somewhat entertaining, but all in all, I was a bit disappointed.Firstly, the presentation itself is lacking in character. While this may be (and probably is) a deliberate attempt to muster some of the feel of Japanese works, he seems to miss the basic essence of some of those simplified presentations, and the result is a very stacatto feel to events and descriptions of the story. Are we supposed to understand/sympathize with Oishi, the leader of the band, who sacrifices everything for the sake of his lord? It is difficult with the material present. Years seem to pass by in days, and one never really gets a feel for how long these men waited to exact revenge for the death of their lord.Moreover, there is a distinctive Western feel to the story, particularly the romance between Oishi and his geisha (whose name escapes me). For example, at one point, she passionately throwing the covers off her naked body, she pins him down in the bed pleading with him to give up his thoughts of revenge. It seems very contrived, particularly considering the behavior to which she is accustomed (I apologize if one finds this to be a major plot spoiler, although IMHO, if a book can be spoiled by giving one or two plot lines, it isn't worth it's salt). While Allyn tells us that his story is indeed a fictional interpretation of events whose details are obscured, at best, some scenes simply feel out of place in his own rendition (no other woman in the book acts in this way, e.g.).However, as I mentioned, the book goes fast (it took me about 3 hours to read it), and it certainly serves as a good diversion (e.g. on a plane flight), but I like my books to have a bit more meat."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"If you're curious about the history of the samurai and the ancient culture of Japan, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"Book well worth it, an easy read and a good page turner. For anyone who enjoys Samurai stuff, check this book out."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"The 47 Ronin is based on historical events. In 1701 an old school samurai lord was goaded into assaulting a foppish and corrupt member of the shogun's staff. And for this his life was forfeit. He was forced to commit suicide. His troops had a problem with this.They were under surveillance as, correctly, the shogun and his inner circle suspected that they would want revenge. But the samurai chose to bide their time. They waited for years, lulled the government into a false sense of security, and then planned and executed their revenge of the self-serving bureaucrat that was behind their lord's death.As a story, it is brilliant. The characters are complex and well developed. The plot involves conflicts between law and integrity. The settings are well portrayed. It is hard to put down.As a case study, the 47 Ronin planned, reconnoitered, prepared and executed a very competent military operation. They displayed a remarkable appreciation for operational and tactical patience, appreciated the need for reconnaissance, and integrated information operations into the execution of the plan. The leadership demonstrated by the ronin who orchestrates the plan is exemplary.This makes for a superb reading for leadership, Japanese culture, or military science.And a heck of great story.E.M.

It puts you right into 16th, 17th, and 18th century Japan capturing the very essence of traditional Japanese culture meeting today's modern Japanese. The story's arranger John Allyn does a very good job balancing entertainment and translational, historical, accuracy. It displays many subtle but devastating and drastic changes of the attitudes, society, and culture of Japan as its feudal era began to come to an end. Honor, Loyalty, Service, Revenge, Truth, Justice, Patience, Wisdom, Perfection. Those are just a few of the words that describe some of the greatest warriors of our time: the samurai."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"The 47 Ronin Story is a story of honor and determination. In the tale, the Lord Asano is visiting the Shogun's court and is affronted by Kira, the Shogun's Master of Ceremonies. In response, Lord Asano attacks Kira, wounding him but violating the law of not attacking another in the Shogun's keep. Because of this, the Shogun ordered Lord Asano to commit seppuku in response for his affront and confiscated his lands and holdings. At this point, the story of the 47 Ronin truly begins.The samurai serving Lord Asano learn of the affront to their lord and his being forced to commit seppuku and having to decide whether to obey the Shogun's decree, fight, or commit seppuku. Oishi, the leader of Lord Asano's samurai decides to order the Ako to obey the Shogun's decree but to look to taking vengeance on Kira. To do this, Oishi orders the Ako samurai to disperse, some of whom are to learn what they can of Kira. While the samurai (now ronin since they no longer have a lord) are following Kira though, Kira's supporters are following Oishi to determine if the Ako Ronin are attempting revenge. Taking their time, and moving quietly, Oishi and the Ako Ronin lay plans for vengeance...While the story of The 47 Ronin is arguably the greatest story to come from Japan, my feeling is that Mr. Allyn failed in capturing the story. Mr. Allyn's telling is to western in it's telling. While Mr. Allyn describes the honor and dedication Oishi and the Ako samurai/ronin had, it's thru the eye's of a westerner and with their dialog. To me, this is like reading a modern telling of the Iliad rather than the classical telling. While the 47 Ronin Story is a classic and worthy of 5 stars, I have say that John Allyn's telling is only worthy of 3 stars."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"Extremely disciplined and clear writing; I was delighted to discover it was still in print!This man really knows how to tell a story."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"This book is a credible modern version of the Japanese saga of the 47 ronin (ex-samurai), for whom honor and loyalty to their master were the prime sense of their life.When their master is slain because he fights against corruption (high taxes, briberies) and silly laws (the \`Life Preservation Laws' of the Shogun, making animals more privileged than human beings), their only life goal becomes revenge, \`bringing peace to their master's soul', because \`a samurai cannot live under the same sky as the slayer of his lord'. But at the end only 47 of his former soldiers remain loyal to their cause and will try to seek revenge for their master's execution.This book doesn't attain the high standards of well-known Japanese classics (e.g., The Tales of Genji) and flirts sometimes with melodrama.

In Japanese, it is entitled &quot;Chushingura&quot; which translates as &quot;Vengeance&quot; The Forty-Seven Ronin Story probably ranks as one of my favorite books about history ( and I have read many). Unlike other historical situations where men were faced with death, these men had a choice between life and death and they chose death with honor. The warriors were driven by allegiance to their code of chivalry known as &quot;Bushido&quot; which emphasizes a fanatical loyalty to their lord, tempered by the serenity and wisdom of Confucianism and Buddhism. The book provides fascinating insight into the feudal system known as &quot;bakufu&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate and the influences of Confucianism and Buddhism on Japanese society. While it may be fictionalized or embellished in places, the book is based on a true incident which occurred in 1701. The loyal retainers of Lord Asano were given the choice of a free life with a loss of reputation suffered when their lord was wrongly forced to commit seppuku. Instead, the men chose to seek vengeance and restore honor to their clan. The loss of face caused by the death of their lord was more than they could endure and the men sought revenge after a two year facade of drunkeness, unruly behavior and poverty. Ultimately, the corrupt court official responsible for Lord Asano's death was beheaded by the loyal retainers and the men dutifully paid their respects at Lord Asano's grave before turning themselves in for court martial. All forty-seven men were given the privilege of committing seppuku, for which they were grateful since imprisonment or execution was considered disgraceful. The loyal retainers were buried with their lord at a temple called Sengaku-ji which is located just outside of the city of Tokyo. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Japanese culture, history or martial arts. It is one of the most impressive examples of men who refuse to compromise their honor or integrity at any cost.."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"The story of the 47 ronin is THE national story of Japan and the key to understanding Nihon Kokoro, the japanese mind. Just as the United States has the legend of the Alamo, Japan has the story of the 47 Ronin. The popularity of the story comes from the fact that the heroes had become an ideal. They embody all that a Nihonjin, a Japanese person strives to be. It also illustrates the cultural chasm between the asian cultures and western cultures regarding duty, honor and death (the japanese consider seppuku a very honorable way to die).The heroic warriors were offered a chance to live, but in a solemn and dramatic ceremony, each man, in turn, knelt down and ran his thumb over the blade of a razor sharp Katana (sword blade)in order to draw blood. One by one, they then impressed their thumbprint on a document swearing loyalty to the end to Asano, Lord of Ako. More than three hundred fifty men in all executed the blood oath, and forty-seven would avenge him. The Ronin were buried next to their Lord and his wife on the grounds of a buddhist temple, a site of ritual pilgramige to this day. A must read for anyone studying martial arts, this book is the key to understanding the spirit and the drive of the Japanese people."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"John Allyn here presents for English language audiences one of the most oft-told episodes in Japanese history. In March 1701, Lord Asano of Ako, having been summoned before the Shogun in Edo (modern Tokyo), was provoked into attacking a corrupt official, Kira, the Shogun's Master of Ceremonies. Asano was forced to commit seppuku, ritual suicide, and his lands were forfeit. His death left his samurai masterless, or ronin , but when they learned that Kira had survived his wounds they determined to avenge Asano, following the Confucian edict that :[N]o man may live under the same sky with the murderer of his lord.After biding their time until Kira was in an exposed position--no longer protected by the Shogun's forces--forty seven of Asano's former samurai attacked his castle (December 14, 1702) and killed him, despite the almost certain death their actions were likely to bring :[S]ome people live all their lives without knowing which path is right. They're buffeted by this wind or that and never really know where they're going. That's largely the fate of the commoners--those who have no choice over their destiny. For those of us born as samurai, life is something else. We know the path of duty and we follow it without question.Their action proved so popular that the Shogun allowed the forty seven to commit seppuku rather than be executed as criminals. Their gravesite, at Sengaku-ji Temple, remains a national shrine; the story is a staple of Japanese theater under the title Chushingura; and there are several film versions, including one which was used as WWII propaganda by the government.In Allyn's capable retelling, the story is brisk and thrilling, with a minimum of extraneous philosophizing or psychoanalyzing. The action, though terrible, takes on a logic of its own, as the ronin seek to redeem their master and preserve their own obligations of honor, loyalty, and duty. The tale and its continuing resonance reveals much that is admirable, but also unfortunate, about the Japanese character. You can't help but admire the devotion with which they adhere to their moral code, but at the same time there is something chilling about the automatic, unthinking nature of their actions and the degree to which they are influenced by external factors, like how others will judge them, rather than by internal ethical considerations. Most disturbing though is the question of whether this loyalty is a one way street, or whether the masters would be similarly willing to sacrifice themselves for their underlings, and whether each samurai would so sacrifice himself for a mere comrade.Obedience, particularly blind obedience, be it to a man or to a code of conduct, is a very dangerous trait for any culture to glorify, both because it absolves the obedient of moral responsibility and because it stifles innovative thought. The same qualities which seem so laudable here and which have made Japan a homogenous, orderly, productive, and nonlitigious society, have also made it susceptible to authoritarian government, overt and covert racism, industrial cronyism, economic stagnation, and have contributed to a culture that is simply not very creative and tends to be too inflexible for its own good.As a pure novel of adventure, the book is terrific and the insight the story provides into the Japanese character is invaluable. Both the book and two movie versions of the story, 47 Ronin and Chushingura, are well worth tracking down.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"While not hugely detailed, \\"The Forty-Seven Ronin Story\\" is a good introduction to one of the central icons of Japanese history. The 47 Ronin have become the embodiment of duty, sacrifice and honour, and deservedly so. This book, while not without its faults, presents non-Japanese readers with a good introduction to the tale.Essentially, the book stays true to the major details of the 47 Ronin story. It is not detailed, as it is not all that long, but it covers the main points and adds some flesh to the story along the way.For those not familiar with Japanese manners and courtesy of the Edo Period, the book has no major issues. However, those familiar with these points, will find places where Allyn has taken some liberties and changed aspects of the story. One such point is the attack on the Shogun's courtier and the place where it happened. While not fatal to the story itself, it is noticeable to those with a familiarity with the history surrounding the 47 Ronin.For a fast, light read, \\"The Forty-Seven Ronin Story\\" is a great book that is a great introduction to a fantastic episode in Japanese history. However, for history buffs who have already gained a fair amount of knowledge on this specific episode, you might want to find something else.For those who want more about the history itself, there is a good selection of contemporary and nearly so sources translated in Hiroaki Sato'sLegends of the Samurai.

It is the original story of true loyalty and vengance. I was surprised at how few versions of this story are actually written (at least in the US). Keep in mind this is one written version of a popular folktale - much like many popular Robin Hood stories. There are few actual written historical accounts of the true events and what goes on in the story is not to be taken as historically accurate. It is a good yarn and the author has done an excellent job of weaving together this story. You feel Oishi's quiet outrage every step of the way on his quest to avenge his Lord Asano. Parts of the plot of this story have been retold in several popular American movies typically in the form of the son trying to avenge the death of his father rather than the retainer trying to avenge the death of his master (Star Wars anyone?).

Once you know the outcome of the 47 Ronin story, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"Revenge and Redemption In a world where change was taking place so rapidly, the 47 ronin of Ako forced themselves to continue the tradition of honor and social control that feudal Japan had once been ruled by. Japan was a place that was in a constant state of flux and change in the beginning of the 18th century. While the Shogun, Tsunayoshi, attempted to further his central control in the country social changes began to take place. The makeup of the social classes was being redefined. A system that was once enforced by the samurai was now increasingly being centralized. Asano and his force of samurai were the exception to this rule of change. For them the most important aspect of their history was duty, honor, and sacrifice. The 47 Ronin Story is a book about honor, revenge and redemption. From the beginning of the story, the concept of honor and redemption is apparent. Lord Asano of Ako is portrayed as an honorable man who is trying to live the laws set forth by the Shogun Tsunayoshi. In obedience to his leader, Asano is readying himself for the ceremonies to take place in the palace of the Shogun. At the same time, an element of tradition and redemption of traditional ways takes place in his preparation. In order for Asano to understand the etiquette for the occasion, he must learn from the Shogun's master of ceremonies, Kira. Kira requires a bribe for his services and Asano refuses to pay the bribe because of his traditional values. In Asano's attempt to protect and redeem himself from the bribery and corruption, he ends up committing a grievous act wherein he injures Kira and seals his fate. Although Asano was allowed to commit seppuku it was, in a way, a disgrace to the honor and tradition of traditional Japanese values. Immediately after the death of the Lord of Ako, the samurai serving Asano, now ronin or masterless samurai, become fixed on revenge and redemption of their good names, and the name of their master, Lord Asano. No longer with a master, and their lands taken over, the ronin of Ako disperse with the knowledge that some day they will hopefully return and avenge the death of their lord, and regain their titles as samurai. With Kira alive the ronin felt they could not redeem themselves without the death of their lord's effectual killer. In the first days after their master's death, almost all of the ronin vowed to someday get revenge. As time passed, however, only the most dedicated ronin were seen to be the ones to take an interest in regaining what was previously theirs. In the attempt to organize their forces, the ronin of Ako would eventually have to do exactly the opposite of what they were planning to do in order to attain revenge, and redeem themselves. The ronin had to totally degrade themselves. The ronin had to let others around them know that they were truly masterless samurai who had lost all of their will to become honorable men through revenge on Kira. One man opened up an archery school, teaching the arts of the samurai to the common people. This was a despicable and dishonorable action to take. Even Oishi, the retainer of the Ako forces had to convince the people around him that he was no longer desirous to seek revenge, and redeem his good name. In his attempt to soil his reputation he divorced his wife, began drinking heavily, spent his time in geisha houses, attended the Kabuki theater, and even started a fight in the theater allowing himself to lose showing his apparent bad sowrdsmanship. While trying to soil his reputation further by living with a mistress from one of the geisha houses, and drinking heavily, some of the ronin under his command began to question his ability in leadership. Fortunately the charade put on by the ronin of Ako was seen by outsiders as a loss in honor and reputation. Spies that once watched the ronin retreated, and the ronin were finally able to plan their final attack on their hated enemy. In the final attack, the men of Ako were a small but committed group of 47 ronin, poised and ready for a surprise attack. Like a tiger stalking its prey, the men were able to attack the residence of the now retired Kira ending the conflict. By this action not only did the men of Ako get revenge on the person who in effect killed their master, but they were able to redeem their names, and the name of the master Lord Asano. Although all 47 ronin were sentenced to death, they were allowed to die in the honorable ceremony of seppuku, or ritual disembowelment. As the men acted together in their common cause they became united in their struggle that eventually lead to their deaths. In their deaths they found peace and comfort in exacting revenge, and redemption and honor in their actions."},{"Title":"47 Ronin Story","review":"The 47 Ronin Story by John Allyn is a wonderful book and is easy to read also. The paperback has a feel to it that makes it readable, yet when you've finished you feel full; content. The amazing (and true) story of these 47 Ronin really makes an impact on the reader and also challenges them, because it makes you ask the question, 'What is honorable?' Some of these samurai became drunks and whore-mongers simply to avenge the honor of their lord. Is that considered right? Does the end really justify the means? With such a revered history in Japan, the story is a must read for anyone who has a love for the Japanese or Samurai culture.

It is based on an 18th century historical event, which has been retold many times. Mr. Allyn writes a very readable story that emphasizes duty, honor, betrayal and loyalty. Mr. Allyn's version of this story is not only exciting but he also does an effective job describing the rigid social structure of this period in Japan. And he does so in a simple and elegant prose. In this story, the admirable Lord Asano goes to visit the Shogun at his palace. While preparing to meet the Shogun, he insults a greedy scheming sycophant, who plots revenge and traps the fiery but naive Lord Asano into taking an action which leads to his demise. As a result, the Shogun also takes the lands of the dead Lord and banishes his wife. Hearing of his death, his samurai, who are now ronin, plot the death of the sycophant. To tell more is to spoil it but suffice it say that this book not only tells an exciting story but illustrates a society where the code of behavior is very different than the one in which we live.

Over the years I've read too many books which live up to the negative connotations of the epithet \\"pulp\\". This is not one of them.Marshall Browne is an intelligent writer who knows how to get inside the mind of his protagonist. He has done this superbly in his Inspector Anders books, and now has created a similarly compelling and unusual character in Inspector Hideo Aoki of the Tokyo Municipal Police. Crime books set in Japan are enough of a rarity to give this outing an advantage over the more commonly-travelled mean streets of crime fiction. Browne evokes the particular characteristics of both the city and rural settings with great care and attention to detail. In fact, detail is an area of writing at which he excels, with meticulous research adding to the vividness of the novel, but never weighing it down as sometimes happens. Nowadays I read little crime fiction, but a book like this reminds me of what originally drew me to the genre, and indeed what can make it great and memorable reading."},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"I loved this book. Set in Japan and especially in a northern inn (called Ryokan) the atmosphere and sense of place for me made it a winner. But there's plenty of mystery and blood-soaked action! We meet Detective Inspector Hideo Aoki of the Tokyo Municipal Police, a Robert De Niro look-a-like, I think, whose life both as cop and person has collapsed. He's been pulled from a case involving a corrupt and murderous ex-governor, nicknamed the Fatman. Aoki can't get this nasty politician out of his head. He gets suspended. Bad things happen to his wife, and a newspaperman who writes it up. Aoki spirals down further. His boss, Superintendent Watanabe (a really sinister character) sends the Inspector for a supposed health-cure to the remote inn. Aoki recalls it featured in an unsolved case of a missing woman years prior, who was the wife of a prominent banker and also the former owner of the inn, now run by her daughter. The seventh anniversary of the disappearance is coming up, and a number of people have assembled: the missing woman's banker husband, a Tokyo bureaucrat who was her callous lover - and her ex-husband, a half-crazy chef. A snowstorm totally isolates the inn. As the lights fail and the phones are cut (cell phones don't work in these mountains) murder and mayhem break out. Recovering from his nervous breakdown, with no badge, no forensics back-up, no cop partner to work with, no communications - and no gun! Aoki prowls the rambling and dark inn trying to solve the old case, the new murders - and stay alive himself. The deeply plotted story has more twists and turns than the corridors and staircases of the inn! The events at the inn lead back to the Fatman and the Yakusa - the Japanese Mafia. The creepy atmosphere evoked, the characters - all with a secret agenda, including the missing woman's beautiful and reticent daughter - kept me on the edge. I really liked the bits where Aoki befriends the inn's cat - and looks after his late wife's bonsai plants. And the mystery man from Osaka, who endlessly plays the ancient and war-like game of Go adds more intrigue. The story stalks you and bit by bit draws you in - in a frightening way. Can Inspector Aoki make a come-back? I hope so.A cat lover in Arlington."},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"Another cerebral, atmospheric thriller from the Australian author of the Italian Inspector Anders series, this one is set in modern Japan and features the reserved, dedicated Detective Inspector Hideo Aoki of the Tokyo police.The book opens with an abrupt, devastating end to 17 months of hard, secretive work by Aoki and his team documenting the criminal corruption of a powerful politician. Word has come from above to drop the nearly completed case and disperse Aoki's team to other duties forthwith.The detective prides himself on his stoicism. \\"Aoki was a pragmatist, like his mother. What came to him - in his police life, in his sparse life beyond that - he accepted. He took orders and worked hard and efficiently. Whatever way something finished, he went on to the next task, the next stage, but this time was different.\\" His team had poured their lives into the investigation. One detective's marriage had broken up because of it.Drinking too much, Aoki finds himself unwilling to go home to the gentle, cultured milieu of his wife and elderly father. Several years after the arranged, amenable marriage \\"it had occurred to Aoiki that his father had been choosing a daughter-in-law as much as a wife for his son.\\" He struggles to conform, to take up his new, mundane assignment, but then the detective whose marriage had failed commits suicide.Aoki breaks down at the supper table, and his wife, trying to help, leaks the case to a journalist. Aoki is suspended and his life begins to splinter under a series of devastating blows. In an effort to help, Inspector Watanabe, his superior, sends Aoki to a ryokan, a remote mountain retreat where men can shed the modern rat race and steep themselves in hot-spring baths and tranquil tradition, including Geisha services.But Aoki arrives to find strange company. A banker and the government functionary who cuckolded him are dining together on the anniversary eve of the unfaithful wife's disappearance seven years earlier. It was a sensational case and its lack of closure stalled Watanabe's career. In addition an elderly Go master talks in riddles and seems to know a bit too much about Aoki and his troubles, and the exquisite proprietor (daughter of the missing woman) exerts an allure as powerful as she is remote.A massive snowstorm traps all these people together without electricity (a minor inconvenience in this ancient inn) or phone and murder stalks the night. Secret rooms and ingenious medieval warning systems contribute to the atmosphere of ancient, enigmatic culture, behind-the-scenes menace and manipulation.This is not a flawless book. Some plot elements are a stretch, starting with the convenient snowstorm and even more convenient assemblage of characters. But Browne's skill with character and atmosphere more than make up for this and readers will wish he would write faster so we can have more of Aoiki and another Inspector Anders too.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"Japanese detective Aoki is very, very good. He's proven that he can get the job done. Problem is/Politicians give and they take way.Aoki and his selected team are given a high profile teflon political target. Aoki's investigation takes it's toll on his team in a lengthly top secret operation. All the legal ducks finially are lined-up and all thats needed is the order to start the arrests. But the rug is pulled out from under him and his men. Much face is lost. But kicks in the face from a systemically corrupt system(worldwide, including USA) come with the job. Aoki's mistake was that he'd forgotten its sponsors were a breed who always kept their options open and they don't want their dirty laundry aired. His other mistake was that he had gone straight from college into the metropolitan police and, in due corse, had been stamped out of its mold. So when a journalist is murdered because his wife wanted to restore Aoki's honor - he's in it for blood. The savage nature of the killing was a graphic message: a terrible lesson in not seeing, hearing, or telling(keep quiet about criminal business). Any hopes of any opposition political power breaking the criminal stranglehold on power were hardly more effective than the shadow play of those puppets. As the loses mount up for Aoki he is reminded of what his father told him/In time, the real appreciation of certain lost things comes to most of us. It is often accompanied by great sadness.His loved ones, and all they stood for, had slipped through his fingers, seemingly in a eyeblink. Broken in spirit and mind Aoki is wisked off to the far away Kamakura Inn to recuperate or be terminated from the force.A head of a large bank and a minister of finance are at the inn and tell Aoki/There're still trillions in gray area loans on the books. It wouldn't take too much to terminate our banking and financial world. Maybe up to half the bad debts involve yakuza. Somebody called our recession the yakuza recession. These shark's are business killers, life destroyers. The banker and minister of finance were to protect only the yakuza loans. Their doctored-up spin would be broadcast to the nation, masking the real truth behind the banking collapse.Also at the inn are key players in a seven year old murder case that remains unsolved, in which a fresh recruit named Aoki was involved. And now, a much more experienced Aoki, in success and failure, will have to, yet again, steel himself for another battle of wits, agility, & strength - for this time he's been rendezvoused in(n) to die.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Inspector Hideo Aoki and his squad have worked for almost a year and half of double shifts to gather evidence to prove criminal wrong doing of former Governor Yukio \\"Fatman\\" Tamaki. As they close in on the Fatman, the Director General informs Hideo the case is closed because the ex-public official is now considered above the law. To Hideo the Fatman wielded some of his major political and monetary influences to force the cops to back down.Making matters even worse for Hideo is that the brass sends him into exile as befitting a failure. He travels to the remote Kamakura Inn to investigate in what is assumed a nonentity murder. Instead Hideo soon finds ties to the notorious Fatman even as other killings occur, which he knows if he surfaces before he has airtight proof against the Fatman he will be yanked again and further humiliated with an even more remote exile.The key to this wonderful Japanese police procedural is the stubborn Aoki, who in spite of being run out of town in a fall from grace manner continues to do his best; he refuses to allow the abusive treatment of him stop him from doing his job even before he connects the dots back to the Fatman case. While the fast-paced story line provides an insightful look at Japanese society mostly through the eyes of Aoki, RENDEZVOUS AT KAMAKURA INN is owned by the beleaguered hero.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"This is the first Marshall Browne novel I have read, and unfortunately, it was disappointing.The book has an interesting premise and starts promisingly. However, it quickly deteriorates as the protaganist is frozen into inaction, spending most of his time wondering what to do.There is little tension here as the novel slowly makes its way to a predictable conclusion.I hear that Marshall Browne's Inspector Anders novels are much more entertaining so it might be worth trying one of Mr. Browne's other novels first; this one wasn't much chop."},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Kamakura Inn: A Thriller (Thomas Dunne Books)","review":"I'm sorry that I bought the book. The author pulls way too many rabbits out of the hat for me to enjoy this story. The few good descriptive passages and insights into Japan are quickly skewered by another tacky plot device. I'd expect better stuff from a high school AP English class. Yes, it has a compelling flavor that may make a page turner for some; but I'd suggest time and money could be better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Battle Over the Reich: The Strategic Bomber Offensive against Germany Volume 2 Nov 1943-May 1945","review":"..I thought this title would be worth investigating. Frankly it is not - the treatment is disappointing to say the least - this is over-priced (!!) slim 'coffee table' tome. There is little evidence of new research & data. The 'enhanced illustrations' are mostly Tullis profiles lifted directly from the Jagdwaffe series..large photos reproduced over an entire A-4 side are blurred & indistinct...if you know nothing at all about the subject it might be worth looking at..otherwise avoid."},{"Title":"Battle Over the Reich: The Strategic Bomber Offensive against Germany Volume 2 Nov 1943-May 1945","review":"Alfred Price is a leading author on the Allied bombing campaign over Germany in World War II. As such, it is always worth looking at any work on the subject that bears his name. However, I agree with an earlier reviewer that this book falls more in the category of \\"well presented coffee table book\\" than a must read for historical research. So for a reader with a more casual interest in the topic, I can recommend this book, however it is overpriced at its list price. Wait until it goes on the discount table then buy it at half price. It would be a good value then."},{"Title":"Battle Over the Reich: The Strategic Bomber Offensive against Germany Volume 2 Nov 1943-May 1945","review":"This book is one of the best I've seen describing the air war in Europe. It is the second volume in the overall work. It:Is Beautifully Illustrated, both photos and drawings Is Well Written Has Reports from German pilots as Well Discusses the Evolving Technology Covers Weapons that Came too Late.This second volume covers the end of 1943 to the end of the war. This is when the RAF and the US 8th Air Force finally hit their stride in bombing Germany. The tonnage dropped and the increased accuracy was finally able to deliver what the air oriented generals has been promising since the beginning of the war.The air generals had been saying that there was no magic target, no single target that would win the war. They were wrong. The magic target was fuel. By the end of the war the Germans had plenty of aircraft. But almost no fuel. Pilots were going into combat with very few hours. This was not unlike the British pilots during the Battle of Britain, but the British got better, and the Germans got worse until the end.This book was first written in the 1970's when it was possible to talk with a lot of the German flyers who were still alive. It has been re-written to reflect later research and re-printed for this edition. It's an excellent read."},{"Title":"Sister Irene's Culinary Journal: A Notebook Filled with Love, Faith, and Recipes Gathered Over Many Blessed Years of Cooking, Serving, and Caring","review":"Recipes for cream of butternut squash soup and avgolemono (Greek egg-lemon soup), Swiss omelet roll with mustard sauce, bahmi goreng (Indonesian pork), spring stuffed chicken breasts, roast rack of lamb with walnut crust and pear-bourbon sauce, toasted coconut souffle with chocolate rum sauce, Cape Cod cranberry cheesecake and other mouth-watering dishes are offered, a few pages at a time, following each few pages of Sister Irene's light, appealing personal reminiscences. Through the index, readers can locate individual recipes under type (e.g., salads) and major ingredient (e.g., turkey). Although the ingredients in sauces were chosen to enhance the flavors of specific foods, yet this reviewer supposes it possible for cooks to vary these ingredients to suit individual tastes. Besides opening a window for us on her Greek heritage, Sister Irene explains the use of various foods by the Orleans, Cod Cod (Massachusetts), inter-denominational co-educational community where she resides. We read of the planting and picking of beans and berries, the first presentation of a particular dish by a beloved resident, the sandwiches and desserts favored by members of the public flocking to the community's summer afternoon harbourside teas, as well as of local mission work and the community's symposium for choirmasters and organists. A note explains that the Community of Jesus is dedicated to &quot;the transformation of individual lives through a way of life centered on God.&quot; Readers of any faith, or of no faith, may be as fascinated as I was by this book, by the creative-sounding recipes, and by the atmosphere created or transmitted by its author. My only reason for awarding four stars instead of five is that I have not personally tried the recipes.

While all around Dominick Priest humanity is either commiting suicide or being killed by fanatics, the hero struggles overland toward his home village, not really knowing what awaits him there. On the way there, including during the crossing of the name-giving storm-tossed suspension bridge, he slowly goes mad and becomes the prophet of a new religion that embraces life - perhaps a bit too much..."},{"Title":"The bridge","review":"Mano's book is weirdly prescient about the burgeoning power of the green movement and he explores the darker ramifications of a world ruled by a green/socialist government whose ecological politics have tainted and warped the very fabric of society. Mankind is no longer dominant in this world, but has willingly ceded his dominion over it. The big change comes during a civil war between the Green/Eco forces and the Realist/Christian forces. In the end the Greens won and proceeded to radically remake the world, tearing up highways and parking lots, planting genetically modified plants that could grow in the harsh and polluted soils of the cities, and ending man's consumption of nature's resources. Pretty much what the Greens seek to do now, actually.But in this dystopian future we see what would happen if it is taken to it's ultimate end, such as the PETA or ELF folks would have it. For in this future no one farms or raises food, in fact eating or drinking anything is forbidden and punishable under the law. To subsist everyone consumes a liquid e-diet provided by the government. The e-diet is a chemically constructed nutrient rich fluid that the body can consume completely and produces no waste products at all, it is also loaded with narcotics to keep the people docile. Pollution of all forms has also been outlawed, even noise pollution - people are forbidden to listen to music, watch movies, or speak. In fact all communication is by a type of finger-speech or reading lips, and anyone making noise or speaking aloud, even in surprise, can be punished under the law. No competition is allowed either, playing games with others or competing against one's fellow man is a sign of anti-social behaviour and punishable under the law.There are more such laws that Mano introduces us to, and he does so in an interesting way. He has Priest, the main protagonist for much of the book, a newly released convict travel from Yankee Stadium (where he was imprisoned for speaking in anger) back to his home in New Loch to be with his wife and new born child. The government has released Priest because their latest policy decree is that the very act of human breathing is offensive to nature (because of the germs and virii killed in the process) and therefore everyone must die. Priest now has seven days to get home before the decreed day of death is final. In those seven days we explore this world and discover that it is a study of opposites, at once verdant and yet bereft life, and that Priest is at once both a hero for wanting to live and choosing life over a senseless death, and at the same time an ugly savage and anti-hero for his actions and behavior. With the sparing use of other characters such as Paul Xavier, the aged Catholic priest who befriends Priest on his trip home, Mano does an excellent job of showing us the logical result of the faux intellectualism and arrogance of the nannystate that a green/socialist government ultimately leads to; a society of death and nihilism, that values even microbial life more than human life, and in the end sows the seeds of it's own destruction."},{"Title":"The bridge","review":"Anyone who says this is not a good book, must not have read it. For it's time, the book was amazingly prescient about the \\"Green\\" movement, and proto-environmentalism of our time. He was from England, had no right or left wing ideas, and was just trying to write a good science fiction novel. Like George Orwell, with Big Brother watching you(like our video cameras in the streets, and drones watching you today from the skies,), and Jules Verne with his sub-marines, and aerial flight, Mano was right with his predictions. Today, people will insult or attack you if youre wearing animal fur, even if it is fake. Who gave them that right? And global warming, when most scientists now disclaim that theory? No, this was a work of science fiction, and a damn good one at that. Sorry if he was right on the money!!"},{"Title":"The bridge","review":"I say this book was far ahead of its time simply because there were many in the time period this was published (many among us today would agree) who thought this would be an ideal. A world where mankind has become an inoffensive,dwindling species that has been indoctrinated (and drugged) to believe themselves wrong to even exist. For those of us who grew into adulthood during the early years of the eco movement, this often seemed the inevitable goal of its founders and believers. I first read this as a teenager and it impressed me as much then as it does now.Its a world where balance is gone; certain species have run amok and almost everything is suffering from excess growth without checks. Humans are lethargic with the only ones with any sense of purpose are the Eco Guards who enforce the dictates of some unknown supreme Council. No competition of any sort, no talking, no noise at all, no killing of even insects never mind higher forms of life. Living on a diet of liquid protein that causes disforming of the bone structure, body cramps, and is not vented by the body as waste (pollution), humanity exists, not lives among the decaying works of man.It is a depressing book and though extreme in it's prophecy of the future, it touches on the nihilistic demands of the eco movement's hard line supporters. But having man revert to a much less intrusive species is NOT something that is undesirable to even many mainstream eco supporters. They just aren't aware of what that would actually mean to the world or humanity itself.Its a fast read and well worth the time invested in it. The hero is no well rounded superman but a less than likable man on a mission to see his family. His trip through a dying world is one that will keep your interest to the end."},{"Title":"The bridge","review":"These other reviews have to be jokes or written by the author.This book is PAINFUL to read.

He has chosen a highly ambitious and broadly conceived approach to a complex and intriguing subject, Shuangqing--the 18th century peasant woman poet whose existence is still being debated today. In recent years Shuangqing has emerged as the focus of attention in Ming-Qing women's studies, but so far Ropp's book is the first work (in any language) which demonstrates--through extensive field trips and years of research and reading--the abundance and complexity of the questions of Shuangqing as a cultural icon. The book manages to be specific and broad-ranging at the same time, providing valuable information not just on Shuangqing but also on Shi Zhenlin and his circle, the group of Qing literati responsible for the transmission (or possibly the creation) of the Shuangqing story. This is indeed a richly researched and elegantly written bookMost important, Ropp has written an engaging study of Shuangqing which demonstrates impressively what an innovative methodological approach could mean to the general public and the scholarly field. Instead of following the conventional way of academic writing by routinely presenting an analytical argument with a supply of copious notes, Ropp creates a lively narrative throughout the book which offers its readers an exemplary interplay of literary history and personal observation. He begins his narrative with his trip to Jintan and Danyang with Professors Du Fangqin and Zhang Hongsheng, two of China's leading scholars, in search of information about the vanished worlds of Shuangqing and Shi Zhenlin. In retelling and reconstructing the story, he has skillfully introduced the various themes running through the book, namely (1) his reading of Shuangqing's story in Shi Zhenlin's Random Notes; (2) the poetry and song lyrics of Shuangqing and their place in Chinese culture; (3) the evolution of Chinese opinion on Shuangqing and her poetry from the mid eighteenth century to the present, including debates over whether she really lived or was just the fictional creation of Shi Zhenlin. Parallel to Shi Zhenlin who prized the opinions of like-minded people, Professor Ropp also documented his discussions with many scholars and friends, so that his is an extremely interesting book with a fresh perspective. It tells the readers not only the result of his research but also the &quot;process&quot; of the long search for the &quot;mysterious&quot; Shuangqing. Needless to say, its implications are numerous and rich. I believe readers are bound to learn more about Chinese culture from this book than from a conventional academic book. For Ropp writes like a literary detective, and the book has a message about the joy of constant discovery. As he explains in the &quot;Preface,&quot; the most interesting part of this project has been the process of discovery along the way. From this book readers will learn how a scholar can study and examine the past of an alien culture, how one can use a book such as Shi Zhenlin's Random Notes as a window for learning about a significant aspect of traditional china, and how people (of all cultures) are inclined to mingle history, fiction, and legend in recreating our remembered past. Moreover, the fact that Professor Ropp has experienced firsthand the dust and dirt of farm work in his youth (in a small town of Illinois) certainly enriches his many close readings of poetry by Shuangqing, a peasant woman poet in 18th century China. Ropp's translations of Shuangqing's poems are generally accurate and elegant, and so far they represent the most comprehensive and meticulous treatment of this body of texts in English. Again, rather than providing a conventional book of translation with notes, Ropp has incorporated his many discussions of poems with informed people like Liu Laoshi of Taipei's Stanford Center and Zhengguo Kang of Yale University , thus creating an interesting account of the translation process which would make fascinating reading for general readers and scholars alike. Indeed, in terms of the study of Shuangqing's poetry, this book is hard to match. Truly this work by Professor Ropp will make a significant contribution to the fields of cultural and gender studies, China studies, anthropology, and even other branches in the social sciences. One of its strengths lies in its innovative methodological approach which I have already mentioned above. It is obvious that the author of this manuscript has read a vast quantity of materials in a wide variety of fields, and many of the primary texts he read in the original Chinese. In particular, this is the only book (in any language) which discusses in such depth the history of reception regarding the story of Shuangqing. There is no doubt that Professor Ropp's scholarship is both sound and solid. Moreover, he writes in an elegant and powerful style that holds the reader's attention to the subject amidst highly detailed descriptions and discussions."},{"Title":"Vintage","review":"I enjoyed this story.

I'm sorry, but I have to say it was quite a struggle to get through this, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'm just glad I only paid $3.00 for my copy and not the $12.95 retail price."},{"Title":"Gargoyle Tears","review":"My name is Jennifer LB Leese, and I am half of JV Harlee. After reading the review by Publishers Weekly, I felt appalled and displeased...I needed to comment.First, I am a reviewer and an author, and it is well known by reviewers of all kinds that picking apart books (one sentence, one misspelling--NOT plot problems or character discrepancies)in such a way is unprofessional and says a lot about the reviewer.Second, hackneyed prose and misspellings happen in &quot;big&quot; name author's books, as well. So, that wasn't a real biggie for me.What did bother me is that the reviewer clearly did NOT read &quot;Gargoyle Tears&quot; as there is no mention of an unborn sister anywhere in the book. Heck, there is no mention of Ethan having a sister or that the gargoyles are awaiting the arrival of someone unborn...period.If the reviewer HAD read &quot;Gargoyle Tears&quot; fully, instead of looking for mistakes alone, they would have found out who the &quot;savior&quot; is in the book by reading to the end.Things are now straight, and you can't please everyone. Thanks for listening."},{"Title":"Yamaha XV (Virago) V-Twins 1981-2003 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"I agree with the others that say the book is a little confusing. The layout could have been a lot better. For example, The explanations in the book are basically split by 1000 and 1100 being B and lower cc's being A. That being said, they contradict this entire setup and throw people off subject when the book says \\"see appendix A\\" or \\"same as A\\" in the middle of explaining how an 1100cc engine or carb works. I hate it when a book does that(Ex: Page 103 of a book says refer back to page 76 for instruction). Why not just put it right there or even make two books. In addition, I would like to say there are lots of pictures, two of which being for the exact model you will be looking for. All together the book is good for a beginner, but there will be lots of times you still have to search for information/pictures. On the other hand if you have a Virago that is smaller than a 1000cc model then by all means buy it. Especially if it is a 535. This is because that is appendix A, which is explained in great detail and no references to B. I hope this helps with future buyers."},{"Title":"Yamaha XV (Virago) V-Twins 1981-2003 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"A good resource well illustrated but at times confusing due to the number of models it includes.

It's a fascinating look at Hollywood history. Check out the 7 page bibliography; this is not just an address list, the author has done his homework. Looking for someone or something in particular, or to create your own tour; there's an incredibly detailed 17 page index! Every stop on each tour is documented with an easy to read, sometimes lengthy STORY. It's the Britannica of Hollywood tour books. I did much of the &quot;Old Hollywoodland&quot; Tour - once I got my bearings at Hollywood Memorial Park, I was OK. I loved Whitley Heights. Forget about finding anything in the canyons without these directions; though the author doesn't mention the need to stand on the trunk of your car to be able to see into Falcon's Lair! BTW, not every site is gruesome...Timothy Leary's last launching pad is on the Benedict Canyon tour! The book is not cheap; but it's a great read whether you're driving or not."},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"Several years ago an L.A. cemetery worker told me that a Chicago area resident was researching a book about Hollywood cemeteries and death sites. I am assuming this is it. This is a chatty gem of a tour book that examines some uncoventional tourist attractions ----- predominantly suicide, death and scandal sites ----- and is loaded with information. Having done my own bizarre self-designed tours in L.A., I wish I had this book in the past as I would have saved myself much time and trouble. The narrative was informative and well-written and provided a lot of facts, along with some excellent (and fairly current) pictures. For the most part the information was accurate, but I did identify some questionable facts mostly involving dates. My immediate impression was that this book probably should have been proofed better before it went to print, but it is quite apparent that the author really does know his/her subject matter and did a fairly thorough job researching the subject matter. Is it worth the $35 price tag.......definitely! It provided me with a full day's worth of enjoyment and was a lot cheaper and more fun than a trip to Disneyland. Will I use it again? Absolutely........I have only done a couple of the tours so far!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"I have family that lives in the L.A. area and when I visit them, they know we will do a &quot;Death Tour&quot;. They teased me at first and then when we started seeing the sites, they stopped!! Now they look forward to the next tour that we will take. This book is an interesting compilation of not only where events have taken place, but also the history behind them. Although, the title can seem a bit ominous, there are a lot of other sites to see in the book besides &quot;DEATH&quot; (stars homes, arrest locations, homes used for TV shows, etc.). So, as for the previous review about this being too morbid, I completely disagree. Besides, death is after all a part of life. Enjoy...I certainly have!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"Wow, This was not a book I purchased. It was given to me for my birthday. I thought, wow, another EJ Fleming Tome. Great. Well, this was a shocker.

He is the most incredible writer of our time!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"I love visiting celebrity graves and infamous locations so this book was perfect for me. I even learned about a few scandals I had never heard about before. Mr. Fleming provides good directions and helpful tips so you won't miss a thing. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Hollywood scandals."},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"This unusual guidebook is structured as a series of sixteen tours to scandalous sites around the Los Angeles area., from Hollywood (central, Western, and more) to Beverly Hills to the outer boroughs. Why are we so fascinated with sites of death and scandal? Who knows?!? We are, though, and we might as well own up to it. Nothing sells better than the true-life stories of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll (or sex, drugs, and Hollywood's big screen, in this case).This is billed as a guidebook, but, as a Los Angeles resident, I found it more fascinating from an armchair perspective than as a step-by-step trip guide. I have no desire to go on any of these sixteen tours, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the scandalous sites around the Los Angeles area. Much of the text focuses on pre-1930's and lesser-known film stars, so few people are likely to obsessively follow any given tour as a tribute to a fallen movie star. Anyone familiar with the Los Angeles area will enjoy this book and glean ideas for \\"Oh, do you know what happened here??\\" during the course of the text. If you are an L.A. resident and ant to impress your friends and visitors, look no further.The text is a guidebook on the surface, but beneath the exterior, it is truly a guide to every major Hollywood scandal. I don't plan on using it as a driving tour; rather, it has furthered my education about the region. On the other hand, the comprehensive index will allow any fan of specific stars to locate the site of related scandals."},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"Here's is a copy of an e-mail that I sent to Mr. E. J. Fleming, the person who foisted this terrible book on the American public while charging them 25 bucks apiece for it.Dear Mr. Fleming,I am writing to you concerning one of the most egregious instances of bad reporting that I have ever witnessed in my entire lifetime of buying and reading non-fiction books about Hollywood actors and films. Your book \\"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites\\" is what I'm talking about here. I will give you very specific examples of what I mean by \`bad reporting.' I could also say that it just lack of any kind of research at all on your part, since the facts in your book could be confirmed or rejected by just a little bit of research.On page 56, \\"Tour 4: The Sunset Strip\\" in a section about John Belushi, you write (and I quote verbatim): \`...Belushi...was able to turn his popularity into roles in movies such as \\"Animal House\\" (1979), \\"Blues Brothers\\" (1981) and \\"Neighbors\\" (1977).' (Unquote)Not one of those movies was released in the year you specified and you incorrectly titled one of the films (it's 'THE Blues Brothers'). Here are the facts about those films and their release years: \\"Animal House\\" (1978), \\"The Blues Brothers\\" (1980) and \\"Neighbors\\" (1981).On that same page, you write these ignorant words about actor Sal Mineo (again, I quote verbatim from your book):\`...Sal Mineo starred in \\"The Rose Tattoo\\" (1951) [and] \\"West Side Story\\" (1952)' (Unquote)Mr. Fleming, I don't even know what to think of a film reference book that makes these kind of terribly obvious errors concerning the subjects of their expertise. It's shocking, actually. Did you know that \\"The Rose Tattoo\\" starred Burt Lancaster and was released in 1955? Did you also know that Sal Mineo was nowhere near \\"West Side Story\\" (that means he wasn't in the movie; I think that you're mistaking him for Richard Beymer, sadly) and that film was released in 1961, was actually the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1961, which any self-proclaiming film fan, like yourself, should know. Later in the same article about Sal Mineo, you write (again, quoting verbatim): \`Mineo's...career was on the skids and he was relegated to roles like a nameless monkey in 1972's \`Planet of the Apes\\"' (Unquote)Wow. As anybody who knows ANYTHING about film in the latter part of the 20th century knows, \\"Planet of the Apes\\" was released in 1968 and Sal Mineo wasn't in that film. He was, however, in the second sequel to that film, which was released in 1971 and was called \\"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\\" and he played a character with a name; it was Milo. Crazy how many inaccuracies you can fit into one small paragraph. I'm astounded.This is as far as I got with your book. My jaw was hanging slack with incredulity at the lameness of your pathetically researched book. I felt sick that I had actually spent money on it, MY hard-earned money. Listen, I had already found other inaccuracies with release years in your book before I got to page 56 but the ineptitude of that page, THAT was the breaking point for me. I threw it down on the ground in disgust and went no further. Your book is no doubt riddled with false information and sloppy research. God knows if your addresses are incorrect or if you got other facts wrong; I'm sure that you did. You give books like this a really bad name. I'd like a refund. Quickly, please.Yes, I hated it. I expect a refund soon."},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"I was pleasantly surprised about how much I liked this book. Even if you never plan on going on any of these tours, it's fun to read the stories about the stars and their lives and there are pictures of some of the houses. It would have been even better if it had pictures of all the houses mentioned in the book but I suppose that's unrealistic. I found only a few typos and inaccuracies but overall it is well-written and if you like to read about the stars from the Golden Age, you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites: Sixteen Driving Tours with Directions and the Full Story, from Tallulah Bankhead to River Phoenix","review":"The title of the book \\"Hollywood death and scandal sites\\" is misnomer in that the book is mainly devoted to guide the visitors of Hollywood, California to many celebrity places; where Hollywood celebrities lived, worked and naturally died, including many movie locations, but not necessarily focused on sites of death and scandals. Even though the market has countless tour guides and maps, this book describes the celebrity homes/places of interest, with a brief history, in Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Hollywood, and other regions of greater Los Angeles. In many cases photographs are provided that is helpful in identifying the house. Each driving trip covers an area and all the places of interest on the route are described with a little bit of history. You need to have a GPS system as you navigate through the residential streets of Beverly Hills and Bel Air. This is certainly a useful book and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it but it also borrows info from books that are already published. Stories about Jean Harlow and the death/murder of her husband Paul Bern is borrowed from Marx book (Ref 1); the info about the celebrities who stayed at Beverly Hills Hotel is borrowed from Stewart and Prince Book (Ref 2). A lot of stories about haunting in Hollywood are well documented in many websites and blogs. In this regard I recommend seeing-stars.com website, which is very informative.There are many interesting places and the ones I liked are as follows; the deaths and suicides in Knickerbocker hotel in Hollywood (page 18); the houses of scary film actor Bela Lugosi and his suspected haunting (page 19); Cary Grant - Randall Scott love nest (page 24); Double Indemnity movie site (page 30); the home of actress Tallulah Bankhead where numerous sex and drug abuse occurred (page 40); 1920/1930s actor Ramon Navarro's murder site (page 49); home of Humphrey Bogart and Mayo Methot and the story of their stormy marriage (page 58); actor Spencer Tracy's last home where he died (page 60); actress Rebecca Schaeffer murder site (page 62); Dixie Crater and Hal Holbrook robbery site (page 70); actress Lupe Velez and Gary Cooper love nest (page 76) and her suicide site (page 129); Bette Davis and Howard Hughes love nest (page 88); the last home of actress Marion Davies and Randolph Hearst (page 90); Clifton Webb haunted home (page 93); brief history of Beverly Hills hotel and its famous guests (page 95); Pickfair home where Mary Pickford passed away (page 103); brief history of the home where Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Danny Kaye lived (page 104); Marie Dressler's home (page 126); the last home Leslie Howard (page 132); Great Garbo hideaway (page 133); Lionel Barrymore haunted home (page 136); Marlene Dietrich home (page 137); Clark Gable accident site and Joan Crawford's Mommy Dearest home (Page178-179); Douglas Fairbanks Sr., death site (page 195); Peter Lawford's Kennedy-Monroe love nest (page 196); Margaux Hemingway's suicide site (page 198); Marlene Dietrich and Mercedes Acosta love-nest (page 199); Ann Sheridan death site (page 217); Lee Cobb death site (page 221); actress Barbara LaMarr death site and her alleged drug abuse (page 247); singer Del Shannon suicide site (page 249); Snoop Doggy Dogg shooting site (page 250); and the home of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle (page 250).

Published back in the early 1960s it suffers from a limited perspective of the Rev War. If the reader is expecting a detailed reference of historical sites in NJ pertaining to the Rev War then he will doubtless be disappointed here. The author provides four rather dry chapters on the Rev War and how it occured in NJ. Much of this information is available in most general histories of the conflict that have been published since this work first came out. There is nothing much new here that stands out. Even as a work of local history this book falls short. The maps are basic and infrequent.For its length of 100 odd pages the reader will find a very general history of the conflict. Useful perhaps to the basic reader who has little or no prior knowledge of subject. The short length of the narrative will doubtless appeal to high school students required to do some reading on the Rev War. If one is searching for a ready reference on historical locales in NJ that are still accessible today this book falls completely short. If you want a quick, basic read on the Rev War with a few references to NJ thrown in perhaps this is for you. Not recommended overall and overpriced for what you get!"},{"Title":"Three O'Clock Dinner","review":"Have not read it tho'heard Dr.Walter Edgar speak very highly of it so have sent it to my brother in the UK for him to read prior to visiting Charleston with us in The Fall"},{"Title":"Three O'Clock Dinner","review":"This was a book that came from my mom's library.

Based on reading this book I would not read another of this author's stories."},{"Title":"Everstone: Blood Legacy D20 Core Role-Playing Game","review":"The thing that must be commended first off, is that Everstone: Blood Legacy is the work of one person and one illustrator. This is not a corporate product, but the private endeavor of two guys! Unbelievable.The book itself is about as thick as the Forgotten Realms Campaign book. The art inside is uniformly black and white, and while none of it is excellent (or even solidly good) none of it is as bad as the kind of stinker art you sometimes get. The biggest complaint is the women, who are uniformly represented without a shred of respect, as a bunch of big breasted teen-hottie bimbos in armor bikinis *sigh*. The high point is the technology, which looks quite slick even in black and white.Plot synopsis: Mysteriously, over 300 years ago enormous civilization ending monsters, called Hollow Lords, appeared suddenly one night and ended the world in a Night of Terror. Massive, iconic creatures, the Hollow Lords are the apex of entire races of lesser monsters spawned in their image. The races of Lannith petitioned the gods for aid, and the gods as a whole, for no known reason, suddenly turned their backs on all of their servants. Desparately the kingdoms sought to flee before one at a time they became extinct. Fortunately the Hollow Lords were more interested in doing battle with each other than with the mortals of Lannith, and so those races which hid themselves in remote enough locations, were passed over.After hundreds of years hidden in mountain ruins, a group of survivors--Magi from Everstone--learned through their spy networks that one of the Hollow Lords and all of its progeny, had been brought down in battle. Encouraged they emmerged wielding a rune technology learned from the inhabitants of the ruined civilization (a gnomelike race called the Gavown) and an army to wield it. They managed to push out the Hollow Lords, and establish a niche for themselves on the surface world.Following their victory, the Everstonians began to search out any other factions that may have stayed alive, trying to build a powerful enough alliance to resist their Hollow Lord foes. They found the Ka'taan, a nomadic race of feline beastmen; the O'grom, a ponderous race of emmaciated elementalists thought related to ogres; the Fey, a race composed of the dreams of other races and divided into the Sylphs who are the masculine ideals of nobility and honor, and the feminine Nymphs who are the embodiment of whimsy, humor, capriciousness and...lust. These they added to the three races of their kingdom, Everstonians (humans), Gavown (the aforementioned gnomish types) and Golems (intelligent runecrafted constructs animated with the thought matrix of their creator, but then evolving beyond it). The gods have even thrown in their weight again behind the fledgling nation, no explaination given for their long hiatus however--causing them to be mistrusted by many.The magic system is interesting. Magical abilities are bought alongside mundane special abilities per class. Everyone has magic in one form or another. Characters each have a pool of Energy Points which fuel the spells. Every time a character levels up they get a pool of Character Points with which to buy racial or class special abilities and thus customize their character. Characters can even learn the magical abilities of other classes, or even of the gods, through study and periodic Spellcraft rolls.The book is divided into roughly four sections:First is the historical section (42 pages) then the character creation section (87 pages) a section mostly devoted to rune technology and vehicles, but also the special combat rules (63 pages) and an atlas section of background description covering the Everstone Valley and its dangers (41 pages). Intersperced between these are inserts of short fiction (which I found to be somewhat amateurishly written and hard to get through) and sidebar descriptions of the various creature of the Everstone universe (which I thought were immensely helpful and creative, though hard to get to, since they're scattered throughout the book rather than in their own section.)On the whole I found it a great first effort, and unimaginably good to be the product of just one person's imagination. The ideas are really evokative and interesting, and the setting is definitely worth getting excited about. Downsides are that the writing is uneven and unpolished, the art is fair but never great, and the setting is somewhat scattershot: a little of this, a little over here, but never fully detailed.A fully original and unprecidented setting it isn't. All of it's ideas have their roots elsewhere, from its rune-magic, skyships, and dream-dwelling fae to it's Earthdawn reminiscent post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. It is however very compelling and offers some intriguing new combinations and possibilities for the ideas it provides, and is certainly worth trying out."},{"Title":"Everstone: Blood Legacy D20 Core Role-Playing Game","review":"I consider Everstone to quite possibly be the best version of the 3.5 rules I have ever encountered.

There are passages and dialogue that are a bit rough in places, but all in all, this is a great self-contained RPG that's very much worth picking up."},{"Title":"Toponymy","review":"I have not read this book cover to cover. I consider it a reference work into which for knowledge I dip from time to time. Its treatment of its topic is broad-ranging and seemingly encyclopedic. The author, an Israeli geographer, has written very thoughtful essays on all manner of topics related to the naming of places: legal aspects, language issues, cultural and political conflict, to the humor found in place names are just a few of these. A very valuable compendium of the history and lore of toponyms (place names)."},{"Title":"Military Mountaineering ..training for Combat","review":"This is a training manual prepared by the United States Army in 1976.

There is a big section on emergency evacuations and rescue litters. The avalanche section is very well done, has sections on prediction, rescue and more. The book has 139 pages, and is full of illustrations and photos.

They are interesting as an exercise - especially to observe one's response to texts out of their context. However, rarely do they work as literature in their own right - at least in the sense of being of interest in 500 years. When they work, I still consider them emphemeral.99: The New Meaning is not an exception. The provision of the number of words in each extract appears to add no value other than insuring the reader correctly identify when the extracted text begins. In this particular case, I found myself uncomfortable with the European-centric text; in some manner, it caused me to read the text as an &quot;inside literati&quot; text.In short, the text is worth reading as experimental text but not particularly a original experiment."},{"Title":"Adam and Eve","review":"Just a brief note because this book... as with all great erotic novels ... is out of stock waiting for re-print.This is a story about Adama an up & coming painter trying to find a sponsor, and Eve an aspiting acterss, as well looking for her big break ...

It was recommended to me by someone who already programs with Smalltalk. I found that this book was very good the second time through. After reading this book the first time, a lot of the concepts seemed a little fuzzy. After reading it the second time, I then had a better grasp on the language and was able to program most of the examples given in the book without too much difficulty. Knowing now the contents and organization of this book, it is now one of MY recommended reference and learning books."},{"Title":"IBM Smalltalk: The Language (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"This book is great as a reference for the class library.

Mikami's Sumi Painting: Study of Japanese Brush Painting","review":"This is an absolutely fabulous introduction to sumi painting. It is basic, it is simple, it describes the materials you will need, and gives you techniques that you can practice forever as they are fundamental... and key to your ability. Furthermore, this text gives the beginner a real sense of accomplishment early-on with its diagramed paintings you can attempt yourself. Mikami-sama has done a fabulous job with this book. I would easily recomend it to anyone interested in getting started with brush painting!"},{"Title":"On the Irrawaddy: A story of the first Burmese war","review":"A ripping yarn from the early days of Empire, told from much nearer the time and informed by the values and ambitions of a different age; an age when a young man would expect to hazard his life in deadly climates, and hand to hand battles in order to establish his place in business. If you've been sent on a team or character building course, read this and cry. A long forgotten trade and long forgotten war are the dramatic backdrops, and it makes one yearn for the days when the whole world was a frontier filled with opportunities and the only stake you need place on the table is your life."},{"Title":"Inner Peace, Volume 3","review":"the evil has given in. its time to correct the wrong doings of sin. email me back when you can my friend : ) i love you always"},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"Although this is a great book for any art lover it is a must for the plein air (outdoor) painter. It demonstrates how Cezanne transformed his \\"motif\\", the scene he has selected, into a painting by showing photos of the motif side by side with his paintings. Machotka, an artist himself, discusses the artistic problems presented by each scene and Cezanne's various solutions as they vary over his development as an artist. Machotka is knowledgeable, thoughtful and writes well. This book will certainly extend your appreciation of Cezanne and if you paint plein air, will likely make you a much more observant and better painter. As a painter this is one of the few books on composition and technique that I recommend to other painters."},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read and had. Machotka details Cezanne in a great way. I was never a great fan of Cezanne before purchasing this book, now I'm a devoted fan! Cezanne would be proud to have someone like Machotka writing about his work."},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"Cezanne's influence on Cubism and later abstract styles can make the viewer forget just how important looking at his native landscape was to the painter.

A book to return to again and again."},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"I teach a university level plein air painting course in Michigan. This book will be helpful for students to see how Cezanne interpreted and why he chose particular landscape subjects."},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"Machotka's \\"Cezanne: Landscape into Art\\" is now a classic study of the rich ways in which nature impacted the mind and artistic transmission of the acknowledged \\"father of Modern Art.\\" This study which provided documentary evidence in the form of color photographs taken in precisely the same location used by Cezanne in painting his iconic works reminds the reader that modern art did not divorce itself from nature as many thinkers have claimed. In fact the evidence that modern art remains indebted to its father and his love of nature becomes abundantly evident in Machotka's seminal work. Every Post-Post Modernist is well advised to rethink arts relationship to nature; it is as unavoidable as ones own body and its natural reality. Landscape into art is the evidence that art itself cannot long subsist without a strong tie to its natural origins. Any renewal of art begins at its origins in the natural realm and at the side of its father Cezanne. William J. Havlicek PhD."},{"Title":"Cezanne: Landscape into Art","review":"Excellent presentation and exploration of the interpretation of Cezanne's landscapes, sites.

After scanning through a copy owned by a local artist, I spent hours and gas driving to used book stores in Berkeley and San Francisco since it is no longer published, and finally purchased it on-line. The text is wonderful, describing Cezanne's techniques. Love seeing the photographs next to Cezanne's painting of it to compare how he translated what he was seeing."},{"Title":"How Al-Anon Works for Families & Friends of Alcoholics","review":"for those of us who have a drinking or sober alcoholic in our past or present (and god, don't most of us!), this book can help. it's beautifully yet simply written and gently lays out a new philosophy for life, one in which we can learn to keep the focus on ourselves and our behavior, be honest but in an appropriate way, and be kind but firm - with boundaries. this book offered me a whole new idea of what love and life are and can be, and encouraged me to walk forward in a healthy direction like few books have.another strong plus is that it offers many personal stories - of how and why a wide range of people got into al-anon and how their recovery has been progressing, and each told by the individuals themselves, starting with Lois W., al-anon's co-founder, the wife of Bill W., the founder of AA.this is a wonderful book and i recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"How Al-Anon Works for Families & Friends of Alcoholics","review":"This book is a wonderful basic text on the principles of the Alanon program, a program of recovery for anyone who has an addict in their lives.

Reread is too strong - because the first time I skimmed it - the first 2 chapters. Then I came back to it and saw on pages 32 and 33 - how I was UNABLE to control alcoholism. How I was UNABLE to fix the disease in my wife. It said, I wasn't to blame. It said, stop fighting and arguing, you (I) was only making the the DISEASE stronger (more arrogant, more coniving, more deceitful).I used several quotes in my blog.

Your word ring true even after several years of the Clinton regime. You call it like it is even though your Libertarian bias is somtimes too much..."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I moved to Atlanta somewhat a &quot;Liberal&quot;. I was introduced to Boortz by a couple of locals I was sharing an office with. I have sense become a Libertarian with a whole new look on politics. The book really did not provide me any real eye openers as I listen to Boortz almost daily and have heard most of the book(in bits and pieces) from the radio. I am glad to see that Neal Boortz really sticks to what he writes and says. Wake up people the time for change is now. Read the book and think a little."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals, by Neal Boortz, serves as anyone's pocket reference to the worst liberals have to offer. The 160 pages go fast, making it convenient to read on an airplane trip or during your lunch break. This book was built to hit you hard with the issues, leaving the fluff for other titles.The book's beauty begins even before the first chapter. Turn the first few pages and we are presented with a note that claims &quot;There will be no attempt whatsoever in The Terrible Truth About Liberals at political correctness&quot;. Buckle your seatbelts.The book opens with a quick analysis of the differences between conservatives and our warm-blooded liberal friends. Neal hits on a liberal's reliance on emotion instead of logic, their destruction of the individual in favor of &quot;groups&quot;, their dependence on the government and their never-ending determination for control.The book continues with how universities are destroying young minds, and details a 13 point list of what many college students actually learn. Neal then provides text of a fictional Commencement Speech that he would read in the event he is asked to speak at one (although he is not holding his breath). Do not read this portion of the book with a cup of coffee in your hands, because you might spill it while laughing. Much of it is funny, but it is also sad, and true.The next portion of the book is devoted to money, including taxes (and who really pays them) and social security (job security for liberals). Neal presents a delightful portrayal of wit throughout these chapters. There is a good chance that you will leave them angry. You may be surprised about where your money is being spent by our government.Neal then documents what a liberal often turns to when presented with clear and convincing facts: the race card, or what he calls the &quot;R&quot; word. After reading his documentation, you may find yourself paying closer attention to how liberals solve their desperation when debating.The Terrible Truth About Liberals is chalked full of rage provoking analysis and observations other authors won't dare talk about. It is a quick read, but does not skimp on the details. This is a great read for the summer.Neal Boortz has been a talk show host in Atlanta, Georgia since the late 60's. He is nationally syndicated on 'finer' radio stations throughout the country."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This is a great book that unapologetically says what needs to be said. It's a dose of tough love for the left. That said, I would like to respond to reviewer M.J. Nojonen who has put forth another leftist misinterpretation of this REPUBLIC's founding documents.Contrary to what left wants people to believe, \\"promoting\\" the general welfare is NOT the same as \\"providing\\" it. A quick check of the dictionary will show that there is a clear difference between encouraging a service and supplying it. Every word of the founding documents was carefully and deliberately chosen and the use of the word \\"promote\\" was no exception.So Neal is absolutely correct about the fact that our government was NEVER intended to provide social services such as education, healthcare, etc. The left's inability to understand why is due to an ignorance to the true meaning of the American Revolution.Fortunately there is a cure for this type of ignorance, but only for those who are brave enough to confront reality and be honest with themselves. A careful reading of the book \\"DISCOVERY OF FREEDOM\\" by Rose Wilder Lane will provide a thorough understanding of the meaning of the American Revolution in the context of human history.\\"DISCOVERY OF FREEDOM\\" is a very important, must read, that contains knowledge that few born into this world have had the good fortune to possess. Read it and you to shall become one of the few. Share it with others so the few can become the many.It's baffling why leftists who are so sanctimoniously concerned about corporate monopolies welcome government monopolies as if they are somehow more altruistic or divine in nature. The left's contentment with receiving services from government monopolies is quite hypocritical, not to mention illogical. Monopolies produce low quality results at high prices and this is true whether the monopoly is a corporate or government entity.Ever wonder why progress and technology has advanced further in the last 200 years than in all of the previous 5,000 years combined? It's generally because the first Americans broke free from the Old World (collectivist) ways of allowing some government entity to be their Nanny. The left wants to take us back to those dark ages, but true Americans (rugged individualists) have no need for a Nanny thank you."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I found this book both entertaining and RIGHT ON! Boortz has eloquently stated what I have known for years, and presents arguments better than I have ever been able to do. The fact that he uses humor throughout the book in no way takes away from what he says.The Ted Kennedy Liberals of today are a far cry from the classic JFK liberals of yesteryear. They have in fact moved so far away from classic liberal thinking that they are destroying this nation with their leftist facist ideology: rather than defend true freedom of speech, they want to control people's thoughts and actions; they trod over our Constitutional Rights even as they claim to be defending those rights; and many of them honestly can't see this for themselves!I recommend that EVERYONE - of no matter what political persuasion - read this truly important book. Rather than being simply another &quot;political book&quot;, to me it ranks as a grand Philosophical work on the par of many of the great political philosophers throughout history, and I hope its' small size will not deter people from reading it. In fact, although I wish it had been longer, Boortz's concise work says a lot about today's misguided liberalism, and can easily be read in one sitting, not just because of its' size, but also because of how it flows and grabs the readers' attention."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I must say, his goal is to enrage the Loony Liberals who read it, and he does a fine job. The problem with Liberals, as Boortz states it, is that they believe that all groups are entitled to the same thing. The truth of the matter is, as a member of a group you are not entitled to anything. If you get it, it is not because of your group, it is because you earned it. And that is exactly what he talks about. Neal hits on another point in his show and his book: Liberals, if you are intelligent enough to read their campaign platforms, are really Economic Fascists...that's ALL THEY ARE. They don't sound quite as nice sounding people, when they're called that, are they?My only complaint, it needs to be longer, either that or Neal needs to write another."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Boortz nails it! As our country moves from the principles of rugged individualism to the unconstitutional practice of seizing our property under threat of force, Boortz's book is the bellwether screaming for our attention. Read this book America...be inspired, flush the liberal slurry from your brain and let's all move forward as one powerful force to take back our country!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this and in such a small volume ....learned more than I expected. Small warning to liberals, if you read it with an open mind you may find the logic inescapable. The information, stories, and history in here make it a must read for anyone who wants a direct no frills overview of the real agenda in politics today. One quote will stick with me always because for all the truth in it, it was written before the Constitution about the danger of the rule of man over the rule of law...aka, democracy. We are supposed to be country ruled by law...not the mob. I loved the example of the three wolves and the sheep picking the menu. It better not be majority rule...LOL. The truth that the majority will figure out they can take from the minority is so very prophetic. It is hard to believe it was said over two hundred years ago. Listen to any election and the liberals are freely talking about stealing from one group and giving to another to buy their votes. So when I read that quote, I could not believe the man was not writing it today. The rich mixture of logic, common sense, and history have made this one of my favorite reads this year and I plan to give one to all my friends and family for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Like his radio show, and daily web site (www.boortz.com), Neal nails the truth down that the Liberals hate you to hear.Among the things he explains, is why there is such a disproportionant majority of Liberal teachers in our Colleges and Universities. He points to the 60's and the Draft Deferrments for college students that kept their grades up during the VietNam War.By taking the non science courses that were easier, students could keep their grades high and maintain their deferrments. When they got their BA's, and the war was still going, they went on to get their MA's and PHD's-remaining in college as long as possible, until the war ended. Once it was over, there were few jobs available for their Liberal Arts degrees in the 'real world', and the only place open to them was academia as teachers.I saw this happen with people I knew. One said to me &quot;all my life I've fought the establishment, without much success, but now I'm teaching, and I've got their kids, and their minds are mine&quot;!His parents had the money to send him to Hofstra (doctors son) where he majored in Political Science. Mine didn't have the bucks and I got my draft notice. I enlisted instead for four years in the Navy. The GI Bill paid for my BS which did have a diverse job market in the real world.Boortz pulls no punches, and his background as a lawyer, adds to his insight and Libertarian approach.He teaches how Liberals identify everyone by their 'group membership' and avoid individualism. They talk in terms like the poor 'unfortunates' of society, as opposed to those 'more fortunate' Fortune is defined as an unexpected windfall. This ignores the hard work and sweat of those that make good choices in life. Liberals suggest that those that are 'fortunate' got it by cheating and stealing it from those that are 'less fortunate'.Neal says most of those that don't make it are victims of themselves, poor life choices, not paying attention-doing homework in school, using drugs, getting pregnant underage.Later on in life, they wind up looking for Gov't handouts in the form of entitlement programs which are Socialistic redistributation of wealth, by taking the earners tax dollars and giving it to the ne'er do wells to buy votes.His other book- &quot;The Commencement Speech You Need to Hear&quot; is good too."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"In &quot;The Terrible Truth about Liberals&quot;, Neal Boortz uses his direct, Libertarian style honesty to spell out the primary differences between liberals and conservatives. He exposes many liberal myths, several of which will surprise the average reader at first. But, in the end, the entire book makes more sense than many people will want to admit.Boortz attacks the liberal thought process head-on. He shows how the liberal thinks with emotions rather than sound logic, how the liberal often cannot defend his positions, and how liberals will resort to deception, if necessary, to promote their agenda.This book is a quick, easy read that will thrill conservatives while driving our left- leaning friends crazy with its blunt honesty. As you read this book, don't be surprised if you find yourself continuously nodding your head in agreement.And don't forget: VOTE LIBERTARIAN!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"An easy to read, short series of essays which point out the rights and wrongs of political ideas as has not been done since we listened to our great grand parents, if you had the chance to hear them. For a country which has lost it's moral roots and basic understanding of American political philosophy, Neal Boortz gives his audience a taste of these ideas and why so much of the past 70 years of liberalism has chipped away from the power of the individual and how that will cause decay in our country. A must read, especially for anyone who feels that they need a basic understanding of political issues. This book will give the reader a foundation from which to understand most political issues."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This book is a classic. In his typical &quot;in-your-face&quot; style, Neal Boortz throws down the gloves and tells it like it is. After breathing the rotten stench of &quot;political correctness&quot; forced upon us by the liberal mainstream media, this book is a breath of fresh air. Neal exposes the ridiculous ideology of the malignant liberal menace that is wrecking our society. Keep up the good work Neal!!!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This book should be required reading for all humans, especially &quot;Liberals&quot;. Enlightening. Some of the more vitriolic reviewers have quite obviously not read the book. To them: Buy it. Read it. Then we can talk. Great work, Neal Boortz!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"A short, quick read that clearly explains the mindset of both parties and what a Libertarian is. He is one of the most intelligent talk show hosts ever and the only wish is that this book were longer.If he rubs you the wrong way, change your diapers. This book is clear and to the point."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"A great, if acidic, book giving a point by point explanation about the flaws of liberals. This book identifies everything that disgust a logical person about liberals and, in part, thier political counterparts the Democratic Party."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Folks, this is truely a great read, and a no holds barred, unapologetic look at the hypocracy of the far left in this country. I only give it four stars because I believe Boortz wrote this book in such a way as to put any liberal readers on the defensive by not also pointing out the hypocracy of the far right. I understand the book was intended to focus on liberalism, but I wish Boortz had taken the opportunity in this book to educate people that there are more than two choices in the political spectrum, and could well have won far more converts to the Libertarian perspective if approached somewhat differently. Nonetheless, this is an excellent and entertaining read.S. Brown from Alpharetta; I feel sorry for you, and I'd like out of your so-called \\"social contract\\". I prefer contracts where all parties contribute something beneficial."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Neal Boortz says and writes what Americans who love their country are thinking. This book is outstanding, and very easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a comedic look at the real liberal thought."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This was a very simply written book which spells out in plain English the &quot;Terrible Truth About Liberals&quot;. If you are an achiever and like to think for yourself and are sick of society leaching off you, this book is for you! If you listen to Neil's radio show, you've probably heard a lot of the things that are in this book. I would recommend this book as a graduation present to anyone graduating from college!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"As the self-proclaimed king of insensitivity so bluntly states on his highly rated Atlanta-based radio show, &quot;Welcome to the House of the Painful Truth.&quot; In this brief, yet concise, treatise, Boortz reveals how he really feels(as if he ever hides his disdain) about the liberals of America. Boortz lays out, interspersed with humor, a concise and structured argument debunking the emotion-based logic(or lack thereof) of the brainless liberal populace. Boortz tells how he made the transition from a delivery man doing heavy lifting to doing talk radio in Atlanta after a DJ killed himself and a position became conspicuously vacant. At the interview, Boortz, in his trademark sarcastic style, promised to give a 2 weeks notice before offing himself.Speaking of liberals, Boortz correctly states, &quot;They want limited government about as much as you and I would like to have a root canal.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"A very short, concise, and straight forward book. A small book with a lot of informative thinking.I plan to refer this book to my friends. Hopefully my liberal grand child will read it, also."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Boortz gives common sense explainations of what he calls liberalism and equally common sense examples of why it's all so absurd.Don't worry it's not too long and drawn out. (look at the book dimensions) But that's all it takes for Boortz to get his point across. This book is greatly entertaining even if you're not interested in politics. Boortz wouldn't have survived so long as a political commentator if he wasn't also a great entertainer. And he proves it in this book."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"The net result of reading Neal Boortz should be an abiding renewal of sanity. Liberals who stumble across Neal find themselves wretchedly still clothed in ideological leisure suits. Sure, they sort of looked okay at the time but you sure hope no one has a photo of you wearing one.In &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; by Jerry Furland, the bad guys are in fact the Republicans AND the Democrats. Guess Furland might well be a closet Libertarian. Whatever he is, like Boortz, he is indispensable. These guys and a few other stalwarts just might eventually do some good. Recommend both these of authors-pass them around, quote them-whatever. America is more than the sum of it's two dominant parties. Much more."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I find it amazing how those who disagree with Boortz have used insults to make their case. Having listened to him for years when living in Atlanta, and now over the internet, I have found him to be speaking the truth far too much lately. He hits the nail on the head when dealing with the liberal mindset. It should be required reading in any civics class, but sadly, it won't be. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Neal Boortz has hit the nail on the head in his book The Terrible Truth About Liberals.

He shows how the liberal mind works (..or doesn't work..), but most of all he makes you think. I highly recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves &quot;politically homeless&quot;. It is a quick read, and brings up the real issues in our society today. Boortz's analogies on &quot;Ground Rush&quot; and &quot;48 seconds&quot; hits hard. (really hard!!) WARNING: if you are a liberal, you will be offended and insulted by this book (but read it anyway)!!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Short and to the point. Boortz as usual has pragmatic, common sense ideas and tells it like it is. He hits the nail on the head as far as the connection between liberals basing their ideas on feelings and emotions rather than stats and logic. Not to say there isn't a segment of conservatives that are exactly like this also, however liberals are more likely to display this. Hardcore liberals and leftists (as opposed to moderate ones) will probably not enjoy this book because of its truthful stance on the need to be an individual rather than be associated with a conceptual group."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This is a great book. It explains, without using many words, what is wrong with liberalism. I read the whole book in one evening, because I did not want to put it down. Neal even showed me the error of thinking you get money back with your tax refund. Highly recommended! Remember, you only throw your vote away if you don't vote Libertarian."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"As another reviewer pointed out; this is Boortz at his best. Satire, wit and coherent observations with a \\"take no prisoners\\" style hallmarks this book. I've read it 3 times.I miss Neal though. I can't stand listening to his radio show anymore. It nothing but a long litany or pro-Bush propaganda.I am wondering what happened to the old Neal \\"you know a politican isl ying when you see his lips move\\" Boortz.Today it is like the Bush administration slipped something into the AC vent at his Atlanta studio.Neal - W is just another lying politician like all of them. whats the deal? Do we need to get you de-programmed like a Moonie?Neal - read your own book - this one. Maybe you'll pop out of your trance.Neal - we want you back. We have enough Hannity's and Limbaughs. We need a BOORTZ!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I sure am thankful for people like Neal and Rush who attempt to help people like me and you remember what America stands for and what it can be. They do this even in the face of an overwhelmningly liberal media that controls basically everything someone who doesn't listen to talk radio sees and hears.. Even after being labeled as \\"hate radio\\" hosts and having the media turn millions of Americans against them, Boortz and Limbaugh continue the fight. And what an important fight it is too!! We can't afford to let control of this country fall into the hands of these liberal politicians who will say and do ANYTHING if they think it'll get them votes. (Just look at John Kerry and his tendency to flip or flop whichever way he thinks will be the most popular at any moment). In this book, Neal Boortz spells it out plain and simple: the liberal agenda and the threat that it poses to America and to our freedom to be an individual and make choices on our own. It's not just an illogical tirade. Neal backs up his claims with concrete examples.. I strongly reccomend this book to anyone, liberal or conservative or in between."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Neal A. Boortz, Jr. (born 1945) is a libertarian radio host (The Neal Boortz Show), author, and political commentator. He has also writtenSomebody's Gotta Say It,FairTax: The Truth: Answering the Critics,The Commencement Speech You Need to Hear, etc.He wrote in the first chapter of this 1998 (revised 2001) book, \\"In the pages that follow, I am going to tell you the terrible truth about Liberals... The book is small because it doesn't take a lot of prose and flowery language to get my message across. Just a small measure of logic and fact will take care of things very nicely. I try to limit my use of words with multiple syllables so that Liberals won't be discouraged from picking up this book and, perhaps, learning a bit about themselves.\\"He states, \\"Freedom is not something that is given to us by government. We form those governments to protect the freedoms that were already ours.\\" (Pg. 21) He asserts that \\"Government is inherently evil. There's no question it's a necessary evil.\\" (Pg. 40)In his chapter, \\"About Race,\\" he states, \\"Frankly, though, I'm not fully convinced that Liberals really want to see our racial divisions healed. Somehow this racial division has become a potent weapon in the hands of the left.\\" (Pg. 89) He refers to homeless people as \\"Urban outdoorsmen,\\" and compares them to people living in the mountains of Colorado; \\"The only thing that sets them apart from the urban variety is that they have more trees and fewer dumpsters.\\" (Pg. 110)He opines that one of the \\"most basic Liberal rules\\" is: \\"You shall not hold an individual responsible for his actions.\\" (Pg. 127) In his discussion of the minimum wage, he suggests, \\"One of the greatest social crimes a couple can commit is to have a baby that they cannot afford to raise.\\" (Pg. 131)He is very fond of Ayn Rand's book,Atlas Shrugged, calling it \\"the big kahuna. Thankfully it is over one thousand pages long, which makes it unattractive to most Liberals who prefer fewer words, larger type, and more pictures.\\" (Pg. 118) In fact, he ends the book on the note, \\"Maybe it's time to plan an escape route. Does anyone know where Galt's Gulch is?\\" (Pg. 160)Boortz's book is deliberately provocative, and thus illustrative of the current radically \\"polarized\\" political debate. It's certainly never boring, however, and will be of considerable interest to people who like this kind of polemic."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I enjoy Neal Boortz.

I didn't really get all that many new things out of the book. However, it's always nice to know that there are others who agree with my political ideas, and, as such, this book is extremely valuable.Liberals are opposed to the idea of private property. Their ultimate goal is to have the government control as much property as possible, and to have people dependent upon government.Liberals believe that people are too stupid to control their own economic activity, and so liberals want to use the government to force people to live the way that the liberals want them to live. Liberals cannot stand the idea of allowing people to control their own money. For example, liberals cannot stand the idea of giving people the choice to opt out of social security, and to let them make their own decisions regarding retirement, and to let them be self-sufficient, and not have to rely on getting a check from the government. The idea of people being self sufficient is something that scares liberals.Please keep in mind that Boortz is not a Republican. He is a Libertarian."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"One would think that a book of this nature would be unnecessary decades after liberal public policy has been largely discredited. But it seems that old liberal &quot;solutions&quot; are being revived by a new generation of societal engineers who refuse to learn from past errors. In this book, Boortz wants to make sure that those lessons are learned lest we degrade American values even more by further exposure to hands-on liberal idealism. Boortz holds no punches and speaks his mind with clarity and persuasion. He is very hard-hitting and is likely to offend the sensibilities (or sensitivities?) of those with bleeding hearts. A definite must-read for Libertarians and Conservatives. But Liberals Beware - you won't like the reality that Boortz presents."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Gary Chapman reviewed this book.

He is a great read if you want a liberal view on how to construct a \\"fair\\" society.\\"He also spent a lot of time in saying \\"poor people\\"'s (sic) misfortune is perfectly predictable and so does not deserve help. He perhaps should know that using a negative income tax to help the poor to get out of perpetual poverty is justifiable on libertarian ground.\\"This is the most controversial statement of all. Libertarians do NOT believe in the income tax to redistribute wealth. We allow that SOME form of tax (not income) is necessary to provide for common defense and other national concerns, but there is no such thing as a \\"negative income tax.\\"\\"In other cases, his ideas are often repetitive. For example, the idea of \\"less fortunate\\" has been appeared in the book more than once.\\"His repetition was pointedly made to highlight areas where people have the most serious problems. \\"Fortunate\\" implies that it was luck, not hard work and determination, that brought a person success. For the VAST majority of successful people, this simply is not the case: Less than 5% of today's millionaires inherited their money. So where does the rest of the money come from? Hard work. Long hours. Dedication.

Everybody should read it.Liberals are the fundamental problem with our country. They expect government to do everything for them, and they also expect the government to tax and punish people who want to be independent and live free.If liberals continue to vote for despots to rule our country, the USA will collapse like the Soviet Union and decline into a Zimbabwe-like chaotic death.I must add that NEAL BOORTZ is the greatest radio talk show host of all time (WSB Radio, Atlanta, AM 750, FM 95.5). His show is syndicated, so there is probably a radio station in your local area where you can tune into his Church of the Painful Truth."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I honestly would have given this book 5 stars if I had read it when it first came out last Sept., but I read David Brock's \\"Blinded By The Right\\" before \\"The Terrible Truth About Liberals\\", and wow, what a difference perspective makes. \\"TTTAL\\" now comes across as just the kind of stuff Brock was called upon by the right-wing propoganda machine to spew out to the masses.1 star by a less hateful, more \\"compassionate\\" conservative (remember those?

Answer: it doesn't.Liberals believe in freedom and choice tempered by social responsibility. What Boortz thinks he's talking about is communism, of a type which barely exists in the world any more. And the idea that - in the US context - the Democratic party aspires to control every aspect of individual lives is ludicrous.But then, what's more ludicrous still is that, instead of laughing at this book, people take it seriously!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Boortz wouldn't know the truth if it jumped in his bank account and was never taxed. Boortz is a multi-millionaire DJ who cloaks himself in the sheep's clothing of a Libertarian, but his fan base knows better. Boortz's show will never delve into the Libertarian platform of the legalization of drugs or a woman's right to choose, he chooses to stay in the shallow end of republican dogma of low taxes for the rich corporate entities, and the rediculous notion that this will somehow raise revenue for the government which has been proven time and again that it does not increase revenue, just debt. Which is really what people of Boortz ilk is really all about, borrow, borrow, borrow, and make the working class pay the bill when it come due so he can have his airplanes, and huge homes though unfair tax structures. Boortz will not realize that the people who make ALL the money should then pay ALL the taxes. Boortz cooks the book on virtually all his \\"facts\\" and can never back up his figures honestly. Which brings us to the big picture that Boortz is a failed lawyer striking it rich in the conservative/fascist AM radio wasteland telling listeners and readers that people like himself (Rich...although he'll gladly include YOU in the mix) are being treated unfair by being taxed too much, and he also manages at the same time to slip in racist comments like a good, polished armchair bigot should. Boortz's big argument for virtually everything is taxes, taxes, taxes. He brushes broad strokes on the subject resting comfortably in the facts that he knows that his white male audience all hate taxes. Which is the oldest rant in the books...ranting about taxes...big deal. Only idiots fall for this form of phoney support. If Boortz was serious about making fair government he would not be just pointing out the enemy to everyone, but working to make a difference, which he does not. His effort is to sit behind the microphone a rile up the stupid masses with anger and paranoia to feed his tax free lifestyle so he can jet from here to there and enjoy the fruits of the rich. That's precisly why he offers only token support for LIbertarian causes, because he's is not a Libertarian. He's just looking for the next republican wedge issue like a rich leech living off the ignorant. Put it this way, if Boortz was living in Germany in 1931 we would find him goose-stepping down mainstreet Berlin at every chance. Seig Heil!

If you want a good laugh and a basic overview of some parts of the conservative philosophy, this book will do it for you.

The next thought that springs to mind is racist, evil, cold-hearted republicans. Well all of that is about to change with this book.What Boortz conveys in this book is a simple, common sense approach to the differences between liberals and conservatives. Boortz spells out how the public has been mislead for so long and how the media aids in this game.You'll see a clear picture of why we do not live in a democracy.

You'll even understand how and why taxes are collected.In the 166 pages of this book you will begin to understand what separates the liberal left from the conservative right.

Learn the truth behind America's most popular Liberal myths! It doesn't quite slice-and-dice, but it does give the reader a good introduction into Liberal and Conservative thought.Boortz starts with the most concise, clear explanation of the difference between liberals and conservatives I have yet to find anywhere. Though unfortunately short, it does manage to give you an excellent insight into the mindset of each group.From there he proceeds to debunk classical liberal myths left-and-right, and offer up to the reader several suggestions on how to diffuse Liberal arguments without the slightest effort. Probably the best part of the book is a chapter in which he dictates his ideal college commencement speech to the reader. If only all graduates could listen to this thing, it's a perfect summary of Boortz's political thought, and better, a perfect lesson on why not to become a Liberal.He tosses in a lot of humor and factual examples to accentuate and enforce his point, it's quite an easy and enjoyable read actually. And it's message is very powerful- if every Liberal were to read this book, i firmly believe their species would die out. It's a book they'll never read though, I'm afraid.. no pictures. One of the most efficient books I've ever read, in terms of strength of argument to shortness of length. You could read it in a couple of hours, but enjoy it's lessons for a lifetime.

Boortz vents his frustration with liberals in the book like he does on his radio shows. For those who listen to Boortz on talk radio, the book is a compilation of his views which he has expressed on his talk show. His commencement speech is the best. The only criticism I have is he seems to be fine with conservatives and Republicans. As a Libertarian, he needs to express his criticism with Republicans as well since both mainstream parties are corrupt."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Before discovering Neal Boortz, I leaned too far to the left even to be classified as \\"liberal\\" in any sense. What makes Boortz's message stick is a level-headed objectiveness and a philosophy based upon hard facts rather than generalizations or \\"spin\\". As I am not a fan of the Rush Limbaugh style of blustery hoopla, I was struck by the fact that Boortz employs no gimmicks or chanting minions in getting his message across; instead of just attempting to elicit an emotional reaction (a common tool of both liberals AND conservatives who haven't done their homework), he has taken the time to present the reader with genuine information based upon years of extensive and non-partisan research.As an author, Neal Boortz's style is as sardonic, engaging, and informative as his radio persona; whether you agree with him or not, it's tough not to listen. He is never dull or obtuse, and never leaves any stone unturned. And while he has written this book in a highly witty and accessible style, it is never condescending. One gets the sense that he does not underestimate the intelligence level of the general population. Pundits and sociologists could learn a lot from his approach.The specifics which he has uncovered will astound you. ....And if he still doesn't get through to you, don't put it down without at least reading the allegory in the last chapter; it gives the whole work a better finish than a fine wine."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Neal Boortz doesn't need a lot of pages to show that modern liberalism is harmful to America. He proves that most liberals want government controlling everything from the economy, schools, healthcare, and most depressingly, our lives. His main point in the book is that no one in America needs to be taken care of by the government. Our economy offers so much opportunity the anyone can make it no matter their race, class, sex, religion, etc. Boortz claims liberals want people poor and helpless so they can get the reputation as being compassionate. But, this ends up ruining lives and makes for a complacent and apathetic society. Boortz believes that ending entitlements and welfare will force people to become motivated and responsible.The main theme you can derive from this book is that people should be free to use their own money, make decisions for themselves and their children, and be free of government's grasp. According to Boortz, liberalism is against what these principles stand for. And he's right."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Everyone should read this book even if you are liberal, conservative or other.

Boortz's book is right on the money and true to life examples illustrate the idiocy of liberal logic (or illogic). As a former slacker, I once waited for the government to carry me, thought I would &quot;fall into success&quot; or win &quot;life's lottery&quot;. I was once a bystander in the political process, content to let government run itself. The &quot;Terrible Turth&quot; was a real eye opener. It's the perfect kick in the rear for anyone who's afraid of being involved in politics or content to let liberals overrun our freedoms. Boortz's book puts everything into perspective. It's informative, funny, and downright inspiring. It's not the wealthy &quot;I'm-better-than-you are&quot; Republicans bashing Democrats or the partisan finger-pointing I thought it would be. It's just the truth."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"While I must admit my own bias (being myself a libertarian and a very big fan of Mr. Boortz), I have to say I never was a libertarian until reading this book.

While it plays to conservative fervor, any experienced right-winger will find very little new in characterization of liberals and their thinking. Yes, there was an occasional chuckle from a well turned phrase or original argument, but they were relatively few. The writing style is fairly low-brow; not of the quality of Limbaugh and others.

Rush's radio show can be predictable, but Boortz gives a new blend to talk radio.For the reviewers who hate the book...He's a libertarian not a conservative... if you would have read the book you would have found that out.He also was going to school to be a lawyer where he would of made big bucks, not be a delivery boy his whole life. So apparently he didn't get into talk radio for the money, because when you start out you don't make much at all. So this crap about him being some rich snob is baloney.

This book is written in typical Boortz style- it is a very quick read that will excite conservatives but annoy the heck out of liberal readers.Boortz case against liberals fails for many different reasons, chief among them is that it is written much too simplisticly and one-sided to be taken at all seriously. Boortz is great at narrowing down complex topics into a single, sound-bite sized slogan and reapeating it endlessly.In the first chapter, Boortz explains the basic differences between liberals and conservatives. He starts by claiming that liberals operate on emotion and feelings, and conservatives operate on reason and logic.The problem with this premise is that it fails to explain why both conservatives and liberals act on reason AND emotion. Many liberals feel that conservatives act too emotionally, as evidenced by conservatives opposition of gay marriage and thier knee-jerk militarist reaction to 9/11. Likewise, liberals believe that conservatives illogically vote against thier own self-interests when it comes to economic matters (see the book: \\"What's the matter with Kansas\\" by Thomas Frank.)Next, Boortz explains that liberals see people as memebers of groups while conservatives see people as individuals. One wonders if Boortz realizes the obvious irony in this statement: he claims that he sees people as individuals, and yet lumps liberals and conservatives into groups.Boortz's entire line of argument here is straw-man. Liberals believe that individuals are naturally social animals, and that group survival is better than survival of the fittest. Liberals also believe that individuals live in an environment called society which forces us to interact and co-exist in groups. Boortz doesn't even get close to adressing these arguments.Next Boortz claims that liberals think America is great because of the government, but conservatives think it is great because of freedom. This is an illogical argument. Liberals believe that government is essential to create freedom. Liberals think America is great because our form of government has proven successful and has given us liberty, democracy, freedom and human rights.Boortz counters this by explaining that government cannot give us freedom, it merely protects the freedom we already had. If this were so, then what does Boortz think of Somalia? There is no central government in Somalia, so using Boortz's logic, the residents of Somalia have the same freedom we have in America. This is far from true, considering the fact that Somalia is one of the most violent and dangerous places on earth.What makes American freedom different from Somalian \\"freedom\\"? If American freedom is better, then isn't it because America has a better form of government than Somalia? If Boortz was to acknowledge that American government gives better results than Somalia, then he would find himself arguing against his own point.Boortz spends an entire chapter attacking the evil that is Democracy, arguing that America is really a republic and not a democracy. In doing so, Boortz ignores the fact that a republic, by definition, is a form of democracy. Every branch of our government -- executive, legislative, judicial, monetary -- ultimately derives its power from majority rule or approval.In an argument against welfare and taxation, Boortz explains that liberals think it is ok for government to levy taxes to pay for welfare programs for the poor. He then asks if liberals would think it ok if an individual broke into someone's house, held a gun to his head, and forced him to surrender his money to help a \\"lazy\\" poor person.In this argument, Boortz ignores that taxpayers agree to exchange thier money with the government for goods and services. This is called a \\"social contract\\". To consume these goods and services without paying for them is itself theft, and is rightly punished as breach of contract. Thus government is not forcing someone to give up thier money at gun point, but actually enforcing contract.Boortz might object that he does not agree to the social contract. If so, he should simply stop consuming the government's goods and services. Stop using the water and energy supplied by the government...the food inspected by the government...the highways and roads provided by the government...etc. Let us know how you make out without government help, okay Neal?Boortz may also object that welfare payments to the poor are theft. However, this is also untrue. Welfare is a form of social insurance. In the private sector we freely accept the validity of life insurance. The same applies to social insurance like unemployment and welfare. The tax money that goes for social insurance buys everyone a private good: the comfort of being protected in times of adversity. It buys us a public good as well. If workers were allowed to starve and die during temporary setbacks, the economy would frequently be disrupted. Social insurance allows workers to have some help over rough times and gives everyone else a smooth-running economy.The rest of the book is filled with more nonesense like this (and many examples of Boortz calling poor people lazy!!!) This book earns Boortz the title of \\"High Priest of Idiocy.\\" Congrats Neal! You sure did earn it!"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"the one thing I don't understand about this book is the fact that boortz doesn't point out the fact that all liberals are mentally retarded and suffer from what doctors call the anti-american gene. it is quite amusing to me to hear all of the liberals whine and complain about a rich white man and this and that. maybe if you would get off your you know what you could make something of yourself. oh, but then you wouldn't have time to complain. I have a better solution for you though. since you are unhappy with the amount of dollars in your wallet, go down to mexico and exchange them for some pesos and salute the red, white, and green."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"If I were to assert that &quot;Christians despise blacks, want to put Muslims in concentration camps, and want to slaughter all gay people&quot;, any reasonable person would call that a dreadfully unfair statement. The fact that I have heard individual Christians (or, people who claim to be Christians) express these sentiments does not mean that they should be taken as the feelings of the entire community.Yet this is exactly the approach that Boortz takes in this book. He has perfected the art of erecting a straw man of his own construction and knocking it down. Not only does Boortz spend most of his time &quot;debunking&quot; some of the fringe ideas that no &quot;mainstream&quot; liberal espouses, it's almost as if Boortz is inventing hypothetical liberal arguments for his own purposes. The notion, for example, that liberals want to &quot;abolish private property&quot; is ludicrous, but that doesn't deter Boortz from going with it. By the end of the book, one expects Boortz to accuse liberals of enslaving children for the purposes of fattening and eating them. (I'm actually surprised that he didn't!)In the final analysis, this book almost reads as satire aimed at conservatives. If you are a vitriolic dittohead, you will doubtless enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you are looking for truth (terrible or otherwise), there's none to be found here."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I don't believe many people would disagree that it is time to rethink many of our approaches to social and political problems. After all, things are rapidly changing and we've never had a complex, highly-technological, multi-cultural world economy before. We're all making this world up as we go along. Yesterday's bright idea is tomorrow's headache. Boortz and the libertarians have some good ideas--as well as Republicans, Democrats and even socialists. We all need each others help and feedback. We're all in this together. That's where I'm disturbed by the arrogant, know-it-all, derisive tone that Boortz and his true believers often take. Using distortions, misquotes, statements out of context and uproven accusations, Boortz creates ridiculous, weak, stereotypical opponents: the &quot;bed-wetting liberals&quot; and the &quot;liberal media&quot; and then neatly proceeds to dispatch them. An actual dialogue of mutual respect between Americans with differing ideas is never established--not in this book; not on his radio show, where people of opposing viewpoints are rarely allowed to express themselves. If they get on the air at all, they are put on hold while Boortz &quot;re-educates&quot; them, and others are rudely cut off the air. Look in the book, listen to the radio show and read the reviews of his fans and look at how freely &quot;moron&quot; &quot;idiot&quot; and worse are used to describe people of differing ideas. One has to wonder about a government with people like Boortz and his followers in charge. What would happen to all those &quot;illogical&quot; &quot;underacheiving&quot; &quot;morons&quot; unable or unwilling to be put on hold and reprogrammed? Would liberty exist on for Libertarians?"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This is the first book I have ever truly regrettedpurchasing. Amazingly, I can honestly say the piece was not worth the$$ I paid for it. While the author addresses a number of libertarianissues that would be interesting in any other forum, his rudimentary vocabularly and woefully crude delivery spoil the show. I understand that there is a popular market for authors and public figures who are straight shooters, but this was really disappointing. The publisher clearly discarded any semblance of literary standards when approving this book for printing. Stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"You gotta love libertarians. I am sorry if you and Mr. Boortz feel that schools, libraries, environmental protection, public health etc. are not areas in which government should involve itself.Mr. Boortz, heinous New Deal democrats didn't create this concept.Read the preamble to the Constitution, the supreme authority from which all libertarian philosphy is derived, the wellspring, the mother lode, the alpha and omega: \\"promote the general welfare\\" is right there in black and white.Enjoy your feudalism."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I sometimes enjoy listening to Boortz's show, and he makes some good points in this book, but overall, the book is pretty superficial. Listen to one of his radio monologues instead."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Boortz continues to vicously attack those who disagree with him, while ignoring the same flaws in those he likes.His character is defined by remarks such as laughing about &quot;homeless-sickles&quot; the day after a homeless person was found frozen to death in Atlanta. A truly mean spirited soul."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Neal's philosophy: If you are Rich and White you have worked for and deserved everything that you own, If you are poor and black you are morally weak and your poverty is divine justice. Elitist garbage from the talk-astard himself. This philosophy created the great divide in this county, and people like Boortz want to keep it that way."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"This book is a tiresome compendium of Boortz's radio rantings. Most of Boortz's argumentation is so vague and so undocumented it is beyond all belief. Here's a check for all such rhetoric: Replace the word &quot;Liberal&quot; with, ..........; and see how the book reads. Boortz has convinced himself there is no freedom in America anymore. Hopefully he will take the nosefull of nickels he made with this book and swim away to establish his own dictatorship."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"boortz book is the same fascist bologna he has spouted for years, too many years. To even suggest a 165 page snail-effort is a book is insulting to even his loyal listeners. If Mr. Boortz intends to write another &quot;book&quot; in the future I wish he could try to keep the same thought process for a book worth writing, not a single minded essay."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"That problem with this book and Mr. Boortz's philosophy is that it has a weak foundation. From reading this book, I am uncertain what branch of libertarianism he belongs to but he believes, like most libertarians, in limited government (except of course to protect their property), right of private property, and something called the free market.Libertarians talk about these three ideas as a given, as if they always existed. The central component to all of this is private property and it is the foundation of their philosophy. But for American libertarians it is their Achilles heel. Since libertarians believe that the right to a given property is valid only when transferred legally without coercion one need only trace back said property to see if the property had been lawfully transferred (original acquisition). One need only trace various properties in the New England states to understand that most properties there had been stolen from the native population. If a property has been stolen, it has been obtained illegally.Instead of knocking down straw men, Mr. Boortz would do better in writing a book about defending basic libertarian values since this is a thin and weakly argued book that merely speaks to the converted. Those who a fans of Mr. Boortz should instead read Robert Nozick's &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; and come to understand that even he passes on the idea of \`original acquisition' - that is how land was first acquired, since it is a sticky topic for most libertarians."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Right from the beginning it was apparent that this book was compiled largely on the basis of one man's opinion. He contradicted himself quite early by stating that 'Liberals view people in terms of their membership in groups...Conservatives view people as individuals.' Isn't he, a conservative, viewing all liberals on the basis of their membership in a group? Isn't he assigning them all immutable characteristics? Doltish."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"It is very sad that some people can read this book and think, &quot;This man writes the truth.&quot; I was in Paris and I was amazed to see a copy of this book being read by a French man. I asked him about it and he told me, &quot;This is the way Americans think. They are amusing idiots.&quot; Not all Americans, thank God."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"For someone who claims to be sooo intelligent, Neal does nothing in this book but throw out the same mindless garbage about liberals that has been the source for so much of his own personal wealth and gain. (Without it he would still be working his original job as a delivery man - a worthless job I suppose to his greatness) I believe that he would have contributed more to his fellow Americans doing precisely this, and that his views on the wealthy would be vastly different if he was back in his &quot;old&quot; shoes. Amazing how the love of money can completely distort ones entire perspective on life. It is amusing to read however for the less gullible reader."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Why pay for something you've already heard for free. This non-rational aspect of markets is but one of many realities that this libelous, .. ignores."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I have NOT read this book yet, and I don't think I will. However, I incidentally listened to the live-stream of Boortz' radio show on WSB. For me, as a European, it is incredible that such plain and simple people find opportunities this vast to make themselves heard AND even read among middle-class citizens.I base my critique primarily on one statement Boortz uttered in that show... He stated that American Culture were &quot;inherently superior&quot; to any other on the globe. Excuse me, but just the fact that the American &quot;culture&quot; is very convenient and globally successful just implies that it is the world's fittest, but not necessarily its finest! What Boortz does is like stating that rats were absolutely sublime and superior beings just because they can hardly be extincted!Don't get me wrong, I revere and study the American Culture profesionally and would never assimilate it to a rats' plague! OK?D. Marin, Germany"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Finally, a place where people can talk about Neal without being cut off and swept under the carpet. Boortz never has the gonads to let people talk on his program that have an iota of knowledge b/c that would make him look dumb. He's even got his token black guy and white woman to back him up in the radio studio.This book is just like Neal's show: it is entertainment - that is all. He machine guns anything in his path and pulls mundane shock-jock tactics in order to appeal to the vapid masses out there who are too desperate to have someone's approval that appears to be in a position of authority.Neal Boortz is a carny balker - he is the man behind the curtain. Period."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Usually I like Boortz not all the time. This book is Boortz at his best. Biting wit and satire is sprinkled \\"liberally\\" throughout the book. This book contains may truths all of course filtered through Neals *sometimes* libertarian viewpoint.Neal claims to be a libertarian but many of his views fly in the face of real libertarian ideals. Neal is fan of the War on Terror but he should know better. A real libertarian would know that the War on Terror will have no more success than the War on Drugs or War on Poverty. Federal \\"Wars\\" usually end up creating an environment more conducive to the thing you are warring on. The three \\"Wars\\" I mentioned are cases in point. Neals knows this or should.That being said he takes some pretty good pot shots at the liberals of today and most of what he observes is accurate. I wish he would turn more of the biting wit on the neo-conservatives, but since Neal is a Neo-com himself I won't wait for that.The real puzzlement to me Boortz's support for the so-called \\"Fair Tax\\" A real libertarian would see the holes in this plan and realize the potential for a national sales tax would be even worse than the income tax. The IRS would in no form go away - it may change it's name but it's not going anywhere. If we extend the same level of growth to the fair tax as the actually happened to the income tax the Neo-IRS will be in your house every year demanding reciepts on everything you purchased to prove you paid the tax.Instead of 30% or so there could not limit to the amount of tax due on a sale even amounts greater than 100% - something the income tax could never do. Nothing in the Fair Tax proposal safeguards against it and even if it did it can be easily changed.I can easily imagine the Federal government in their typical fashion attempting to peform social engineering using the sales tax as they do with the income tax. Think about a 10,0000% tax on guns and ammo. Can be done with the stroke of a few pens, effectively wiping out all of your 2nd amendment rights without actually making owning guns illegal. Perfect, it is a no-lose scenario for the feds.In 5 years there will be 2500 ( or more) different sales tax levels thus negating any possible advantage of elimating compliance costs. The black market will flourish not that that is necessarily a bad thing in my opinion, but that would drive rates up even more. Soon you will only be able to survive on black market goods with their artifically higher thanks to the sales tax.The \\"Fair Tax\\" does nothing to limit government growth and spending and will probably make matters worse. Taxes would be more easily raised with campaigns like \\"A penny for freedom\\" or higher tax rates on \\"luxury goods\\" make those rich SOB's pay their \\"fair share\\". Recall the so-called luxury tax that taxed high end boats and cars resulted in rampant unemployment in several industries and drive boat buyers offshore where they paid NO taxes. The \\"Fair Tax\\" will cause this at every level of industry. The fes have been wanting to restrich private aviation for years, nows the chance with a 1000% tax on AvGas or a 3000% and aircraft parts. ( of course to fight terrorism )A real libertarian would know all this. A real Libertarian would know that we can easily eliminate the federal income and replace it with nothing, and SHOULD do so immediately. We would gain the all the advantages they mention without having the sales tax burden. Promoting the Fair Tax is waste of time. He should put the same effort into educating the country about the illegality and lack of need for the income tax - then we might get somewhere.Neal exbibits the same myopia on many issues that he accuses the \\"liberals\\" of - they are guilty but then so is Neal.All in all this is an enjoyable book, but his criticisms should have been more evenly distributed across the line and been a lot more fun if he poked the same holes in the so-called conservativecauses as he did the liberal ones."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I first read this book about a month ago, and I plan on purchasing myself a copy sometime within the next week.It is a great book for any one of you to buy as a gift for any of your liberal friends.

Come up with some new material neel. he's not a writer, he's a talk show host. that being the case his book is half assed and he even admits his lack of writing skill and interest..on the other hand if you have minimal knowledge about the subject you will think he's the man."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"I am not a fan of Mr. Boortz. I listen very rarely, and he usually offends my sense of etiquette and courtesy when I do. Nevertheless, as one who spent more than a decade as a liberal and moving amongst them before becoming a conservative after an agonizing 18 months of soul-searching, I must admit Mr. Boortz is on to something in this book.Liberals (certainly the ones I knew, including myself) consider themselves a superior form of homo sapiens, even though their record is nearly blank. Progressives have done much in the world, especially in the last 40 years. But the &quot;progressives&quot;, now, are, ironically enough, labelled &quot;conservatives&quot;. The right is where the great new ideas to advance society have come since the 1980s, and liberals, in their defense of liberal establishment status quo, have been rigid reactionaries, their &quot;progressiveness&quot; being merely a genius for finding new ways to redistribute taxpayers' money and undermine the free-market economy.In fact, liberals are driven mostly by hate. Some, like me, realize that what they really hate is themselves, and they make adjustments where they pull their weight in society -- but the only way a liberal can be made to pull his weight is for him to become a conservative.I may sound harsh (or, if you're not a liberal and therefore have a sense of humor, tongue-in-cheek), but it's true enough. But there's no reason for anyone not a liberal to read this book. It's not a great book, but Mr. Boortz, who has been on all sides of the political spectrum except the far left (and I've been on the extremes of either end, so I have a little more insight through experience), is able to glean some very good points by the use of logic and perception of the liberal political spectrum. And therefore his book, and other similar titles, would be useful for liberals to read. Since they are their own worst enemy and problem, it would be good for liberals to read what Mr. Boortz says about them, whether he's (as he often is) right on, or merely hits a glancing blow. It may cause liberals to think and be introspective about their inner failings.Liberals too often are like religious fundamentalists: when the first enthusiasm of conversion starts to wane, they try to force themselves to be &quot;ultra-religious&quot; and legalistic, rather than trying to advance to a new phase of their walk with God. Liberals usually are liberals to fill a void or lack in themselves, and pursue legalistic &quot;fundamentalist politics&quot;. If Mr. Boortz can at least begin the intellectual process of introspection on liberals, which may be painful (it was for me; it was like self-surgery, without anaesthetic), then his book will do some good. But if it becomes merely a way for conservatives and libertarians to get a chuckle out of the foibles of the illogical ultra-left, then who needs it?I would urge liberals to purchase this title or check it out from the library or steal it or force a taxpayer to buy you one at gunpoint. Even though Mr. Boortz's prose may occasionally be heavy-handed, and he isn't always correct, it's a good starting point for liberals who genuinely are interested in hearing out opposing views (admittedly a small number); from then the liberal can move on through more intellectual voices, like David Horowitz, Thomas Sowell, William Bennett, Harry Stein, etc."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Liberals","review":"Mr. Boortz has hit the nail on the head. He presented reasons for why America is in such a mess that are so logical that I am shocked that I had never thought of them myself.

The volumes -- i) Fixed Point Theorems, iia) Linear Monotone Operators, iib) Nonlinear Montone Operators, iii) Variational Methods and Optimization, iv) Applications to Mathematical Physics -- are together over 3700 pages in length!!!The 8 indices (I use the term broadly) of volume I are -- 1) Symbols, 2) Theorems, 3) Important Definitions, 4) Schematic Overviews, 5) General References to the Literature, 6) List of Important Principles, 7) Contents of the other Volumes, 8) The Index -- just to give an idea of the detail and care with which these volumes were prepared.The Appendices found at the backs of I, IIb and III are themselves an impresive collection of facts from analysis and linear functional analysis. (In fact when I want a quick reminder of some fact or am curious about extensions of some concept, I often go here first or in conjunction with a handful of other books most notably Evans and Gariepy's &quot;Measure theory and ...&quot;, Folland's &quot;Real Analysis&quot; and Conway's &quot;A Course in Functional Analysis&quot;.)The problem collection is an incredible work in itself with references to papers in which the problems are studied in detail. The problems themselves are mini-expositions in extensions and side explorations not found in the main text.Another beautiful feature is the very large collection of pertinent and often quite entertaining quotes that appear throughout.The text reads very smoothly and speaks very well of the translation efforts of P. Wadsack, L. Boron, and J. Quandt. There are minor mistakes that I have never found disturbing. In fact the mistakes keep me engaged, though I imagine they might cause some difficulty for someone with a weak background in analysis. Nevertheless, I recommend these books to anyone seriously interested in nonlinear analysis. I recommend them not only because of their comprehensiveness, not only because they are fun to work through or even just read, but also because they include an incredible collection of annotated references.The only serious drawback to these volumes are their price and the difficulty that one sometimes has obtaining them. But to be fair I should add that I think the books are worth the price since in fact I have the whole set.The first volume on fixed point theory is large (909 pages). This alone gives an indication of the ground taken in by fixed point theory in nonlinear analysis. The three &quot;main&quot; fixed point theorems -- the Banach, Schauder, and Bourbaki-Kneser fixed point theorems -- occupy, together with their extensive applications, the first 516 pages of the book. The last 393 pages are an exposition of mapping degree and fixed point index theory (and their applications). The author makes great efforts to keep the presentation of degree and index theory as simple as possible -- but not too simple!I recommend the volume."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications: I: Fixed-Point Theorems (Zeidler, Eberhard//Nonlinear Functional Analysis and Its Applications) (Pt. 1)","review":"This is an excellent book on fixed theorems both for beguiners and experts alike.The only complaint I have about the book is that It is impossible to buy.

That speaks for itself.I have to comment on the \\"physics\\" of those who are trying the old melon argument. This one has always been laughable, but just for the fun of argument let's take it on. Hmmmm, firstly the difference between the melon and a head is that the head is attached to a body but the melons aren't. Melons are softer too. So the melons went forward after being shot from the front? That may only be because the melon is very soft and the bullet passes through it without resistance. A skull on the other hand is like rock, and the autopsy physicians claimed they found only tiny splinters of the fatal bullet in the president's head. That by itself suggests explosive ammo was used which could not have been used in Oswald's rifle as a Mannlicher Carcano cannot handle such ammo. The ammo for Oswald's rifle was designed to pass through more than one body without losing much of its mass.If melons go forward after shot from the front, that proves that melons go forward after being shot from the front. Did anyone try shooting melons from the back to see which way they go? Oh, you want to argue that it does not matter because the melon is the same no matter which direction you shoot it from. Yeah, right. Except that the melon is still NOT a human head. After you have stopped laughing,just consider this: If the melons went forward that still says NOTHING about what happens to a human head if attached to a body! It seems these melons are best enjoyed with SOUR GRAPES!!"},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"I feel compelled to ask one of your previous reviewers (Gary Waltrip) whether he has ever taken a physics class, because in my opinion, I don't believe that his CPA credentials qualify him to re-write the laws of physics, nor refute an expert the likes of a Cyril Wecht.Clearly Kennedy was shot from the front, (i.e. Zapruder film frame 337), why else would his head go back and to the left towards the car's trunk? Remember his wife climbing onto the trunk to retrieve a peice of her husbands skull?When is the last time you have seen (an analogy) a head snap backwards and to the left like that I ask you? How about when the likes of a boxer like Mike Tyson hits someone from the front, and their head snaps backwards and not forward.Otherwise what you are proposing is that one can get hit from the back of the head (as you are with Kennedy) and that their head will move backwards. If that is what you are proposing, then I would like to see that experiment, because it doesn't exist, but in your fertile imagination and the Warren Commission's.Lastly, don't discredit the conspiracy theorists, because our Government has lied to us in the past, remember Nixon...\\"I am not a crook\\"...

However, this book serves the subject of JFK's assassination with distinction with Dr. Crenshaw going on the record stating that what the so called official autopsy report concluded does not jive with he saw in Dallas on November 22, 1963. We are taking about a physician who physically examined President Kennedy right after he expired. He observed and looked into the hole in the back of Kennedy's head. Dr. Crenshaw has a dark and important story to tell here. And the tale of what JAMA did puts medical ethics in the form of publication into question. Shame on you JAMA for allowing politics an arena to controvert good medicine!Previously the assertion of discrepancy between what the medical staff of Parkland Hospital saw and what the autopsy physicians finalized in their report was researched and corroborated by one David Lifton. His book Best Evidence remains some of the best documentation on the subject of medical evidence related JFK's assassination. Lifton was right about the difference in what the doctors at Parkland saw and the conclusion of the official autopsy report.

Malcolm Perry and Robert McClelland, had to enlarge the president's throat exit wound for the tracheotomy, and Crenshaw's fabricated account obscures such facts--about events both at Parkland and at Bethesda.

Gary Davis;with the title \\"JFK Conspiracy of Silence\\".After that book was published in 1992,the authors were slandered both personally and professionally by the Journal of American Medical Association.The authors filed a suit for slander and malice and the court ordered a monetary settlement by JAMA. The revision,\\"Trauma Room One\\" covers this suit and the results.There have been thousands of books,articles,documentaries, films,investigations,commissions,etc about the killing of President Kennedy. There are countless motives,connections,theories,and conclusions about who did the killing,why,and who was behind it. No murder in the US has received more coverage and few even today believe the whole story has been revealed.Many conspiracies have been generated around motives ,but the most important conspiracy of all, is whether or not JFK was hit in the front or both front and back of the head. If he received hits in both the front and back;then there had to be a conspiracy.Dr.Crenshaw attended to JFK when he was brought to Parkland Hospital. He ,as well as other attending Doctors,were silent for several reasons about the President's wounds.There was no autopsy done at Parkland Hospital because the body was taken away by Feds and taken back to Washington,where an autopsy was carried out many,many hours later.The whys and wherefores of this is covered in the book and in many other books,etc.What is different here is that Dr.Crenshaw,felt he could no longer remain silent about what he saw as wounds as they tried to save his life and what was reported and accepted by the Warren Commission.Dr.Crenshaw unequivocally maintains there was one or more bullet entries in the front of the skull and a large section of the right rear of the skull had been destroyed by an exit of the bullet.If the skull and other evidence is still available it should still be possible to determine if the Doctor was right. Much has been said about the autopsy in Washington and the state of the evidence.Furthermore ,there has been a 75 year freeze put on access to the evidence and investigations.Dr.Crenshaw died in 2001 .At least he is on record for what wounds he saw to the President.One day,it may be resolved,and if Dr.Crenshaws assertations are confirmed to be true;that being there was a frontal bullet entry,then the murder of JFK was a conspiracy;and at the highest level of power in the US Government.A very interesting read."},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"I appreciate this personal detailed account of Dr. Crenshaw's personal experience in the assassination of President Kennedy.

The story was a good read, though I don't know why he needed to use swear words like &#34;g-- d----&#34; in it, as it added nothing to the story and served only make Dr. C. look unprofessional on that point. The medical cover up was sad! LBJ himself calling the emergency room to put in his request for a death bed confession of Oswald was sinister. Evil is the word to describe the medical coverup. I was glad that he told his story before dying, but disappointed that he didn't tell it at the time of the event; yes he would would have lost his career and possibly been killed, but it would've been a courageous thing to do. Jean Hill in &#34;The Last Dissenting Witness&#34; displayed such courage. I'm not sure what I would've done; it was a frightening and confusing time.The US democratic system has not recovered from the coup d'&eacute;tat of November 22, 1963.

Gary Waltrip doesn't have to rewrite the laws of physics to explain why Kennedy's head snapped backwards when shot from behind -- two different researchers proved that is exactly what happens because of the jet effect of materials blown out the front. One researcher shot watermelons off of fence posts, and everyone of them fell off TOWARDS the rifle, not away from them. Another researcher did the same thing with 5 gallon cans filled with water. Furthermore, the computer enhancement of the Zapruder filsm shows Kennedy's head moving forward very rapidly BEFORE it snaps backwards with the jet effect. This is a great example of how the conspiracy buffs don't even know the most basic facts about the assassination."},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"From a European perspective there is nothing new in the fact that John F. Kennedy was murdered by several assassins and that several shots were fired from the front - at least that is what I was taught at school in the seventies, with the cautionary remark that Americans were too naive to be able to accept the truth - the truth being not only the facts of the JFK murder but the much more sinister fact that they were lied at by several successive governments, by the CIA, the FBI, and almost all their mass media. Maybe it was easier to see this truth from a continent that had been ravaged by a horrible war where unbelievable atrocities had been committed in the name of governments. Maybe it was easier because the European nations had had more than their share of \\"Tyrannenmord\\" in the past. When I grew up during the \\"Cold War\\" I actually did not see that much difference between the Soviet government and the U.S. government. They used somewhat different methods to hush up their dirty secrets but they were both effective up to a point.Apart from the simple facts which one of the eye-witnesses at last discloses this book strikes me most by the effect it had in its first edition. What is most strange and not a little frightening is the way the American media still dictate the people what to believe and what not. Even now, 40 years after, they are still trying to hide the truth, to distort what cannot be hidden, to spread disinformation, to influence or discredit witnesses, and in this case to shed doubt on the reliability and the reputation of a distinguished surgeon. In an unprecedented act of defamation a scientific(!) journal, the \\"Journal of the American Medical Association\\" (JAMA) called Dr Crenshaw's book \\"a fabrication\\". Crenshaw sued for \\"slander with malice\\" and won in court but the damage to his reputation cannot be undone.

Research his background and you can come to your own conclusion on his motivations.In closing, I will paraphrase Fletcher Prouty: \\"A cover story is like a balloon. It is not necessary to pierce it with dozens of needles to deflate it. Only a single needle will do.\\" Charles Crenshaw provides a single needle with this book. The wounds in the autopsy photos are not those he saw when treating Kennedy moments after the shooting. Thus you have a conspiracy. It's that simple.

His story is corroborated by others who were also present. Initially, critics claimed Crenshaw did not receive a phone call from LBJ while Oswald was on the operating table. A Parkland hospital telephone operator has since supported the fact that a call did come in from LBJ and it was transferred to the room where Oswald lay. In this phone call, LBJ attempted to coerce Crenshaw into \\"hearing a deathbed confession\\" from Oswald that he killed JFK.

Dr. Kemp Clark a neurosurgeon believed the wound initially was a \\" tangential wound\\" and has not commented specifically since as far as I know. At Bethesda Naval Hospital several of the hands on eyewitnessess Jerrol Custer the X-Ray Tech, James Jenkins, one of the naval corpsman who was assisting the Autopsy, were certain of a frontal entry, and James Sibert an FBI Agent is open to a frontal shot according to a recent book In The Eye Of History.As far as the throat wound there isn't one Parkland witness in the historical record until the time of the Warren Commission who is even suggesting that this most controversial wound appears to be an exit wound... So, what the good doctor was saying was not far fetched."},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"There is little question in determining the honesty of a writer, and Dr. Crenshaw's account is that of a man who simply tells what he saw. His critics on the other hand go around and around, snarl the subject in a ball of confusion and then draw conclusions no rational man would ever forward.Trauma Room One is one of the best, most concise books on the Kennedy murder. It isn't just about the medical side; it's a great assassination overview and offers a number of possibilities that other books have not covered, including beautiful reasoning to counter the conniving speculation found in the Warren Report.While Trauma Room One reveals the medical shenanigans perpetrated by the Naval doctors and even the cowards among his own team, Groden's DVD showed the most irrefutable evidence of conspiracy: the acoustics test of the police microphone tape proving the head shot was fired from a position closest to the president. As the limo was traveling away from the depository, there is no question.Now, why don't we storm the bastille and get some answers?"},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"Everytime I think I've seen and heard it all, one book comes along to prove me wrong...and this is that book. &quot;Trauma Room One&quot; is a terrific work of schorlarly writing and research: Drs. Crenshaw, Wecht, and Aguilar are to be commended for groundbreaking new information on the medical aspects of President Kennedy's death. I am very, very impressed. In fact, I've reread the book three times so far! Get it!"},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"Dr. Crenshaw was a resident in the Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on the day in 1963 when President Kennedy was brought in mortally wounded. Dr. Crenshaw assisted in providing emergency care to Kennedy and was present when Kennedy was pronounced dead. Crenshaw saw the wounds on Kennedy's body in Dallas and makes a significant contribution to the Kennedy Assassination lore by describing them. Crenshaw saw a bullet entry wound on the front of Kennedy's neck (that was later obliterated by a tracheotomy incision) and also saw a large gaping exit wound on the occipital skull. Those are 'fighting words' to Oswald fans because they were inflicted by shots from the front, and Oswald could have only shot from the rear. Dr. Crenshaw generally provides an excellent first-person account of the goings-on at Parkland Hospital on that terrible day, including the confrontation at gunpoint between the Secret Service Agents who were attempting to leave with the body and the coroner who was attempting to retain possession of the body long enough to perform an autopsy. Needless to say, the Secret Service agents with their drawn weapons won the day and the body was whisked away to Air Force One where new-President Johnson could keep tabs on it on the way back to Washington DC. Crenshaw's account of the confrontation is highly-entertaining readings. This book is a groundbreaking book that is required reading for anyone interested in the historical aspects of the Kennedy Assassination."},{"Title":"Trauma Room One: The JFK Medical Coverup Exposed","review":"If you want to know what things looked like from the inside,at Parkland Hospital, this is the book. Dr. Crenshaw, a citizen of Texas,does the good citizen's of Texas proud by telling all he saw of thisGod Awfull conspiracy; right down to the phone call Dr. Crenshaw took, in the ER from LBJ,asking him to get a death bed confession from Lee Oswald. It's too bad that thepeople of the United States cannot view the insane final confessions to all thekillings that LBJ made to his doctor, hidden behind Dr / patient confidentiality."},{"Title":"Command Under Sail: Makers of the American Naval Tradition, 1775-1850","review":"This book covers the period of US history from 1775 to 1850 and it's primary subject centers about 12 officers of the US Navy. Each one of these individuals were the ones that laid the very foundation of what the the US Navy is today.The most interesting thing about the book is that there are 12 seperate authors, not one. In addition, at the conclusion of each chapter (which covers the life of each seperate officer) there is a rather healthy listing of additional references.The beauty of the book is that each naval officer, who is a hero in the best of naval traditions, is described with all the laurels and warts of a human being. Their professional knowledge, attitudes towards their fellow officers and the men that served under them, their skill as diplomats and their families is very well described.For those who have either served a career in the nations sea going service or are just plain history buffs, the investment in this book is worth while. A splendid addtion to any ones library.Richard Detjen USNA, Class 1958."},{"Title":"Ruby the Copycat (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"I am 13 years old and I remember that Ruby the Copycat was the first real book I have ever read on my own.

Some reviewers seem to think that kids need the complexity of Dickens in their story plots, but what seems &quot;forced&quot; and &quot;pat&quot; to one reader seems neat and effective to this one.

Ruby's need for adult guidance seems realistic to me."},{"Title":"Ruby the Copycat (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"I have mixed feelings regarding this book. On the one hand the book is funny and deals with a real life problem of kindergarden and primary school children (\\"he is a copycat\\" is a regular accusation at my house). However, reading this story after reading Peggy Rathmann's three other books: \\"Gorilla\\", \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria\\" and \\"Ten minutes till bedtime\\" is a little disappointing. The three books mentioned are totally hilarious and I feel they are all unique and special works of art. This book however, although very good, does not come to their masterpiece level.\\"Ruby the Copycat\\" is written with a neutral voice without \\"taking sides\\" - just telling the story as it is. Reader can understand both Ruby, the copycat, and in a way even understand why she is copying (Ruby is the new kid and Angela's ribbon is so very charming) but also see the point of view of those being copied - as Angela, whose every act (red ribbon in hair, rainbow painted shirt) is copied by Ruby. At first this is nice and Angela whispers back at Ruby \\"I like your ribbon\\" - but after a while Angela does not whisper any more... Ruby is stripping her of all individuality. These are an adult words but the book is written in a language every child can understand and the pictures are there to strengthen the words. Ruby wins the readers heart in the end when following the teacher's advice (don't we all wish for such teachers) finds her own unique \\"thing\\" and now the children copy Ruby's \\"hopping\\"."},{"Title":"Ruby the Copycat (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"When I was 9 years old, I read this book at a daycare where I stayed. I read it every single day. One day, I remembered it, after forgetting for years, and came here to amazon.com. I was overjoyed to learn that yes, they had this book.

This is a story of empathy and sincerity that every child and adult can relate to. Highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Ruby the Copycat (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"I always panic when I check out on Amazon great books of my daughter's and see that they have not been reviewed in a while...it's almost like I have to voice my OCD-opinion so that someone at a publishing house will possibly notice and declare: \\"Let's reissue that copycat book by Rathmann!\\". Plus, I always have to state my take on reviews left by others that I deem possibly detrimental to a great product (yes, I know that I can comment on reviews on a whole separate \\"page\\", but who the heck really looks at that stuff?. And yes, I know that I am obsessed with reviews in general). By now, you probably get the gist of Ruby's story via reading the previous reviews, so I don't have to go into all of that. I was just suprised by two past reviewers (both of whom gave \\"Ruby\\" a good number of stars) and what they had to say about the psychology of \\"Ruby\\". One reviewer states that Ruby \\"is stripping her (Angela) of all her individuality\\". I just feel that this view on Ruby's actions is a little too strong. This is common grade school stuff, and not a scenario from a prisoner-of-war camp. The other reviewer stated that Ruby/kids \\"need to be taught values\\"...since when is not copying the fashion of others a value? I thought that telling the truth, sticking up for friends, and being nice to others in general were the main chapters in a parent's values-to-be-passed-on handbook, but I guess times have changed for the worse. My daughter has copied her peers (possible reason for her short Hello Kitty phase which ended recently) and has been copied by her peers (someone copied her drawing, which I will admit is a little more serious than copying another's fashions because art, like Angela's poem, is from one's soul). You know what? Short-lived copycatiness on both ends will occur again in the future, and life goes on. My daughter will never admit if she is copying another girl, and I do stress to her the importance of being different and of trying to be flattered when she is copied. I will whip out this book the next time that she mentions this girl at her school that carries a purse everywhere at the tender age of seven, or when she accuses her little sister of copying her every mode. It's a terrific book which expresses simply the beauty of being one's self."},{"Title":"Ruby the Copycat (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"This book has a wonderful message about being yourself.

As with most books, this one would be well complemented by certain others,especially given the vast array of results and approaches to the field.It is true that Lang includes few examples. He also does not treat in any detail topics such as the fundamental domain of the actions of the various groups of transformations. For the latter topic, Serre's text 'A course in arithmetic' is an excellent introduction. The most complete reference on the various aspects of the congruence subgroups of \\\\Tau may be Shimura's book 'Arithmetic theory of automorphic functions'; Shimura's text includes much more, for instance, on Zeta-functions, elliptic curves, and abelian varieties. As for Hecke operators, an excellent reference is the seminal paper by Atkin and Lehner, 'Hecke operators on \\\\Tau_0(N)'.For examples of computations with modular forms, I recommend looking at Cremona's book 'Algorithms for modular elliptic curves'. Another excellent reference is William A. Stein's forthcoming 'Modular forms : a computational approach'. Stein's text deals with algorithms and computations of modular forms via modular symbols (of arbitrary weight) using the open source computer algebra system SAGE.Despite this plethora of references, I would commend Lang's book as one of the cleanest developments of the basic theory, assuming some prior background."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modular Forms (Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften)","review":"I'm not sure who could benefit from readingthis book.

However, this book shows how ephedra is just the tip of the iceberg. If the pharmaceutical industry and their allies in Congress can crush ephedra with nothing more than anecdotal evidence is any supplement safe? Today ephedra--tomorrow Vitamin C!!!! This is a great book to read to understand the issue."},{"Title":"Ephedra Fact and Fiction: How Politics, the Press and Special Interests are Targeting Your Rights to Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs","review":"I have been taking Ephedra for three years now and have followed the label requirements with no ill effects. I really believe this is just a way for government and pharmacuetical companies to try to restrict the rights on those who take supplements. In the book the author points out what really happens behind the scene in Washington with using the media and press to drive the fear into people who want to take Ephedra. ANYONE who takes supplements, not just Ephedra should give this book a look since it shows that it could happen with any supplement."},{"Title":"Ephedra Fact and Fiction: How Politics, the Press and Special Interests are Targeting Your Rights to Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs","review":"I had never heard of Ephedra before reading this book.What is Ephedra? It's a Chinese Herb (ma huang), an adrenaline-like stimulant, which has been used for thousands of years. Though in the case of this book, 'ephedra' specifically refers to the synthetic alkaloids ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine (also used in widely available and legal over-the-counter cold remedies). The chemical cocktails referenced by the book were herb weight loss pills that combined Ephedra and caffeine, as sold by the Metabolife corporation and several other companies in the 1990's and early 2000's.If you google 'Ephedra' and look at the Wikipedia article, you'll read the inflated claims this book successfully debunks.The book asserts (with over 10 pages of bibliography articles in respected medical journals) that less people died from using Ephedra than from using Aspirin. That Steve Belcher died from heatstroke and pushing himself too hard (autopsy report cited), and that Korey's Stringer locker contained no Ephedra products when his family emptied it after his death (newspaper article cited). The book includes the passages of the deliberately misinterpreted RAND report (p102-9) and specifically shows how lies were told.Further, the book explains exactly what AER or Adverse Effect Reports are. The 15,000 *unscreened* reports turned over by Metabolife in the hearings included things like consumer complaints about pricing, gunshot deaths, and cases which only mentioned the word 'ephedra' without establishing causation.This book cites (p98) a prospective, two arm, six month, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical safety trial conducted at two sites which appeared in the 2002 edition of the Journal of Obesity. It involved about 200 people. One of the co-authors was once a professor at Harvard Medical School. The conclusion was Ephedra was safe and helped weight loss at 3 additional pounds per month when taken properly with exercise and a fat controlled diet. As a medical journalist the author calls this an unbiased study with 'a scientific gold standard'. He later states bigger studies like this are needed to conclusively show Ephedra is not dangerous (they have never been funded).While the supplements industry did spend $4 million lobbying for their product, the big-pharma industry spent over seven times that, $30 million, getting the product banned (charts p158-161). Why? It is cheaper and perhaps better than (their) weight loss drugs also on the market. The supplement industry makes low billions of dollars, and pharma (worth hundred of billions) wants a piece of it. Chapter six explores industry PR techniques and chapter seven is about how pharma develops drugs at taxpayer expense. While interesting, they had little to do with Ephedra, other than highlight how powerful industry opposition is. Chapter eight shows how much of a farce the congressional hearing were, but is on the boring side.Supplements Under Siege: Inside the Conspiracy to Take Away Your Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbsby this same author examines Pharma's influence in detail.Five stars because the premise of the book is spot on, and the arguments are well documented, well supported, and make sense. This book has convinced me Ephedra is not a dangerous product and was only banned because of industry lobbying. The reason for this lobbying was that Ephedra's results were equal to or surpassed more expensive diet drugs owned by big pharma. I currently have no desire to take Ephedra or other weight loss remedies."},{"Title":"Intransitive Predication (Oxford Studies in Typology and Linguistic Theory)","review":"Those who have studied some foreign languages will be aware that in many languages adjectives and even predicate nouns can have the same structures that in english are considered \\"verbal\\". In languages such as Arabic, by contrast, adjectives are totally like nouns to the extent of taking definite articles. Students who have studiedBasqueorHindiwill wonder at the absence of the simple verb forms.In \\"Intransitive Predication\\", author Leon Stassen takes the mask off the mysteries behind these differences in a remarkably complete manner. Stassen first explains with a clarity I have never seen in any other linguistics book what the predicate categories he is describing are, and then with equal efficiency compares and defines the three strategies that can be used for intransitive predicates: the verbal strategy, the nominal strategy and the locational strategy. These depend on in the first case absence of a support item, in the second case on a fully suppletive \\"copula\\" (which in many languages is not a verb) and in the third case on a support verb. Stassen also defines the patterns in terms of negation, so that for instance the suffixes for \\"to be\\" a student ofTurkishmay know are actually not verbal at all because their negation is different from a \\"proper\\" verb.After this, Stassen looks at how these three strategies can be combined to encode five different classes of intransitive predicate, namely event predicates, property-concept predicates, class membership predicates, identity predicates (\\"this is my wife\\") and locational predicates (\\"the post office at the end of the street\\"). He shows that there is a very clear and easy-to-understand hierarchy behind how these five predicate types are encoded, so that there can be no more than sixteen actually possible patterns.Next Stassen discusses with very easy-to-understand examples cases of each potential pattern. the examples, using familiar linguistic notation that is far from incomprehensible though for the merely curious. After that, Stassen looks at the concept of \\"switching\\" whereby a predicate category can be encoded by more than one strategy. Because switching is a very common phenomenon, it has to be discussed in detail, and this Stassen does very well. He shows that there are several types of switching, which can either be split by subcategories of the predicate or by the critical category of permanence. Permanence leads to the use of the most time-stable category possible, which is nominal or verbal depending on whether the language is tensed. This notion of \\"tensedness\\" is the decisive factor in the extent to which languages use the verbal strategy, because it is impossible for a language have tensed property-concept words as it is non-iconic. Thus, Stassen shows clearly how highly tensed languages like those of the many Papuan and more northwesterly Amazonian families have nouny adjectives usually encoded by a zero copula. In contrast, languages without obligatory bound tense marking like Chinese or Vietnamese or Yoruba have verby adjectives, as do most of the polysynthetic indigenous languages of North America and southeastern South America.Lastly, Stassen ties his vast body of research together into a \\"predicate space\\" analogous to the \\"vowel space\\" ofIan Maddieson. This \\"predicate space\\" allows one, together with the \\"tensedness\\" parameter, to see why languages' \\"verbal systems\\" work as they do. It explains extremely simply the curious fact that languages with nouny adjectives have shared nominal and locational predication and those with verby adjectives split encoding.All in all, \\"Intransitive Predication\\" must stand as one of the best works for the general linguistic student. It is epic is scope yet by no means hard to read, and the examples it provides are so many and so clear that the reader is left knowing everything (s)he must. It is no wonder this book was a critical component of theWALSatlas."},{"Title":"JOSEPH SMITH BEGINS HIS WORK - VOL 1 - Book of Mormon 1830 FIrst Edition Reproduced from uncut sheets","review":"This was for a class that my husband is taking online so I cannot review it at this time."},{"Title":"The Loudest Scream (Fear Street: Fear Park, No. 2)","review":"I think all 3 books on The House Of Fear, First, Second and Third Horror are superb.

According to the introduction by William L. Andrews in the Signet Classic edition of the novel, &quot;Sport&quot; first appeared in &quot;Lippincott's&quot; magazine in 1901 and was published in book form a year later.After a disturbing turn of events, the Hamilton family leaves their home in the southern U.S. and makes their way to New York City, where they try to start a new life. But the pressures of urban life have serious consequences for each member of the family.&quot;Sport&quot; is a story about injustice, innocence, and temptation. As he follows this family's story, Dunbar looks at many different relationships: parent/child, husband/wife, black/white, etc. Particularly interesting is his look at the relationship between the media reporter and those who are the object of media reports. The book also presents an ironic view of artists and their connection to larger society.&quot;Sport&quot; is a dark, moralistic tale. Although the characterizations are fairly shallow, Dunbar's narrative moves along effectively. I actually found the most intriguing character to be Skaggs, a white reporter for a &quot;yellow&quot; newspaper. This novel serves as an ironic complement to those slave autobiographies (such as the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;) which depict a flight to the north as a liberating experience; the north in &quot;Sport&quot; is a cold, amoral place full of dangers for black people. Overall, this is a compelling book that I regard as a significant milestone in African-American literature."},{"Title":"Sport of the Gods (Signet Classics)","review":"Please disregard the comments on the review below. To begin with, &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot; is not a commentary on the mid 90's! It is a novel from the early 20th century about the hardships of the negro race in the northern urban areas (NY in this case). The novel is a bit harsh in its depiction of prejudice but that is precisely what makes it most compelling. The lack of hope presented in it is a social commentary about both the white and the black trying to rise up from slavery. In general the book is excellent, sad at some points, funny at others, but mainly it is one of the jewels of American literature which needs to be read by all regardless of ethnicity."},{"Title":"Sport of the Gods (Signet Classics)","review":"Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872 -- 1906)is best remembered as a poet. He wrote in both dialect and formal English. His famous poems include \\"We wear the mask\\", \\"Sympathy\\", which includes the line \\"I know why the caged bird sings\\", and \\"Frederick Douglass\\". Dunbar wrote prolifically during his short life, with an output that included essays, journalism, plays, short stories as well as poetry. Dunbar was also a novelist. His final effort in this form \\"The Sport of the Gods\\" (1902) remains an impressive work, a minor classic of American literature.Dunbar's novel describes the fate of an African American family, the Hamiltons, which is forced to move from its home in the deep South (the particular State is not named) to New York City. The Hamiltons had seemingly achieved a degree of success and stability in the post-Civil War South. The father, Berry, had worked as a butler for a prosperous plantation owner, Oakley, for many years. Berry had lived frugally, and managed to save money. His wife, Fannie, also had a good job working as a housekeeper for the Oakleys. The couple had two children, Joe, 18, a barber to white people who had become a dandy, and Kitty, 16, her mother's darling. The peaceful life of the family comes to a startling end when Oakley falsely accuses Berry Hamilton of stealing. Berry is sentenced to ten years in prison. His family is ostracized by whites and blacks alike. Fannie, Joe, and Kitty move to New York City to find a new life for themselves.The heart of this novel lies in Dunbar's descriptions of the underside of New York City life -- the hustlers, bars, tawdry shows, raw music, and loose women -- that spell doom to the newcomers from the South. Much of the action takes place in a nightclub called \\"The Banner\\", frequented by African Americans and by a class of whites who, then as in later times, practiced what is now termed \\"slumming\\". Dunbar has no affection or sentimenality for \\"The Banner\\" or its ilk. He writes: \\"[O]f course, the place was a social cesspool, generating a poisonous miasma and reeking with the stench of decayed and rotten moralities. There is no defense to be made for it. But what do you expect when false idealism and fevered ambition come face to face with catering cupidity?\\" Some of the frequenters of the banner include a con-man and raconteur named Sadness, the best-drawn character in Dunbar's book, a chorus girl named Hattie, and William Thomas, a railway worker with designs on young Kitty.The destruction of the Hamilton family proceeds naturally and inexorably in this environment and becomes \\"The Sport of the Gods\\". Joe quickly takes to drink and becomes involved with Hattie. When she puts him out, Joe kills her and is sentenced to prison. Kitty succumbs to Thomas's advances and ultimately finds herself working in a vulgar chorus line. Fannie is persuaded by a gambler and criminal that her husband's long imprisonment is equivalent to a divorce. She marries him and endures and abusive relationship.For all his negativity towards it, Dunbar offers an effective portrayal of early African American life in New York City, particularly its music. For the most part, the book is written in a bleak, naturalistic tone which reminded me of Stephen Crane's \\"Maggie\\", a somewhat earlier work about the effect of a slum environment in the destruction of lives. After Joe's imprisonment, the patrons of \\"The Banner\\", including Sadness, reflect upon his fate and upon the fate of young Southern blacks moving to New York:\\"This was but for an hour, for even while they exclaimed they knew that there was no way, and that the stream of young negro life would continue to flow up from the South, dashing itself against the hard necessities of the city and breaking like waves against a rock, -- that until the gods grew tired of their cruel sport, there must still be sacrifices to false ideals and unreal ambitions.\\"Readers looking for high-quality writing that remains somewhat off-the- beaten path should explore Dunbar and this novel. He remains an author worth remembering and reading. \\"The Sport of the Gods\\" raises themes that would be developed in American literature throughout the 20th Century, especially in works written by African Americans. It is a short, bleak and effective novel by an American poet.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Sport of the Gods (Signet Classics)","review":"Have you ever wanted to yell out to the heroes of your favorite movie \\"DON'T DO THAT YOU IDIOT!!\\"? This book is sometimes frustrating because you, the reader, can see where the plot is going and want so badly to help the story's characters avoid what seems to be the inevitable. A naturalistic picture of life, and an often-missed text which deserves more attention. It doesn't make you feel good-- but it does make you want to be sure that people have choices, that this sort of thing isn't allowed to happen, that life isn't a series of \\"sport\\" that the gods (a vindictive type of gods) play with us.

I wanted the class to read a novel that could be read in a relatively short period of time and would be easy to follow. I first read Dunbar's The Sport of the Gods my first year of grad school.

A good choice for literature courses or for personal reading."},{"Title":"Sport of the Gods (Signet Classics)","review":"I need to say that I read the latter portion of this book from the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Reader. I really enjoyed this story even though it was quite melancholy. The story of a falsely accused butler, Berry Hamilton, stealing money from his Southern employer, Maurice Oakley. Of course Hamilton was sent to jail without much of a thought and his family had to leave town.The family which consisted of Fannie(wife), Kit(daughter), and Joe(son) all made their way north to New York. When they arrived they were immediately confronted with the smooth talkers and wonders of the city. Fannie tried to keep somewhat of a grip on her children but it soon wilted. The \\"city\\" had much more appeal than Fannie's moral cautions. Fannie lost her grip on Joe first. The Banner Club and it's patrons feed his strong desire to fit in with the City. Kit's appetite for the stage blinded her relationship with her mother. They all soon forgot about Berry being in prison. Skagg's a Banner patron that had befriended Joe sought out to find a story and found the truth.The story is about how unfortunate circumstances and how the refuge of a new city ate away at a family like a parasite. The book ended in tragedy and redemption. Dunbar is so gentle with his characters. His gentleness makes the tragedy go down a little easier."},{"Title":"Sport of the Gods (Signet Classics)","review":"My point being if we're going to require our nation's youth to read Huckleberry Finn in public schools, it is a shame that this book is often left off of the course syllabus.

Therefore it is a must that those who study or teach from these sources have a good understanding of the context within which they were written, but enough of my rambling... This book deals with religious and philisophical beliefs of Christians and Pagans alike in Collosae and the surrounding cities. The arguments presented are well thought out and the evidence is meticulously presented (while this is a good thing from an academic point of view, it can put you to sleep real fast). I highly recommend this because it is extremely informative about aspects of life in Paul's day that were familiar to people that Paul wrote to, but rather foreign to us today. This book has provided me with a deeper insight into Colossians and all of Paul's letter. Any serious teacher of religion, Sunday School, etc. should read this and I guarantee that your presentations of Paul's letters will be the better for it. One other point is that if you are considering getting this book, get it right away. I've learned that book's of this nature (though potentially beneficial to many) have a limited audience and typically go out-of-print or become otherwise unavailable."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"This is an excellent book to get to know the basics of PTSD as well as treatments and steps for therapy.

I experienced the impact of PTSD from a very early age, but it went untreated until I was in my early 20's. This book has a very in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the symptoms of PTSD, the causes, and has a sensitive introduction to many aspects of healing and healing options from PTSD caused by many different traumas (including sexual child abuse, rape, and violence). This is a very balanced book that talks comprehensively about depression, anxiety, triggers, intimacy and everything that happens to survivors of trauma. Over the years of my healing I have been able to turn to this book again and again.The book talks about being a victim, survivor, thriver and helps trauma survivors to learn how to break free of the trauma and live a healthy life emotionally, mentally, physically.Ultimately we will all find our own way to healing, but it always helps to be educated and to receive support. This book is very in-depth and well rounded with many healing options to consider such as writing about our traumatic experiences, and meditation to name just a few (many of these healing options were helpful to me). I often go back to this book for support when difficult emotions such as anger, grief, or trauma triggers re-surface (sometimes reading it in the middle of the night when I can't sleep). As the years go by my PTSD has improved significantly and does not intrude upon my life as much. However, it does not go away and I have continued to experience physical problems as a result of the long term impact of the post traumatic stress. I have grown accustomed to withstanding (and I suppose ignoring) the stress, but it ends up resulting in physical problems. So, I have found that I must manage the stress whether I think I need to or not. Going back again and again to read up on skills for reducing the triggered stress as been incredibly helpful to me. When it comes to PTSD we really are on our own. No one can really help us because the stress is happening within us. So, it is up to us to take the steps to learn how to manage the internal stress. It's not an easy task, but it is very much worth it and it greatly improves our quality of life."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"Have been with PTSD for 7 years now. When I came across Dr. Schiraldis book on this very site, I didn't know what I was in for! - Most precise and compassionate information, so much help I'd never dreamed of, and the best possible of tools to learn how to cope - how to live with PTSD, and to start overcome it.I'll never forget how chapter one begins, \\"PTDS results form exposure to an overwhelmingly stressful event or series of events.... It is a normal response by normal people to an abnormal situation\\". How I needed to hear that! While everybody thought I'd gone mad, including myself.Later, I told my shrink about this phenomenal book, I said to her: \\"Finally, a \\"user's manual - a book for the man on the floor\\"... and she'd laugh and comment that I must have gotten somewhere, saying that!Now - dear Mr. Shiraldi, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I have suffered multiple traumas in my life: This book has been an excellent supplement to my therapy. It has helped me see fully realize the extent of my symptoms and also to see how the secondary symptoms have affected my relationships with others and thus gain perspective on much of the criticism I have endured through the years from colleagues and peers. PTSD affects all areas of the sufferer's life, including interpersonal relationships, school, the workplace, and the home. I am only now understanding how my PTSD has affected my life, and beginning to get a glimpse of a more positive future ahead. Futhermore, it has helped me to see that a positive support system is essential to recovery, and I do not have that within my family, so it will have to be cultivated from my friends. I also highly recommend this book for its straight forward, no nonsense style.

I was not disappointed.Even among my Vietnam Vet friends, who range from Marines and combat medics to Army Nurses and Red Cross Donut Dollies, there is a great deal of variation in how they experience PTSD.As many of the non-Vet readers will know, trauma is trauma, whether it is combat-related or not, and this book approaches it in that way.One Vietnam Vet friend who worked on the IWCS system in Thailand (troposcatter long haul communications) suffers from PTSD, even though his support role to the Vietnam-based forces technically kept him out of harm's way.Whether you are interested in self-healing or in understanding the pain of others close to you, this book is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"Dr. Schiraldi has a gift for making this very complex condition simple to understand.

The good times just keep on coming. For post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) victims, things also go on forever. Over and over, they mentally relive their most traumatic experiences in a continuing nightmare. PTSD is insidious. First you are the victim of severe, unspeakable trauma. Then, like a ghost, the trauma comes back to haunt you. Many associate PTSD only with combat veterans. However, almost any severe, stressful event can cause PTSD, be it rape or assault, abuse, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or an accident. PTSD is a deadly, serious problem that plagues its victims. Fortunately, it does not have to be a life sentence. Treatment is available and recovery is possible, as Glenn R.

I have recommended it to people who have the diagnosis but also to anyone who has or knows someone with a mental illness of any type because much of the information is widely applicable, although what he writes about PTSD is invaluable.

Now I know that my reaction to the very abnormal is normal, I feel better already. I have a lot of work to do, but relief comes slowly and in small steps. I give this a definite, huge thumbs up and five-star rating."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"Very practical, thorough and well thought out.

It is an organic disturbance in the mind and the nervous system, and there are ways to live with it.As the suicide rate for returning veterans continues to climb (and to be unreported by media), PTSD is going to continue to be a public health issue, as will its treatment.

There are so many great techniques and explanations included that are in real english and easy to read and understand. I wish I could have found it a year ago!"},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"This book may well become the best friend of every person recovering from PTSD. I frequently find myself turning to this book for direction and comfort when the symptoms become overwhelming. It is a powerfully effective tool against the panic and feelings of isolation that I face as a person with PTSD. The clear, concise explanations, acceptance of the reality of these symptoms, and specific instructions and suggestions for professional and self-treatment, organized in an easy-to-read format, have proven invaluable in my own recovery. Glenn has taken the fear and confusion of PTSD and turned it into an understandable and manageable situation. I would recommend this book to anyone suffering from PTSD. It may save your life, and will certainly save your sanity. I can't say enough good things about it. It has, truly, changed my life."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"I purchased the e-book version and I found myself looking forward to reading it. I found it gives you sense of security ie. it helps you identify and name what you are going through, but most of all I found this book effective as if in front of a therapist.(it will not substitute him/her) but it gives you a lot of insight and help when most you need.I found that slowly I was looking forward to another day without going around with this immense sense of guilt and sadness after being constantly abused by my ex husband.This book has honestly given me back the joy and meaning to my life. I can plan ahead now and most of all it is teaching me how to take care of myself first. I am finding my self esteem is slowly but surely going back on track which is amazing.I would honestly recommend this book to anyone, before even trying to buy any other workbook that there is out there in the market. The reason I say this because it really lays down the basics one needs to know what goes on inside you when you suffer from PTSD.Hope other people will find this book as life saving as I did!"},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"Issued ten years ago, the first edition of Schiraldi's PTSD Sourcebook became (at least over time) the \\"industry standard\\" orientation text for new counselors and therapists in the VA Healthcare System. Then, as now, it was both comprehensive and easy to understand.I wondered (in about 2000 or 2001) why it wasn't used as a complete \\"patient education\\" piece, but over time, I came to understand that the VA is =very= conservative about such matters. With good reason, at least in some respects: There was material in the first edition that was surely capable of triggering PTSD symptoms in readers who had not yet progressed far enough in therapy to defend against such triggering.While not a substantial revision of the original, the second edition does add a number of simplified descriptions of therapeutic techniques as well as mentions here and there of newer efficacy research to support these and previously included methods. That said, the second edition continues to be the single best, mass-market text available for understanding PTSD's causes and conditions, as well as doing something meaningful about it.With regard to the controversy over triggering, my suggestion is simply that while PTSD sufferers with denser, more primitive ego defenses (e.g.: dissociation, rage, nihilistic depressive orientation) require some work before tackling a book like this, most sufferers - and family members alike - will be hugely rewarded for diving in here. Schiraldi's book is \\"practical\\" and \\"hands-on,\\" as opposed to \\"heavily neurobiological\\" or \\"interactionally theoretical.\\"This is not Bessel van der Kolk's (wonderful) =Traumatic Stress= or even Matthew Friedman's terrific little =Post-Traumatic and Acute Stress Disorders=. But, as a clinician, I found it (once again) to be a very effective re-orientation toward discussing PTSD and its component issues =with= those who are neither neuropsychologists or theory-soaked experts on interactional traumatization, let alone psychopharmacologists.Schiraldi neatly distills the whole gamut of topics on nature and nurture, as well as stress and de-stress, into one- and two-syllable verbiage we can use to make sense of it all the same way the =patient= will have to make sense of it.Do I have issues with the book? Of course. Shiraldi does tend towards the VAHS culture's view that one size fits all here and there. And some clinicians who have not themselves worked through their all-or-nothing orientations may get the idea that the author has covered all of the possible bases. He has not. But if he tried to do so, the book would be impossibly large, as well as needlessly difficult for lay readers.That's a critique, however, that can be made of nearly any mass market book on such a complex subject. On the whole, this is a valuable and worthwhile read for clinicians and patients alike."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"This book helped me to realize that I was not crazy. I was in a car accident in 2006 where I had to helplessly watch my friend die right in front of me. I was not injured in the wreck which caused me lots of guilt. I thought my life was falling apart until I saw a therapist and a psychiatrist and learned that I was suffering from PTSD. I am still suffering from PTSD but this book is teaching me that I am not the only person who has ever gone through this and that I just might get better from this. I keep this book beside my bed and read it every night. With this book and continued therapy and medication, I hope to be able to live life again some day."},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth","review":"I have been suffering with anxiety, depression and phobias for most of my life.

I have suffered from PTSD ever since I was 7 years old and witnessed a brutal murder. One of the murderers was a relative and he threatened to kill me and the rest of my family if I ever said a word to anyone. I was so traumatized I lost the ability to speak. That was just the first of a series of traumas in my life. If this book had been available when I was younger it would have helped me to avoid so much pain .... so many mistakes ...I eventually got some excellent counseling and learned about many of the tools listed in this book. I wrote the story of my life and about all the destructive things I did to try and cope with my pain. It ends with my journey to wholeness and healing.

Of particular interest to me is Chapter 23 entitled Thought Field Therapy. While little is known of this technique in some therapuetic circles, TFT or 'psycholocial acupuncture' is currently being used to successfully treat sufferers of PTSD in places like Rwanda.If readers of this book try this technique for themselves by closely following the simple steps as described in Chapter 23, it is likely they will find relief from stress and anxiety.I highly recommend this excellent book for the inclusion of this groundbreaking technique alone."},{"Title":"Cryptography: An Introduction to Computer Security (Advances in Computer Science Series)","review":"Cryptography is a fascinating and important subject; so is computer security. But as all of us know who have suffered from breaches of computer security, cryptography, although a useful tool, is only one small aspect of computer security. This book is quite a nice book on cryptography, although not the best; I recommend Bruce Schneier's book and Alan Konheim's book as better texts on cryptography for anyone seriously interested in cryptography. However, the relationship of this book to the subject of computer security is sort of like that of a book on padlocks to the care and protection of racehorses.Unfortunately, there is no book I know of that gives adequate treatment even to the role of cryptography in computer security, let alone to the entire subject of computer security, so we learn the hard way, from our mistakes. The only book I know that places this topic in proper perspective is &quot;Cryptography's Role In Securing The Information Society&quot; created in 1996 by the Computer Science and Technology Board of the National Research Council, and published by the National Academy Press. This latter book is kind of interminably boring, and it raises far more questions than it answers, but it's the best we've got; it's well balanced, and was prepared by a group of hard-bitten scientists and engineers with lots of practical experience (plenty of it bad.) So if you want to know how cryptography relates to computer security (maybe), read this latter book, not Seberry and Pieprzyck."},{"Title":"A Stricken Field","review":"While this is fiction, it is based on Gellhorn's personal experience in 1938, when she was a young reporter in Prague trying to help those fleeing the Nazis. Her Afterword to the book explains how desperate she was, after witnessing (with Hemingway) so much killing in the Spanish Civil War, to try to do something--to persuade England or the U.S. to intervene. She hoped this novel, which describes the world of foreign reports in Prague as well as the plight of the refugees, would spur someone to take action to help Czechoslovakia.

I decided to find her earlier releases and finally got my hands on her debut book, \\"What's New, Pussycat?\\"Delilah's been proposed to by her long lime live-in boyfriend. The thing is, she no longer loves him and is bored with Bradford, where she has lived all her life, and him. Delilah tries on her not-engagement ring, a copy of Princess Diana's/Kate Middleton's engagement ring, and gets it stuck on her finger. She's taken to the ER where she runs into this handsome stranger, Charlie, who gives her his card and invites her to contact him when she gets to London. Being smitten with him, she decided to chuck in her job, and leave Bradford for London. Once in London, she meets Sam and through him. Vivienne, and things start going her way. She runs into Charlie (talk about serendipity), and the dreams of Charlie being her prince charming seem to start coming true.It was a good entertaining story, but it took me some time to get involved in it. Some parts of the book were very easy to predict, some which were pleasant surprises, and parts which were a little unclear due to the inclusion of tertiary characters. I loved the Tom Jones connection. Delilah is named for his song by her mother who was a huge fan of his. The inclusion of the lyrics for \\"Delilah\\", \\"Help Yourself\\", \\"It's Not Unusual\\", and \\"What's New Pussycat?\\" is well placed and enhances the storyline. It's easy to see how Ms. Potter has improved with time and subsequent books.Happy reading! :)"},{"Title":"Canine and Feline 101: A complete guide for selecting, training, and caring for dogs and cats.","review":"As a cat breeder and cat enthusiast, I find this book to be a must have for all cat lovers.

I highly recommend this excellent collection for poetry lovers and non-poetry lovers alike."},{"Title":"Collected Poems: 1953-1993","review":"A poem is a poem is a poem, right? Wrong. At least to me poetry is something that comes from within, something that's born perfect, something that doesn't need the craftsman. I know I'll draw a lot of criticism from the school of thought that swears by crafted poetry, but no, that's not my cuppa.John Updike has always passed this touchstone test of mine, more so in this collection. True, not all pieces in this volume are spontaneous, but thanks to his respect for poetry, he has segregated his poems from his &quot;light verse.&quot; In his own words, &quot;In making this collection, I wanted to distinguish my poems from my light verse. My principle of segregation has been that a poem derives from the real (the given, the substantial) world and light verse from the man-made world of information - books, newspapers, words, signs. If a set of lines brought back something to me something I actually saw or felt, it was not light verse. If it took its spark from language and stylized signifiers, it was.&quot;The fact that Updike understands the thick line between poetry and prose in verse, doesn't make his poems and verses any less interesting. In fact, it adds to their character."},{"Title":"They studied man","review":"I came across this excellent book in a used bookstore while on vacation in New Hampshire. It's basically a short history of the so-called \\"Social Sciences\\" in the form of short biographical sketches of the major innovators in the field. I've had introductory college courses in Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology, so I was not completely ignorant of the subject matter here. However, I found the book easy reading and could be used as a basic introduction for someone who has no previously gleaned information. This is an old book from the early 1960s, which is one of the things that make it fascinating. First of all, there is no mention of Karl Marx! I found this very refreshing since my major complaint about all the social sciences courses I had was that they were thinly-disguised excuses to expound communist/socialist propaganda. However, there is also no mention of Max Weber! What conclusions can one draw from this? Were the social sciences free of Marxist ideology before the late 60s? Or, with the cold war still raging, were these omissions a defensive move of self-censorship? Is this a form of repression that is even worse than communist propaganda? Several of the scientists studied here (i.e., Ruth Benedict, Alfred Kroeber), while not exactly forgotten, seem to be no longer regarded as highly as they once were. Others, like Spencer, Taylor, and Fraser, are respected for their influence on others, but their actual work has been rendered essentially obsolete. Levi-Strauss had not yet become the superstar he would be only a few years later and is not mentioned. This causes one to wonder how deeply science is affected by fashion. How will the work of today's thinkers be regarded in the future? Make no mistake: the book is dated. But that very datedness is what makes the book so provocative. I also found the bibliography at the end extremely useful. Four stars."},{"Title":"How to Bead Earrings: An Artistic Approach","review":"This book teaches a technique of beading but there isn't much of a connection to earrings which is what it is supposed to be about.

The author, turning 50, his wife, and their 18-year-old daughter lived for a year in an apartment overlooking the Seine and Notre Dame.

This scholarly work by Dr. Schneider, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia, examines Fascist theories in their various phases and documents the author's first-hand observations of the new political system as implemented.The relation of Fascism to syndicalism is well illustrated. This is an important but too often misunderstood aspect of Fascism. In popular literature \\"corporatism\\" (corporativismo) is frequently confused with the modern business entity, when in fact as a species of syndicalism it means something quite different. Dr. Schneider does a nice job tracing this doctrine of industrial assemblage as it was put to work in Italy under Mussolini."},{"Title":"Hooked on Math(Multiplication) (Master the Facts, Level 3)","review":"This is OK, a little old.

The CD, on the other hand, is worth purchasing, as all the examples are much more widely discussed as in the book.The book (and the CD), of course, has mistakes. I've covered them in my review on the book (I don't want to repeat myself here so check out that session here on amazon.com).And the most important question: is this package worth its price when Core Java 3rd edition only costs you 64 bucks? Complicated question... Core Java 3rd edition is meant for 'Experienced Programmers', but I think even a beginner can understand most chapters, they're so damn well written. In comparison, Deitels' book is far too concise and does NOT cover most advanced features of the language - even the part on the I/O covers the OLD I/O library. If you take into account that Core Java discusses virtually EVERYTHING worth mentioning, this Deitel-book doesn't seem to be THAT good any more.For reviewers that complained about the low sound quality - it's really bad, but still understandable, I've never had any comprehension problem (n.b. my native language isn't English).To summarize, go for Core Java instead. It's much more comprehensive, covers much more advanced features of the language and is much cheaper. If you can't learn the basics of the language from that book, buy this one, too - and the CD as well (without the CD, this book is practically useless to beginners)."},{"Title":"Complete Java Training Course (5th Edition)","review":"After starting and putting down a dozen of the most popular \\"learn Java\\" books I have finally found a presentation that works!Not only was I not scared away by the exercises at the end of the chapters, I was actually challenged and pleased to find that I could do every coding exercise with the knowledge I had gained in that chapter.It takes time and effort but it does work!I have no prior programming experience.

They were a wonderful followup to the earlier generations of Luftwaffe camouflage and markings books, featured excellent pilot biographies, contained carefully selected and unique photos, and had amazingly good and well interpreted artwork.Circumstances took me away from these books during the intervening years, and I am just now catching up, picking and choosing the volumes that I hoped would provide the most interesting new information.Kampfflieger Volume Three, Bombers of the Luftwaffe January 1942 - September 1943 by Dr Alfred Price is only somewhat like the early volumes in the Jagdwaffe series. The writing is mostly about unit dispositions and combat operations, with much less about the participants. There is little about camouflage and markings beyond the artwork and its captions, and those leave several questions unanswered.Coverage of the Do 217 E and K bombers is generally good, although the line of thought is interrupted by a page of He 111 photos. There is probably more about the He 177 fiasco than necessary, but this section is informative and well supported by photos. The Ju 86 R-1 flights over Great Britain receive good treatment, although I am not fully convinced by the artwork showing broad yellow underwing markings. Early use of Ju 188s also gets some coverage.The first section on The Eastern Front gets only to its second page before things start to go into a steep dive. An outline template for a late Ju 88 A-4 is used to make the artwork for what is obviously an early A-4 or A-5, which is also given two colors of yellow bands, the broader of which is really not there in the photo.The matter of yellow fuselage bands on Eastern Front aircraft troubles the rest of the section. Price gives the order of battle which tells the reader which units were on the Eastern Front at which locations and times, and he tells us that units in the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front used white bands while those in the Middle and Northern Sectors used yellow bands, but the photo captions are very inconsistent in this regard, and the text does nothing to clarify the matter.Comparing a color and a black & white photo of an He 177 test aircraft on page 211 shows why. It is nearly impossible to distinguish consistently light colors (the He 177 has a white band that is lighter than the aircraft's white code letters in the color photo but darker in the b&w; photo). Contrast between the \\"yellow\\" fuselage bands with code letters and fuselage crosses is all over the place, sometimes lighter and other times darker.The order of battle and the general rule of which color band goes where are what one should be able to rely on to make a determination. Notice the He 111 photos and illustrations on pages 229, 231, and 238, then throw in any of the Mediterranean-based unit photos which definitely had white fuselage bands (but watch out for the illustration on page 254 which repeats the early A-4 or A-5 using a late A-4 template).Price's coverage continues with pretty standard fare about the Fw 200s of KG 40 and excellent photo coverage of bombers carrying Hs 293 and Fritz-X guided bombs. Price ends with a short essay concluding that Germany lacked the fuel refining capacity to sustain a strategic bomber force.This volume contains enough that is new and interesting to be of value. It is not as crew focused as the early Jagdwaffe volumes, but it does contain some human interest from Price's many years of interviews. In the final analysis, it is a good resource, but not an excellent one, simply because it is weakest on what the series title promises: Luftwaffe Colours. It takes little effort to notice that the most interesting photos, from a camouflage and markings perspective, go unillustrated and unexplained except in the most general terms. This is presumably an editor's decision and not Price's.Unfortunately, there is worse to come.

Set in Alabama, during World War I, MUSIC OF FALLING WATER exquisitely mines bitter themes of familial guilt, resentment, dashed hopes and a desperate search for the truth about the mysterious disappearance of young sister Rhoda, who one night simply vanishes, never to be heard from again. However, when human bones are discovered in the murky waters surrounding the family's old grist mill many years after Rhoda's seeming evaporation into thin air, the reader is as anxious to find the truth about their identity as are her sisters and the entire Holloway family. Julia Oliver's long awaited second novel (after the dazzling GOODBYE TO THE BUTTERMILK SKY) evokes the lush beauty of rural Alabama during the early part of the last century. In MUSIC OF FALLING WATER, she explores the complexities of family relationships which readers will most assuredly identify with. Most impressive to me, after reading MUSIC OF FALLING WATER, is the narrative's lush texture, which seems increasingly rare in modern literary fiction. This is a novel to be read slowly in order to absorb its delicate and precise details. There is genuine warmth here, which readers will savor as they immerse themselves in the lives of the deftly drawn, heartfelt characters. MUSIC OF FALLING WATER will appeal to a wide readership."},{"Title":"Music of Falling Water","review":"Not only was I intrigued by her much praised poetic style of writing (a rare find in this day &amp; age), but Oliver portrays very well the less-than-perfect famial relationships with which we can all identify. Even back in the early 1900's when things seemed pure and innocent, we can see that the same types of scandals took place and that really, nothing is new under the sun. The author sheds light on the current events and circumstances of the age and provides interesting details about a rural family's upbringing and routine. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a book you can't put down until it starts exploring the mystery of things in depth and then you are lured in by the twisted tales of family secrets which are gradually revealed. During the last half of the book things really pick up and by the end you are left feeling like you yourself are part of the Holloway family."},{"Title":"Music of Falling Water","review":"The Music of Falling Water is like a wonderful \\"new\\" Jane Austen novel. Jane Oliver is a sophisticated artist, and her stories are entertaining . I especially enjoyed her commentary about her personal and societal expectations in the age of the redefined family.As a retired English teacher, book club member, and avid-reader, I highly recommend this new book!"},{"Title":"Music of Falling Water","review":"First off, I should say that the writing is excellent. You won't have any problem following the story. As another reviewer stated, she does have a way with &quot;lush texture&quot;. I have to disagree with the statement that the reader is anxious to learn the outcome. You can pretty much tell the outcome after the first couple of chapters. The best part of the book is the end in which the everything is finally revealed, but aside from the character, you should have pretty much figured everything out long before you get to this point. If you need a book that you don't want to get too involved in and don't want to spend more than a few hours on, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"As a psychiatrist who has treated and worked with Indigenous people in both New Zealand and the United States, I can honestly say that Eduardo Duran's recent book, Healing the Soul Wound, has not only greatly influenced my way of working with Indigenous people but has changed my way of viewing the world. In this book, he artfully and intelligently weaves Native American, Jungian, and Freudian concepts and wisdom with touches of mysticism and philosophy. I found his insights into the dreamtime to be profound and extremely helpful...\\"we have lost the ability to communicate with the Sacred because our egos have become so full of themselves.\\" He goes on to say that through our dreams the Creator has found a way to get around our egos and talk to us. I was particularly struck by his thoughts on the meaning of suffering and the healing of the soul, not only of our patients, but of ourselves."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This new book by Dr. Duran includes case studies of his integrating shamanic healing techniques with traditional Western therapies. Dr. Duran's writing is intelligent, brilliant, and groundbreaking in scope and content. Though the clients he works with are Native Americans, his method is a challenge for each of us to find our mythic structures and to use them to mature the flat world view of Western materialism. Again and again his clients are struck by how familiar their work is with Dr. Duran. They literally reclaim a conscious relationship to their souls and to their mental and spiritual health. This book is a further development of his first book which was a theoretical consideration of postmodern neocolonial therapeutic models. This book actually introduces healing practices which demonstrate explicitly his theoretical viewpoint. If you read Dr. Duran's second book, \\"Buddha in Redface\\", this is what happened to the therapist in that book when he \\"grew up\\". It is a book of hope, elegance, humor, and finally of meaning."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This is a great example of the kinds of books that will actually assist in the quest for cultural competence. It is written in clear and concise language and the cultural interventions appear to be appropriate to the circumstances."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"I have to say this book is fabulous, despite the odd minor criticism. I actually brought a few things on the subject of cultural clarity to the attention of the author who was welcoming of feedback and whom showed interest in reading some of my own culture's perspective on these issues. On the whole this book does much positively in the way of challenging the status quo perspective on personal wellbeing and mental health issues in our society today. We have at large one of the most serious crises affecting our world today - that of soul loss and spiritual/cultural disenfranchisement on an epidemic scale, which is at the root, the underlying cause, of all the wars and conflicts of countless varieties on the face of the earth.Eduardo's book teaches readers much concerning the need for the psychotherapeutic/psychiatric branch of the Western medical profession to become more open to deferring expertise or knowhow to worldviews which have for decades, if not centuries, been ignored and downplayed as \\"irrational and/or unrealistic\\" in being able to offer genuine solutions to many problems in society at large today. Native cultures right across the globe have been blessed with much insight from the Creator, for at one time, all populations shared a common experience. It is a fact that now as in the more recent history, even back to the more recent ancient history that feudal hegemony in the West has had a magnitudinous effect on severing the tie between the West and the knowledge of how social structure critically influences how people within society engage with each other and the wider creation. This is not to say that Western society knows nothing about how to do this in harmony with all creation - in fact - there is much within Western philosophical ethics which does honour life and respect the rights of all in the creation to live a life of positively meaningful fulfillment. It's more that within the West's institutional structures, the main means of becoming informed lie with 'experts' who like to maintain a monopolistic position on their knowledge roles and in order to sustain this monopoly, they push the premise often that no other worldview except that which is in accordance with scientific empiricism, has any if much at all, efficacy or \\"medically proven\\" basis for being effective in problem-solving areas. This is why it is a turn for the better to see that Eduardo is doing some way-paving for the mainstream in his field and equally important is his dedication to the welfare of his own people.I have replied to the 1-star reviewer whose review was absolutely pathetic, needfuly reminding them that the author is part of the Native community and has trained in the traditional practices also! And good on those people who seriously \\"wannabe\\" more atuned to traditional ways in conjunction with the mainstream scholastic views! Eduardo Duran does well in this book to advocate for a more open-minded awareness within mainstream Western psychotherapy/psychiatry of traditional worldviews. Too often the profession sorely overlooks other paradigms or relegates them to a vague last resort should all 'medical expertise' fail, much to the detriment of many patients when these patients could have been attended to sooner and with much more success. It shouldn't be only the 'lucky few' that have access to healthier alternatives. What about all those still imprisoned within the confines of ignorant diagnostic yard-sticks? This is what he is talking about when he says cultural competency is a must for the long-standing closed-minded professions within the Western medical paradigm - this is the only way they can break through the obstinacies of theoretical dogmatism.Although this book is recommended for those involved in counselling or theraputic professions, it is really a great book for anyone interested in exploring culturally inclusive ways and means of resolving life's more perplexing challenges, for Natives and non-Natives alike. Patients and others seeking help can also benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"Duran books spark diverse feelings. I found this and his prior work superb and profound, as have years of graduate students working in the field. Its still the best book of its kind for helping those with multigenerational trauma, both with Native Americans and other victimized populations. Yet one of the reviewers above, a woman using the innovative title \\"Anonymous\\" was clearly upset by both this book and Duran's Buddha in Redface earlier contribution. A quick look at her reviews sees her self-identify as \\"of Cherokee lineage\\" but in another as a \\"non-native person like myself\\"; she reads Lara Croft books even though \\"this book sucked\\" was the verdict for one of them; she loved the movie Hidalgo and hates her coffee pot. She says she headed a behavioral health unit with Native American clients. This rare allergic reaction to Eduardo Duran's continuing contributions is notble in that it truly does symbolize the many less than competent care managers and providers who for so long misunderstood and mistreated their diverse clients; who may lack the wisdom to know what they don't know. This confusion as to identity and capacity may be threatened by the clarity and substance of Eduardo Duran's books. They may see themselves and their shortcomings in these pages and, as Hans Toch says, if the shoe fits it will hurt."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"The wisdom of the ancestors is something we lost in our society. The writer puts problems in a historic / intergenerational context. The Bible mentions this intergenerational context in a different way. Combining these approaches provides access to solutions or healing, whereby healing in the book is about harmony and balance. Looking at illnesses in this way provides new space and ways to help to cope with them, in stead of taking pills to \\"cure\\" as the only way.The book is worth reading for health professionals, people who practise family constellations, and even for organization advisors, who want to create sound organizations and sound relationships at work.A daring thought is the following: the present financial crisis is caused by some way of thinking/acting that is connected to the past, to the history of the present major decisionmakers. As the crisis can not be solved with the same consciousness that caused the crisis, it is worth trying to work with the spiritual elements described in this book, worth trying to go deep into the intergenerational context of the crisis. It takes courage to do so, I believe it is worth the effort. Our children would be delighted."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This book was referred to me and I have passed it onto my professors.

Worth more than the price. This book will challenge the non-Native counselor to explore thier own belief systems and come to appreciate the historical approach to treating Native clients."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling with American Indians and Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"Duran's first book, NA Postcolonial Psychology was a ground breaker. This most recent book offends on many levels. The idea that all native people must return to traditional ways in order to heal makes the assumption that they don't have within them or around them what they need in order to do so without some hierarchical psuedo-shamanist wannabe medicine man with a degree in clinical psychology spoon feeding them. Then, to make matters worse, traditional medicines are taught to be used by 20 years worth of psychology interns without benefit of having walked that path. Leads to multiple generations of psychologists culturally misappropriating traditional ways under the guise of \\"helping cure\\" Native people. And what's this bunk about medicine people being the ones to use drugs and alcohol because they have the \\"power\\" to do so? Not sure that has anything to do with traditional native american worldview, but may have something to do with some seriously unhealthy practices. Different native people have different practices and understanding of medicine. Making blanket pan-Indian generalizations that smack of new age ideas isn't healing. There's a certain feel of cultural voyeurism that is promoted in this book and it is not recommended. I was a Director of a behavioral health clinic within the urban American Indian population, and am a psychologist. There are many ways to promote healing in communities and among people, and many ways to train cross-culturally, and this is not a book, philosophy or trend I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Idiot's Bible: with The Other Side: My Life in Tucson (Spanish Edition)","review":"Easily a literary masterpiece.

Even better character in Erik!!!"},{"Title":"The Sacred Awakening of Light Warriors","review":"As I read 'The Sacred Awakening of Light Warriors', a lot of things started to make sense. Suddenly I understood the loneliness and disconnection that I had felt all my life; the aloneness was actually an illusion, but an experience which was essential in order to know the pain of humanity. In their teachings, The Counsel of Light gently remind us that it is necessary to know this pain so that we may fulfill our world task, a task unique for each one of us and yet always related to the healing of ourselves, one another and the Earth.The lesson which I found to be most insightful is that on 'The Gifts of The Seven Sacred Awakenings'. This gives an overview of the spiritual journey from the first faint rememberance that we are all here with a purpose, to the knowing that we are already enlightened beings, radiating love, connected to all that is and embodying this truth in every moment. It has been a source of guidance to be able to recognise as I experience the early stages of awakening in myself.The lessons in this book resonate as profound truths and I sense that this text will play a vital role in the expansion of conscious awareness which is happening on the planet right now."},{"Title":"The Sacred Awakening of Light Warriors","review":"After going through life feeling alone and without any purpose, I finally found this book.

The book is very simply written with very simple examples but very profound and enlightening. It is very inspiring and gave me the hope that I was not alone, I was looked after and there is a bigger plan. The energy of the author and the counsel of light comes through the book and fills you with love and light. This is a book with a message for everyone.For anyone interested in understanding their purpose and walking the spiritual path, this book is a must. It gives courage to those who are scared to take that first step and is a wonderful guide."},{"Title":"The Sacred Awakening of Light Warriors","review":"I bought this book because I like the introduction. Upon reading, I feel a rush inside of me. Somehow while reading this book, you know that what she is saying is true, yet you are not sure what it is. This book is an awakening, it will guide you to your path. Let me just put it in a small sentence : its a book which will show you your spiritual path and also whats in your life.I gave it 4 stars due to the context of the channeling. Sometimes it is a bit repetitious, but in the end, its a beautiful book. Its more of a spiritual awareness book. I can't comment more on this, since every one is different, and everyone's path is different, but with this book, it will let you be aware of whom you are and what's for you ahead."},{"Title":"70's: A Book of Records","review":"This volume takes an in-depth look at the UK music scene in the 1970s. It provides thousands of names, chart positions and facts but does not concern itself with songwriters, publishers and producers.The decade was one of great diversity so that by the end of the period the charts contained bubblegum pop, MoR, mod revival music, new wave, ska, disco, heavy metal, soul and rock. This contrasted with the start of the 1970 when teen acts like Sweet, The Jackson 5, David Cassidy, The Osmonds and Slade ruled the airwaves.In this decade, glam rock came and went, Bob Marley made his breakthrough, disco was big and pure pop in the form of Abba did very well. On the album charts, artists like ELP, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Camel, Yes, Van Morrison and The Moody Blues contributed some great music.The punk and new wave explosion was the really big event in the rock world, with bands like The Sex Pistols, Ramones, The Clash and The Jam. There were also The Police, Gary Numan, a new wave of heavy metal and the Two Tone bands.The book looks at the artists, the charts, the TV shows, small independent labels, the music press (NME, Sounds, Record Mirror, Melody Maker and others), the movies (from Abba - The Movie to Zachariah) and at different styles of music like reggae. A complete list of reggae songs that made the charts is provided.The chapter on Radio deals with the stations, the DJs and the programmes. The A - Z of Books provides an interesting list of books from the decade under the headings Beatles, Bowie, Blues &amp; Soul, DJs, Dylan, Punk, Presley, Rock \`n Roll, Rolling Stones, Reggae/Rastafarianism, Songs, The Sex Pistols, Rod Stewart, The Who, Wings, General Music Books and General Rock Reference.The chapter Alternative Style Bands has short histories of interesting artists like The Adverts, Advertising, Alternative TV, Blondie, Boomtown Rats, Cabaret Voltaire, Elvis Costello, Damned, Fall, Human League, Jam, Nick Lowe, The Only Ones, Penetration, Police, Skids, Slits, Toyah, X-Ray Spex and many more.The next chapter is a long list of major artists who never had a hit single in the UK in the 1970s; it includes The Allman Brothers, John Cale, Dr John, Iggy Pop, Edgar Winter and ZZ Top. The chapter titled Chart People lists every act that made the UK singles charts in that decade, the year of their first hit, number of hits, last chart hit of the decade and its highest position.Next comes Chart Analysis of Artist Performance, which considers the decade in terms of its most successful singles artists. Thirty-nine groups and solo performers achieved ten or more hits. The top five are Elvis Presley (30), Elton John (25), Wings (23), David Bowie (22) and Cliff Richard (22).The chapter titled Obituary provides information on the artists who died during the 1970s, from Louis Armstrong to Ronnie van Zant, whilst the next chapter, 1970s Gossip And News, traces some of the stories and events that coloured the news pages of pop on a month-by-month basis from January 1970 to December 1979.The chapter Charts investigates the various UK charts of the 1970s, how they were compiled and discusses the changes that took place. The top 50 best selling singles and albums of each year are also provided, plus the top 100 singles and albums of the entire decade.The book ends with a Seventies Quiz in two sections (The Hard 500 and The Pop 250) and the answers to all of the questions. This book is a goldmine of information on the British music scene of the 1970s, about the musicians who made the music, the DJs who played them and the songs and albums that contributed to making the 1970s such a colourful era."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Received this item in one day.

Would absolutely do business again and recommend highly to anyone."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I'm still reading this but loving it. Work and sleep are really getting in the way of my reading. This is my third Crais book. I'm trying to read them in order and I'm becoming a bigger fan with each one."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"\\"Lullaby Town\\" by Robert Crais is probably the best private dick story I've read (well, not counting the great crime-noir writers of the 30's, 40's and 50's). And, I'm not even a passionate fan of this genre. Jo Nesbo's work (he's Norwegian) provides a wholly different take on the genre, and so he and Crais are not comparable authors in any way.What makes this story good is the dialogue, the not-too-complicated-but-complicated-enough story line, believable characters (for the most part), and the occasional even if predictable-in-outcome action. Yes, a lot of people are killed and murder others, all perfectly in keeping with their roles and allegiances. The New York Mafia characters, while full of stereotyped speech and mannerisms, nonetheless capture your interest.Elvis Cole, the main hero is a private eye, and he is assisted by his trusty buddy, the mysterious and deadly Joe Pike. Together they wrap up a Mafia-inspired money laundering scheme involving the heroine, the one-time brief wife of a now famous Hollywood producer, who is the real \\"dick\\" in the story.There are sections of the tale which become page-turners, true to the style of the genre and entertaining to read. Only once in a while do you feel that the way out of the dilemma in which Cole and Pike find themselves is a bit too fantastic to hold water. Thus, on occasion one must suspend disbelief to continue. But those scenes are rare. What comes to mind is the shoot-out in the pumpkin field. But that is a minor flaw.There are no sex scenes -- a welcome feature of this story. Kudos to the author for resisting all the opportunities to include sex, for had he gone there, the story would drop in value considerably.All-in-all, it's a good read, easy to pick up where you left off. Even for those of you who do not like Private Detective stories, this one deserves a try. It's good.A 5 on Amazon's rating scale, due mainly to tight writing and excellent plotting."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"There are now about a dozen of these private eye Elvis Cole, with partner Joe Pike, mysteries set in Los Angeles. We looked forward to \\"Lullaby\\", the third in the series, as it was the last in the complete Crais' bibliography we had not yet read - so obviously we enjoy his work. Cole tends to be the \\"brains\\", and has a comedian's mouth; Pike is more the brawn, reminding us of Lee Child's terrific protagonist Jack Reacher.In this story, a famous and wealthy movie producer used to getting his own way on everything hires Cole to find his ex-wife and son, neither of whom he has seen in over a decade. Elvis skillfully follows some really marginal clues but soon enough finds the two. Mom has forged herself a new life as VP of a small town bank in Connecticut, but has become mixed up with the NYC mob via a money laundering scheme into which she stumbled and can't get loose. Our hero decides to help her rid that entanglement ere reporting her discovery to his client, but the plot soon thickens when the producer shows up with his entourage. Meanwhile, the mob connection is explored throughout most of the book, to a violent but satisfying ending. Frankly, that part of the tale got a little far-fetched, as what would have stretched credibility even at home was even worse across country from our leading men's normal environs.So - a reasonable, suspenseful addition to the set, but one that will be surpassed in quality by later books as Crais hits his stride."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"LULLABY TOWN, Robrt Crais third book in the Elvis Cole series rocks.

This is one of those you can't put down, should be asleep as morning is coming, but must finish the book so you are able to sleep. We only need two hours of sleep, right?

Lullaby Town is the third in the Cole series and the third one I've read, I'm a stickler that way, and it bears the strongest resemblence yet to Parker's Boston PI.Not to say this is a bad thing. While I am a longtime Spenser fan I'm sorry to say that the series is beginning to lose it's zip. Enter Crais. Although there is strong evidence that he is Parker influenced, he gives Cole and Pike the gusto that Spenser and Hawk used to have.I highly recommend the Cole series, at least the one's I have read, they make a great addition to any mystery/PI lovers library. I look forward to reading the next one.Note to Parker fans: Try the Jesse Stone series. Very fresh and very original."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"How can you not love a private investigator that has Disney figurines in his office? This is just another well-written book by Robert Crais, the third in the Elvis Cole mystery series.Private investigator Elvis Cole is hired by overactive director Peter Alan Nelson to find his divorced wife and young son. His search takes him to a small town in Connecticut, where the ex-wife has taken on a new identity as a bank manager. Simple enough? Not for Elvis! It turns out that she has been laundering money for one of the largest organized crime families in New York, and she wishes to get out, but fears for the lives of herself and her son, Toby. The story becomes even more complicated, as the money laundering appears to be isolated to one mob family member, as he seems to be back-stabbing the rest. To make matters worse, the deep-pocketed Nelson turns up as he wants to re-enter their lives, a step that they are just not willing to make yet.Cole's partner, Joe Pike, is back along for the adventure, adding that ever-so-serious, vigilante-type background. Pike's character is the perfect compliment to Cole, making for a much more complete storyline. As always, Cole's witty dialogue and his well-detailed actions lead to a very entertaining thriller.Robert Crais does a masterful job of covering all aspects of the mystery, and keeps the reader guessing as to how Elvis and Joe can rescue this family from the mafia. The book is one excellent page-turning novel that culminates in an amazing, explosive ending. This is definately one Elvis Cole adventure that you will not want to miss."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I'm a huge fan of this series and can tell you that it is one of the best around. It was nice to see the action shift to New York. As usual the characters are well written and the story moves along. I love Elvis' sense of humor. Working my way through the series. I know that the latest one is about Joe Pike so that should be great. Pick this up, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais does it again. Elvis Cole does it again. Joe Pike: ditto. It's difficult not to get hooked by this series. Elvis is funnier than Fletch and Pike is basically what Dale Gribble from \\"King of the Hill\\" would be if he wasn't a complete [baby]. Sure, the plot is similar: woman in jeopardy, child in jeopardy. But the chapters fly by. It's LA, and things can get rough, and, heck, Cole even lives near Connelly's Bosch (look on a map)... but this is an LA where Peter Pan still has a chance and everbody is kung-fu fighting."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Once again Crais weaves a brilliant yarn. This one had fewer wisecracks than others, but it sped along on a good tight story line. If you are not familiar with Mr. Crais, he is similar to Parker's best Spenser novels. His characters have depth and his plots twist just when you thought they were done. Terrific mystery that keeps the pages turning."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"This is the third book I have read by Robert Crais in the Elvis Cole series. Trying to read them in order. I think this is the best one so far. Elvis and Joe Pike are great together. Still wonder if Spencer and Hawk could take them but think it would be a pretty close match. Elvis is hired to find the son of Peter Alan Nelsen. He had left him and his wife years ago. Elvis finds them but they now have mob connections and the mob does not want to give the wife up. Elvis and Joe then take on the mob. Coles fast mind and quick wit get him into and out of trouble. Pike is always around someehere. You may not see him but he is there. A very good mystery and Crais holds you attention. I found myself nearly skipping pages to find out what happened next. IF you like a good fast paced book you will like this one."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais just gets better and better. Lullaby Town, his take on Hollywood types and the Mafia, is crammed full of action and fascinating characters. When Peter Alan Nelsen hires Elvis Cole, &quot;the World's Greatest Detective,&quot; to locate his ex-wife and child, the race is on. It's been over ten years, and the obnoxious Nelsen has become one of Hollywood's top-grossing directors. Now he's decided he wants to be a father. It is quite a mystery---how does a celebrity like Nelsen not get contacted by his ex-wife? You'd think she'd want something from him, right? Or, if not for her, for her son. When Elvis does track the lady down, she claims not to be Karen Shipley, the ex-wife and movie-star-wannabe. Funny, the photo looks exactly like her, and her son could be Nelsen's young clone... What is going on here? One heck of a story! From unreal, insincere, tinseltown LA to virtuous, real small town Connecticut, to the seamy and rotten Big Apple of the NYC Mafia underworld and its assorted creeps and hitmen, Lullaby Town (where does Crais get his great titles?)is among the best in this superlative detective series."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"These books go quickly. It is a private eye duo Elvis and Joe and I like both characters for different reasons which will be evident to anyone who has read Crais. They are based out of LA but the bulk of this story takes place out on the east coast. This story deals with Hollywood and the mob and has a few twists that I never saw coming. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"L.A. private investigator Elvis Cole is one of the most unique characters that have come along in ages. I can't even remotely compare him to anyone else. Elvis definitely grows on you, no doubt about it. This character completely captured my attention. To \\"listen\\" to Elvis talking to himself is a real treat. It provided me is the best entertainment I've had in a long time. The character has a way of expressing himself that will keep you laughing to yourself from the start of the book to the finish. I highly commend Robert Crais for the individuality of his lead character. Read the entire series of Elvis Cole books, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"This is another Elvis Cole novel and I am telling you, once you've read one of the books, you're hooked. These books are well written and remind me a lot of Marlowe books, but with more humor. The awful things is that other characters in the book do not get Elvis' humor, I do, and that makes me laugh out loud even more."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I had to go way out of my way to acquire this Elvis Cole novel. But, it was worth it! Don't miss another exciting adventure!"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais' LULLABY TOWN features Mel Foster's smooth and winning voice, spiced by a long acting career, as it tells of Hollywood genius Peter Nelson, an erratic director used to getting everything he wants - even if he makes enemies to do so. His assignment to Cole - to locate a missing wife and child - should be easy but turns into a nightmare in this fast-paced, breathtaking thriller."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I've recently became a big fan of Robert Crais. I started reading the Elvis Cole series in order, this being the third in the series. I must say it held my attention the whole way through, and I can't wait to continue on!This is definitely a series worth checking out.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I admit it took this third book to officially crown him King, but that he is. After reading hundreds of dozens (I know, I know) of books in my life, including ALL of the books written by a whole MESS of writers, I can recognize superior plotting and characterization. But to have all that chewy goodness also wrapped up in an entertaining, involving and engaging story with LOTS of first and secondary characters you are concerned with--that's mastery. For example, after you have read this book (no, not a spoiler), weren't you a little worried about Charlie in the climatic scene? Being concerned about a rat-bad guy? Now that's some author chops. Run, get these all, if you or the man or teenage boy in your life is starting to think about the bigger moral questions. Good examples in these books to clear up the issues."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"---Lullaby Town is the third in Robert Crais' Elvis Cole series and considerably better than the first two.I have been reading the series in order after hearing about Crais. The Monkey's Raincoat, the Cole debut, spent a lot of time convincing us how cool Elvis is, and offered a plot that often stretched credibility.But it was good enough to invest in the sequel, Stalking The Angel. That was better, not so silly, but still offered an unlikely plot.But Crais seems to hit stride with Lullaby Town. The plot still stretches a bit, maybe more than a bit, but the action is taut, the character of Cole a bit more realistic and the writing snappy and crisp.Next up for me is Free Fall. I can't wait.If Crais keeps improving, he may turn out the most memorable private eye series since Ross MacDonald's magnificent Lew Archer books back in the 60s and 70s."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"LULLABY TOWN is the third entry in Robert Crais's \\"Elvis Cole\\" series about a LA Private Eye. I'm currently reading this series in order, and this novel is the most enjoyable of the three I've read.The plot of LULLABY TOWN, which involves Cole taking on the mafia in a small Connecticut town, is borderline ridiculous, but it's still good fun. Crais takes a bit more time here in developing the story, and the storyline of this novel seemed to flow better than the prior two installments. The dialogue in LULLABY TOWN is quite humourous and sharp, better than almost any PI author in print. After reading this book, I can see why Crais became a superstar of the genre.It is pretty clear that these early Cole novels are highly influenced by Robert Parker's Spenser series. This is not necessarily an insult, since the early Spenser books are some of the best genre writing available to modern readers. Still, my problem with Crais is that his early work strikes me as heavily derivative of another author's style, which means that it lacks the freshness and originality that are required for truly great fiction. Crais seems to feel comfortable following a formula, but I wish he would take more chances with his talent.Overall, though, LULLABY TOWN is a very solid read, and I look forward to reading more novels in this series."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais always holds my attention. I usually can't wait for his next book. I started reading Crais about 7 months ago. I ordered most of his other books. I tell anyone who likes mystery and suspense to read his books. RWH"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais' detective, Elivs, is a sharply drawn character whose persona and background are very funny. This is a fun book to read, but the details of the plot didn't contain many amazing twists and turns. Still, the book was enjoyable. Elvis is the kind of person you would love to grab a beer with, and I can't say that about many characters in novels that I have read."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Just love Elvis Cole and Joe Pike in another fast moving adventure.I enjoy the smart alecky conversation too."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I have only known about Crais for about 6 months. I cant believe his work doesnt get more publicity. In my opinion he blows Stuart Woods and Robert Parker out of the woods. Elvis is a very likable character. This is the 4th book I have read and one of my favorites so far. Action packed -fun to read. I also like James W Halls work but I think Crais is becoming my new favorite."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"If you have been reading Crais' Elvis Cole books, do not miss this one. A great addition in the series.The story revolves around the wife and child of a movie moghul who left her years ago. The search eventually leads to the mafia getting involved and Elvis Cole and Joe Pike go against them with their usual bravado which is sometimes borderline foolish. There are some enjoyable characters in the book and the plot hangs together quite well.Do not miss this if you enjoy PI novels."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I have recently become a Crais fan and I could not put this one down. The hero, Cole, is called upon by a rich yet annoying film director to locate his estranged wife and son. However, the more he finds out about the ex-wife, the more dangerous his mission becomes and he then has to enlist his old friend, Pike, to keep him out of harm's way. Definitely a good book with strong dialogue."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I'm a Crais fan but sometimes I wonder why. His books are strictly formulaic in that they follow a pattern. They are so formulaic that they all seem the same. Crais indulges in too many plot cliches (there always seems to be a convenient coffee shop across the street from a place Cole is watching, with a perfect view of the target building's front door and where Cole can sit for several hours sipping coffee, waiting for the bad guy to exit.) Plot twists and turns often strain credulity. I dunno. I guess I like reading about Cole and Pike and the plot thesis is often creative. But the devil is in the development and that, I feel, is where Crais often falls down."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I've read this book as well as the rest of the Elvis Cole series. They are witty and entertaining. It is very easy to become involved with the characters. Elvis Cole is a caring individual who has a witty way of looking at things. Even his cat is funny. Joe Pike, his partner in the detective agency, is straight as an arrow. He can't even smile, his lip just quivers. Each Elvis Cole book in the series seems to be a little better then the one before. I'm totaly hooked on this series. I also recommend Harlan Coben and his Myron Bolitar series. I have read all of Harlan Coben's books. In the process of ordering his books, Robert Crais was recommended to me as an alternative to Harlan Coben and the Myron Bolitar series. This is why I'm reading Robert Crais and I'm hooked. Buy the whole Elvis Cole series. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I didn't like this book quite as much as the other Elvis Cole books I have read, Monkey's Raincoat, Freefall, and LA Requiem. It's a good book, it just seemed slower, with less action. This is an absorbing series, and shouldn't be missed. I have to force myself not to buy them all at once or else I'll have them read in a week."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Elvis Cole is hired by a top new movie director to find his abandoned wife and child. Elvis finds her, but she is laundering money for the mob. Elvis has to do some quick moves to get her untangled from the Mafia. Crais is an excellent writer, his books are easy reads with few plot twists, he has'nt written a bad one yet. This book or Voodoo River is his best but, they are all very good."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"If you have read other reviews of mine of Mr. Crais's books, you will know that I read his latest three books first (loved them) and then started with the Elvis Cole series at the beginning. I have not found the first two up to the standards the author now sets for himself, but I liked this book quite a lot. The wise cracking is eased off and Elvis gets himself involved in a situation that takes some doing to solve and it is done in a fairly believeable way. I hope that as the series progresses he continues to improve to the level of L.A. Requiem.In this book Elvis has been hired by a big shot Hollywood producer to find his ex-wife and son as he thinks after 12 years it is time to be a Dad. Well, Mom and son have moved from LA to Chelam, Connecticutt. Mom has made a life for herself and son, Toby, without any help from the big shot and it is not wanted now.However, Mom has this little problem of having been co-opted by the Mafia to do some money laundering (she is a branch bank manager) and while she would like to end the relationship, the Mafioso that has used her has other ideas.Soon all of the characters are in the same vicinity and it takes all of Elvis's and Joe Pike's efforts to keep matters from dissolving into a large pool of blood. How they do it is the point of these easy reading novels and why we keep coming back for more."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais was a Emmy-award-winning writer for \\"Hillstreet Blues,\\" and that was enough for me to give his Elvis Cole series a try.Elvis is a Los Angeles private eye in the Travis McGee tradition: irreverent, smart-alecky, with a special forces background. His sidekick is Joe Pike, an ex-marine, who is definitely the strong, silent type.In LULLABY TOWN Elvis is hired to find billionaire producer/director Peter Alan Nelsen's ex-wife with whom he had a short marriage years before that produced a child. Elvis tracks her to a small town in Connecticut, and that's where the conflict really begins. There are mafia hoods involved in the woman's life. Robert Crais has the same problem John Sanford has in his Prey novels; bodies pile up like cord wood, and the critical reader begins to wonder why the local authorities put up with this stuff.Elvis and Joe Pike are likable characters, and we pull for Karen Shipley (alias Nelson) and her son, but her husband Peter Alan Nelson is a veritable horse's behind who thinks the world revolves around him. It's hard to imagine somebody like Stephen Speilberg being as self-absorbed as this guy. No one would do business with him.I found Chelam, Connecticut, to be a unique setting for a thriller. Elvis and Joe even stay at a Howard Johnson, and there's a woman who runs a boarding house who provides an important clue. Otherwise this is the same old, same old type of mystery/thriller. If you'll looking for something to read on a long plane ride this will do fine; if you'll looking for originality, try George Pelecanos."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"By far the weakest entry in Crais' excellent Elvis Cole series. Leaving his familiar LA terratory Cole encounters stereotyped mafiosa and a New York and Connecticut as three dimentional as a Hagstrom map. Only read this while you're waiting for the next Elvis Cole to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I am a new-comer to this series and after barely finishing \\"Lullaby Town\\" don't expect me to buy the T-shirt.(To be read in Elvis' cute/sarcastic style.)I mean, really? Our boyish hero is hired by a \\"famous\\" Hollywood director to find his ex-wife and son. The mogul is surrounded by toadies and sycophants and is.. ARROGANT. You tell by the way he throws his candy wrappers around. Really? Elvis cooly follows her \\"trail\\" with a few well-placed calls to friends in high places and interrogating her former landlord, who cracks like an egg.The fact that she's 80 years old probably helped. This story is much ado about nothing, yet Elvis acts like he's on the trail of Osama bin Laden instead of a young wife who left her a**hole husband. Like a human Scud, Elvis hones in her in no time and lets her know the jig is up! Really? Since when is it a crime to leave your husband? Oooh!Wait! It turns out she's trying to protect her 12-year-old son Toby(Aww!) from the harsh realities of life while also laundering money for the Mafia. Really? How?...When?..Really? What follows is so unlikely and silly that I won't bore you with the outcome. This book reads like Crais is trying to interest some Cable channel into making a series out of it."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I heard Robert Crais speak at the Pikes Peak Writers Conference 2001. I was impressed. I've purchased his books, starting with Monkey's Raincoat, and I'm equally as impressed with his writing talent as I was with his speaking talent. I'd recommend his books to anyone that likes a fast-paced story with a charming hero. Elvis Cole is great."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Elvis Cole is a charming, sharp witted, wise-cracking private investigator who is teamed up with a Clint Eastwood type partner, Joe Pike.His novels are fast paced, and entertaining enough to make me laugh out loud.My favorite Elvis Cole novel is L.

I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"To set the stage, I am a Spenser or Robert Parker fan. I read every book he writes when I want to relax and start and finish a book in the same weekend. Elvis Cole and Robert Crais are on the same level. I have been consuming Crais' books one after the other since I first found L.A. Requiem. Lullaby Town is another hit with more Pike and food and action and humor.

He has no idea where they are, but he now wants to know his son.Locating Nelsen's ex-wife, Karen, doesn't prove that difficult for Cole. She has made a new life for herself and her 12-year-old son in Connecticut. She's vice president at a bank, has a real estate license and recently moved into a new home. The catch, however, is that she's involved in a money laundering scheme with the local mafia.Elvis is determined to help Karen get out of the mafia deal. In the process, he stumbles upon some shady dealings by Charlie DeLuca, the mafia kingpin who's controlling Karen. Elvis believes he can use this as leverage to free Karen from her obligations.Inpatient with the progress of the case, Peter flies to Connecticut. But, of course, he only manages to muck up the works.Written in 1992, author Robert Crais provides readers with another interesting and entertaining Elvis Cole novel."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"If you have yet to begin the marvelous Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais, you've got a great treat ahead of you! Few series get off to a stronger start than Mr. Crais did with The Monkey's Raincoat, which won both the Anthony and Macavity awards for best novel while being nominated for the Edgar and Shamus awards as well. Stalking the Angel followed powerfully with classic noir style of the 1930s hard-boiled detective up against evil, but moderated with wise cracks. And the books just keep getting better from there in their characterizations, action, story-telling and excitement.Elvis Cole is the star attraction, the co-owner of The Elvis Cole Detective Agency. He's now 38, ex-Army, served in Vietnam, ex-security guard, has two years of college, learned to be a detective by working under George Feider, a licensed P.I. for over 40 years, does martial arts as enthusiastically as most people do lunch, and is fearless but not foolish. He's out to right the wrongs of the world as much as he is to earn a living. Elvis has a thing for Disney characters (including a Pinocchio clock), kids, cats, scared clients and rapid fire repartee. He drives a Jamaica yellow 1966 Corvette Stingray convertible, and usually carries a .38 Special Dan Wesson.His main foil is partner, Joe Pike, an ex-Marine, ex-cop who moves quietly and mysteriously wearing shades even in the dark . . . when he's not scaring the bad guys with the red arrows tattooed on his deltoids, which are usually bare in sleeveless shirts. Although he's got an office with Elvis, Pike spends all of his time at his gun shop when not routing the bad guys with martial arts while carrying and often using enough firepower to stop a tank. Pike rarely speaks . . . and never smiles. A standing gag is trying to catch Pike with a little twitch of his lips indicating he might possibly be amused. But he's there when you need him. He drives a red Jeep.Robert Parker's Spenser is the obvious character parallel for Elvis, but Spenser and Elvis are different in some ways. Cole is more solitary, usually being alone when he's not working. Cole is very much L.A. and Spenser is ultra blue collar Boston. Cole is martial arts while Spenser boxes and jogs. What they have in common is that they're both out to do the right thing, with money being unimportant. They both love to crack wise as they take on the bad guys. The bad guys hate the &quot;humor&quot; in both cases, and can't do much about it. The dialogue written for each is intensely rich.Mr. Crais has a special talent for making you care about his characters, especially the clients and their kids. You'll want to know what happens to them. With a lot of experience in script writing, Mr. Crais also knows how to set the scene physically and make you feel it. He may be out finest fiction writer about physical movement. He gives you all the clues to picture what's going on . . . but draws back from giving so much detail that you can't use your own imagination to make things better.I grew up near Los Angeles, and get a special pleasure out of reading his descriptions of the differences in cities, neighborhoods, and buildings in the area. He gets in right . . . and in detail. It's a nice touch!On to Lullaby Town, the third book in the series. The title refers to the peddler who sells dreams in Lullaby Town. In our case, it's Hollywood.The peddler in the story is Peter Alan Nelson, a motion picture director dubbed as the King of Adventure by Time magazine (think Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wrapped up into one hyper personality), which also called him &quot;arrogant, brilliant, demanding.&quot; In real life, he has the maturity of a male 2 year old, and has worse habits. Elvis is hired to find Nelson's ex-wife and child so Nelson can form a relationship with his son, whom he's ignored virtually from birth. The studio doesn't want Nelson distracted by all this yearning for his son because he's due to start a new movie in three weeks.Elvis has no trouble finding the ex and the son. They've left a trail a mile wide across the country to Connecticut where Nelson's mousy young wife has turned herself into a successful banker who doesn't want to hear anything from Nelson. At this point, Elvis's job would amount to bringing them all together gently . . . except that the ex, who now calls herself Karen Lloyd, has a little problem with the biggest crime family in the East. Elvis and Joe set out to eliminate the little problem and are tested to the limits of their talents.The story develops rapidly in small segments from quite different perspectives, usually in chapters of 4-5 pages in length, like a scene in a drama. Each change adds to a mosaic portrait of the characters and the overall situation. So the story moves fast . . . but without leaving you behind. There is enough material in this book to make two novels.Pay particular attention to the evolution of characters of Karen Lloyd and Peter Alan Nelson. Mr. Crais does a nice job of helping you realize many sides of their characters over a period of about 10 years. That's one quality that makes this book compelling reading.After you finish the book, you might find it helpful to think about the potential downside of possessing all that you dream of having.Can you select better dreams to turn into reality?Donald MitchellCo-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Robert Crais takes Elvis Cole on the road in Lullaby Town. After the first two books in the series took place in exclusively in the L.A. area, Mr. Crais sends Elvis across the country to the East Coast. The book starts out with Elvis being contacted by Peter Alan Nelsen, who is a big time action movie director, to locate his missing first wife and son. The meeting between Elvis and Nelsen at Nelsen's office is hilarious. In Peter Alan Nelsen, Mr. Crais perfectly captures the stereotypical, self-absorbed Hollywood type. After Elvis takes the case, his search leads him to a sleepy little Connecticut town where he locates Karen (the first wife) and Toby (the son). What Elvis discovers is that Karen isn't leading the simple country life, she's laundering money for the mob. Elvis took on the Japanese mafia in Stalking The Angel and this time he gets a crack at the fabled New York mafia in a way that only Elvis can. Taking the storyline out of L.A. is a nice change of pace as we get to see Elvis outside of his normal element. Lullaby Town further cements Mr. Crais as a great mystery writer and he keen eye and sharp wit are further honed in this third entry in the series."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Lullaby Town exemplifies the quality we have come to expect from Robert Crais. I have read previous Crais novels and this book is just as well written as the others. For people who like crime fiction, Lullaby Town is sure to please you. It is well written and keeps you involved the entire way.It was difficult to put the book down. All of Mr. Crais's Elvis Cole novels are well done; this is just another one of his typical works. Cole, the main character, is native to Hollywood. So when he is asked by a famous Hollywood director, Peter Alan Nelsen, to locate Nelson's ex-wife and son, Cole takes it in stride. His search takes him to a small Connecticut town. This makes the novel different than the others in the Elvis Cole series. Elvis is removed from his element, L.A and Hollywood and dumped into a small town. However, just because it is a small town does not mean there is any less wrong doing. By removing Cole from his usual surroundings it reveals more about him. Cole appears to have matured. For those who have been reading all of the Elvis Cole novels it is obvious that Cole has matured. We see things in him that are not as apparent in Los Angeles. Later, Cole is lead to the Big Apple to take on the Mob. For those people who are willing to look past the fact that this is just another typical crime fiction, or detective mystery, this novel is a total hit. You feel as though you are shadowing Elvis Cole as he hunts down the ex-wife of Peter Alan Nelsen. I found myself feeling as though I were part of the plot. The novel is truly riveting and keeps you reading. The duo of Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, Elvis's partner, is guaranteed to keep you interested and curious."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"If you've read several of the Elvis Cole adventures by Robert Crais, you know by now that they all follow a predictable pattern; Elvis and his partner Joe Pike investigate a mystery for several hundred pages, then the book always ends with a big, bloody shoot-out. Lullaby Town is no exception, but it's hampered by flaws that aren't seen in Crais's earlier books.The main flaw here is pacing. Cole is hired to find the ex-wife and child of a famous Hollywood director. The trail leads him to a sleepy little town out in the middle fo nowhere, in which Cole spends a fair amount of time doing basically nothing and feeling pretty bored. This boredom seeps from the pages and infects the reader as well; the first half of the book is so slow and laborious that I found myself skimming large portions, something that I normally never do. Cole is such a likeable character and his sense of humor is so endearing that I managed to struggle through those first 150 pages or so, and the pace in the second half of the book was definitely faster even if the plotline was as predictable as snow in the wintertime.The bottom line? Read it if you're a Robert Crais fan and you're going through the whole Elvis Cole series in order, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I really loved this book! It's my second Elvis Cole and I'm really looking forward to reading the rest in the series. It starts out as a mundane assignment that turns ugly, early. Cole and his partner, Pike, are ever on the job and the twists and turns of the book are done with great skill and there are lots of them. Very plausible reasons for every death, none of those unbelievable deaths here (you know the kind, as a reader, you think, now who would kill someone for THAT reason?)! True, there was a lot of violence. I just felt as if I was there with them, scared with them (OK they don't GET scared, but you know...). I could NOT put it down (once I got to the middle), and I almost never say that, I just sat riveted to my seat. Outstanding, excellent! Wonderful."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"This is not Crais' best, but another worthy entry into the Cole-Pike series. This one, interestingly, takes place in the mafia world and NY/CT/NJ tri-state area. It is a good jolt to have the story--a darkish one--take place out there. The characters remain fresh and we even have some visits from some old characters (I love this--always great to reward long time fans with visits from characters from other books). Cole is still a mystery at this point (unlike Bosch, we don't know much about him yet and I'm reading the books in order). My only criticism of this volume is that Peter Alan Nelsen is a little too cartoonish for my tastes, but otherwise, a great book."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"This is a wonderful installment in the Elvis Cole series. The characterization of Cole's client in spot on while being ridiculous at the same time. Crais is really good at laying people wide open. The damsel in distress this time around is strong but also unforgiving and a little hard to like. But the plot and ensuing violence escalates at a fast pace making this an exhilaraing page turner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"The comparisons to Spencer are obvious. Even the storyline here is familiar. But despite all that, the book is a fun, fast-paced, enjoyable crime novel. Cole is an easy-to-like wisecracking hero with a heart of gold. Pike is the cold, matter of fact, partner that you can always rely on. In this novel, Cole and Pike are hired by an egotistical and pompous movie director to locate his ex-wife and son. Finding her isn't much trouble, but then Cole decides to help her and learns that she is in a terrible predicament. Cole and Pike eventually run into the NY mob, and from there the story blisters towards a satisfying (and very violent) conclusion. I highly recommend this for fans of the hard-boiled PI genre."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Most detectives would give their eyeteeth to be hired by a director as famous as Peter Alan Nelson, the king of the adventure movie. Admittedly, the job was only one of finding Nelson's ex-wife and child who he hasn't seen in eleven years. Suddenly, after dumping them for a film career Nelson feels a gap in his life which he intends to plug with Toby, his son, like it or not. Nelson likes Elvis Cole because the detective is macho and has lots of attitude. You can imagine what Cole actually thought, but sometimes money is money.Cole finds out that Nelson's wife is far from the loser that the director thought she was. He finds Karen Lloyd in Chelam, Connecticut. The failed actress has become a bank vice-president, raising her son on her own and doing well. Not as well as she should be, though. In the hard days, she did a favor for the mafia and now she's in Charlie DeLuca's back pocket. Since Charlie is the son of the Capo and a complete psychotic, this is not a good place to be. No problem, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike to the rescue.By now, the reader should know that Pike/Cole solutions inevitably involve a surfeit of chaos and violence. This time is no exception. Cole has to worry about Toby, the mafia (several mafias), Peter Alan Nelson (who never behaves as if he is as old as Toby), and a steady flow of crazies. Something a lot worse than a little money laundering is going on and Cole is stuck right in the middle of it. Being Robert Crais' answer to the tired old archetype of the Los Angeles private investigator, you can trust Cole to smiles, cracks sarcastic jokes, play hero, and wait until you're not looking before he hits you up side of the head with a cast iron two-by-four.This book, the third in the series, drags just a bit. Or perhaps, it is just a little too predictable. I like the interchanges between Pike and Cole, and the plot twists that it starts with, but the novel settles down into its plot too soon. The inevitable violence comes arrives early and is over played. Still, this is a pretty good read, not one a fan would ever want to miss."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Elvis Cole, private investigator, was tasked by a famous director, Peter, to find his ex-wife and son. A seemingly simple assignment soon turned out to be mission impossible. After locating Karen and Toby, Elvis soon uncovered that the former was owned by the mafia, who would not be at all happy with the interference of Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike. Being his usual righteous self, Elvis could not sit back and see Karen's life destroyed by the mob. However, could he and Joe take on the mafia, save Karen from its clutches, and escape unscathed?Like all other Robert Crais' books, it had the compelling power which made it impossible for me to put the book down. I have always believed that for a book to be likeable, we must like the characters in the book and really feel for them. This is precisely the reason which I enjoy this book so much. I was rooting for Elvis and Joe all the way as I followed the story which simply took my breath away."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"This is the best novel of its genre that I have ever read, and I have probably read too many.

I am looking forward to reading all the Robert Crais I can get my hands on"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Elvis Cole, \\"the world's greatest detective\\", is hired by Hollywood director Peter Alan Nelson to find his ex-wife, Karen, and son, Toby. His search takes him to small-town Connecticut where, once he finds Karen and her son, finds himself in the middle of problems involving the Mafia.Pithy comment follows dry-witted humour in another very enjoyable detective story with the irrepressible Elvis Cole in control. For the first two chapters I found that I was chuckling to myself at least once per page as Elvis met the self-centered, big-shot director client, Peter Alan Nelsen. Although the humour doesn't continue at this pace, a light-hearted feel is maintained throughout the whole book. If you like your detective stories slightly on the humorous side with just a little bit of danger thrown in for spice, then this book (and all the Elvis Cole books) are just perfect.Although this book is part of an ongoing series, it isn't really necessary to read it in the order that it was written. While the main characters are the same (Elvis and Joe Pike), previous plots aren't divulged."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"I've read five of Crais's books and have ordered his Sunset Express &amp; Indigo Slam.

His characters are very good."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Foregoing his familiar LA turf, Robert Crais ventures to New York City and the sleepy Connecticut suburb of Chelam in this offbeat and entertaining mystery. Private investigator Elvis Cole is in his best wisecracking form, while Joe Pike's stoic form is always there exactly when needed. The change in venue was a refreshing change of pace, and the east coast-west coast banter was humorous and effective, as Crais succeeds in poking fun at both the shallowness of Hollywood and the brutishness of the east coast crime families. Despite a typically dark and threatening plot, Crais keeps the pace light and the one-liners flowing, building up steam towards an exciting - if not particularly surprising - climax. All in all, a more than satisfying read, and well worth the time invested."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"A pompous director comes to Elvis Cole's office searching for his estranged wife and kid. Elvis, with his usual cool sarcastic reception, reluctantly takes the assignment and traces her to the New England. What ensues is a violent conflict between her, the director, and more importantly, the mob.The sarcastic Elvis and stoic Joe Pike continue their adventures in this missing person's case. In order to throw some new thrills into their escapades, they escape Southern California. This results in terribly predictable characters. The evil ultra violent mobster and his cool tough bodyguard versus the egotistically Hollywood heavyweight and the headstrong single mother.This book suffers and benefits from the usual Crais fare. Sometimes useless descriptions mixed with some repetition. However, it is readable and enjoyable at the most basic level.While not the worst in the series, it really doesn?t offer much. I?d recommend the next two in the series instead."},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"Twelve years ago, Karen Shipley was seventeen years old and had dreams of becoming a movie star.

The circumstances in the book will turn him into someone wanting to be a better person. I was becoming disappointed with the Elvis Cole novels but this one might just change my mind. Elvis is still his wise guy self and his partner, Joe Pike is still the strong silent type.

Joe Pike and Elvis Cole are quite a duo. They totally understand one another. Elvis has a quick wit and uses it. A magna director wants Elvis to find his wife and son. Elvis traces them to a ficticious town in CT and the game begins. The mafia plays a big role in this one and it is quite something to see how Elvis and Joe come out on top. Exciting all the way thru.

What a keeper!"},{"Title":"Lullaby Town","review":"All I gotta say is wow. Third book in the series and still going strong. I think this may be my favorite so far, with Monkey's Raincoat coming in at a very very close second. In this one, the characters, especially Elvis, seemed to have matured a little if you know what I mean. It was cool having Elvis and Joe get mixed up in some sort of mafia situation, it reminded me a lot of The Godfather (also an excellent book and great great movie). Anyways check this book out, but start with Monkeys raincoat 1st - trust me it will give you added enjoyment. And you'll love Elvis and Joe Pike, man they are a cool set of characters together.

What separates Robert Crais from EVERYONE else writing mysteries is the touching humanity he invests in his characters. As with all of Crais's novels, some scenes will make you cry, others will make you laugh, and ALL of them will keep you turning the pages. The scenes when Elvis Cole confronts the mobsters in New York are drop-dead hilarious, and I could MORE than relate to Karen Lloyd, the woman who rebuilt her life.

Bawer is a worshipper of poetry in the best possible sense: he absolutely revels in the poems he loves. His reader is equally lucky. In Bawer's hands, poets and poetry are animated and vital.Covering a range of modern poets from Auden to Stevens to Plath to Jarrell to Justice, he discusses their poetry and their lives. His pieces are less directly focused on the lives of the artists than, say, James Fenton's latest book, in the sense of perspective, but they are always erudite and engaging. True, I may be partial to someone who clearly takes my own view, openly confessing to disdainful thoughts on poetry as self-expression and therapy (which, I, too, have encountered far too often), but when the future of poetry is at stake, honesty is our only hope. And Bawer has honesty in spades, not even shying away from criticism of the always esteemed Helen Vendler.Bawer's insights made me reread and reconsider poems, and gave me a greater understanding of all. He is invaluable. For anyone who is dissatisfied with the general degeneration of today's poetry and the humid (fetid?) atmosphere hanging over it all, this book is a blessing. At the very least, you'll know you're not alone and learn something (guaranteed) in the process."},{"Title":"Tourism Marketing for Cities and Towns: Using Branding and Events to Attract Tourists","review":"This is a good book if you are new to the industry, either as a student or as practitioner.

Apparently, when the government gets you in its sights you are there forever, especially if you are black. That article got me to thinking back to the days when we of the white left were head over heels in love with the Black Panthers as the epitome of revolutionary manhood (and it was mainly men) and of revolutionary struggle. Well, as we are all painfully aware, those days are long gone although the goals fought for in those days are still desperately in need of completion. Thus, some thoughts about the ups and downs of the Black Panther experience, the most militant and subjectively revolutionary part of the black liberation movement of the 1960's, and its role in the history of black liberation is in order.It is extremely improbable that the phenomenal rise of the Black Panthers in California, and later elsewhere, would have occurred had it not been for the tidal wave of the black civil rights struggle in the South in the early 1960' s and the various ghetto uprisings in the mid-1960's. The victories achieved in the civil rights struggle, limited as they were, taught masses of blacks how to organize around their own interests. That those victories were limited became apparent with the hardheaded and hard-learned experience that those problems were only the tip of the iceberg for the black community as the struggle moved North and West. This contradiction played itself internally in the black liberation movement and eventually caused a profound political collision between the liberal integrationist, pacific wing epitomized by Martin Luther King and the separatist, nationalist, self-defense oriented Malcolm X wing , of which the Panthers were the heirs. A shorthand way of putting this is the black liberation variant of the age-old tension between revolutionary and reformist strategies for social change. The Black Panthers throughout their rise and fall never did successfully overcome that tension, to the detriment of militant leftists, black and white.As any photograph taken of the Panthers from the period would demonstrate the Panthers and particularly the central leadership, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Elridge Cleaver among others were not adverse to little provocative demonstrations or shock-value publicity. The FBI, however, early on had other plans for them and they were not pretty. If J. Edgar Hoover saw the placid Martin Luther King-led branch of the civil rights movement as some kind of communist conspiracy then he turned apoplectic at the thought of armed black men asserting their right to bear arms. Since early slavery times that possibility had always been the fear of whites and the response was no different this time. Over a very short period the Hoover-orchestrated federal and state drive against the Panthers left most of the key leaders and cadre dead, in jail, on bail or in hiding, This was not the first time a perceived leftist threat had been dealt with by the government in this way. One can think of the International Workers of the World (Wobblies) in the World War I period, the Communist and Anarchist \`red scare' raids and deportations after that war and more recently the anticommunist witch hunts of the 1950's. With this difference, however, in the case of the Panthers there was a concerted effort to kill off every one they could get their hands on.The repression of the Panthers became so intense that in many ways they became a de facto legal defense organization. That was quite a difference from the wild, revolutionary black nationalist days when they believed that they could go it alone on the streets with a cadre of black street militants in an American version of a \`third world' guerilla warfare- driven national liberation front. Their nationalism initially alienated them from the black community (except, perhaps in their home base of Oakland, California) as until very late the ordinary black worker could not relate to the Panther political line despite the fact that even then the East Bay and other locales where the Panthers had influence were solidly working class areas. In short, they were looking in the streets not in the factories to organize the revolution.The state repression also caused a shift in strategy as a matter of self-defense. However, the price the Panthers would pay for this was a capitulation to Democratic Party reformism through the vehicle of the Communist Party's legal defense organizations, which they latched onto out of desperation. I have personal experience of this change. A fair number of blacks I had known from various earlier political struggles drifted into the Panther revolutionary nationalist orbit in revulsion against Martin Luther King's non-violent strategy for social change, the incessant racism of American society and the barely hidden paternalism of the white liberal establishment and a fair part of the left. For a period in the late 1960's it was almost impossible for white radicals and revolutionaries to talk or to socialize with many Panthers, especially the rank and file. On more than one occasion I was either snubbed by or threatened by Panthers for attempting to argue for an integrated black and white alliance around a common program to fight the beast of American imperialism. Then in the very early seventies all of a sudden I was invited to various Panther support meetings and social affairs. Obviously the line had changed (through the concept of the united front against fascism) and now I was a comrade again.Even a cursory glance at the current American class structure points out that blacks (and more recently Hispanics) are heavily concentrated in the working class so that in order to be successful the struggle for socialism will have to deal with the fact that blacks will be a central component in the leadership of, and the struggle for, those goals. This is where the sad lessons of the demise of the Panthers between the rock of black nationalism and the hard place of democratic reformist politics is especially important. Looking back at the history of the 1960's black liberation struggle one can see little turning points where if hard communists had had enough forces they could have shifted the axis of the struggle way from black nationalism and democratic reformism. A working class program to break from the Democratic Party and struggle independently for a workers party could have gained a cadre. Do you not think that such a program would have not gotten a hearing from the landless rural workers in the South and the black industrial proletariat of the North and West? That, dear readers, is the ultimate tragedy of the demise of the Black Panthers. Enough said."},{"Title":"A dictionary of the Choctaw language","review":"Cyrus Byington was a missionary who lived among the Choctaw of Oklahoma in the mid 19th century.

Gary L. Francione's _Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement_ literally woke me up and gave me the resources I needed to avoid the seriously harmful strategy of animal welfare and new welfare. Before reading it, I took part in \\"bigger cages\\" campaigns, thought that such advocacy was helpful in the short term and had a very strong desire to continue to do so. After reading Francione's extremely compelling theoretical arguments, empirical evidence and well evidenced practical implications of different advocacy methods, I had no choice but to reject welfarism and new-welfarism in favor of a clearly defined concept of animal rights. In a nutshell, Francione's central thesis in _Rain Without Thunder_ is as follows:In everyday language with respect to human animals, the word \\"welfare\\" has very good connotations. However, in the areas of _law_ and _institutional policy_ with respect to non-human animals, words like \\"welfare,\\" \\"humane,\\" \\"care,\\" \\"unnecessary suffering,\\" and so on only mean _one_ thing. Namely, they mean that the interests of non-human animals will be protected only to the extent necessary to exploit them in an economically efficient manner. For example, in law and policy, the welfare of a pig not to starve is protected because it is necessary to feed the pig in order to get her or his meat. The same is necessarily true of every animal welfare law and regulation. Therefore, any advocacy that attempts to achieve animal rights and the abolition of animal exploitation in the long-term by using the supposedly short-term strategy of trying to pass welfare regulations achieves only _one_ thing. Namely, if those measures are implemented, it will be further ensured that the only interests of non-human animals that will ever be protected are those that are required to exploit them efficiently. In other words, the supposed \\"success\\" of implementing a welfare measure only further ensures that the interests of other animals that are not required to exploit them efficiently will *always* be violated in the most abhorrent ways imaginable. In short, welfare measures *only* harm non-human animals and never help them.Again, before I read Francione's arguments and evidence, I found his claim to be counter-intuitive. If this describes your views on the subject, for the sake of non-human animals who are exploited everywhere, I urge you to read and seriously consider _Rain Without Thunder_. Francione offers an excellent practical alternative to welfarist advocacy that, if followed, will further the rights of other animals on a workable *incremental* basis. As an animal rights advocate, I am extremely grateful that this book exists."},{"Title":"Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement","review":"Rain Without Thunder is a penetrating look at howanimal rights activism without a clear understandingof important philosophical differences between animal rights and animal welfare has led to ineffective strategies which, Francione argues, serve only to more deeply entrench the speciesist paradigms that lead to animal oppression. Francione's insights are important not only for animal rights activists, but for everyone working for social justice. The first truly original animal rights book I have seen in a long time. Read it!"},{"Title":"Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement","review":"In &quot;Rain Without Thunder,&quot; Francione discusses the emergence of &quot;new welfarists&quot; who are doing the animals more harm than good. He meticulously lays out why animal welfare cannot lead to animal liberation. And argues a need for change. This book is a must read for all animal rights activists. Unfortunately you won't see it carried by mainstream &quot;animal rights&quot; (which GF calles the &quot;new welfarists&quot;)organizations, because it is much too controversial!"},{"Title":"Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement","review":"This book is marvelous. Gary Francione not only talks the talk, but walks the walk. As a fellow ethical vegan, I associate with him because the only way to stop animal abuse is to completely abolish ALL animal use. All the animal \\"rights\\" organizations might make some changes, like giving egg-laying chickens 2 more inches in their cages that they share with other chickens with not enough room to spread their wings or even stand up. If human animals were treated like non-human animals used in the food industry, entertainment industry, fur and leather industry and last, but not least, in laboratory experiments, this treatment would be considered torture. I not only recommend this book, but all of Gary Francione's books.

It felt like I had been hit by an invisible energy tidal wave and left at the bottom of an invisible energy sea.The instant that the wave hit, it felt like a pair of invisible energy hands were cupping my brain from above and below, and gently pressing the two hemispheres of my brain together.The two halves of my brain felt like two hemispheres of water that were jelling and blending together into one sphere.All of a sudden my brain jelled and exploded into an infinitely bright, infinitely white, infinitely loving, all knowing, divine light!My mind went totally and absolutely crystal clear. Clearer than I could ever have imagined. Every negative thought that I had ever felt had simply ceased to exist.The infinite cleansing divine white light energy then automatically released from my head and flooded down my body, arms and legs.

But what would seem like a lifetime of grief to them, would only seem like an instant in time for me, until we could be together again eternally. For some reason I was being given the choice to go -die- or stay -live. I decided immediately that I could not leave them alone. I wanted to tell the whole world about my experience).Twelve minutes after my experience began, it began to fade. I said to myself \\"Oh no! Please don't go!\\". But it went!

This slim volume is replete with excellent maps, TO&amp;E info and many candid photos of the ragged, rugged Marauders. All in all, one sad, heroic tale of some undervalued dogfaces in one of Worl War II's worst theaters.

I've been rather interested in Josephine and her circle ever since I read Sandra Gulland's Josephine B. trilogy.A Rose for Virtue (named for a school prize that gets destroyed inadvertently when Hortense wears it) follows Hortense from the time of her mother and stepfather's marriage to Hortense's departure from Paris following Napoleon's final downfall.Hortense is an appealing heroine, resilient, un-self-pitying, and resourceful without ever becoming that dreaded creature of historical fiction, the Mary Sue. As the narrator, she frankly admits that she lacks her mother's easy charm, and she can be stubborn, especially when her estranged husband, Louis, is concerned. She can laugh at herself, and she has a rare gift for facing facts.Lofts does a good job with the other characters as well. Josephine is particularly well done, and there are some nice sketches of life among the Bonapartes, one of the highlights being a particularly fractious family dinner that ends with Hortense's baby son peeing on the tablecloth.This isn't an action-packed novel; the big events, of course, occur mostly out of Hortense's range of vision. Nonetheless, Lofts is good at evoking the emotions caused by these events, as when Hortense, urging Napoleon to flee following his return from Waterloo, gets this succinct reply: \\"My dear, it no longer matters.\\"My only real disappointment with the book was its ending. Artistically, it works, but it would have been good to see what Hortense made of her later life. As the book doesn't have an afterword--I suppose they weren't in style at the time--the reader wanting more information has to go elsewhere. And the reader will likely want this information, for Lofts makes our stay in Hortense's company a congenial one."},{"Title":"A Rose for Virtue: The Very Private Life of Hortense, Stepdaughter of Napoleon I, Mother of Napoleon III","review":"This is a pleasant book about the life of Hortence, daughter of Josephine Bonapart, and step daughter to Napolean Bonapart.

However, don't be discouraged from Norah Lofts.

I learned nothing new from reading Lofts--all the history was covered in Seward, and more (Fifi and Elisa scarcely get a mention here)--but that's not what you read historical fiction *for*, of course: you read it to see the history from a personal point of view, to get an emotional or a visceral impact out of it. Unfortunately, you don't get that here: Hortense is such a reserved, detached narrator (or Lofts such an unengaging writer) that I got as strong a sense of Seward's emotional involvement as I do of hers. (Also, that \\"zombie\\" metaphor was a remarkably poor one on several levels, I feel.)If you want to learn about Napoleon's personal and family life, and you're the kind of reader who prefers to learn their history from well-researched historical fiction, then I recommend it; if you already know the history and are looking for a strong engaging novel, then I would say not."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"Take Sleeping Beuty, add some AD&amp;D action and set it in early 1980's prose.VoilaNow you know if you want to read this book or not."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"With master magician Blais dead, murdered by the evil wizard Nimir, bumbling apprentice Tristan was all that was left to carry on Blais' last quest - to find and awaken the princess of Allaire and thus save all of Calandra, or to fail and doom the kingdom to eternal winter. Tristan felt ill equipped to rescue the princess, especially after hundreds of heroes and wizards, all better trained than he, had died in the attempt. But Tristan loved his master too much to do nothing less than his very best so he started with the basics that the others discounted. The first thing that Tristan had to recover was the legendary warhorse of Esdragon, Valadan, who had disappeared long ago. Then he had to persuade the Heir to the Throne, Polassar, that his was not a fool's errand, but a true chance at victory to save the kingdom. After he had gathered his companions, then Tristan had to find the location of the sleeping princess, somehow awaken her, find the tenth ring that was needed for the princess to use her powers, fight off jealous wizards, Nimir's Ice Hounds, and whatever other complications came along the way....The Ring of Allaire is in many ways a simple fantasy tale retold, but in other ways it is new, fresh and fun. There are also plenty of little surprises to keep the reader guessing, even though some things seem obvious to the reader before it is revealed in the book. But, Dexter's characters are delightful and so fun to get to know and to travel with. I love that Tristan tries really hard and sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn't, but he always tries. He seems like such a normal person and it is refreshing for the nice, normal guy to get ahead for once, instead of the brave, dashing hero. A fast, fun read that kicks of a delightful trilogy - I highly recommend all of Dexter's books!"},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"I have been in love with this series for over twenty years. For more than ten years of that time, it's been out of print. I don't know that I would read it today with the same eyes I did as a teen, but I still remember the liking and empathy I had for Tristan and his companions. I'm still impressed with the twist in how Tristan finds Valadan. The city of magicians is still wondrous, despite the many others I've read about since I discovered the flavors of this one.This is a book which takes fairy tale and epic fantasy, and twines them into one. As such, there will be familiar archetypes, but also new twists. There are shades of The Last Unicorn in Valadan's tale, while still being unique and different. Allaire's plight reminds the reader of Sleeping Beauty, but it's not the same tale at all. And, of course, Tristan calls to mind every orphaned hero since Arthur."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"The Ring of Allaire is the first book in the \\"Winter King's War\\" trilogy by Susan Dexter. While this series seems geared more towards a Young Adult audience I found the writing style very well done and easily enjoyed by adults as well. I would definitely consider Dexter's books a guilty pleasure, which initially I was quite, convinced I wouldn't enjoy. The story encompasses nearly every fantasy clich&eacute; there is, from an orphaned and inept wizard's apprentice, to intelligent and telepathically speaking animals, to sleeping princesses and wicked winter wizards with ice dragon guardians. And while this all may sound contrived and unoriginal that doesn't mean it doesn't make for a good story. I actually found myself enjoying some of the things I thought I would dislike the most. The premise for the story is simple. The young apprentice wizard Tristan (yeah I know....another fantasy story with someone named Tristan) returns home one day to find his master Blais slain by the evil ice wizard Nimir. Blais instructs Tristan from the beyond that he must continue the quest Blais started. The quest, to find the sleeping princess Allaire, rescue her from the clutches of Nimir, awaken her and find the rightful king to the throne of Calandra for her to marry. Tristan leaves his master's small cottage along with his familiar, Thomas (a talking cat...ugh I know, I know, just bare with me!) and Minstrel (a pet songbird...don't say it!) to begin the first part of their quest which is to find the famed warhorse of Esdragon, Valadan, on which the new king will ride. From here they begin their search for the sleeping princess and the throne's rightful heir. Here are my thoughts on The Ring of Allaire;Pros+ Well written, especially for a title geared more towards Young Adult readers.+ Quick, enjoyable and easy read.+ Quirky animal companions quickly grow on you. I especially loved Thomas the cat (his sarcasm is puuurrrfect...yeah I know, awful) and Minstrel the canary (just a cute little character...did I just say the bird was cute??).+ Has a world map, albeit rather barebones.+ Nice little plot twist at the end.+ Elisena evolves into a really great character.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Story moves too fast, especially in the beginning.- Some characters and their names are very stereotypical i.e. the bumbling wizard's apprentice, oafish and bullheaded warrior/knight, sleeping princess, talking cat/horse/bird etc.- Tristan's low self esteem and overly dramatic attitude can start to wear on you.- Heroes spend most of the book impoverished and starving. This started to bother me towards the end as they felt more like paupers than heroes.- Bad cover art.- Story states that thousands of wizards have gone searching for the kidnapped princess yet at the end of the book in the city of wizards no one there even remembers the quest. Also when they're in Darkenkeep (Nimir's stronghold) they literally only come across one hero entombed in ice...one! It just seems highly unlikely that thousands of wizards quested to find the princess only to fail.- Valadan the Warhorse of Esdragon is found way too quickly and easily.- Allaire evolves into a disappointing character.The whole reason I started this trilogy was because I found mint copies of books two and three at a local bookstore. The first time I picked them up, I looked at the covers, scoffed and thought to myself....\\"These books look and sound absolutely terrible!\\" The second time I went back to the bookstore I picked them up again. I decided to put my adult pessimism aside and gave them a try. I ordered the first in the series on Amazon and am now glad I did. I just started book two, \\"The Sword of Calandra\\" and am pleased to say that the series seems to have shifted to a slightly more adult style. As I mentioned earlier, this series quickly became a guilty pleasure. If you're willing to let your fantasy tastes stray to a simpler and somewhat clich&eacute;' story you just might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"This is an exciting and adventurous book.

When I had to buy (AGAIN!) yet ANOTHER copy of this trilogy(don't loan out books you love-they dont come back)I clicked on the link telling the publisher I would love to see this trilogy on Kindle.And Lo and behold it is. I love it. Twists and turns throughout the books. No Elves, No Orcs, no flaming Swords. Just an unwilling hero accompanied by three friends to go on a quest. Did I mention the three friends are a Horse, a Cat, and a Canary? And they can get rather bossy. And All Tristan wants to do is sleep, and maybe eat a meal once in awhile.The first book of the \\"WINTER KING'S WAR\\" is fun to read without all the mainstays you usually find in a fantasy. That doesn't mean, it's boring or doesnt have new tricksup it's sleeve.It's a Hero's Fantasy and all that, just dont expect a rehashed Tolkien-esque warmed over tale. This is a wonderful story woven with the authors gifted weaving with words.And It's the first part of a TRILOGY. So when you finish, you know there is more to read about this bickering band of cohorts and their adventures"},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"The novel features a magician's apprentice and a strapping warrior who ride off to rescue an enchanted sleeping damsel. Although this pretense for the story is unoriginal, the actual plot of the novel is distinct enough to keep it interesting. I found the first half of the novel (rescuing the damsel) very dull, but found the second half enjoyable.The characters are not fleshed-out enough to endear themselves to the reader, but they are well-constructed enough to avoid the 2-dimensional quality that can often haunt this type of stock fiction.As a whole, the book is nothing special. It's not entertaining enough to be recommendable, but if you're fishing through a pile of pulp fiction to find something to read before bed, it's better than most of the other books you will probably find."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"This book's a charming story. True, it uses nearly all the cliches of the genre (talking cat and horse, imprisoned princess, inexpert wizard's apprentice, etc.), yet Dexter crafts her characters with evident love and nuance that make the book extremely readable and a lot of fun. The relationships ring true as well. I heartily recommend it and the rest of the trilogy as a wonderful entrance or return to enchanting, lighthearted, elegant yet earnest adventure."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"This fun and original story starts out the traditional way, with a quest--the wizard apprentice and a big brawny warrior set out to rescue an enchanted princess.The ultimate evil has created a prophecy saying the princess needs three things to be rescued--a wizard, the true heir to the throne, and the immortal, warhorse, Valadan. For hundreds of years, wizards and heirs have set out on this fruitless quest, dying and draining the land of Caladan of all its wise leaders.When his master is killed, young, bumbling apprentice, Tristan, sets out to fulfill the quest, and he acquires the one thing that the others discounted--the fabulous lost warhorse. With Polassar, a conceited warrior of noble blood and Valadan, he sets out To rescue Allaire. But the quest is just the beginning and neither the quest nor the characters turn out to be just what they seemed to be. I can't say much more without giving the twist away.Oh, and one more thing for you animal lovers out there, Thomas, Tristan's familiar, is one of the most sarcastic cats you will ever come across. If cats aren't your style, there is Minstrel the brave canary, and of course, there is immortal Valadan, sired by the wind itself, the magical mysterious and wise warhorse.This is the start to one of those rare series where the books just get better and the final book, The Mountains of Channadran is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"THE RING OF ALLAIRE","review":"Intelligent, humorous and beautiful.

The latest one covers the book of James and is written by Thomas Manton. Like others in this series, it is a classic. Personally, I have found James to be one of the most practical, yet difficult books in the New Testament to follow. James includes a litany of pragmatic guidance to Christians, some which almost seem to contradict key Protestant theological concepts - such as salvation by grace, alone. Martin Luther and several others have struggled to determine where the practical advise that James includes should be placed in relationship to other key Christian doctrines.Given the fact that James contains only five chapters, this commentary is actually pretty long (over 350 pages). But, it is well worth the read since Thomas Manton explains in great detail his understanding of each chapter and verse. I learned a lot from this commentary and feel that I have a much better feel for the book of James. Although this commentary was written hundreds of years ago, the content is still very relevant. Modern believers, like myself, need to know what James means when he writes about controlling our tongue (words), and putting our faith into action.If you are a Christian who would like to gain a much deeper grasp of the book of James, and the wisdom contained within it, then I highly recommend this commentary."},{"Title":"The case of Mr. Crump","review":"I stumbled upon this book completely accidently in a used book store.

Author-Historian Peter Elstob meticulously assembles the story of this great campaign from inception to snowy conclusion. The author painstakingly describes the events and decisions leading up to this great battle. HITLER'S LAST OFFENSIVE is a great companion volume to other Battle of the Bulge books such as DARK DECEMBER, A TIME FOR TRUMPETS, and BATTLE: STORY OF THE BULGE.The current paperback reissue, similar to the previous paperback edition, is burdened by a voluminous word count on each page. As such, the book is sometimes a challenge to read. Additionally, Elstob packed this book with so much information that many of the individual battles, such as Peiper's dash to La Gleize and the 2nd Panzer Division's debacle at Celles, receive only peripheral treatment. Elstob's narrative also jumps from one shoulder of the Bulge to another and casually includes place names as if the reader was already familiar with the area. The maps in the book are insufficient to cross reference the location of all the action.In summary however, this book is one of the better military history references regarding the Battle of the Bulge. It is a relief to see that Elstob's book is still available, and eminently affordable."},{"Title":"Hitler's Last Offensive (Pen & Sword Military Classics)","review":"This book presents the Battle of the Buldge in great detail. The author did a spectacular job in research, and bringing that information to you. Because of the detail, it is not an easy book to read. But, you will walk away from this book knowing the battle inside and out, from both the German and Allied point of view. The book starts with detailed preparations that Hitler took prior to the battle, then followed a chronology of how the battle unfolded at the division level, on both the German and the Allied sides. You are taken to each town and village, and get to see the circumstances, how each battle was fought, and the outcome. The author also describes what the commanders of both sides were thinking, and how strategies changed as battle continued on from one day to the next. The book concludes with the overall outcome of the battle, the losses, and what (if anything) was accomplished from this. It was a bitter, bloody, and vicious battle, that costed 30,000 men their lives, and it repainted for me a completely different impression of what the Battle of the Buldge was really like. My only complaint about the book: despite the fact that the author did provide detailed maps, I wish their were more maps that I could have used to follow the battles in greater detail."},{"Title":"John Keble: A study in limitations","review":"The author emphasizes the personal life of John Keble and seems to have insight into Keble the poet, but she is no theologian and lacks the ability to make a critical evaluation of the role Keble played in the Oxford movement.

Without making accusations and generating theories without context, the author is able to breakdown his research to show trends and examples from real TV news broadcasts. He gives you room to think for yourself.I would recommend reading this book in conjunction with How to Watch TV News by Neil Postman."},{"Title":"Bavarian Lager: Beerhall Helles History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"Do you like german beer? If you do, get this book. This is the recipe key for that famous blond beer served in Bavaria. If you like the red beer, then get the book on octoberfest beer (marzen). This book will help you formulate a tasty, balanced, perfectly malty brew that is delightful. Fifty percent of my brews are helles beers, and once you get them right, I think yours may be too.For the most authentic taste, I recommend incorporating decoction mashing. This subject is not covered in this text, but is in a book titled: NEW BREWING LAGER BEER.Don't forget to drink to the foam (safely) and dance to merry music with a partner! Have fun. Auf Wiedersehen."},{"Title":"Bavarian Lager: Beerhall Helles History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"The various books in the Classic Beer Style series are as mixed of a bag as their subjects. While each makes an effort to provide a bit of a history lesson, some technical background and a few recipes for the homebrewer, each author seems to have been pretty much left to work out the details. As a result, some examples got lost by being muddled with too much history, too many technical details or recipes that are at the extremes of the complexity scale.Dornbusch managed to get a great balance of the three in this book, and he presents it in a style that shows that he downright enjoys his subject. The result is a book that, from a homebrewer's standpoint, is actually fun to read. But most importantly, you can make some pretty good brews from his recipes."},{"Title":"Bavarian Lager: Beerhall Helles History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"Having spent many nights in the Spaten and Augustiner beer halls this is a good book which reviews the style well.

The most common beer in Augsburg was the local Helles lager. In Bavaria every little town has their own version of beer and the breweries date back hundreds of years, some to before the Reformation. The only way to get a real Bavarian Helles in the United States is to brew it yourself. I stopped into the local craft brewer, who brews nothing but lagers and asked him that question, and he said it really doesn't fit within the American concept of either the \\"whatever you want to call the stuff produced by the major breweries\\" or it is too subtile for those who drink the majority of the craft brewed ales.This is a great book and it gives a good history about the development of this type of beer -- in Munich. It ignores the rest of the diversity of most Bavarian beers, but where do you stop? In southern Germany, beer is considered one of the essential food groups, Slowly American tastes are changing and skunkie aftertaste ales will begin to loose some of their charm. The crisp clean aftertaste of a good Bavarian Helles will help change the perceptions you of your friends.I am just beginning my home brewing craft, and my direction is to move to Bavarian Helles as quick as my knowledge and equipment allow. If you already are set up to brew real lagers the right way, or even the way they did it 500 years ago, buy the book, make the beer and enjoy!PS: I changed this title a little bit, the most commonly available brew I am aware of in North America that is somewhat like the Bavarian Helles, is Labatts, but it is brewed with a different hop blend."},{"Title":"Bavarian Lager: Beerhall Helles History, Brewing Techniques, Recipes (Classic Beer Style)","review":"wow. great book and very insightful into what is really a niche beer in bavaria, and almost unknown elsewhere. great commentary about brewing methods, and even an indepth discussion about mash thickness, pH, water chemistry, infusions vs decoctions (and how to do both with and acid rest included!), all in a relatively approachable manner, especially if you have read a few of these books. perhaps brewers publications could commission Herr Dornbush to write/rewrite marzen, and perhaps do a book on munich dunkel, berliner weisse, and some other beers. very enjoyable to read, and i was able to tear through it in 3 hours or so. a definite must if you like the style, are interested in the style, or are just interested in German beer. I would give it a 4/5 as this is a niche style, and the recipes are all pretty much the same. the author had gone into how some of the german brewers who had created helles had also created marzen and vienna, and perhaps some discussion of those and recipes (to see how the style evolved into a pale lager) and perhaps even some discussion about munich dunkle would urge me to say perfect. I am, of course, using the Pale Ales book as a template here, where the author goes into pale ale, ipa, bitters, and even a bit about mild ales. helles could potentially be presented in an analogous fashion.

Many of the papers have been updated since the 1994 edition, and others have been added. The book is divided into 3 parts: Language in Singapore, Language in Society, and Language in Education. The language experiences and status of the three major ethnic groups of Singapore, Chinese, Malay and Indians, are each described in separate chapters. Singapore English is also considered extensively.One striking fact about Singaporean language policy that comes out repeatedly in the papers of this volume is how the government gives preferential treatment towards Mandarin Chinese, and dismisses other dialects of Chinese as merely \\"dialects\\". It would have been nice if the book had included a paper on the motivations behind this policy and how non-Mandarin speakers feel about the policy. However, such questions may not be political acceptable to the government so the omission is understandable.On the whole, the papers in the volume are very well written, with few exceptions. Many of the papers in the first 2 parts of the book might appeal to anyone interested in sociolinguistic and language planning issues. The third part of the book may only interest Singapore specialists, however."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright (Architectural Monographs, No. 18)","review":"In this album review, 83 architectural projects (mostly houses) are illustrated by excellent signature photos in color and without text descriptions or technical drawings.

The city eventually reaches where he lives, and the things that make his favorite sounds (crickets, birds, etc) find new homes or are drowned out by other noises. He looks for a new home that's not too noisy but not too quiet and finds a music shop. He makes his home inside a guitar that he plays at night, and people think it's a magic guitar, because they can't see him. A man named Tex buys the guitar with Sylvester in it and goes traveling to the country. Sylvester comes out of the guitar and becomes friends with Tex, and they travel together making music.It's a simple story that I loved growing up. I'd been looking for it for a long time before I found a copy available, and I was afraid I had hyped it up too much and that my kids wouldn't care for it. Well, my son did love it! He was about 15 months when we bought it, 2 now, but he's also obsessed with guitars, so that could be part of why he likes it!

It is perfect because it asks a question that needs to be asked right here, right now. People have always professed to know what God wants--how arrogant!

Religions from around the globe try to teach love yet for some reason only inspire what 'man wants.' I love sharing this book with my friends and my family. It has led to wonderful discussions about the important things in life.

His first book \`Conversations With God Book 1' was a feast for the soul, in my view, but these later books, particularly those written in the last 5 years, seem to be more of an expression of Walsch's impatience and irritability than inspired wisdom.Humanity is still in its childhood, in terms of spiritual growth, yet the way Walsch attacks certain views and beliefs, like the quote from Al Gore near the beginning of the book, is a bit like attacking a three-year old for dribbling food down its chin. The popular mind will grow into a more mature view in good time, and in turn will adopt wiser philosophies and will begin to behave more like adults. But in the meantime, the 'enlightened few' can cultivate a bit of patience, can relax, and can accept that the popular mind's views are presently somewhat unenlightened, without feeling the need to attack them or get irritated by them.There's room for growth for Walsch, for sure, just as we all have room for growth. We are all 'where we are' on the path, just as Al Gore is 'where he is' on the path. The more we can accept the way things are, without judging or feeling irritated, the more inner peace we will experience, regardless of external conditions and regardless of other people's views or opinions.In my view, Walsch said everything he needed to say in his first book, and his later books are getting somewhat tired."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I must say I'm a little saddened that the majority of bad reviews come from devout Christians, whose calls to \\"read the Bible instead!\\" might form a justification for this book's self-aggrandising assertion that it is \\"a dangerous book\\".I can scarcely believe anybody actually bought the book after reading the opening chapter, which I quote here in full: \\"Very few people will be able to believe what's in this book. At least, at first. That may make it one of the most unbelievable books of all time.\\" I mean, seriously? This is how you're going to start? Who carries on reading a book which starts with such a patently nonsensical statement?Chapter 2 is not much longer, and winds up as follows: \\"Such ideas, if accepted and adopted, will produce dramatically different ways of living and being. Values will change. Priorities will change. Power structures and power *holders* will change. Some of those power holders do not want any of this to happen. That may make this not only one of the most unbelievable books of all time, but also one of the most dangerous.\\"And there you have it. Never mind \\"Das Kapital\\", \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" or \\"Mein Kampf\\", it's \\"What God Wants\\" that is truly a dangerous book! After all, it says so itself!Having quickly browsed the book, I discovered very quickly the answer to Walsch's question. Apparently what God wants is \\"Nothing\\", based, apparently, on the notion that an omniscient, omnipresent God can literally \\"want\\" for nothing, since He already *has* everything. That's fine, but then what? Turning to near the end, there was a sub-heading \\"Morality\\", which began (from memory) - \\"Morality won't change, because God wants nothing.\\" When I lost my faith in God and became an atheist, I had to think about and derive my own moral code, based on certain basic humanity-based precepts. But that whole question as to what defines morality in a Godless (or as Walsch puts it, \\"a Wantless God\\") Universe, deserves a little more exploration and consideration than half a page almost written as an afterthought.The thesis of the book seems clear enough - all that's required is for the entire six billion population of the Earth to think the way Neale Walsch does, about Life, about God, about each other, and yadayadayada. This may surprise Neale Walsch, but the vast majority of people actually do behave as if God doesn't want anything from them, and I don't mean that in a bad or cynical way: most of us give our fellow human beings a certain amount of priority and consideration, as opposed to pursuing a single-minded trip to Heaven. But there are always those extremists - on all sides of the religious spectrum, and on the political. So what Walsch is pretty much suggesting is, \\"Abolish extremism!\\" All we have to do is sit down with Osama Bin Laden and Benjamin Netanyahu, give them \\"What God Wants\\" and see them embrace each other, crying \\"What have we been doing? God doesn't want anything! Here, have Palestine back, God never wanted us to live there in the first place!\\" \\"No, no, keep it! I insist! Turns out I was wrong - God didn't want me to blow up the twin towers\\"The writing style is somewhat hectoring, like being cornered by a bore at a party: \\"What does God want? Nothing ... Even if you disagree with this vehemently, think about it ... What makes you disagree? Who told you this statement could not be true? What makes *them* right? ... Because they read it in a book? But then, what makes the book right?\\" You can practically feel Walsch's finger pounding into your chest. And note the hubris of dismissing a book ... in a book!Ultimately, it is amazing to me that someone can express such baseless pretensions to philosophical and theological importance, in a seventh-grade writing style, and actually get published, let alone sell the substantial numbers it undoubtedly has. Ironically, one good thing the book might encourage people to do is to think more skeptically, but if everybody did that, Neale Donald Walsch wouldn't have sold Copy One, let alone fifteen books of vapid claptrap."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Brilliant!

He would have us believe that God sent His Son for no other reason than to have a nice little chat with us and that Christ didn't really mean it when He said \\"No one comes to the Father except by me.\\" The author forgets that Christ stated specifically that faith in Him was required to be with the Father.

Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Would be unfair to comment more than this having not read the book but the danger would be in doing so in the first place. From what could be gleaned here and from his website would go a bit farther than dangerous, frightening. Don't have an agenda nor an axe to grind. A statement like this is a cause for concern:\\"Humanity's ideas about God produce...\\"Wait a minute isn't this precisely the problem? Can we with full consciousness just cherry-pick out that which we as mere creatures decide how the Creator thinks? It is not possible for all 'religions' to be true at the same time.A better case for all this has been stated before and frankly, a better read would be someone like Francis Schaeffer:\\"Let's consider 'The God Who Is There first'. The major thesis in this book is that modern man has abandoned the idea of truth, and that has had widespread consequences in every area of life.In his argumentation, Schaeffer summarizes the last half of the twentieth century, tracing the development of the intellectual climate in Western society. Previous generations had grown up with a basic operational belief that the law of non-contradiction was true. What Schaeffer would have us understand about the law of non- contradiction is this: a statement cannot be both true and false in the same way at the same time. For example, you are either reading this essay or you are not. You cannot be both reading this and not reading it at the same time. Either you are or you are not--choose one.When we hear something like this, our first reaction is \\"of course we believe in this law of non-contradiction.\\" We believe in it and live by it, even if we did not know what it was called until just a few moments ago. But Schaeffer points out that there has been a gradual decline of belief in this basic principle beginning with philosophy in the late eighteenth century. This first step in the movement away from reason is followed by second and third steps in the areas of art and music. These are, in turn, followed by the fourth steps of general culture and theology. There is much debate about which step came first and who followed whom. The important thing to realize is that after the seventeenth and eighteenth century Enlightenment in Europe, and certainly before the height of the Industrial age, men in the highest positions of academic and artistic life began to think very differently.In the first half of this century, Western man began to think in terms of mutually exclusive truths. In other words, we began to believe that two people could believe mutually exclusive truths simultaneously and both of them could be correct. This would be like two people seeing an object and one claiming that it existed and the other claiming that it did not exist. The two men shake hands and say that they are both right in their conclusions. Objective reality is completely undermined and nothing is true. The result of this thinking is that man begins to despair of his condition.{3} He doesn't know what is ultimately true.Schaeffer's ambition was to help Christians be salt and light in our world. And to do that, we have to understand how people think. Schaeffer also cautions Christians against capitulation to irrationality themselves.{4} In the spirit of cooperation, many Christians are choosing to remain silent when they hear people say that all religions are the same, or that Christianity may be true for one person, but not true for another. Christians cannot afford to remain silent in a world that is embracing irrationality. The unity of orthodox Christianity should be centered and grounded on truth. This is not always easy, but it is absolutely necessary.\\"From http://www.probe.org/docs/schaeffer.htmlFrom the introduction of this book \\"What God Wants\\";\\"Al Gore's insight leaves us all facing a thunderous question: Is the way forward by the way of going way back? The answer is no.\\"Well, the answer is YES and it was because of an about face away from what much of this modern day quagmire of self gratifying 'religion' that sent me on a reverse course. Dear people, whoever you are, truth can only be defined one way. We know this instinctively. While I certainly can empathize with many on all the misunderstood aspects of Christianity, what it may seem on the surface and is in large part 'taught' as in our day is not what is at the core of it's pronouncements. All of scripture at some point breaks down into the matter of the heart. If we are honest enough to let God examine us, as He is the creator of all things it becomes readily apparent what our true state is and our need for a Saviour.

You'll want to go back and read the others whilst going forward into a New Spirituality.For those who have already read his earlier books, this is Dynamite as well!It's Time. Thanks to the author for his Courage and Spirit! Bravo!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Before reading Neale Walsch's books, I was an athiest who believed that reality was made up of only things I could see, hear, touch, smell, or feel. These book haven't changed my beliefs, but merely have helped me to expand my perspective. This latest book may just be Neale's most important work because it's short, concise, and extremely liberating and powerful. I believe that, in the future, this book will be considered a classic of spiritual as well as world writing. Emanuele Capozzi, Roma Italy"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"A rejuvenation and expansion of all our ancient spiritual texts and the beliefs they engender is clearly very long overdue. It has, and still, makes absolutely zero sense to me why The Creator of All That Is, including humanity would design and build a system that is destined to kill itself. Why bother making it in the first place? Yet this is what the draconian god of history purportedly endorses: killing, maiming and destruction; and thus, this is what we have been doing to each other for millennia.In \\"What God Wants,\\" Mr. Walsch contends very emphatically and rationally that God wants absolutely, without hesitation or equivocation.......NOTHING! God is life, the very life that moves in and through us as us. There is NO SEPERATION between God and anything - animal, vegetable or mineral. So what could She possibly want, She is everything that we know and everything that we don't! What else is there? And if there is anything else, He is that too! This book offers among many things, this extremely profound yet simple statement \\"Our will for us, is Gods will for us.\\" That is: WE get to choose what we will feel, think, create and experience. Sadly, this we have done to death. Wrought with refreshing, concise, yet simply expressed wisdom - I CHOOSE to award this venerable work with 5 stars."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"First of all, I was compelled to read this book as I have loved others by Neale Donald Walsch.I picked it up and finished it a couple hours later. In my opinion it simplified the entire spiritual journey for me. Without negating belief systems/religions it offers a new fresh new prospective of God to the human experience on this planet.I had a deep feeling of peace and contentment upon finishing the book and I would recommend it highly to the spiritual seeker."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"If you like any of Neale's other books then this is a must read. Don't start the series with this volume or you may become confused and not read others in the CWG linage. It is well worth your time."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I picked this book up in a surplus store for 2 dollars, without knowing what it was about. As a strong atheist who has 25+ years of Christianity in my past, I often revisit my views and study Christian apologetics to see the newest arguments I'll be facing while defending my lack of faith. I assumed that I was picking up this type of book when I saw \\"What God Wants\\" on the cover.What I read on the inside, however, was a perfectly honest view of the damage that organized religion has perpetrated on mankind and the earth since civilizations first took root in the fertile crescent, and the answer that all faithless people understand to be truth in regards to the ultimate healing of that damage.While I agree that Walsch's style in the opening chapters is quite melodramatic and repetitive, I believe that in order to keep people of traditional faith reading he had to do this.The metaphoric 'God' that Walsch uses in this volume is confusing, on purpose, no doubt. The notion of 'God as Life within each of us, outside of none' sounds very atheistic to me, so I'm not sure what the need for the whole relativism vibe is. If you can be comfortable with the view that God wants nothing, than you can be comfortable with the fact that there is no God. There aren't a host of truths.On the whole, this is a book that I think all of humanity needs to read, solely for it's logical humanistic approach to shattering the need for ancient mythical religions to explain the paths that our lives take."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"What God Wants is on of the most essential books written on the subject of spirituality and religion. It simply states that humanity's present conditions are the result of our believes about God. Those believes proclaimed by most organized religions are inaccurate and limited. If we want to change a course of human history toward peace and harmony we need to expand on our understanding of God and life. Walsh's book sends clear and consice messsage to all humanity.Our old religious believes do not work anymore. Our ideas about God are incomplete and disfunctional.I would recommend this as well other books written by Walsh to everyone who searches for new understandings and new spiritual ideas."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I read this book in one sitting and I wish everyone would read this and \\"get it\\". I read the other 1 star reviews and to those peolpe I say....wake up! We don't need fear-based religions (clubs) that misinterpret what God wants. We Are All One! Remember that.An ex-Catholic"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"After reading the original Conversations with God series I thought I had read all there was to know about this topic and truly believed this of all the many books on spirituality was from God,until I read Friendship With God. That presented even more extremely valuable, usable information, which prompted me to read What God Wants. I am amazed how much new information is shared in this book. It starts out as a reminder of previous ideas, but ends with techniques I have since used with unbelievable success. Our thoughts really do determine our lives, not the reverse."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Please read this book. Throughout mankind, people have used God's name to command, manipulate, kill and control us. I searched and searched for the Truth, which I Was sure existed until I reached 56 years old. I am now seventy. It took me all that time to discover Adi Da Samraj and His writings. No other books told me what He does. When I opened His books, for the first time in my life, I knew I was reading the truth. I ordered all His books. What God Wants, was not available at this time.and it took way too long to understand what was true and how to change the world. Fortunately Neale Donald Walsh has written the Truth. This is a simple, little book that is not simple at all. It is overwhelming to read his words. It is an opportunity beyond measure. Conversations with God opened up a whole new way of looking at God. This book tops them all. He has brought so much truth to our world and certainly knows what the truth is. I found it amazing to realize,that The New York times is not willing to review his books. Pretty scarey. I also learned why people don't want to lean anything new about God. We put our heads down, and never accept the perfection, unwillling to accept all that is actually always here for us. Everyone of us. We are one with God and we will have to understand that, before our world begins to heal. Right now the times are so terrifying and people don't even know or want to know what to do. I believe this book, will be a wonderful influence on our society, if people will just read and understand it. I have my Teacher, Adi Da Samraj, who takes me farther. He came when I prayed for a live teacher, but this is a perfect start for anyone who knows what life should be and is not willing to compromise."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"As usual, Neale Donald Walsch has come through again!! For anyone new to his books, this might be a bit overwhelming, but to those of us who have been reading his books for years, this is just wonderful!! I am so thankful for the insights he has brought to the world, if only more people could read & understand! But I know - this is how it goes!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"What God Wants can only be considered a dangerous book by those who are satisfied with the status quo with regard to humanity's current understanding of who and what God is (or is not). For those looking for a new understanding of and appreciation for the life force animating all life everywhere, this book has the potential to revolutionize their thinking about the nature of divine will. For seekers of a new idea about mankind's ultimate destiny, it offers peace for the mind and soul, and God is portrayed as the process informing our future choices for ourselves and the world. In this book, Walsch's most recent to date, he attempts to reach a wider audience with an urgent message: change is inevitable, but we are the final arbiters of HOW it changes, whether for good or ill. We are the co-creators of our own destinies; our will is God's will for us. Will we freely choose to see that our beliefs create the world around us? Can we accept that our choices have historically led to much human suffering? Given the state of world affairs today, logic and intuition seem to suggest that there might be something missing in the traditional & cultural teachings about God. Science currently corroborates what all faiths have taught . . . everything in existence in the universe originates from the same source and is made of the same stuff, including us. Walsch expands that notion to include God; therefore we and God are one and the same since there is nothing that God is not. If one proceeds with this understanding, he or she will never feel alone or separate again. More importantly, that person will begin to see that our choices affect the collective All That Is."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"For me this is in many ways the strongest of Neale Donald Walsch's books. As well as containing the essence of all his other work, it focuses on one of the most important issues of our time, that is, the failure of the world's organised religions to start waking up and acknowledging that humanity might have got it wrong about 'what god wants'. Those familiar with Neale's work might already guess the answer to the question; to others it could come as an astounding revelation. Neale points out that you don't need to believe in God or be 'religious' to read the book, as all secular society's essential values are based on our religious teachings. In many ways this book is therefore a 'State of the Nation' declaration, in which a clear analysis of current world problems is followed by practical ways forward. What God Wants is a truly joyous and inspiring book, arriving at a time when, as Neale so clearly demonstrates, what we are doing on this planet simply isn't working. The book's power and potential threat are demonstrated perfectly by the mobilisation of large numbers of Christian (so called) fundamentalists who have apparently been instructed to give the book the minimum rating at amazon, barnes and noble, etc, in order to create the lowest average star rating! If you want to know what these people are so afraid of buy the book... If you believe in freedom of speech, in the necessity of questioning current religious thought and practice, and in being part of the saving of humanity and this planet, then PLEASE BUY THIS WONDERFUL BOOK!!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I had previously read the \\"Conversations With God\\" series by this same author. This little book compresses those same TRUTHS into one of the most important books of our time. Also, I have studied the MOST IMPORTANT book of any time - \\"A Course in Miracles\\" and this little book, \\"What God Wants,\\" incorporates those most wondrous and encouraging and liberating truths at a level for most anyone's understanding capabilities. Also, this book has the same truths presented in a similar vein as \\"Disappearance of the Universe.\\" Guess by now you have figured out that TRUTH is truth and cannot be destroyed, and can be recognized in all the various religions, spiritual books, and wherever you find it. It's just so miraculous to be fully and finally free of guilt, erroneous belief in hell, and to understand more clearly how we as ONE WITH GOD (there is nothing besides God) have constructed/made this world through \\"projection\\" - through our own thoughts. We are not here to \\"discover\\" but to \\"create.\\" Our thoughts are the means of this CREATION. There is only love or fear. Which do you choose?"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"With all this hype about end of days. All the doomsay and conjecture, judgement and condemnation I thank God for writers such as NDW. Who said that God stops talking to us or only through people (usually men) thousands of years ago? Who says that superiority exists, that some races or people are better than others? Organised religions say such things.Thank God for such organistations I say. How else would we be able to see how not to be? Without the experience of relativity or the opposite how could we use this contextual field to experience our own divinity.These books urge us to be the change we wish to see in the world, to look around and see the beauty and perfection in all things great and small, pretty and not so pretty. Open your eyes to see God in all her glory, in the eyes of your children and loved ones, your pets and this amazing abundant and glorious realm of the relative we call earth. Lets not consider that it is over, it has just begun. We have it all here and now and thats what Neale's work shares with us. To love as a sponsoring thought, not to fear.What God wants is brilliant, though the first to say \\"Mine is not the only way, merely another way\\". All roads lead to God, lets take a pleasant road my friends, have we not made our journey tough enough so far.LoveAndrew"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This book finally gets to the heart of the misery created by by so many cultures around the world and throughout time, religious ideology. Peel back the layers of the onion and what do you see? Until humanity \\"gets it\\" that God wants NOTHING from us, we will keep killing each other to impose our particular beliefs about God on each other. This writing is pure genius."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The Christmas message, professed by Christians, is generally not practiced by Christians, Jews, Muslims or anyone. As Neale points out, the basic cause for most of the world's existing problems is that, through religion, we all use \\"God\\" as the reason we can attack, kill and hurt anyone different than ourselves, whoever we may be. Each group sees itself as the \\"right\\" or \\"chosen\\" people. Anyone not from that group is \\"them\\" and will be damned to eternal damnation. Well, if God can do that, then it's OK for us to do that too, right? The overall message of the book is that we are all ONE. One people intertwined with One God. There is no seperation between us or God. Neale does NOT put down religion; he is now adding to what we all know in our hearts to be true. For God's sake, we have no idea what's in our own oceans, how can we profess to know everything there is to know about God or Life?Maybe it is time we admitted we may not know everything there is to know about God. Maybe ... just maybe ... we are all equal brothers and sisters in His, Hers or It's eyes? Does it matter HOW you choose to honor God and Life? Does it matter which road you choose as long as it gets you there and you can assist others along the way? I know of a truly great Human Being who was put on a cross and killed because he said to love everyone as you want to be loved yourself. He also said that God's house should not be used as a place of business - he even upturned carts and created quite the scene. So ... He hit certain people in the wallet and up on a cross He went. Guess what? That is the reason religion today keeps us all seperate ... to keep the wallets as full as possible.Time to bring down the barriers while we celebrate our differences. God loves us all ... each and every one of us. Remember, He made us in His image, but we keep trying to do the reverse and turn Him into a selfish, temper-tantrum throwing, angry Human.God Bless and Love to All."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This is really a book for everyone, everywhere, to read right now. It's a wake up call and an invitation to consider changes in our thinking and beliefs that are positive, uplifting, and exciting. What a great book."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I highly recommend this book, but only for the open minded among us who still seek eternal truth, for they shall receive enlightenment from within. For those among us who are closed minded that believe that they already have all of the answers, they shall probably find this book not very interesting and quite challenging to keep up with."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Rarely does a book make you realize how wrong-minded our thinking is. This book turns our brain around into right-minded thinking, and teaches us what actually works in the world, because what we have done so far is definitely not working. Pick up this book and challenge your mind, open your heart, and reinvigorate your soul!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I have many of Neale Donald Walsch's books and I have not read one yet that did not resonate of my truth. Even though I already knew that God doesn't want anything, I chose to read this book because I knew it would expand my existing understanding of God. We live in a world that is desperate for a new understanding of God and I feel What God Wants could help many continue their exploration of God. It is not the only book but certainly one that may help each of us expand our knowledge of God."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I accept the concept that God wants nothing from people. If you can agree with this statement then this wonderful book reads like running water. I find Walsch insightful and need driven. He is compelled to share information that is changing his life. This book is about changing concepts that are not working for the world. Read this book and let's see if we can alter our global direction."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This is the most incredible book i have read in awhile. No where have i read a book that lays it all out for you in such plain, easy to understand language.If you have ever been confused with how God has been taught to you and at times, have a hard time in coming to terms with life, the world, and God.....READ THIS BOOK. I have to admit i have always had this sort of relationship with God, but it is refreshing to hear another come out and say it like it is.All persons would be greatly blessed to experience all this book has to offer. If you read any spiritual literature this year, be sure it is this book."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Walsh has yet again opened my mind even further. In some ways, he is saying that religion gets in the way of one's relationship with God, especially when a religion demands blind faith, no questions asked. Walsch encourages each of us to ask questions, to challenge traditional religious beliefs, and to look within ourselves for our own truths. The first half of the book poses questions that will, hopefully, challenge the reader to look within. And his chapter 13 is masterful.Walsch points out that most areas of human thought and knowledge are continually brought up to date with new knowledge, experience, new ways of thinking. This is especially so in the scientific world. (just ask any physicist). What has not been subject to this renewal of thought are the teachings of traditional organized religions. (just ask any fundamentalist). It seems that God is out-of-bounds to updated thinking.Walsh clearly calls for a renewal of thought amongst all the religions of the world -- not to abandon their teachings, but to expand their teachings to be more inclusive."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Neale Donald Walsch continues to hold his heart and the hearts of all of us in his powerful hands while he plows diligently, confidently and bravely into a new Paradigm for all of humanity. My life has transformed through Neale's previous books and \\"What God Wants\\" provides yet a clearer picture of what is possible if we'll only stop to think! He provides very concrete ideas with which I can continue my transformative work. Neale, keep the Wisdom coming!Sincerely, Meda ChristianiMeda-Christiani@web.de"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Read this book! Although some of the concepts presented here may seem radical at first, if you read this book with an open mind and give the ideas in this book a fair chance you may very well see the elegant simplicity, balance, and logic of the concepts presented here.

Excellent!!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"A truly wonderful book wich aligns us with our intuition of how loving God is.As with the recent other writings by Neale Donal Walsh, this one reinforces a view and paradigms of how human spirituality functions at best. It has the wisdom, tolerance and joy for life of true spirituality.I heartily recommend it to anyone, believer as well as non-believer, who are looking to find again natural peace of mind and elation at being alive right now, despite the apparent chaos that life may seem to be.

Chapter 13 REALLY says it ALL. It is the present for everyone on your gifting lists. Randomly placed in church pews, this book is the answer to countless prayers of those who are tired of reciting, \\"BAAAA RAM EWE\\" and desparately need reading material, other than the hymnal and tithing envelopes, to actually feed the soul while enduring the same ole sermon....\\"Blah, blah, blah...repent or go to hell...Blah, blah, blah\\".NDW, for those who have less than glowing things to say about your work.....Simply pull out your best smile and southern accent, replying sincerely, \\"How nice\\".Highest Regards and Warmest Wishes,Rachel"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The negative reviews of this book seem to be from christians who can't accept ideas about God which disagree with their own.If a person looks inside themselves for the truth about God, \\"What God Wants\\" will resound with them in a profound way. \\"What God Wants\\" presents ideas and truths, that will end the pain and suffering on this planet brought by major religions).Say this and see how it feels:We are all one.Say it over and over again.We are all one.No path to God, no religion, is any better than any other.We are all one.If religious fundamentalists could say: \\"ours is not the only way, ours is just another way\\", then peace, and heaven-on-Earth will follow.It's quite literally as simple as that."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"In 1980 after learning about the near death experience, I came to the conclusion that God does not judge us. God loves us unconditionally. How freeing that was for me and can be for those raised with a judgmental God.Then in 2001, I came to the realization that God was either male or female. God is an energy. Therefore, since everything is made up of energy, God is both within us and in everything.Neale Donald Walsch's 'What God Wants\\" was a real pleasure to read, because was a validation of many personal conclusions.If you do not start with my viewpoints, \\"What God Wants\\" will challenge you to explore exactly what you do believe. Whether you expand your attitudes or not, it will start you to think and question the beliefs of your parents, your religion and yourself. Once you complete this exploratory process, you will feel both more certain and comfortable within yourself and your spiritual beliefs.Open your mind and explore with your heart to find your answers of what you believe God wants and why we are here."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I have read ALL of Neale Donald Walsch's books.I have had the privilege of hearing Mr. Walsch present the wisdom contained within his publications in person. I have also travelled to his hometown of Ashland, Oregon to attend a retreat, where I was fortunate enough to meet with him, his wife and family personally at their home following the weekend of enlightenment. And finally, Neale Donald Walsch and the CWG texts literally saved my life a few years ago - by convincing me that God loves me and that taking my own life was not something my soul was ready for. In his latest book, WHAT GOD WANTS, the messages, wisdom, inspiring words and enlightening ideas have brought me even closer to God, who I KNOW is all-loving, all-forgiving, non-judgmental and one who wants or needs nothing from us. I KNOW this, I don't just believe this, because God has proven this to me in my own life time and time again. It's very discouraging when religious fundamentalists attempt to discredit words and messages, and messengers, for that matter, that are brining new hope to the lives of people who have lost it. I was born and raised a Catholic. My father was a priest, for heaven's sake. And still, I remain open to the possibility that the things I was taught about God as a child may not have been entirely correct. GOD exemplifies change, without change we would not exists (ie. without God we would not exist). So, I encourage anyone reading this to run out and pick up a copy of WHAT GOD WANTS and see for yourself that God loves you and has only one desire for you - your happiness and fulfilment. It's a great read by a great author.Live a little - buy the book - then love ALOT!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"There is a dance between this human life and something one might call the other side. This other side is the awareness and consciousness of God. Neale Donald Walsh has once again skipped through this wonderful dance with his book What God Wants. Just like Communion With God, this book touched my consciousness with it's simple message. \\"What ever YOU want, GOD wants.\\"This is such a simple message, but difficult to advance because centuries of religious dogma have taught us otherwise. Remember, tt was very hard proving to Dark Age citizens that the world wasn't flat. Neale Donald Walsh takes pen to paper and writes from the heart to break down humanities resistance to allowing God to speak and work through each and every one of us.This book is a treasure. And now, it is my most favorite Neale Donald Walsh book."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Based on the reviews, one is either going to absolutely adored this book or hate it. For me, absolutely 5 stars. Having been born and raised in an organized religion, it has always been difficult to explain to others why I no longer choose to be active. Being \\"inactive\\" seemed not the right word for how I felt as far as my relationship to God and my spirituality. All of Neale's book have helped me to clarify my true reality. I don't see myself as being inactive but rather I \\"graduated\\". My spirituality needed to be less restrictive and more inclusive. I use to think freedom was having more money and more time to enjoy one's accumulation. Neale's books have transformed for me what true freedom is - freedom from old and manipulative beliefs about God. The ironic truth to me about these reviews is we can all be right - because that is our reality as we know it. What God Wants for me clearly shows I do not have the follow the path of a One-star reviewer, but neither do they have to follow me - in fact, that's the whole point of the book to me. Now I can truly live my mortal life creating miracles. For me, miracles, is simply creating the outcomes I desire!! So embrace what you belief. Thanks God, Thanks Neale, and Thanks to me."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"In this stunning new book Walsch shows us the key to countering all the hate that has been generated in God's name, a trend that unfortunately is escalating all around the world in these troubled times. The key is God's love, and not just for those of our own belief system but for every person,plant and animal in our world. God does not hate and does not instruct us to. God is all-forgiving and is the source of compassion. Those who would interpret His message in a way that creates conflict are speaking for themselves and not the Creator."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The title of this very important book really blows me away...\\"What God Wants?\\" Haven't you, in your moments of despair, looked up in the sky and asked the question, \\"What do you want from me, God?\\" I know I have and I know that I have done it many, many times.I once thought that God wanted me to \\"accept His only begotten Son.\\" I thought he wanted me to be a Born Again Christian because I was told that it would really please the Almighty. Well, maybe it pleased Him...but it sure didn't please me. I felt horrible during those years. I felt like I was constantly under scrutiny. No matter what I did, I felt like I was being judged and punished and I was...not by God, mind you...but by ME! Of course, I never really made the correlation until much later on.I went on with this religion because I felt that maybe one day I would \\"get it\\"...one day I would become happy, one day I would feel whole, one day I would feel free of all my suffering and heartache. I just didn't have enough faith. I wasn't good enough yet. God was simply testing me.God loves and love never tests anyone...I remember being at such a low point in my life that I wasn't just at the edge, I was completely over it and I fell and I fell hard but I landed looking up and looking up from that fall I realized with real eyes that God is a God of Love, of Grace, of Beauty. God doesn't want anything from me. Nothing! What could an Almight, All Powerful, All Creative Intelligence want? God is All and All means All. There is nothing missing in the All.I am still trying to comprehend this and maybe it's going to take me through the rest of Eternity to completely understand, but all I know is that there is beauty in this book, there is strength, there is a joyful remembering that we are not simply pons in a game...we are here to co-create with Spirit, with Love, with Light and live our lives abundantly. We aren't here to walk behind Jesus...we are here to walk with Jesus as well as with the other Spiritual Masters and we are here to use the same power that they used...the power that is within us now...the power of Everlasting, Unchanging Love.This book pushes buttons because it really does get us to question our beliefs and our values and what we really consider to be True. I love this book and even if you disagree with him and his approach to Spirit, you might still want to pick up a copy and just open yourself up to something great...you might in the process uncover a deeper aspect of who you really are.I bless you with Light, Love, and Laughter."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This book is not dangerous at all, except to those who fear the ability to think independently, ponder for themselves what it all means, stretch their souls to include new thoughts, decide for themselves what to think and how to live and love, question long established teachings that just might be extremely outdated, discuss what we might have missed along the way, listen to others and consider that they might have something of value to say also. But the saddest thing to me is that the thing that is feared most seems to be God (if you don't do it his way) and the point of the book is \\"Which way would that be?\\" Thank you, God, for the freedom and joy of thinking and deciding for myself whether you even exist or not. That is real freedom. That is the true gift with no strings attached."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This book merits at least four stars simply because of its content. Any piece of work that puts forth this type of message is an admirable one, in my opinion. That being said, there are some inherent aspects of this work that are bothersome.First and foremost is the overall tone of the writing. Again, the message is great, but NDW's writing style comes off as borderline overbearing, self-important, and narcissistic. The proclamation of it being one of the most \\"dangerous\\" books ever written is self-aggrandizing. Let's be honest, It was dangerous for Jesus, The Christ to put forth this message - to a world that was not ready to hear it - and was crucified for it. It certainly is not dangerous for NDW, who I'm sure will profit enormously (as is his divine right to - and good for him). His ideas of a \\"New Spirituality\\" are nothing new at all. The idea that God is a singular, divine, energy that is love, and that each of us is made up of that same energy - in effect that each of us is God, has been taught for as long as there have been people willing to listen. Unfortunately the message has been diluted and changed through centuries of mankind's interest in power and control over each other.Another bothersome aspect of this book is the author's failure to give any credit whatsoever to Ernest Holmes and his Science of Mind teachings. The content of NDW's book and Mr. Holmes philosophy/spiritual teachings are essentially identical, though Mr. Holmes was lecturing about this almost one hundred years ago. There's nothing wrong with having the same opinion, but I would find it hard to believe that NDW was not somewhat influenced by Mr. Holmes (especially since he was interviewed by Science of Mind Magazine).This - I admit - is like debating over Jesus or Buddha, however. The important thing is the message, and with that said, \\"What God Wants\\" is another important work in history reminding us that we are all in this together and that we should treat ourselves and each another with love, compassion, and respect."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"In a world that chooses to teach that God will only love you and/or accept you if you follow certain rules, this is a refreshing and entirely believable perspective. Most people will find it difficult to connect with these ideas at first, but if a person understands that the Creator has unconditional Love for every being that exists, it can be very liberating. And why would this be so difficult for us to believe? When you think about it, the idea of a God of conditional love (i.e., you must be saved in some way) is what has gotten the inhabitants of this planet to where we are right now. Is this really such an appealing place to be? Or is it time to have a different perspective and create a different World?"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This book has put into words what I've felt for years.

This book can help you by giving you a better understanding of truly \\"What God Wants.\\" I think you'll be surprised and happy. If you have an open mind and open heart, you will LOVE this book. You can love God in your own personal way. God does not require you to label how you choose to connect to his/her holy spirit.

And Walsh nailed it with dead aim when he said that for such a little book, it is one of the most dangerous that you will ever read. Why? Because it makes you THINK! It makes you QUESTION! It truly confuses me when I try and make sense of why so many...for so many thousands of years...have taken religious leaders and their material as the ONLY truth. The TRUTH is in our hearts, and one need only search deep within it to find the answers to life's greatest mysteries. Neale Donald Walsh however has gone a LONG, LONG way in his journey to deliver that truth to as many people as possible, and allow them to decide for themselves whether to take it as fact or fiction. I LOVE this man's writing. He is beyond amazing."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I found my way to Neale Donald Walsch's books through way of \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne. Amazingly enough the movie, \\"Conversations with God\\" showed up in our mailbox through our movie subscription and no one had requested it. I of course watched it being that it was related to God and that inspired me to read Neale's books because I recognized him from \\"The Secret.\\"His books are amazing and will change the way you see yourself, the world around you and God, however, if you are not at the point in your life at which you are ready for the information in these books, you will not understand what is being said. At times, it can be confusing but the more you read, the more you understand.We have been taught so much about God that is incorrect, and after reading this book, it makes so much more sense. I have realized many things about my relationship with myself and God over my lifetime that have been repeated and confirmed in Neale's books. God DOES speak with me all the time and in amazing ways.If we could all remember our connection to God and each other and realize the things that Neale, and God, share with us through this book and his others, the world would be such an incredible place.

Personally I loved this book, as the other NDW books. But, do I agree with every single little thing in all of them? No. As I do with everything, even different religions, I take what I like, what resonates with my own personal truth, and I just let the rest go. Does it really matter if what helps me be a better person is in the bible or in these books? Nope. If it helps me become more loving and kind and grateful - who cares.

These are the most interesting books I have ever read. However, this is the weakest book in the series. It is a repetition of earlier books and a not so good one at that. I would rather see that Walsch would delve into the more difficult subjects. Such as, to what extend can we create our own reality? What are the consequences of our behavior? and how can we avert these consequences? Why does this message only come now and not earlier? To what extend does free will exist? To what extend can we influence the free will of others? etc etc. So the question is how can we apply these powerful concepts to our daily lives? I have many more questions which are not answered. Instead, Walsch keeps repeating himself in the last three books. BTW this book has not much to do with a conversation with God: It is Walsch's opinion. So it is a book with very good ideas, however, these are much better explained in earlier books. Just read part 1 to 3."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Walsch should have called his book \\"What We Want\\" or at least \\"What God Does Not Want\\" instead.Somehow, Walsch likes to use the same or similar title as some truly religious books, and then write from an atheistic or pantheistic point of view, spouting some common beliefs of people who don't believe in a personal God or the will of an all-loving and all-powerful God, but rather only themselves and what they want. (Look: there can be extremism in any kinds of belief, theistic or atheistic. Understanding and tolerance are important in any case.)In this new book, Walsch kept making self-congratulatory statements like, \\"The stuff in this book is so dangerous.\\" Boy! Some danger! An example of his \\"dangerous\\" sweeping statements (veering close to \\"extremist atheism\\"): people from major religions like Christianity, Islam and Judaism tend to be so extremist that they'll kill (maim, ostracise...) those who don't believe in the same truths that they believe. (!?) Just how many are like this? E.g. consider this: what percentage out of billions of believers (whether Muslims or Christians) are extremists? The answer is likely to be 0.000...1 percent, right?As one online friend put it, \\"That's the paradox of relativism isn't it...they can be fanatical and ABSOLUTE about ONE truth -- that there is no truth! This guy forgets that atheistic ideologies such as Nazism, Communism killed more people in the last century than any religious wars.\\""},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"What does God want? Nothing. Walsch maintains that since God has everything and is all-powerful he doesn't want or need anything from mankind. Certainly God doesn't need us to love Him or to obey Him. He doesn't need us so why should He care if we love or obey Him?But somehow Walsch's God Who Needs Nothing is full of love and created everything out of love. How Walsch can arrive at that conclusion is a mystery since a God who needs nothing could be a God of hatred---after all, why would God care what humanity thought of Him?The only true conclusion one can draw from a God who needs and wants nothing from mankind is that mankind is free to behave any way it wants. Walsch seems to believe that, liberated with this idea that mankind will suddenly starting loving and embracing each other. Just the opposite would be true---if there is no need to obey God (who in fact will not have given any instruction to mankind as to how to behave---why should He?) then man is free to act in any nihilistic way he wants to.Trivialize God and let man do what he wants. That's Walsch's philosophy."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"People who beleive in God may be offended because the author says that God wants something, if any, different from what beleivers already think he wants."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I finally got to the point of the book that said the answer was \\"God wants nothing\\" and I laughed out loud. Now I'll grant you that God NEEDS nothing but He wants me, you, them, in His heavenly Kingdom. Why would He send His son to die if He didn't want anything? He wants to redeem, make right, to Himself all people. But He made it only one way--through Jesus Christ. He wants you to love Him, need Him, worship Him and praise Him. But you must come through His Son. Jesus said, \\"I am the WAY, the truth and the light, NO ONE comes to the Father (God) except through me. And that's where all other religions are mixed up--they don't believe in Jesus Christ.John Wesley said, \\"The chief end of man (man's primary purpose) is to LOVE God and ENJOY Him Forever.\\" That emcompasses my reality."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The author of this work apparently is trying to set up his own religion. Judging from the comments I have read about his work, he is succeeding. The text bashes any established religious belief the author can think of. He than adds his own twists to \\"What God Wants\\". I would not reccommend this read to anyone unless you are studying cultist beliefs."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I do have to say this is one of the worst books I've ever read. After spending 30 pages telling the reader how this book will change everything and that humanity has gotten it completely wrong up till now, Walsch sets himself up to be the wrong bringer of truth who will alter the course of humanity. What he ends up providing is a rehashing of outdated old philosophical ideas, old heresies, and dead religions. He offers no reasoning or evidence for any of his ideas of God, from either philosophy or exegesis of any scriptural text. It is more of a Feuerbachian creation of a God Walsch likes who has no claim on life and is totally affirming in all humanity might say or do.He gives himself way too much credit for offering ideas which will tear down all other theologies, but none of his ideas are new, they are thin lacking any support. He merely creates a God and a theology that is more comfortable and easier, which may seem nicer to some people but it doesn't make it true. I admire him for wanting to bring unity to the world and end injustice, but his way will not work, it will end up causing more separation and injustice."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"all i can say is WOW.....what a crapfest. i would give it negative points if i could. i could refute this book in my sleep as well as his conversation with god books. numerous contradictions, taking scripture out of context (and not even referencing it alot of the time). my boss let me borrow the book(he seems to be a big Walsch fan). its a fast read, but Walsch's ideas can be summed up in totality as regurgitated pantheism, panentheism, monism. he enjoys taking shots at the 3 big objective religions(as they say how things in the world ought to be) and doesnt include hinduism and buddhism because they are subjective. basically Walsch tells us that there are no consequences for what we do in this lifetime and that God's will is for us to do what we want. i almost died laughing when i read that what God really wants is \\"nothing\\". tell me this Neale.....if God really wanted nothing and doesnt care WHY WOULD HE BOTHER TALKING TO YOU in your alleged \\"conversations\\" with him?On page 87 after stating that god wants nothing he goes on to ask if you disagree \\"what makes you disagree? who told you this statement could not be true? what makes them right? how do you know that they know what is true? because they read it in a book? fair enough. but then what makes the book right?well Neale i could ask the very same thing with your book and we'd just be arguing in circles wouldn't we? instead i'll tell you what makes the Bible the true and living Word of God. Aside from all the archaeology, all the legal evidence, and ancient documents that gives the Bible its authenticity....prophecy.and what does this book have.....NOTHING...not surprising."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Walsch wants to challenge the basic presupositions of religion and who God is. No problem there, we should constantly check to make sure our vision of God is not corrupted by our own desires, but there has to be something we are able to test that against. Walsch offers no such thing, in fact the book is less about what God wants and more about what Walsch wants. While he questions all thoughts on God he does not question what he believes religion is for. I had the oppurtunity to talk to Walsch and he describes religion's purpose as coming closer to God and bringing humanity closer together. Now that isn't bad, but Walsch defines God based on that premise. He says that if theology isn't working to that end then we should change everything about it. He thus goes on to define God the way he wants in order to bring about his end of everyone getting along (let me tell you his way wont' work). He does not base his ideas of God on anything from any holy scripture or any philosophy. He had a \\"experience\\" of God that told him this. Now a lot of people have had experiences of God and I think that is great, but it is not what we can base religion on, because other people have had \\"experiences\\" of God as well who wanted to start cults, kill people, and do other horrible things.Basically Walsch redefines God the way he thinks God should be and wants what he would want God to want. This thinking is dangerous because the God he defines is both powerless, irrelevant, and is not a unifying figure. There is greater possibility of abuse in his system then in the current religious thought which I readily admit has been abused.I won't even start to mention his horrible writing style that spends more time pumping up the book as some society saving revelation then giving anything to people to think about. I read the book and tried to discuss these things with Walsch but he wouldn't listen to my questions as regarding his method. My meeting with him was a waste of time as was reading this book."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This is in answer to the person who correctly pointed out that the first book in the series said that there would be three books. That person wanted to know why there are now twenty books! Did you really think this guy was doing anything other than taking your money while persuading you to believe that god spoke to him? In a sane and moral society this kind of crap would be illegal to sell but since we live in a dog eat dog crapitalism, caveat emptor!

On the whole, I agree with just about everything Neale has said. And, if you are familiar with the other 14 books he has written, you will find that most of this book is a re-statement, especially of the first book, Conversations with God, Book 1. If you think not, then go back and read it and then read this book again. What Neale has done here is bring us up-to-date several years later from the original experience...it goes to show, the points do not change.I deeply believe that his assertions are correct about our current experience, but my worry is...who is listening? Obviously, 51% of America is not listening, or George Bush would not now be president...and they could care less about who they really are! As for the rest of us...a small minority are listening and willing to do something about it. In his last book, I believe, 2 - 3% of the entire human race is needed to bring about a radical change in the collective conscious. I happen to believe, that with Bush and the Christian Right, who are suffocating the world with their fear and oppressive rhetoric, Neale's message will remain, unheard. I don't believe that humanity has much longer on this earth because the human mind rather then the human heart, is what drives this world. It's too bad most people are too shallow to understand it is their own life which is on the line with a world on the edge of collapse and if they listened to these 14 books, this one included, they could change the destiny of the world and choose life instead."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Every thinking person should read this book.

Replacing the negative beliefs of &quot;separate and better than &quot; with such wonderful good news can and will heal our world. Thank you Neale for your clear and courageous words and intentions."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I have read most of the other reviews, and I feel I must write a very simple review myself. Yes, it is a review of the other Conversations With God books...but only for those who have read them. I feel that this book was not meant to be read exclusively by those who have read all of the others, but, rather, to grab the attention of those who might not otherwise read the CWG books. This book is also, as stated in other reviews, very basic, but isn't that the point? Most of the reviewers seem to be the type who have studied extensively and are very articulate in their opinions, BUT most of the world is basic in thought (at least initially) and needs BASIC to begin the thought process. However, isn't the whole point of the book that what needs to be done is really very basic, however difficult? Love. Love. Not separate. Pretty basic. Walsch does not call for the disbanding of religion, he calls for renewing all religions and removing what mankind added for control of each other...why is that so wrong? Better yet, why is that so frightening? Why is that concept so frightening that one reviewer couldn't even read the book to have an opinion based on actual fact?Yes, I also agree that Walsch's style could be different...in ALL of his books, but, once again, isn't the fact that it can be read and understood by all different levels of spirituality important, and doesn't the more basic, personal, style accomplish that? Isn't it important that it can be understood IMMEDIATELY by the reader, on most points, important, instead of needing to be studied and cross referenced and group dialoged before being sure you really caught the meaning, like we have reduced our bible and other holy writings to? BASIC. Meant to reach a large audience, not a specific, only highly read, highly educated minority.Yes, I give it a 5 because it doesn't really pretend to be anything it isn't, and is everything that it is, and could be the seed of change that will actually grow this time. Nothing insidious, just love."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"As a long time reader of the CWG material, I am a big fan of Neale's work and I buy his books as my way of supporting the foundation. But I had to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the first half was a bit overdone and melodramatic. People who pick up this book will be curious to hear what God supposedly wants as soon as possible without all the added fluff. While I suppose Neale's little disclaimer was well deserved for those not familiar with his work, it could have been cut back a little.All in all, though, not a bad little book. It was a relatively fast read and makes for a nice handbook to supplement the cwg readings. As for using no scripture to support his \\"wild\\" claims...well...Neale's trying to make a new spirituality (read that: spirituality--not cult or religion. Religions are highly organized with rules and rituals. Cults demand servitude and loss of individual identity) not a shady copy of an already existing religious construction. This book doesn't do as good a job as some of Neale's others when it comes to going in depth into the philosophies he presents. This book tells you \\"what God wants\\", but it doesn't satisfactorily answer WHY (at least in relation to his other works).I wish I could tell Christians and other groups who come across this material that it's not meant to offend or demean their religions. It's simply trying to offer another interpretation to previously held ideas (there's a wonderful chapter in Tomorrow's God that speaks about Jesus and uses several examples from the Bible that made me tear up a little). But there will always be people out there who are offended or threatened by these things, and that's perfectly okay.But with all that being said, it gets a 4/5 from me just for the overdrawn introduction and lack of supporting logic. But perhaps the lack of depth and detail that is so predominant in the CWG series may be on purpose. I think with this book Neale was just hoping to promote some kind of running dialogue over these ideas. He made the attention grabbing title and subject matter to get as many people introduced to different ideas about God as possible. Not so much to get us to suddenly leap in and believe it (in fact,if you talk to Neale, he will tell you NOT to believe every word he says in his books--the last thing he wants is anyone to turn it into dogma) so that more people would begin discussing it. Taking a quick glance over these reviews, he has succeeded."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"A new fundamental understanding of truth.

I now can live my life in peace, it doesn't mean I don't have challenges or pain anymore but I DON'T have to FEAR God anymore.

If you are like me, then I suppose you would have a lot of questions on why the BIBLE is so patchy, hard to understand, and most of all so disunifying? The Religions today are separating us all. We are fighting over who is the chosen. Even the Christians today are fighting amoung one another! Which ones are GOD's chosen? The Cathoics, the Baptist, the Methodist???? There are so many of the religions today that keep pushing DISUNITY, NOT UNITY! There are not a lot of explanations on how to live in this day and time in the Bible. Also, as a small child, while attending church every Sunday, Sunday night, and when ever the church doors were open, I had reservations on how the word of GOD was being preached. Even at this yound age, I thought something was litterally quite NOT RIGHT! I had a feeling of God inside my little body and it did not coincide with what the church was teaching! I felt GOD in my soul and knew him to be everything this book says he is! If you really want to know GOD, then pick up this book today! I have been reading these books since 1996, and they have changed my life! I was not a very good person until these books came into my life. I didn't know what to do, how to treat people, how to find GOD, until these books happened to me. Here is what will happen when you read them. First, you will change deeply inside. You will grow a love for GOD deep inside and with that love, comes a love for every human being on earth. You will always be careful to think only positive thoughts about yourself and eveyone around you. You will love yourself and your fellow man and woman like never before. You will never think of doing anything to hurt anyone. You will feel GOD inside of you finally and have conversations from your soul with him and also see that he does answer every question and request you could possibly have even before you have asked.There are a lot of people out there like me....I know. Maybe you have tried asking and seeking the knowledge that you need in your heart. Maybe you have been asking the wrong people! You need to ask GOD, and I believe with all my heart that these books are answers for out times! These are not the only books with answers. They are merely one of the many ways to really hold God and invite him into your hearts! Out of all of them, this seems to me, to be the BEST! Thanks Neale for bringing this through you to all of us! Thank you GOD, and I love you! Most important! jesus told us that he would not leave us without instruction as to how to live life! He said that he would send help and knowledge! He has many times sent gifted ideas through other, ordinary people! If we continue to turn our heads and walk away from these very special messages, what shall we do then?

Makes sense!From that starting point it is easy for the author to criticise many of religious systems, practices and teachings around the world. So far so good. Then comes the exciting point - how does this give us a deeper understanding? Where do we go from there. Unfortunately, the book is not a truly revolutionary book. If it was truly dangerous, surely, you would sit back and have your life changed ... but life is not changed.It has some bright spots though. I enjoyed:\\"that we should only think what we want to experience, say only what we choose to make real, and do only what we think is our highest reality.\\"With such insights I couldn't give it 1 or 2 stars.

Many of them indicate that the book or the teaching of Neale Walsch have truly changed and saved the lives of many readers. I think on this ground alone, the fact that the book helped these readers and probably many others that it is no doubt of value.On the other hand I am a bit troubled at the thought that so many people seem to so uncritically accept the view of one particular individual as to what God wants, as if the great masses of mankind of all generations did not really know or understand very much at all. I am too a bit disturbed by the supreme confidence of Mr.Walsch in positing that he knows precisely what God wants. Is this on the basis of reason alone, or is he claiming some special revelation or encounter with God?I would suggest a different approach, a more humble one in which each one of us asks ourselves, asks our family religious tradition, asks all we know from life and the world, what God wants of us.I think in doing that we will not come to easy peace or complete understanding, but to questioning and more questioning. I think that we will come to difficulty, problem, trouble and perhaps no sure single answer.But perhaps given the complexity of life and the world, that is a more real way of engaging God and our fellow human beings.I do not mean to discourage anyone or make them unhappy. I do not mean to take from anyone their Answer.My own sense however is that life, and our relation toGod cannot be so simple and so easy.I should perhaps say( not for advertisment but for honesty's sake) that I am a religious Jew who finds seeking for what God wants through reading and rereading the long Jewish tradition on this question."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"A real disappointment. I've read all the CWG books Neale wrote earlier, and found them to be inspirational and groundbreaking. In my opinion, (and reading all the other reviews, I'm standing alone here) the first 12 Chapters of this book were negative, critical, simplistic and rage filled; basically a waste of time. The answer to What God Wants was stated in the CWG books, so what he puts forth here in this \\"dangerous and provocative\\" book is nothing new. Even his statement that God is Everything is not revolutionary. Buddhists and Hindus believe this already.When Neale declares that we are everything, (something I already know to be true) and then he says \\"but those people over there, and what they believe, I'm not like them,\\" seems at odds with his message. When he states that it takes someone special, a select few that will understand his message here, I think he is patronizing and divisive. Again, not bringing us together, but separating us once again.Personally, I believe he has a barely masked hatred of humanity. I don't understand how someone in his position can walk both sides of the street like that; preaching love and union, yet his \\"peaceful\\" message is announced in a verbally violent manner. His descriptions of our human race's problems only seems to incite even more anger in reading it.It took until well after page 150 that I found something positive and less offensive. In my opinion, I should have just started the book from there, and not spent my time and emotion dealing with the first half. I realize that I'm in a minority here, but when everyone is on one side of the boat, I'm willing to stand on the other side for balance. If you have read the Conversations With God series, don't bother with this one and save the time and money."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The odd thing is, every time I was in a bookstore and flipped open the book in the middle, it said good things...but when I actually bought the book and read the first, oh, 11-12 chapters, I was very disappointed. Skip those and it's a decent book.One of the most important things I've been learning with other books is the idea to focus on what you DO want, how you DO want to create and feel and live and enjoy. (\\"Ask and It Is Given,\\" by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a superb example of that.)So, cutting off other people's heads (or organizations) to make yourself bigger isn't my idea of greatness. And the first half of this book does exactly that. Why waste time on all that negativity? Just focus on the part where we can be happy."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"**SPOILERS**I'm a fan of Neale's books. I've read them all several times, but I'm afraid that this one isn't very good. All of Neale's worst habits, as a writer, are on display here:-The self-important, melodramatic flourishes, \\"This is a dangerous book\\"!!-The gimmicky buildup of suspense as we approach the moment he answers the question \\"What does God want?\\"-The \\"pun\\" of the answer--a chapter that is four pages of blank paper. God wants nothing! Get it?Oh, Neale! You are your own worst enemy! You have so much that's worthwile to say, and yet you can't get over yourself enough to say it straight!Neale asks us to pass this book on to others, but I would never do that. They'd just laugh at it for all the reasons just cited. It's a shame. The ideas in this book really are what the world needs now.The book does improve in the second half. But that will be too late for those turned off by the smarmy first half.A missed opportunity."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Until I read this book, I had no idea how many of our cultural, social, and political structures are based on varying ideas about \\"what God wants.\\" I can't believe that wasn't already obvious to me.

It's numerous interpretations has caused unbelievable amount of death, destruction and silent suffering.On the other hand, the Bible is the greatest source of inspiration and wisdom.Neale treats the Bible with complete respect and gives the holy book surprisingly deep, clear and liberating interpretation.For everyone, not familiar with Neale's books yet, \\"What God wants\\" is very highly recommended. It is short, dramatic, provocative and right to the point. After reading ityou will know what to do (or not to do) next.For those familiar with Neale's writing the content of this book is not shockingly new but yet another shining facet of never ending Conversation with God."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I actually purchased this book \\"by accident\\" a few months ago, and because I had other books that I really wanted to read, this one sat on the shelf until yesterday. For some reason, instead of continuing to read my new shipment of books, I went to the shelf to pick a book from there - and this was it. Now that I've read \\"What God Wants\\", I can't tell you how glad I am that I didn't just let it collect dust! It's truly an amazing, truth-filled book, that I wish everyone was ready to read.In this book, Neale Donald Walsch shows how the seperatism theology, so prevalent in today's organized religions, has helped to create the personal beliefs that have shaped the world we live in - one filled with violence & hatred. He then states that, in order to fix the situation we've found ourselves in, we need to realize that we are all one - along with God.He questions all of the ideas that many of us were taught as children, laying them out for what they really are, and then asks the reader to decide if they think that that's really what God wants. He shows how the churches have tended to \\"see\\" God as if \\"He\\" was human - with all the faults, plus several more, that we humans have succomb to.Personally, even as a child I could never reconcile the idea that I was supposed to both love and fear my God - I still don't believe that anyone can do both - not really. \\"What God Wants\\" explains why we never need to fear God, and why having a bunch of fearful humans is NOT what God wants. Why would \\"He\\"???This is a very thought provoking book, and quite honestly, I'm not sure that everyone would \\"get it\\". Although I found it quite easy to read, I've been reading books of a spiritual nature for quite some time now, so I had a basis on which to understand this info. However, even if you haven't read books on this subject before, I believe that if you have an open mind, and are not bound by any type of dogma, you'll gain a lot from the reading of this book. I believe that this is such an important book, and I REALLY hope you choose to read it - it could literally change the world!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"Unless you haven't read several of Walsch' books before this really blow your mind.

This book introduces itself as a \\"dangerous\\" book. This is true, only because it makes you think about the answers to life's most perplexing questions. It makes you wonder about a God, who is Everything and All, who is Love. It makes you wonder why people ever created fallacies about God, which make God out to be angry and jealous, petty and punishing. Neale Donald Walsch's writings and his conversations with God make you realize, inside your true heart of hearts, that God is really all about Love and Life, and that we are all connected to everything and everyone.

The subject matter explored in this book is what we must explore if we are to survive as a species. It illustrates the beliefs we hold about life and God upon which our societies have been constructed upon for thousands of years. It demonstrates we are building a 21st century world on 1st century theology. In every other field of knowledge, our sciences, medicine and technologies we have permitted exploration. Can you image where we would be today if we had not done so?The process through which we create our cultural stories and collective realities, as explained in the book is over a period of many years. Passed from generation to generation through a three-step process: First, our elders give us information about God and about What God Wants that we widely embrace as true. Second, this information sponsors beliefs about life and how it is, as well as how it should be. And third, these beliefs produce behaviors within the human family that creates humanity's life experiences. It all starts with this original information and impacts all of us. Few of us ever choose to question it and are often intolerant of exploration. We have all experienced what happens when one person tells a story to another and that individual passes it on. By the time the story reaches the twenty-first person it's content is dynamically different. With each telling of the story further personal embellishments and, depending its content, ego investment is inevitable. Just image the impact the centuries of our theology story telling has had on its original message? Factor in our compulsion to control and manipulate each other and a powerful, persuasive case exist for motivation in creating major distortions."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This is a wonderful book that opens new frontiers with our relationship with God.If one would read this book with an open mind instead of a mind stuck in past theology, new pathways to understanding would open and we would all see a God of Love, compassion, acceptance and joy, instead of the old God of condemnation and judgement. We would come to understand that we ourselves are aspects of All That Is and nothing exists outside of that which we call God. We are never victims of a capricious God, but creators of our own reality. We would come to realze that we are all One and what we do to another, we do to ourselves. What a Blessing it would be to allow ourselves to think about ourselves and God in a different more positive way.

This book really is the BEST book Neale has written. It's short, fast, and clear. It provides stunning answers to the biggest question humanity can formulate. What is it, that God, our maker and creator, wants from us? Do we really know? Does any one of our conflicting religions know? Yes and no. Our knowledge is simply incomplete. To understand the answer, we must zoom out from a piece of the puzzle (a religion, for example), to the broader picture. Wanna take a ride?!? Detach yourself from your belief systems (however inclusive you think they are), open yourself up, fasten your seat belts, and get your insurance papers out before reading this book... and then read it, listen to what it says.... at the very least CONSIDER the possibility that it is true. I guarantee you, that no matter who you are, how many similar books you have read, or how much you think you know about the answer, you will be shocked (or enlightened) by the answer.

Following up on \\"Tomorrow's God\\", Walsch's previous book, it captures exactly the problems that religious beliefs cause in everyday life. God is not some being outside of our lives, but an integral part of all of us. As such, God has no needs except for us to be.WHAT GOD WANTS truly expresses the core belief of all Christians and other religions; that God is a god of love. Walsch presents a God that is familiar to all of us in our souls. A God we all know exists, but tend to forget in our actions. What man/woman needs is to let go of fear and embrace this experience of a God of love.Many of us who were brought up to see God as this \\"loving\\" yet punishing Father figure will have a hard time accepting a God who loves us no matter who or what we are. As the author points out, an omnipotent God, who is all loving, needs nothing from his/her creations. This is a very difficult idea for those who support fear based religions to hear.This book is a must read for any true seeker of inner wisdom and spiritual insight! The ideas in here will change the world!!!"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"\\"The New Spirituality is a civil rights movement for the soul, freeing humanity at last from the oppression of its belief in a separate, angry, violent, and fearful God. Human beings have always been free. They simply have not known it.\\" -Neale Donald WalschSo, when was the last time you read a dangerous book?Hang on to your seats, because author Neale Donald Walsch challenges the sacred cows of every major world religion by daring to examine what God (truly) wants. An equal opportunity offender, his singular, simple answer to the question \\"What does God want?\\" will surprise most, offend the inert close-minded, and thrill those who are already (all ready!) riding the wave of New Spirituality.Walsch, the author of the New York Times Bestselling Conversations with God series, explores two basic questions in his book What God Wants - A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question:1. Who and What is God?2. What does God want, and why?Declaring that fear and guilt are the real enemies of humanity (and differentiating them from caution and remorse) Walsh traces war, world hunger, violence, sexism, racism and more directly to humanity's belief about God and what He wants.On June 23, 2004, the fascinating results of a scientific survey conducted by Harris Interactive hit the wire services: 69% of adult Americans believe religious differences are the biggest hurdle to global peace. This overwhelming percentage is evidence that individuals are starting to wake up and realize that humanity's beliefs about God and what He wants is THE biggest problem in the world today.For many nations, entire social and judicial structures are built upon beliefs about various interpretations of sacred scriptures. The major religions, without exception, advocate an \\"us versus them\\" Separation Theology. In the 19th century, Americans sincerely accepted the biblical story of Noah's son Ham to justify slavery. In that time, to raise one's voice in protest to enslavement would have been met with persecution, accusations of heresy, and possibly death.Yet, even now, many followers of religions such as Islam, Christianity, and Judaism justify discrimination, superiority (\\"specialness\\"), indifference, hatred, and violence based on what the \\"sacred scriptures\\" say. At the risk of being labeled an infidel, subversive, or \\"lost sinner\\", Walsch sounds a clarion call that NOW is the time to ruthlessly examine what humanity believes about God, and what Deity wants from humanity.Walsch asserts:\\"When it comes to its most sacred beliefs, our society will not tolerate new ideas that violate doctrine-or even question it. Thus, we are trying to build a twenty-first-century reality with first-century moral, ethical, and spiritual tools. This would be akin to a surgeon stepping into a modern-day operating room with a very sharp stone. It is not necessary to build our tomorrows with such primitive tools. The prohibition against new ideas and new thoughts about God can and must be lifted. A new discussion about God and What God Wants must begin.\\"Fortunately for humanity, Walsch (and Atria Books) had the courage to open the discussion by asking difficult questions, presenting the global consequences of centuries of religious assumptions, and offering a compellingly simple solution to mankind's greatest challenges. Walsch examines ideas on morality, suffering, free will, death, male and female, money, sex, and so on through the lens of Separation Theology (which is what we've had up until now), and how those same ideas look through the lens of Unity Theology.While humanity is in some deep do-do right now, the good news is that we can choose TODAY to make different choices-including how we choose to see God, life, and our fellow man.Indeed, our very lives-and the life of the planet-may depend on it.As Walsch succinctly puts it: \\"We human beings do not need to be saved from the \`snares of the Devil', we need to be saved from ourselves. We are threatening to condemn ourselves to Hell right here on earth. We can yet create Heaven on earth, but we must choose now very wisely...That new understanding can launch the Thousand Years of Peace of which it has been written. It can give birth to a Golden Age of Glory.\\"Amen and Amen.Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"The core message in this book is to reduce fear. Fear from religious dogma, and damnation if you don't obey and listen. I found it useful, and helpful in that respect.

They are both additional great reads."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"'What God Wants' explores some of the most controversial and sensitive questions that all of humanity has asked throughout time, about who God is, what God wants, and where do we, as individuals and as a collective fit in?Neale Donald Walsch concludes with answers that make simple sense of otherwise potentially conflicting and confusing issues, and in doing so, uncovers some exciting revelations that give hope to all of humanity, and are within everyone's reach of understanding and application to their life. This is a book that gives a refreshing perception to old, deeply ingrained belief systems, and challenges us to be greater, more thoughtful and responsible beings. I feel that the message Walsch is delivering demands a more powerful portrayal. However, whatever your belief or understanding of God, this is a very worthwhile read and is sure to open doors to much contemplation and potential change.To further explore God, there is no better reading than the compilation of remarkable teachings by Ramtha, particularly 'A Masters Reflection on the History of Humanity' Part 1 and Part 2. Ramtha's unlimited knowledge and genius gives each individual the tools and knowledge to be great, to reclaim their lost and forgotten divinity and to understand God from a personal and scientific level, giving hope for a noble, adventurous and joyfilled life. The subject of what God wants, amongst many others, is thoroughly and beautifully explored in these two volumes.Belinda Dawson."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I once read the original &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; with my children. They asked, at the end of the story, why the people of Emerald City didn't realize there was a wizard behind the curtain pulling all the levers and making all the rules. Upon discussion, one of them said it was because the people of Emerald City didn't WANT to know.Walsch has become a &quot;Toto&quot; of these times and ripped away the curtain from our everyday plodding and made us question how we've seen God (and life) for so very long. Like in his previous books, Walsch's &quot;What God Wants&quot; will make you think twice about life. It'll make you ask questions. Question how our beliefs in God have shaped this world. Question if that is how you want it to stay. Question how we can recreate a better world today. Don't be an Emerald Citian. Be Toto! Question your reality."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I am writing as someone who has read and is a big fan of most of Walsch's prior work (especially CWG 1, 2, 3, Communion with God, and Tomorrow's God). What God wants is basically a short and easily accessible summary version of his prior work, and probably a good introduction for those who haven't read Walsch yet, and an excellent choice for those who don't like thick books. For the fans of Walsch's writings like me: it nicely completes the collection, but it doesn't really add anything!The other thing is that this one does not dwell on the \\"big\\" universal metaphysical questions, which is what I liked about the others: it is, I think, mostly targeted at the many people who have faith in one of the main monotheist religions (Christians, Jews and Muslims - I guess Conservative American Christians are his primary focus), of which I am and was not.So, I would still recommend the Conversations with God, Communion with God, or Tomorrow's God, over this one, for the essence of Walsch's incredible message and their more universal appeal. I would recommend this one to offer as a gift to people you know who have faith in one of the big monotheist religions and are starting to examine their faith.It is of course legitimate that Walsch now wants to spread his message as widely as possible, so I guess he will be experimenting with different writing styles, all at the same time intensifying, like he does here, his call to action to bring about the New Spirituality on earth."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I think what this book will accomplish over time is to open up an overdue debate about some of the most significant philosophical issues in our history - a debate that those in power have successfully squashed for a few thousand years. That is why this is a dangerous book. But it is dangerous only to those who want to use their authority to hide the Truth or to impose their views on the world. For the rest of us, it will be a force for spiritual and psychological liberation. Mr. Walsch's genius is in presenting these extremely complex issues in a logical, easily understood manner."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"This book you'll probably either love or hate. Evidence: see how many reviewers gave it either a 0-1 or a 5. Shows it's an important book. It IS provocatively written. But it's hard to argue with Walsch's logic or with his general contentions and their far-reaching implications.Many might prefer, as I do, that he'd have given some of the positives of traditional religion, which are many, along with the strong negatives. But to his credit, Walsch more than once warns that he is simplifying complex subjects. I give him some slack because most authors in the theological/philosophical arena, myself included, lean to the complex side. We need accessible books like this to stimulate deeper thought and conversation.And actually, there is more research and careful thought behind what he is saying than meets the eye. Through 5 years of graduate theological education, many years of Christian ministry, and years more of self-directed study, I've encountered the same concepts. But I found \\"What God Wants\\" to bring a fresh approach, and stimulating, concise, helpful summations and calls to action. He is absolutely right to emphasize that actions follow beliefs and the emotions associated. We need a lot of new actions! Few books confront us as well on the vital need to examine and revise our often-counterproductive (and wrong-headed) beliefs about the most foundational issues for us individually, as a society, and the world."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"As Mr. Walsch says correctly, We have been trying to figure out exactly what God wants for a few thousand years or so. Does God want us to kill our enemies? Worship him (or her, depending on your view)? Give money to the poor? What?What is it that God wants?The answer that Mr. Walsch gives is a simple, yet suprisingly effective answer.Unlike most of Mr. Walsch's previous books, this isn't a conversation between Mr. Walsch and God. Mr. Walsch does all the talking here. And for the most part (98%), he gets it right.Before he gives the answer to the big question, Mr. Walsch does a wonderful section where he looks at our current beliefs in God and asks bluntly, \\"Is this what God wants?\\" He looks at why we punish people who want to die, how we frighten people with threats of damnation, and why we generally believe that we are seperate from God, and we're a bunch of sinners.And after each comparison, Mr. Walsch asks, \\"Is this what God wants?\\" Hopefully, people with some common sense will say \\"No.\\", becuase Mr. Walsch shows us how our beliefs are, literally, killing us.In general, our beliefs about what God wants, or what his will is, has been slaughtering millions and have made millions more suffer needlessly.Perhaps my favorite one is this. \\"God wants humans-indeed, has caused humans-to be seperated from God. Yet God has given humans a \\"way back home\\" because what God wants is for humans not to be seperate from God.\\" (pg. 122)Does that make any sense? Yet this is the idea that our religions give us.As Mr. Walsch says after this statement, \\"Is this what God wants?\\" To which he says, no. And I agree with him.What then, is the answer? I'm not going to give it here, because I believe you should find out for yourself what the answer is. I will say that it is one simple, little word. There are a lot of little words out there. But one of them is the answer, and it does make sense.Mr. Walsch backs up his answer with an examination of the nature of God, religion, and how the answer could affect us in our daily lives. He basically says that religion will not go away, it will be expanded. God will not dissapear, because we want God. We want someone to talk to.Mr. Walsch suggests that the biggest problem is that we just don't know everything. We know a lot, but we don't know everything. And as a whole, we're just too scared to try and look for that missing part.Mr. Walsch suggests that if God could say one sentence to all of humanity, it would be this: \\"You've got me all wrong\\" (Pg. 117), and I agree with that answer.The only real quibble I have with this book is how it is supposidly \\"Dangerous.\\" Early on, Mr. Walsch says how \\"You could be tried and executed for preaching the answer in this book.\\" Uhm...No, I don't think so. But then again, he shows how many people have introduced ideas throughout the centuries, and have been killed because of it.In the end, this book really does make you think about what God wants. Even if you don't agree with the answer given in the book, it will make you think. Some...no...many of our ideas about God and what he wants are killing us. This book is a wake up call, showing that we don't know everything, and how we've messed up a lot.But...it's not too late to turn around. It's not too late to explore.It's not too late to figure out what God wants."},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I've always loved the Conversation With God books. They were written with love, warmth, patience and humor. They were supposedly the words of God. This book, however, is very clearly the words of Neale. He is angry. He is frustrated. He has unfairly lumped every single religion as trash and worthless. In Buddhism, it is against their religion to harm even a fly (literally) but he lists them as one of the religions that have caused people to mass murder in the name of God. Neale, have you even studied the religions you are bashing? Then just when I think his ignorance and ego could get no bigger I read \\"This could well be the most important information ever placed before the human race.\\" How very, very ironic that Neale criticizes a religion with a Savior yet then declares himself to be the Savior of the human race with what he is about to reveal to us. He repeatedly criticizes the worlds religions for claiming that only they have the truth and then declares that what he says is truth and that they are all wrong. He does exactly what he is criticizing. All the while he is complaining of a separatist religion and then he actually creates what he is complaining about! Does Neale want a world where we can all appreciate and learn from our religious differences or does he want a world where we all believe what Neale believes? And with every book after the CwG series I am constantly reminding myself that in the very first book God said there would be 3 books. So why is this Neale's 15th?"},{"Title":"What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question","review":"I have been reading and studying Walsch's series of 'Conversations with God' books for the last eight years.

While the book is well researched and organized, ultimately it is Turnbull's wonderful language that makes this book shine. He carefully and lyrically describes, not just people's physical characteristics, but also their personalities and personal energy. And Turnbull focuses his book's attention on his subjects' most lively and engaging interactions, quoting letters and discussions at length only when they are truly fascinating. Turnbull, who knew Fitzgerald personally and considered him a friend, obviously loved the subject of this book - and that love helped to bring its subject to life. It helps, of course, that Fitzgerald led a wild, legendary existence.The best I can do, to give a sense of this book, I think, is to quote a few passages, half-randomly, directly from Turnbull's prose:In describing Fitzgerald's school headmaster: \\"He was almost pure albino with thin flaxen hair, white eyebrows and lashes, and pink watery eyes that jiggled behind thick lenses. His soft bulk, his round face with a button nose surmounting several rolls of chin -anyone could see that Fay liked to eat\\" (Turnbull 1962, 39).In describing Fitzgerald's final years: \\"Now was the time of hospitals, nurses, night sweats, sedatives, and despair. Fitzgerald seemed to be slipping back into the morass of 1935-6. Half-crazed with worry and isolation, he was also blocked in his work and 'a writer not writing,' he once remarked, 'is practically a maniac within himself'\\" (Turnbull 1962, 298).In describing Zelda, Fitzgerald's wife: \\"Zelda, too, was acting strangely. With her angry sidelong glances and barbed remarks there was something crouching and inimical in her posture. She was a wily antagonist who lay in wait for you conversationally and gave compliments that turned out to be brickbats. 'Did you ever see a woman's face with so many fine, large teeth in it?' she might say of some one she didn't like - after which she would retreat into herself. But the Murphy's remained fond of her and she of them\\" (Turnbull 1962, 165-166) . . . \\"Her willfulness had modulated into a bizarre petishness. Out with a group of friends, she would suddenly want fresh strawberries or watercress sandwiches and make everyone thoroughly uncomfortable until she got them\\" (Turnbull 1962, 177)."},{"Title":"Scott Fitzgerald","review":"This biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald is now fifty years old, but it wears well and I could not ask for more in a biography. Andrew Turnbull set out to write a biography that focused on Fitzgerald's personality (as opposed to his literary works), and he succeeded admirably.In preparation for this work Turnbull interviewed or corresponded with literally hundreds of people. (At the Plaza Hotel in New York he found only one person who remembered Fitzgerald - a bellboy.) Turnbull was aided, and no doubt inspired, by his own recollections of Fitzgerald. They met when he was eleven, Fitzgerald was thirty-six, and Fitzgerald rented an old Victorian house on the Turnbull family estate outside Baltimore. Fitzgerald and his daughter Scottie, joined for periods by Zelda (when she was not in a sanatorium in Baltimore), lived there for about two years, during which time Fitzgerald was quite accessible to and friendly with the Turnbull family.Fitzgerald could be a showman and a show-off, and frequently he was a boor - especially when he was drunk (a state more common for him than for most people, even more common than for most writers). But the essential Fitzgerald was a Romantic and an archetypal Irishman, a combination that perhaps made the alcoholism inevitable. He was unusually magnanimous, both with his money and his time and attention. He was devoted to Zelda, even after she slipped the traces and drifted off into her own worlds of schizophrenia. He promoted and encouraged numerous other writers. And, of course, he was a brilliant writer himself. Among the tributes from Turnbull: \\"No one had written more gorgeously than he of America's last fling at adolescence. The gay chic of his style, with the wit and tenderness constantly breaking through, had suited a time whose very tawdriness, in a work like 'Gatsby', he had transformed into lasting beauty.\\"Turnbull pays due attention to Fitzgerald's relationships with other literary luminaries of the time, especially his friendships with Edmund Wilson and Ernest Hemingway. For a time Hemingway had no bigger fan than Fitzgerald, but Papa did not repay Scott in kind. Towards the end, Scott realized that Hemingway \\"is quite as nervously broken down as I am but it manifests itself in different ways. His inclination is towards megalomania and mine toward melancholy.\\"And, of course, much of the book deals with Scott and Zelda. \\"It was hard to say whether he or she was the leader in this chaos. They complemented each other like gin and vermouth in a martini, each making the other more powerful in their war with dullness and convention. * * * Both were unstable; when they should have called a halt, they egged each other on. They faced life not ignobly but with a mad sort of daring, committed to doing as they pleased and never counting the cost.\\" They both flamed out, in different ways. The book includes a letter that Zelda wrote to Scott in 1936, during one of her lucid moments while at the Highland Mental Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina (where she died, eight years after Scott, in a fire in 1948). It is one of the most poignant letters I have ever encountered. As a beautiful, mystical, yet tragic love letter, it ranks with anything that Heloise wrote to Abelard. It alone is worth the price of the book.SCOTT FITZGERALD is a sensitive, affectionate portrayal of one of America's quintessential writers. Plus, it is superbly written and very readable. Anyone looking for a \\"non-literary\\" biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald need look no further.ADDENDUM (25 July 2012): I just finished reading \\"Hemingway Vs. Fitzgerald\\", by Scott Donaldson. It was written almost forty years after Turnbull's biography, with access to many letters and papers that were not available to Turnbull. In it, Scott Fitzgerald is somewhat shabbier and a little less noble than in Turnbull's biography, and the dreadful alcoholic that he became receives more attention. Also, in Donaldson's book Zelda Fitzgerald is zanier and less likeable than she is in Turnbull's. That said, I still recommend Turnbull's biography."},{"Title":"Scott Fitzgerald","review":"As a devotee of F. Scott Fitzgerald, this is by far the definitive biography of this very special writer.

In tracing the history of star-gazing, Evans traces the history of science, showing how ideas arose, migrated, stood up or failed under testing, and were passed down through the centuries. One learns a deep respect for ancient astronomers. Almost 2,000 years before Columbus, Greek scientists had figured out that the world was round, and had even determined that the Earth was miniscule compared to the size of the universe. Evans is committed to the idea of learning by doing, so he gives detailed instructions on how to construct every instrument that ancient astronomers used--from sundials to astrolabes. The book is full of great science projects. I would strongly recommend this book for those interested in the history of science, ancient and medieval thought, backyard astronomy... even astrologers would benefit greatly from this book."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"The big problem when writing a book about history of science, is how much background to include.

You can learn how the ancient greeks were able to predict the position of the stars and planets using the principle that the earth is the center of the universe. I took the class 2 years ago, and every once and awhile i pull out the book just to read through or make a new astrolobe plate."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"I love this book, but some publisher blemishes diminish it from a perfect five to a mere four.For a long time I've been looking for a book to explain how astronomical observations and calculations were made by the \\"ancients\\". I recently discovered this book and it seems to have everything I was looking for. Indeed, after only reading 2 or 3 pages I've learned a great deal; for example, what star risings and settings mean and how they were used determine the calendar. In thumbing through later pages I see promises of explaining all sorts observations and how they were made. For example, how can you accurately determine the position and motion of the sun in a star field when the sun obliterates the view of the stars near it? The historical precedents and chronology presented also help make this book a great pleasure to anticipation.However there are two deficiencies, in my opinion, that detract from the book. One is in the presentation and one is the fault of the current publisher, Oxford Press.This book needs a much better index, and, if possible, a glossary of terms. I don't read a book like this sequentially. I read a part that looks interesting, move ahead, then go back to clarify something, then move forward, then back again; a kind of iterative learning. By the time I finish I will have, literally, read it two, or three, or more times. I'm not very knowledgeable in astronomy and this book introduces many new terms that are very similar sounding, and defines them, casually, in the middle of paragraphs. Thus, it difficult to keep track. I'm sure it would interfere with the flow of the presentation, but clearly highlighted definitions and a more complete index would help.My real complaint is with Oxford Press. This new hardcover book, that I just purchased (September, 2009), is nothing more that about 250 sheets of 8.5 x 11 paper that was Xeroxed on both sides, combined and glued at the spine and placed between \\"hard\\" covers. The illustrations, which were not that great in the original, are really below par here. I don't mind a Xeroxed copy, which would be useful for personal annotation and comments, but not at this exorbitant textbook price. The original version, which I looked at a library, was properly produced with sewn signatures and pride. My copy is nothing more than a paperback and will crack and break apart long before I finish it. I've had this experience before with Oxford. I have a copy of \\"Astronomy\\" by Michael Hoskins and it is a wonderful book. But it started to fall apart and then I realized how cheaply it was produced. I realize that there is a new philosophy in the textbook trade; use it and lose it. Publishers want you to buy it, use it once or twice, and then discard it or have it fall apart. Some electronic books seem to come with licenses that expire after the semester is over. What trash. I still refer to my college texts of more than forty years ago."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"This is an extremely useful book; by far the most user-friendly guide to ancient astronomy available. Both the technical and historical aspects are generally presented with admirable clarity. My only complaint is that the early chapters on pre-Ptolemaic ideas are too cursorily treated. Unlike the thorough discussion of Ptolemy's system and the outline of Copernicus' system, this early material is presented in recipe-book form with little emphasis on ideas.Consider for example the theory of the gnomon. Much time is spent discussing gnomon plots (i.e. plots of the shadow cast by a vertical stick in the course of a day) and their practical uses. But our curiosity is suppressed: looking at a sequence of gnomon plots over the course of a year (p. 54) one naturally wonders why the curves are hyperbolas, except the equinoxes where the curve is straight. Not even the latter is explained. This is very unfortunate because it would have paid off greatly to think about these interesting and natural questions at this stage, since the answers lead naturally to several ideas developed subsequently. Let's see how. Why hyperbolas? Because the sun moves in a circle, thus generating a cone with the tip of the gnomon as vertex; drawing the gnomon plot amounts to cutting this cone with a plane, so one gets a conic section. Why straight at the equinoxes? Because then the daily orbit of the sun contains the tip of the gnomon in its interior; drawing the gnomon plot amounts to cutting this plane with a plane, so one gets a line.These simple insights are very fruitful. They immediately suggest Ptolemy's equatorial ring (p. 206), for example. And they would have helped us greatly in the construction of the sundial (pp. 133-139), a very complicated construction which Evans pulls out of a hat in pure cookbook form. If we had taken the time to think about the gnomon plot earlier we could now have approached this construction much more naturally as follows. To create a sundial means putting hour marks on our gnomon plot. To do this we should divide the sun's daily orbit into 24 equal parts and figure out how to find the corresponding points on the plot. This is easiest at the equinoxes, since the orbit and the tip of the gnomon are then coplanar, as we saw. By contrast Evans goes straight for the much more complicated cases of the solstices, and then obtains the marks for the equinoxes as a by-product. This construction would have been natural instead of artificial if one had understood the equinox construction first, just as later the solar theory (being simple but having the essential ideas) is a good introduction to the planetary theory, as Evans emphasises. In fact, if we were willing to settle for an approximate sundial we could have avoided Evans complicated construction altogether by extrapolating the hour curves from equinox line by qualitative reasoning as follows. Since the sun's position at a given hour throughout the year are all coplanar, the hour curves on the dial will be straight lines. It is also easy to see that the noon hour line will be perpendicular to the equinox line, and that the other hour lines will deviate only slightly from this in a sun-feather pattern. This would give us a sundial that would be perfect around the equinoxes and accurate surely within an hour at the solstices. After this it would be easier to appreciate the full construction at the solstices."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"Upon receipt of this book, I just read it from cover to cover. It's easily one of the most interesting and illuminating astronomy books that I own.James Evans explains very clearly how ancient astronomers obtained such a vast amount of data with very simple instruments."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy by James Evans is a wonderful, comprehensive study.It is beautifully illustrated with original drawings of early astronomical instruments and charts. I got a copy out of the library because I needed to learn about armillary spheres and astrolabes and and couldn't find much useful information anywhere else. I found it so interesting that I bought my own copy."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"I took the class from the Author at the U. of Washington in 1984, and have kept the handouts all these years. It was one of the best classes I ever took, and the material was always fantastic!The book takes you thru a long history of the foundations of astronomy with well documented informaton, as well as many hands-on projects you can do. You atually get to redo some ancient astronmy -- building sundials, and even an armillary sphere!This would be a wonderful book to work thru with a child interested in the sky."},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"An excellent development of the history of astronomy detailed at the university level. Don't think the ancients were in any way less intelligent or sophisticated than we are! Here is your proof. I used the mathematics and history described in this book to develop a video about the history of science (zpeg.com)"},{"Title":"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy","review":"I read Evans' book on ancient astronomy because I was interested in the history of astronomy. So this is a limited review; I cannot speak to the quality of the exercises for the students. It is difficult to find any biography for any of the ancient astronomers simply because the data is so limited that filling up a separate volume is nearly impossible. In desperation I turned to Evans' text. It turned out to be a serendipitous move. Simply as history, this is an excellent book.Evans starts out with references to the sky in the earliest Greek and Babylonian manuscripts and then has a 16 page overview from that point up to Copernicus. He then begins to interweave exercises, observations to be done, and applications into the text. Each chapter has many sub-headings which makes it easy for the reader to select those sections that are historical compared to the hands-on sections. As is apparent from looking \\"inside\\" the book on Amazon, the chapters are divided by topic with the last one on the planets being by far the longest. This makes sense since the planets were so important for developing ancient theory. Readers find the same names appearing in different contexts and by the end I had a strong grasp of the contributions of many of the pre-modern astronomers.The book changed my thinking entirely about Ptolemy. Living in the time we do, it is easy to have a fairly strong negative stereotype of \\"Ptolemaic astronomy.\\" Evans completely shatters that stereotype. Ptolemy was not only an excellent astronomer for his time but a superb organizer of the information available to him. There is extensive detail about Ptolemy in the book. Evans discusses the relationship between data and theory, especially as it applies to Ptolemy. It sheds light not just on Ptolemy but also many other ancients like Aristotle. Ptolemy, like Aristotle, was not responsible for the doctrinaire uses of his ideas hundreds of years after his death. (I often wonder how Aristotle would have responded to the use of his ideas to block the study of nature, a study which he himself considered so important.) The reader will find in here a biography of Ptolemy that is better than any single volume out there.The book also brought several other people to my attention, especially Hipparchus. Hipparchus was one of the very first to make careful observation and careful analysis central to his ideas. His name keeps popping up in places you would not expect. He seems almost like a person born in the wrong time. I had also known in general that Muslim culture had kept science alive through the European Dark Ages but Evans fleshes this fact out in detail by talking about the contributions of several individuals. Evans corrected and filled in some very simple and often inaccurate concepts I had. I cannot comment on the book as a classroom text. But I found it an excellent source of historical information about the ancient astronomers. Strictly from the historical perspective, I can highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Electrical Motor Controls: Workbook","review":"I have used this workbook, in conjunction with the hard cover text, for about 14 years. I have tried several other books but none of them can compare with this one. The material is very clear and presented in a precise manner. Some of the answers from the answer book, that is provided for instructors, are a little over complicated for application but the student does not see this. The text starts very simple and builds from there to the more complicated drawings. The only suggestion I would make is to use another letter to indicate the coil besides &quot;M&quot;. The students mistake this for the motor once in a while."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I picked up this novel hoping for some fun. I mean, the name, the cover, the basic concept all point to a fun mystery read.And I was not disappointed!This book was a ton of fun to read. I found some of the similes and metaphors over the top, but not so much that it ruins it.There are lots of twists and turns in this accidental investigator's report. And you don't know who to trust, or who to believe. The only part I found that wasn't fair for a 1st person mystery is when she finds out who's behind it all we don't get to find out until later. I've always found 1st person mysteries are better when the reader knows everything the hero does. But it does help keep the suspense going so I'll cut her some slack... this time 8=)I'm looking forward to the next Calamity Jayne mystery. I'm sure it will be just as much fun and keep me up late reading again!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I wouldn't say these are the most challenging mysteries, but the writing is charmingly funny and sweet.

The title has to stop me long enough to click on the link, the cover needs to look professional and hint at the storyline, and the blurb must be easy to read and tell me a bit about the story.This one stopped me with the title and cover, and the blurb was well-written and charming enough to make me want to read the book.

After earning a nickname of \\"Calamity\\" Tressa just wants a little respect and proceeds to try and solve the mystery of a murder that no one saw but her. Being, as she describes \\"unusually unlucky,\\" hilarity ensues. She is made into a believable character that is just trying to get ahead in life. The things she does and the things she says; even when speaking to herself; are things you could imagine yourself saying or doing. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Great Job Ms. Bacus!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The story was good but the voice patter was off. Tressa sounded more like she was from Texas or Oklahoma than Iowa.

You had some options in mind, but that was it. I enjoyed the book so much that I did something I rarely do.... I bought the series in a boxed set for my kindle!

It's a great read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book is well written, plot moves at a good pace, and the characters are like-able and well-developed.

Then this little mystery picked up speed and I ended up enjoying it very much. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the first person style refreshing.

A fine \\"free\\" summer read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Too much narrator. Just could not get into the book. Cliches were a distraction and over done. I am glad it was free."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"\\"Okay, I waited a few days to write this because I was really not sure how I felt about this book. I'll start by saying I got it off the free list, so all I invested was time. I won't rehash the story, but will start with what I did not like. Being from Iowa, the main character came off a bit as a hick which bothered me, but to be fair there are hicks and rednecks in Iowa, but this certainly doesn't describe the majority of people there. It's possible I'm a bit over-sensitive. I also did not like a lot of the bizarre or country-styled metaphors and comparisons. The word hemorrhoid does not belong in a romantic comedy.Now the good. While the book had a rocky start for me, I tried to keep in mind that most of what bothered me were stylistic things and that this was an early work. Strip those things away and there is a story about a woman taking charge of her life with more enthusiasm than grace. I can appreciate that. It was funny, and weird, and at times romantic. The mystery kept me guessing until the end, although to be fair I can never figure out whodunit until the end. My mom wanted me to read this book because she loved it. While I'm not as thrilled by it as she was, I did enjoy it and think there's a solid character base to build on. I think I'll try the next one in the series to see if it's better.\\""},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I laughed through most of this book. It is well written and entertaining.

For instance I was recently towards the end of a long trip when I walked out of a gas station to find a guy washing the windshield on \\"my\\" truck parked at pump 13. I hesitated for a minute debating whether to rush up and ask him what he was doing, or whip out my phone and dial 911, or run back into the station screaming at the top of my lungs. Then I realized I had moved my truck away from the pump and it was setting two parking spaces to my right. What are the odds of two identical trucks using the same gas pump withing 5 minutes of each other? And yes, I've actually had car keys that fit another relative's car of the same make. So far I've never found a body in the truck but give me time... Yes, we can all identify with Calamity Jayne to some extent and this book is truly a delightful read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book made me laugh so hard I loved it.

I'm a highly educated (Ph.D), successful woman (own my business), so CJ doesn't hit AT ALL close to home. Maybe that's why I could just sit back, relax, and enjoy her crazy antics. Everyone has that one blonde friend that actually could do something as stupid as most of the stuff that she does in this book, and I guess that's why I enjoyed it so much, b/c I could see my real life friend in these same situations (Shhhh, don't tell her I said that :) Like most of these freebie mysteries, the plot is paper thin, but the writing is surprisingly good. The author stuffs the book full of clever double-entendre or \\"southernisms, \\"She saw Rex and was after him faster than a tasered bull out the shoot at the Ferndale rodeo\\"--that kind of stuff. I walk endless hours around my block every week, and if it weren't for Kindle speech-enabled freebies, I'd never have the energy to do it. This little book was a God send, especially after I had listened to three duds in a row (including one by the \\"great and mighty\\" DS). Definitely looking forward to CJ Rides Again. I think the character (if not the plot), is good enough to be played by a platinum-ed, pony-tailed Sandra Bullock in some daisy dukes (I'd pay to see that), or maybe Renee Zellwegger, if she could hit a note somewhere btwn Jerry Maquire and Bridget Jones!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Calamity Jayne is not going to receive recognition for being level headed or making wise decisions. She doesn't seem to have any ambitions. What she does have is a life filled with comical moments and events that begin to challenge her to want more.

Combine that with her tendency to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you get some laugh out loud moments.

Few funny moments, few interesting plots but overall little slow and predictable. Took me 2 weeks to finish it , usually I am done in 3 evenings."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"At times I laughed hard enough to spill my tea. We've all had one of those days but the lead character seems to be having that kind of life. It was a great escape from the drudgery of daily life. I even read a few chapters while struggling through the drudgery of housework (Though, in hindsight, I don't recommend reading and vacuuming). A fun mystery with just enough red herrings for speed bumps and just enough nervous tension to keep you up past bedtime. I look forward to another offering in the future."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I almost didn't make it past page 50. The opening is slow. Too much time is spent in C.J.'s head going over unimportant details. And I found Tressa's 'voice' kind of annoying rather than funny. Many of the jokes fell flat for me. Also her name isn't Calamity Jane, it's Tressa. That threw me the entire book. I kept getting confused as both names are used interchangeably in dialogue.This is also true with other characters, and when the killer is finally revealed, I had no idea who he was because there were so many different names floating around.Once the plot picked up I got into the book and enjoyed it. It was a fun, flirty read. I enjoyed the banter with Rick, and loved Manny, Joe, and Hannah. To me this books comes off as something between the Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (not vampires thought) and Stephanie Plum. Now that I think about it, there area a lot of similarities to Stephanie Plum.Best of all, this is a romance novel with sexual tension but without pages and pages of descriptive sex. Yeah! I don't see those very often any more.I'd recommend Calamity Jane as a summer beach read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I just finished Calamity Jayne, and I did enjoy it. I would recommend it as a funny and easy read, but it is not at all \\"amazing\\". One thing that was amazing to me were the number of spelling and grammar errors. (Kindle Edition) I just hate that, it becomes a distraction. Back to Calamity, a silly and somewhat transparent 'mystery' that only the title character is unable to figure out, is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Minor Spoilers *a couple things that happen, but not the endingThis book felt like it tried really hard to be a southern Stephanie. And it failed miserably. I thought Calamity came across as just plain whiny and irritating.I gave the book 3 stars because I finished it, however, I would never read another thing by this author. I felt they tried to make Rick mysterious, but he just came off as well, some guy that had a good job (not that he was ever at it) and looked good, but was basically mean to Tressa? I don't know they kept calling her all sorts of stuff. CJ, Calamity, blah blah.So this guy that has always been a jerk to her, and she too him they are really crazy for each other. It came across more just as crazy. There was NO CHEMISTRY between them. Instead of blowing up cars like Stephanie, they shoot her horse. They have Hellion Hannah as the grandma instead of Grandma Mazur. The lead is nicknamed \\"Ranger\\".I did not find this book funny, I thought it tried to be funny, but in recounting \\"Calamity's\\" escapades, it just sounded like she was a brat. I got the impression even her family did not like her, and I did not blame them.Overall while I read it, I kept hoping it would get better and it did not. If you have not read the Stephanie books it might be ok for you. I am glad this was a free book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This was a fun book but doesn't live up to it's marketing label. It was supposed to be a contemporary romance but honestly other than some love/hate name calling banter and a couple of smooches there wasn't much romance. It was more of a mystery but a weak one at that. I think the saving grace was that there were a few characters I loved. I loved the \\"hero's\\" grandpa who informed Tressa (aka Calamity Jayne) that he was the Green Hornet and she was his Kato and just needed to drive. This was before he pulled out a gun that would impress Dirty Harry for their protection which ended up stolen and used to murder a murderer.I didn't like Bacus's way of wrapping up the mystery either. She builds up a somewhat suspenseful scene where the killer realizes Tressa is on to him/her and Bacus tries to continue the suspense by saying things like The Killer stared at Tressa. The Killer smiled a cold evil grin. So not identifying the killer during the big stand off for a a bit which I thought was a bit over kill and didn't make the mystery better. However, like I said there were some great (well, at least interesting) characters so I gave this book a 4 star rating and will read the next one. Oh and the blonde jokes peppered through the book were fun too."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Oh yes, I really loved this book. I had some LOL moments and I don't normally do that with books. Tressa Jayne is just a country girl who loves her horses and dogs and I can relate to that since I grew up in the country myself and had a pony, dogs, and cats. People keep comparing her to Stephanie Plum from Janet Evanovich's series and in some ways they are similar. However, I think I like Tressa Jayne better, because Tressa's insecurities and mishaps can be blamed a lot on the labels that people in her small town have put on her. Tressa just wants some respect and for people to stop laughing and making fun of her. She tries to pretend like all of the snickering and disrespect doesn't bother her, but deep down it is very painful to her. She puts up a brave front so that people don't know that they are truly hurting her feelings when they make fun of her. But Tressa is a hard worker and wants to prove to everyone that she can succeed and improve herself. I saw a growth in Tressa's character in this first book in the series and I'm looking forward to seeing what she accomplishes in the rest of the series. This book was not just a murder mystery/romance/thriller, there was Tressa's feelings about her life, her family, her sometimes arch enemy/romantic interest, Ranger Rick. The interaction between Ranger Rick and Tressa was hilarious and sweet. Looking forward to the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"A delightful mystery that involves madcap adventure and small town life. My favorite part of this book was a lot of the references to the Iowa town and its goings-on (since I'm from the same area as the author.)If you love a light mystery, this is a quick read with plenty of comical characters and witty descriptions. There were several pages that I was laughing out loud at the things Calamity was thinking. I am looking forward to the next misadventure of Calamity."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This is a fantastic, incredibly funny book - I absolutely recommend it! The dialogue between Tressa \\"Calamity\\" Jayne Turner and her childhood nemisis, Ranger Rick Townsend is hilarious and their chemistry is irresistable. I can't wait for the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"If you are a Janet Evanovich fan, you will love this book. Calamity Jayne is a lot like Evanovich's first couple of books in the Plum series in that it can move a little slow, but the characters, humor, and plot are there! I have no doubt that every book Kathleen Bacus writes in this series will get better and better! I can't wait for her new book this summer!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Excellent. If you like Sue Grafton or Janet Evanovich, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I loved ALMOST every sentence of this book. Mr. Bacus is a very funny writer; Tressa is wonderfully drawn; and Ranger Rick is a hunk. The secondary characters are great--her sister could be mine.HOWEVER, I had one problem with the book: the political humor. It was old and stale, actually hurting the freshness of the writing. Secondly, I don't spend $6 to have my political party insulted. However, in the interest of bipartisanship, I still gave the book 5 stars, but, next time, Kathleen, leave it out. It's a cheap shot and not worthy of your talent."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I could not ever get going with this. Just seemed to never make any point. Didn't like the characters. Just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Loved reading this book.. Humorous, suspense filled.. with a little splash of romance.. Loved how all the characters are so lovable. Read a couple more of Kathleen Bacus's books.. Loved them all! :) You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"An amusing \\"who done it\\". Calamity tells the tale in a fun, witty style. Easy and quick to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book was well-written, although the folksy country talk was mildly annoying by the end. My favorite character was the rascally father of the male protagonist."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book was very funny and kept you guessing till the very end. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The main charecter is a wonderful heroine for young and old women. A big departure from the maiden in distress novels that abound!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The main character is just too stupid - I know there are people who make poor decisions in life and don't necessarily see reality in the same way as I do, but I don't enjoy reading about someone who acts so foolishly."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"From the very first sentence I have enjoyed this book so much. From the very beginning it has made me laugh so hard and out loud that people around were looking at me like I was crazy but I didn't care. It was suspenseful but not scary and had just enough romance you could daydream about. It leave you with question but mostly it leave with wanting to read more, more in the series or just more in her collection. I will be reading this book again and again and suggesting to my mom and grandmother to read it as well."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"but still pretty endearing. I do wish Jayne's conversations wouldn't all consist of her asking others a dozen questions without taking a breath, or waiting for an answer. Seriously, what kind of reporter does that? However, her personality is buoyant and the author hints at all kinds of crazy adventures/incidents and accidents in Jayne's past so she's a fun girl to hang out with."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Loved this book. A &#34;not regular&#34; type girl who wants the same thing in life that other girls want but things just don't work out like a fairy-tail. It is a great book to read, makes you laugh, makes you wonder, glad you read it at the end. Want more Calamity."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Was slow to start but then the plot thickened. She also had me rolling, was laughing so hard! Great job, nice twist! Will be looking for more from K.Baucus."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I really liked this. Book a lot! It has humor plus mystery all in one. I could not stop reading it. I would recommend it to all my friends."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book really keeps your mind going. It is a who done it book for sure. I. Would recommend this book to everyone. Man or woman."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Just finished this and was one of the cutest stories I have read in a long time. I had a hard time putting it down ad the authors writing is just great. Will look for more in this series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I found this to be a really fun book to read. Calamity is such a hoot. Always getting into trouble at every turn. It reminds me of people I know in real life. She has a hard time dealing with how people see her, so she try's to change that fact. Along the way, she find's her-self in deeper water. She does not give up, it makes her even more determined to get to the bottom of it.* If you like fun mystery's that will make you laugh and stay on the edge of your set, this is the one I would recommend to you."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I love to read, and mysteries are my favorite books. But this book had the extra added bonus of comedy that made it an all around good read. I couldn't wait to see what happened next!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Loved this book and look forward to reading more in this series. Easy fun reading. Author knows how to keep you coming back for more."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book made me laugh from the beginning, I think there is a bit of calamity in all of us! I would definately recommend this to women wanting to have a laugh, there were plenty of twists and turns as well. I thouroughly enjoted this and will now read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"If you are ready for a few laughs, this is a good book to read. This reminds me of the Janet Evanovich books because it's about a not-so-competent girl that has to solve mysteries. Kathleen Bacus has written other books and I intend to read them."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I started this and couldn't put it down it was wonderful. I love a good mystery and this one had me up late everynight to finish it. If your looking for a fun book that wont spook you out this is this the one! Calamity Jane was the best"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This is a lighthearted love story mystery. I found my self laughing out loud. I could not believe how she described working in a big box store, you would almost believe she spent time working at one. You just wait to see what trouble she gets into next."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. Poor Calamity Jane sure holds true to her name. I wanted to keep reading to find out just what was going to happen to her."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Bacus's laugh-out-loud mystery/romance/comedy novel, complete with heart-pounding romantic encounters and small-town charm, is a cozy read filled with eccentric characters and quick-witted dialogue. If you're interested in a light beach read, pick this one up. A word to the wise: if you're prone to laughing out loud when reading funny books, try not to read Calamity Jayne when you're sandwiched between two sleeping passengers on an airplane...sometimes we learn these things the hard way."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This entire series is so hilarious and charming I suggest you just go ahead and grab all the books now. You won't want to wait in between to read them all. Calamity (Tressa) is a riot. You can't help but love her like a sister or best friend as she careens through life getting into one mess after another. I literally laughed out loud several times while reading the books, and not just at Tressa. The supporting cast is just as hilarious, from two old coots who talk more about Viagra than infomercials, to a cousin who is basically allergic to life, and Manny, the loveable tough guy who refers to himself in third person and is verrry secretive about what he does for a living.I just plowed through the whole series one after the other, totally hooked on Tressa's madcap adventures and dying to know which guy she'd end up with (the back & forth \\"two-step\\" she plays with Ranger Rick will keep you extremely involved)but once I finished the last book... it left me depressed. Seriously. I've never been so into a book before that I became upset at the thought of not reading any more. I felt like my best friend had moved away. I really hope Anchors Aweigh isn't the last in the series. Even if Tressa's finally got her man there's still plenty more trouble she can get into. I'd love for this series to continue."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"While I agree that at times I was sometimes jarred by the similarities to Stephanie Plum, I had a lot of fun reading this book. (Plus, it was a relief while I wait for the next Plum novel!) One thing that I really enjoyed about Calamity was all of the references to things that actually happened in the real world in my lifetime. (80's / 90's) I felt like I could relate and it brought me some fun text to self experiences! I always like books better when there is a part of me that can connect with the character in the book.Rick is the big strong type that is constantly there when she falls into a mess! Loved him! Wish there was more \\"relationship\\" with them. I mean even Stephanie doesn't hold out forever with Joe.I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. In fact, I already have! :-) Enjoy a fun, light read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The main character was so incompetent and clueless for someone who was supposed to be an adult it was ridiculous. Being a little spacey might be endearing but she was portrayed as an idiot. I seldom don't finish a book but this one was too silly for me to even care what happened."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"As I was browsing the tables at my local bargain bookstore a few weeks back, I came across a series of books that had adorable little covers. Okay, I&#8217;ll admit that the covers are what first drew me to the Tressa Jayne Turner Mystery series. The woman who worked at the bookstore gave it high praises so soon enough, my admiration for the covers morphed into curiosity, which then morphed into me purchasing the first three books of the series, which led to me smacking myself because seriously MORE BOOKS!?! However, I am so happy I listened to that lovely, little sales lady because Calamity Jayne turned out to be an adorable, funny, and yes ACTUALLY mysterious book and even though I am only one book into the series, I can already tell it is going to be so much fun reading all about Tressa Jayne Turner a.k.a Calamity Jayne!Calamity Jayne was New Adult before New Adult was even a thing and that sort of really rocks my socks off! Tressa entered adulthood with a thump, and up until this point, she has remained in a slump that she can&#8217;t seem to get herself out of. College didn&#8217;t work out for her. Several attempts at jobs around her area didn&#8217;t work out for her. And quite honestly, the few jobs she was actually able to snag (and keep!) aren&#8217;t working out for her all that well. I love that this book introduces us to Tressa at one of her low points, a point that ALL of us go through during early adulthood, that moment in life when you question every decision you&#8217;ve made up until that point. She is confused about who exactly she is, has not a single clue as to what she wants to do for the rest of her life, and no matter how hard she tries, she can&#8217;t seem to shake that &#8220;Calamity Jayne&#8221; nickname that she&#8217;s been branded with.Regardless of her many problems in life, Tressa proved to be an absolutely wonderful character! She was so determined to make something of herself, prove everyone wrong about her and I think that made Tressa a kick-butt main character! She was so sick of everyone thinking she would just make a mess out of everything she attempted and how they just assumed she couldn&#8217;t handle anything. Everyone&#8217;s lack of faith in Tressa pushed me to root for her even more! Another thing I love about our dear Tress? She was really sort of awkward in a hilarious way and you all should know that I love me some fellow awkward people! This girl can get herself into some CRAZY situations add that to her constant rambling & odd thoughts, and you&#8217;ve got yourself some major giggles from yours truly. Sometimes her quirky personality had my head spinning a bit but I found myself totally loving this girl throughout the book!Tressa is joined by an equally entertaining set of characters! Since this book is set in a small town, you get that small-town feeling by getting to know everyone! Tressa&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t make as big of an appearance as I would have liked to see but from what I did catch, they were supportive of her in a tough love sort of way. However, Tressa&#8217;s grandmother does stand out because she is one heck of a spit-fire! She had such a sassy personality and I could see how Tressa took after her. Along the way we also get to meet Joe Townsend who is the grandfather to the one and only Rick Townsend, Tressa&#8217;s nemesis and the (hopefully) future love interest to our main character! Joe Townsend was so much fun! Sure he was old, but he was hilarious and he was the PERFECT side-kick to our mystery-solving main character! Rick Townsend is slowly but surely growing on me. Sometimes his comments were rude, but he also had some good jokes thrown in there and before long, I was laughing at the way he and Tressa interacted. You can tell there is a not-so-pleasant past with him and Tressa (he is after all, the one that came up with the name &#8220;Calamity Jayne&#8221;) but you can also see how much he cares for her. He was always there for Tressa, sometimes willingly, most time not-so-much, and I cannot wait to see where the rest of the series takes them!On top of having a superbly fun cast of characters, I also love that this book was truly a mystery! Tressa finds herself in a not-so-hot situation when she discovers a dead body in the trunk of her car. But naturally, as with the case of most discovered dead bodies, it disappears before anyone else can see it (haha!) This is what sends Tressa on that all-important journey of self-discovery while simultaneously solving the murder that no one believes even occurred. Tressa uses this opportunity to really prove herself to her small town and while I would go a less dangerous approach, I commend Tressa for kicking some crime-solving butt. I like that while this was at times a really creepy situation, it was always laced with humor to help make it less freaky for those of us who may or may not be giant whimps. But don&#8217;t let the fact that humor was included fool you! This book kept me on my toes and constantly guessing the ENTIRE time! Just when I thought I&#8217;d have the murder figured out, something would happen to completely change my mind!I really was pleasantly surprised by Calamity Jayne! Not only is the cover super adorable (and also, can I say tasty? I mean, look at the ice cream!), but the inside of the book proved to be equal parts fun, entertaining, mysterious, and quirky. I suggest this for anyone looking for a light-hearted, quick, mysterious, and entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Loved this book. Raised three of these blonde Calamities myself. They do think like that. Loved the tongue in cheek humor. Plenty of action to keep me interested. Characters so real you wished they were your neighbors. Held my breath, laughed out loud, tucked it in, and said OH NO--don't do that. But Calamity came through. Very good read. Just to short. Please keep them coming."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This was a fun book that I wanted to keep reading. It had me laughing out loud in more than one place. Entertaining and couldn't figure who the bad guy was."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Calamity Jayne was a laugh-out-loud story full of suspense. Loved the characters, from Tressa \\"Calamity Jayne\\" to Ranger Rick to Grandpa Joe and Hellion Hannah. As soon as I finished reading the first book, I bought the boxed set of 6 so that I could read the rest of the Calamity Jayne adventures. A light and fun read with characters reminiscent of Janet Evanovich characters."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This author tried to please too many people with too many \\"understories\\". The attempt to portray the heroine as a struggling Christian wanting to improve herself, and the perverted \\"religious\\" leading man who whored after everything female was unbelieving. I believe that in the case of this story the \\"sex\\" scene seemed forced. The story its self was not bad, but I hate it when a romance novel tries to fight for the lead in a mystery book and I feel that this author did not combine the two well."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I love reading books. Was disappointed that book 4 has not come out yet. I do get upset when finding out that their are book series and I need to buy them."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book would be better without the narrator. This writing style is really annoying and ruins an otherwise enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I finished the book DESPITE the annoying first-person narration which distracted from the story. It was okay, but reining in the continuous comments, references, and non-stop blabbing would have made the story much more enjoyable. Glad it was on the free list!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Jayne's comments were too cutesy. I didn't have much sympathy for her. It's not my type of story. I'm just learning about my Kindle, so I wasn't too choosy, when I picked it out."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Off-beat characters make this a very entertaining book to read, and it manages to keep you in suspense until the end. I will look for more books in this series."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I found it very simple reading and except for the age of the characters, would be good reading for teens. Delete some of the graphic scenes and sexual content and the writer would be good for teen readers."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This is the first book that I downloaded on the Kindle app. It was free and I used it to test out my device. I pretty much enjoyed the book. It's a quick, easy read.The book's main character is Tressa Jayne Turner. She's working two part time jobs, lives in a trailer on her parent's property, and drives a car that is on the verge of falling apart. Everyone discounts her as a \\"airhead blonde\\". She has a love/hate relationship with her brother's best friend, Ranger Rick.One night, after working both jobs, her car breaks down while driving home. She discovers a dead body in the trunk and an envelope filled with money in the glove box. She runs for help and runs into Ranger Rick. They come back to the car and the body is gone along with the money. Then she realizes that it isn't her car.We follow her journey where the police don't believe her, her life is being threatened, and she keeps finding dead bodies."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I really enjoyed this book.I just couldn't help liking Calamity, cheering her on in places and feeling sorry for her in others.Its a well written mystery that had me guessing \\"who done it.\\" But at the same time had romance and quite a bit of laughter. (You don't half get some funny looks when your sat giggling during your lunch hour.)I downloaded it, simply because it was free but I'm glad I did. I'm definately going to read more from this writer."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Fast read, loved her thinking, would recommend this book to everyone. Hope she has more book out soon!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Very well written and the characters are genuinely real! I picked this book up on a whim and I'm glad I did because I had one laugh a minute and was pleasantly entertained by this book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Calamity Jayne Is the story for a lot of us blonds. Its funny, gorey, and romantic. Its Verry well written and I devoured every word in it."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Tressa Jayne Turner has spent her entire twenty-two years living up to everyone's expectations - and she has the blonde hair and blonde jokes down pat to prove it. That's no thanks to her older brother's best friend, Rick Townsend, who together since Tressa's early childhood have tormented and teased her unmercifully, and bestowed upon her the nickname by which Grandville, Iowa knows her best - Calamity Jayne.But Tressa wants to change their perceptions, to break free of the ditzy and clumsy blonde moniker. However, Calamity Jayne is known so well that when she literally stumbles upon a dead body - and said dead body subsequently disappears - the police and all of her family automatically disregard her find as the result of an overactive imagination.Everyone, that is, except her equally bumbling and outspoken grandma who surprisingly understands her. Soon Tressa discovers why and learns her smart-mouthed, fertility god statue collector of a grandmother had her own nickname growing up, and it fits her perfectly - Hellion Hannah.Throughout Tressa's subsequent quest to prove she's not the idiot all believe her to be, she uses her self-deprecating humor to cover fear when her life is threatened, manages to hold the hunky Rick at bay (she's not about to become another notch on HIS bedpost and risk continued humiliation when he notices her chocolate-induced love handles), and finds herself using the services of one geriatric, gun-toting, Green Hornet wanna-be against her will. Plus it wouldn't hurt if it all culminates in earning back a coveted job as an investigative reporter for the Grandville Gazette.That's all I'm gonna tell you, folks, except to say that from the first pages of \\"Calamity Jayne\\", I was rolling with laughter. Each time I laughed out loud, my son wanted me to read the passage to him - and that was quite often at times.My only real criticism would be that throughout the entire series of the electronic version of all six books, there were alot of grammatical and formatting errors that grabbed my attention and could have used another set of eyes for edits. For that I would have ranked this three stars. However, they didn't bother me enough to make me cease reading. Even though I also knew from the very beginning in each story who the likely bad character was, it was great light-hearted reading fare and kept me entertained.And isn't entertainment a good reason to read?"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The story line is easy to follow. I figured out \\"whodunit\\" fairly quick, but I finished the book nonetheless. I wouldn't hesitate to read another book by Kathleen Bacus!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"A great who did it. Mystery all the way through with a dizzy gal as the leading lady locating bodies."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This wonderful first novel by Kathleen Bacus is an amazingly funny, yet grippingly suspenseful, debut. Filled with laugh-out-loud moments and peppered with truly poignant observations from the underachieving \\"Calamity\\" on her average-Jayne life, it doesn't take long for readers to start rooting for this plucky heroine to receive her due. Determined to win the respect of the townspeople who have good-naturedly mocked her all of her life, our \\"dumb blonde\\" heroine Tessa Jayne finally comes to realize it isn't R-E-S-P-E-C-T that she needs, but SELF-respect. While watching her discover that fact, you root for her and cheer her on as she gets closer to solving the case no one in town believes is a case.I loved this book, and I'm looking forward to Calamity Jayne's further adventures. What a fun, delightful read."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"What an enjoyable book! The writer's style makes for a very quick read and keeps you laughing all the way. I did not guess the ending and that is very unusual for me. Can't wait for Calamity Jane Rides Again!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"A small-town underachiever with two dead-end jobs, a lust-hate relationship with her brother's gorgeous best friend \\"Ranger Rick,\\" and a reputation for living up to her hated nickname, Calamity Jayne stumbles into a murder mystery -- and a way to prove to everyone, especially herself, that she's more than just a walking, talking dumb blonde joke. Calamity's wise cracks kept me laughing and the story's mystery kept me guessing 'til the very last page.Terrific, fun debut, Ms. Bacus! I'm looking forward to the next book in the series!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"The best thing about this book is that it does have funny moments and the plot is a good idea. HOWEVER, oh my gawd! The heroine's stupidity (supposed to be charming), got VERY old and went on way too long. Not funny. I got bored with all the Lucille-Ball-badly-done antics, gave up about halfway through and skipped to the end, something i've only done one other time in my life. I don't think i missed a thing by skipping half the book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I found this book on Cozy Mystery website. I love mysteries and am always on the lookout for new ones. I agree with the reviewers, good mystery, funny, but nobody warned me about language and, well, alot more descriptive than I'm used to.Maybe it's time books had ratings like movies. Mom's with daughters looking for clean reads, beware of this one.I own over 50 Agatha Christie books and she was successful without being crude...wish more of these new wonderful authors like the accomplished Kathy Bacus would emulate her in this area."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Someone, please tell me why anyone would portray the female lead character (usually in her mid-twenties) as having a brain not yet fully developed. Tressa, a.k.a Calamity Jayne, is just such a character. Jayne finds a dead body in the trunk while driving home one night and doesn't even realize that it is not her car that she is driving. After searching for help and returning to the car, the body is gone. Jayne is now on a mission to solve this mystery, putting herself into either stupid or silly situations, all in the course of one week. This became tiresome and boring really fast. I rated this a three instead of a two only because some of what she is thinking is actually funny."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Anyone who lives in or near Granville, Iowa knows that the centerfold for Murphy's Law is Tressa \\"Calamity\\" Jayne Turner, who seems to land in the fire time after time. However, this time Calamity Jayne manages to make even Murphy look like an optimist with her latest bonehead blunder. Tired after working the late shift at Bargain City, Tressa takes a car that looks like hers, but is not hers. On the drive home on a remote road she has a flat. She opens the trunk to pull out the spare only to find the corpse of the town's drug-smuggling attorney and an envelope containing plenty of cash.Stunned Jane runs off to find Ranger Rick, but by the time they return to where she left the vehicle, the car with of course its body and loot is gone. Neither Rick nor anyone else believes Jane's story; that is no one except the killer who believes she concocted a story to abscond with the money and whoever has the cash. The murderer wants his loot returned immediately to him or there will be one less dumb blond living in Iowa.CALAMITY JANE is an amusing chick lit investigative tale with the emphasis on the heroine as the poster-child for dumb blond jokes. The dialogue between Rick and Jane is often amusing especially when she tries to persuade him that she is telling him the truth while he figures she is just doing one more stupid thing. Kathleen Bacus provides a lighthearted romp that stars simply a likable bud dumb blond.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Ok, in the beginning of this book I didn't like it. Ask Heidi. I went and complained to her. I didn't see how anyone could like Jane. Scratch that. I could see how they could like her. I could also see why people avoided her like the plague. Ok, initially my award for the most annoying character went to Mac of the Fever Series fame. Come on, if you've read it you know exactly what I'm talking about. Jane had her beat by a mile. By about 10 miles really. Oh my goodness just reliving it for this review is putting me in a tizzy. She would just start talking and talking and I wanted to put my hand over her mouth. Then Heidi said she grows on her. To be honest, I didn't really think it'd happen but I persevered. And you know what? She did grow on me! At some point she stopped being annoying and I just kept reading until I was finished. How did that happen? I never thought of Tressa as ditsy either. Maybe cursed with a lifelong streak of bad luck but not ditsy at all.At any rate, I did end up liking the book, enough to want to read the rest of the books in this series. I liked the Jane at the end. The one that stood up for herself. I liked Ranger Rick. Even though he was questionable at first. And his introduction in the book didn't quite mesh with the rest of his scenes in the book. i.e. He started out loud and annoying but the rest of the scenes showed him as the opposite. He's mainly serious and broody. And didn't he seem a little too insistent on getting Jane to back off and do something else, like leave the country? Mmmhhhmmm. Suspicious!I liked Joe and her Grandma. Though Joe was annoying at times, I think he kind of earned that right, don't you think? He just wanted to have fun. And he was funny.I laughed a lot during the book. Especially in the end when Jayne narrows her eyes at a suspect. For some reason I thought that was hilarious.And I can see the similarities to Stephanie Plum. Crazy old people, income deficiency, food, funny and even starting sentences with \\"probably\\" (twice). But they are also very different! So make sure you don't skip this one. It's funny enough with a hint of romance that makes you keep reading.Did anyone else picture her a little more blond? And your cover lies! I could have sworn she said she had curly hair!!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Tressa Jayne Turner just cannot get a break. Known as an accident waiting to happen, she's had difficulty holding down a job and getting any kind of respect. She blames her brother's best friend, \\"Ranger\\" Rick Townsend for her sorry reputation, as he bears witness to many of these unfortunate incidents. All Tressa wants is for someone, even just her family, to believe in her for a change instead of running for cover.When she comes across a dead body of a prominent town citizen, Tressa knows this is more serious than any other situation she's ever been in. But the local police don't give her explanation much credit, so it's up to her to solve a murder in a small town. And maybe, with the help of the bane of her existence, Ranger Rick, she might actually succeed. The dead bodies start piling up, and before long Tressa is up to her eyeballs in guns, tattooed hitmen, geriatric partners-in-crime, and the irritating yet irresistible ranger who gives her libido a jolt whenever he's near. The problem is that her life is in danger, so who can she trust?I really enjoyed this book, except for one thing: every once in awhile I'd swear I was in the middle of a Stephanie Plum book. The details were too close in similarity for me to ignore, and I would be unpleasantly jarred out of the plot during one of those moments, confused as to which book I was actually reading. I'm going to give the author the benefit of the doubt and believe she has never read the Evanovich series, and therefore had no clue that some of the phrases, gestures, and character descriptions fit almost to an exact \\"T\\". I look forward to book 2 in the series and hope the similarities aren't as glaringly obvious. Kathleen Bacus has a way with words and I enjoyed her writing immensely."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I thought this book was very funny. The story flowed very well and I found myself having a hard time putting it down. I loved the relationship between Calamity and Ranger Rick.

Too many clich&eacute;d phrases and attempts at sounding fancier than what it is. Plot line was interesting and protagonist was endearing."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"For the most part, this book is grammatically correct; unfortunately, it does have a plethora of mistakes, which brings the rating of the novel down.I don't want to give away any of the details of this story so as not to ruin it for the next reader. It is reputed to be full of dumb-blonde jokes, but is also chuck-full of clich&eacute;s; too many for my taste. The book made me laugh aloud more than once, not in derision, but with humor, and that speaks volumes. The author was imaginative with her creation of scenes and kept you wondering what would happen next.I give this book 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Loved this book.

Husband also read it and thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I really enjoyed this book and will have to read the rest in the series.

The author makes too many analogies and references to old events so often that you get tired of reading them. The story has great potential but she overdoes it."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"If you want it all this is the book for you. A little romance mixed in with a mystery and a heroine who can make you laugh while laughing at herself.

Sometimes you just want to escape and this is one of those books. I? Would love to see more Calamity adventures."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This is without a doubt one of the most engaging novels I've ever read - yep, I mean it. The sense of fun that pervades this work can't help but lighten your heart, and the mystery is well developed and delivers plenty of surprises. Yes, Jayne's ditsy, but loveable. Suspend your world weary cynicism and just immerse yourself in fun - you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was funny and suspenseful with a hint of a hot budding romance just waiting to bloom. I couldn't wait to see what unfortunate incident would happen next to our unsuspecting heroine, nicknamed Calamity Jane for good reason...unlikely things but yeah, it could happen...to her. It is difficult being typecast and trying to step out of the role assigned especially when it fits so well. Good luck Ranger Rick, you will have your hands full one day soon. I loved this book, it was easy to read but not easy to guess whodidit. Stretch your imagination, suspend your incredulity and just enjoy."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I worried this would be a sappy romance novel but it ended up being more of a whimsical mystery. Definitely kept my attention, even had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. I would have like to havep seen Rick's character developed more but hopefully this will happen in the second book of the series!"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Having spent a little time in such a small town Iowa town, this book brought a smile to my face as I read it. The \\"calamities\\" the lead character experienced seemed a little much at times, but overall I liked this pleasant novel"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Highly entertaining, and funny. Reminds me of the Stephanie Plum mysteries by Janet Evanovich. Will probably get her other books."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"I enjoyed the way this book kept me guessing. I was not disappointed at all.I hope to read more from this author soon."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Okay while the story line was outrageous it could still be believable but the whole first person take time to make comments and over use of the nickname and side comments made this book irritating then in the end the biggest let down of all. Why have a hot guy in the story if they are not going to get together. I was shocked to see there are more but don't have the patience to read them as this was annoyed me."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Couldn't get into this book. Basically a narration of the character telling the reader how everyone picks on her because she is blonde. Found myself skipping pages just to find dialogue between characters and that was quite short. Writing showed promise in that character almost came across as amusing, but fell just short. I did not even chuckle once and read several chapters. It was obvious from the beginning Jayne would end up with the Ranger. I was not willing to finish the book to prove myself correct. Less narrating and allowing the storyline/dialogue to make the story would have been better."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Good, not great. Fart parts were good. Needs more sex though. 34B boobs are my favorites. Too much mushy mush"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"Although downloaded I have not read it yet, so I have no opinion yet on it will let you know"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"It's not easy to make me laugh, but I did so several times during Calamity Jayne. Tressa, the poor dear, got into so many predicaments. The more she strove to overcome her dumb blonde reputation, the more it caught up with her. On certain occasions, it actually came in handy to pretend she was the ditz most everyone in town believed her to be.Even at the scariest points in the story, I found myself chuckling at the author's turn of phrase.Also enjoyable was the blooming relationship between Tressa and Townsend, the ranger. Faced with the outlandish happenings Tressa kept throwing in his path, it wasn't easy for Townsend to handle both his job and the feisty blonde.I had a great time reading this novel and highly recommend it.Morgan Mandel"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This is a very funny and mysterious book if your looking for a good laugh you will love this book"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This novel tells the story of Tressa Jayne who is quite famous as Calamity Jayne in her small town. The nickname is justified by describing a series of rather unfortunate and hilarious accidents that Tressa is involved in. Tressa character has all the shades of a blonde girl with no brains who ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time. During one of those accidents, Tressa happens to discover a dead attorney in her car and that is where the adventure begins.The mystery is fast paced and quite intriguing,it evokes a certain empathy for Tressa and you feel like cheering her on.The other characters especially the senior citizens added to the mix are well written and seriously funny. The off-on chemistry between Tressa and Ranger Rick is adorable. The author has painted a very colorful portrait of Tressa making the reader chuckle along the way. Some of the dialogues and exchange of one liners will make you smile. I don't want to reveal much but the portions of Tressa and her tight jeans and Tressa with a customer buying music CDs are remarkable and will have you laughing loudly. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This was a book that kept me entertained as our heroin went about solving the murders I felt our heroin was one of us the great unknown & wasn't a bimbo & got her man"},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This was a very fun, light mystery.

I laughed out loud several times. When questioned by my husband, all I would say was Calamity Jayne and he understood I was enjoying it.This is chick lit that was very entertaining. I never knew what to expect next. I will be looking for more Jayne books."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"This book was okay, the storyline was good, I was not really a fan of Jayne herself, it was one of those things as your reading along and she is just so dumb talking in the book that your thinking in your head OMG DUH just say it already, be clear. There was alot of that in this book. Still not really sure if she is just dumb or just plays dumb. How can you reason out a murder investigation but accidentally get in the wrong car and not notice? Thats why I don't care for the main character all that much, if she's smart enough to reason through a murder, she can damn well realize its not her car shes driving, among other REALLY dumb things in the book. There were some really funny parts, thats what held my interest, and the mystery plot. the four stars are for the comedy of it, it was funny."},{"Title":"Calamity Jayne","review":"An enjoyable read- had me laughing pretty much throughout the whole book. I would recommend continuing on with this series, just for the comedy alone!"},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in submarines. Since I made five submarine war patrols during WWII, and served in the U.S. Navy for twenty six years, it's possible I may be a bit biased. This is the best submarine book I've ever read that gives a realistic look at the day to day life of a submarine crew in action. The perspective is from the view of an enlisted man,who really tells it the way it was."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"This is an interesting book for one reason in particular. It is the only first person account of submarine warfare I know that was written by an enlisted sailor in the navy. It's well written a good story and shouldn't take long to finish.This book centers more on the personal triumphs of the people on board the submarine and less on the strategy of submarines in the war. All in all, a great account of their war patrols.As a radio nut I think it's particularly interesting that the author was a radio man in the service. I can't think of a book written by anyone in the service who played a role in radio service. As a result of mission he was in a key position to observe everything that was going with the ship and its place in history.If you liked this book you might like to find War in the Boats, Wahoo, Clear the Bridge, and Silent Running by Calvert."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"This book about the submarine USS Gaurdfish is an in depth look at look at the war patrols of a famous sub and is a great read. I highly recommend reading this book to veterans and people who are interested in military ships and events."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"Highly recommend to any one interested in WWII sub warfare. Great stories that read well, easy book to follow, and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"I try to read most of the submarine books that come along and in the case of this title, I'm glad I did. The author, Claude C. Conner, wrote it for his children,I bet he's surprised to find he has so many of them! Being aimed at those uninitiated to submarine lore, the book is quite easy to read and very easy to comprehend; certainly the glossary demistifies much of the goings-on of the diesel boats of bygone years.The book is also jam-packed with thrilling stories of The Guardfish's patrols both when the author served on her and when he didn't! The book is easily read in one or two sittings as a result of the author's knack for telling true submarine adventure tales.The title alludes to an unfortunate \\"friendly\\" fire occurence, the only one during World War II in which a US fleetboat sank another US Navy surface craft. Most of the last 4 or so chapters recount some of the slickest brass hat equivocating, obfuscating and ring-knockery to be beheld in naval literature, some things in life never change!All in all, this is a terrific book, not only for it's portrayal of naval history and heroism but also for it's depiction of human nature. Pick up a copy, and when you're finished, pass it along. Or make your friends buy a copy at Amazon dot com!"},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"What goes up must come down. What goes down may come up. Thirteen, Fourteen and fifteen. Four more words. One more."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"What a great book on our WW2 submarine warfare. I would love to see more from this author, and if this book is an example, other books would be good reading also."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"Claude Conner's account of his experiences as a submariner and the history of the great submarine he crewed on during the second world war is a fascinating account of what that exciting and fearful life was really like. He tells of the great commanding officers and their triumphs and frustrations, and of the unfortunate mistake hinted at in the title of the book. I found this truthful and rather fascinating book difficult to put down until I had finished it. I can highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity: My Patrols on the Submarine USS Guardfish during WWII","review":"Mr.Connor's book is boring! He recalls his experiences on the \\"GARDFISH\\" which was no \\"experience\\" at all. That's 1/3 of the book. He then shares his memories on a repair ship. Another 1/3. Then devotes the final 1/3 to the mistaken sinking of a friendly ship..the rescue of the surviors and the boring trial which followed. Don't buy this book in expectation of reading exciting missions of an US submarine..there isn't any!I cannot encourage anyone to buy this book."},{"Title":"aesthetics and history","review":"Bernard Berenson is the greatest living authority on Italian art and the expert who directed the purchase of many of America's great collections of paintings. In this recent book (published in 1948), Berenson sums up the result of a lifetime of reflectiion on the problems of aesthetic judgment and presents the guiding principles which underlie his own taste. His view of art is a dramatic and humanistic one; it examines the response of man's total being to the experience supplied by works of art, and judges in terms of the whole experience. The humanist Berenson consequently has some sharp things to say about contemporary tendencies in painting; the man who could, without faltering and on the basis of his own judgment, spend a fortune on a painting for a client does not hesitate to record here is own passions and prejudices. This directness, combined with his knowledge and enormous culture, makes this fundamental book on the theory of art a continual delight to read.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"I can not describe how thrilled I am to own this Bible. This is in reference to the King James Cambridge Reference Edition Black Goatskin Leather.Cambrdige is known for their quality craftsmanship, and this edition is no exception. The goatskin binding is so soft, it stays open with one hand. The font size is great for reading in low light, or from the pulpit. I also enjoy the center column references and Hebrew/Greek definitions on selected words from the text. The concordance and dictionary in the back of the book is pretty extensive. The full color maps are also worthy of mention.There really is no room for note taking, but there really isn't much that needs to be added.This Bible will last longer than me, and with the lifetime warranty on the binding, I know this Bible will stay in my family for a long time.I have several different Bibles, and this one will be my last purchase. I know you will be as pleased as I am."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"I have to add a word of caution about this deluxe edition of the King James Version Presentation Reference edition from Cambridge. The goatskin binding is probably one of the most beautiful Bible bindings I've ever seen. However, in the copy I purchased the print quality did not meet the same standards.Particularly in the New Testament, the inking was very uneven. Some pages were so faint that they almost appeared gray, while others were very heavily inked. In some places, there was almost an alternation between a lightly-inked 2-page spread and a heavily-inked one. Because I believe the Bible is printed to be read, not just admired for the binding, I found this unevenness unacceptable in a Bible of this price.Happily, I returned my copy and purchased the same edition in the calfskin binding. This new copy was &quot;printed in the Netherlands and Great Britain&quot;, and did not have the same print quality problems. The binding is not as luxurious, but still quite nice, and the print quality is good and even throughout.I hope my experience with the &quot;deluxe&quot; copy was an exception and not typical of all Bibles in that binding."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"This Bible does indeed live up to the praises of those who have already offered reviews. I just want to echo an &quot;amen.&quot; Just a few morsels of my own to throw out there. First, the goatskin leather is soooo exceptional. It feels great, looks particularly classy, and yet has a texture that reveals a certain &quot;toughness&quot; (as compared to more fragile calf-skin leathers). I just love goat-skin leather. To me, it's the best leather there is for a Bible. And you will have to hold it in your own hand, and look at it up-close with your own eyes to see what everyone is talking about.As far as the paper used, the red-colored hue blended with the gold that covers the paper is truly a sight to behold. I've never seen such quality and beauty in a Bible! Just looking at this Bible is an aesthetic experience! And the paper strikes me as being made to last. It's delicate without being too flimsy or too fragile.In terms of print quality...It is outstanding! Mine does say &quot;Printed in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&quot; also. And so I have not noticed ANY production quality problems mentioned by one or two other reviewers. As far as the font goes, it is the perfect size font, and the type is bold and crystal clear. And true, there is no real margin space for writing, but while I DO mark and write in virtually all of my Bibles, I won't even &quot;THINK&quot; about marking or writing in this one. It truly IS too beautiful to deface by adding one's scribble or colored markers. This Bible is intended, I believe, to be an heirloom, something to read and enjoy for life and then pass it down to your children. And yes, this Bible IS somewhat expensive. But hey, you can blow the same amount of money over one dinner in a nice restuarant. So expense is relative. And so, if you just want to have a truly beautiful Bible, one that feels good, looks great, and is just a delight to read while you draw close to God and enjoy His Word...Go ahead, get this one! They simply don't make em like this anymore!"},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"As Amazon has put all of the reviews for the various Presentation Reference Edition's together under each title; I want to make it clear that this pertains to the Goatskin edition, ISBN: 0521509211.This is truly the most beautiful Bible I have had the honor of owning. The Goatskin leather is the finest cover material I have seen on any Bible at any time. The paper is an excellent quality India paper with a high opacity and good strength. (It's thinner than I like for note taking, but for a Bible like this, it's quite appropriate-I wouldn't think of writing in it-it's that beautiful.) The art-gilt page edges (red under gold) are magnificent--you really have to see it to fully appreciate its richness. The layout is excellent, the character spacing lovely and old world, and the font size is large enough to be easily readable, even for those over 40.That said I did need to return the first Bible I received due to print quality problems. The print varied in depth of inking and occasionally the type would break up a bit. Part of the charm of this particular edition is that they use the Turquoise image to produce it which dates from the 19th century. Unfortunately, no matter the care given by the printer, there is occasional minor fluctuation in the print quality compared to one done solely through modern processes. The real problems do seem limited to one particular binding of the Bible though. The one I returned said, \\"Printed and bound in Great Britain\\". My replacement, which is fine, says, \\"Printed in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom\\".My recommendation is that you find one with the language \\"Printed in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom\\" at the front of the Bible. I highly recommend this Bible for its beauty and quality of materials and production. There truly is not another like it."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"This edition is both practical and beautiful. The binding is buttery soft to hold and appears to be well stitched. The gold over red edging is very striking against the black goatskin leather.The pages are thin but sturdy, and the font size is perfect for those of us who refuse to wear bifocals. My copy was printed in the Netherlands and Great Britain, and the type quality is excellent. I like the center cross references, and the concordance is very useful. The maps and dictionary are also excellent for serious Bible study.I own many Bibles, but if I could only have one, this would be my choice. The price may seem a little steep, but for pure reading enjoyment or daily study of God's Word, the Cambridge edition can't be beat."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"This edition is my personal Bible for daily reading. I obtained it after I started wearing bifocals. It has large easy to read print. Cambridge's quality in building Bibles is unmatched; the goatskin will last a long time. This book of course is the 1769 revision to the Authorized Version (a 1611 old spelling is available from Greyden Press) as are most King James Version Bibles today. The cross references are excellent, the concordance, dictionary and maps are functional. The price is high, so don't buy it if you are only going to put it on a shelf for six days and carry it to church one day a week."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"This Edition of the King James Bible, By Cambridge is Excellent. The Print size is about a 10PT and is easy on the eyes. The Bible is Black Goatskin, and the Binding, and Paper Quality are the very Best. I would recommend this to anyone that has a appreciation of fine Bibles, Fine Binding, Paper, and the King James reference edition by Cambridge."},{"Title":"KJV Deluxe Presentation Reference Edition Black leather","review":"This is the finest crafted Bible I own. Beautiful and readable heirloom.I have heard some criticism of Cambridge tampering with the spellings and capitalization within the text of the King James in the 21st Century printings. I have many of their most collectable and also this exact edition. THERE IS NO SUCH TAMPERING. This beautiful Bible is magnificently bound with impeccable attention to detail. Cambridge continues to reign Monarch of high quality King James publishers. If they had the rights to the \\"Scofield\\" study system there would be no contest at all from Oxford Press. It is a very valuable and useable Bible. Stunning craftsmanship. Cambridge has excellent customer service too.

He has gathered a large force of cavalry, men of arms and bowmen, who are camped outside his castle. Then a large shiny object falls slowly out of the sky.The ship is two thousand feet long. Lowering itself onto the boggy soil, it sinks deep into the mud. A hatch opens and a ramp lowers to the ground. A short but brawny creature, with blue skin and a short tail, steps out of the ship and three more follow him. The first creature lifts an object that projects fire, instantly killing one of the soldiers. This blue creature is immediately downed by a clothyard arrow and soon after that the other three bristle with arrows.Sir Roger leads a charge into the huge vessel and the blueskins are slaughtered throughout the ship, at the cost of a dozen human soldiers. The blueskins seem to be little practiced in hand-to-hand combat and many are not even armed. The only survivor is carried out by Red John Hameward, Captain of the archers, who has recognized the need for an informant.Brother Parvus teaches the captive, Branithar, the Latin language and is able to learn something of the ship and its mission. The Wergorix were following their usual practice to searching out suitable planets and subjugating the inhabitants. Unfortunately for them, the humans are not strangers to warfare and not too fearful of the unknown.Sir Roger soon conceives of using the ship as transport to France, thus taking the whole of Ansby village with him. The men, women and children -- including Sir Roger's own family -- load their herds and tools into the ship and then board themselves. Branithar sets the controls and presses a lever to start the journey.Unfortunately, Branithar has set the controls to take them back to Tharixan, the nearest Wersgorixan world. Once activated, the automaton cannot be stopped nor reset. Ansby village is going to the stars instead of France.In this story, the primitively armed English defeat Wersgorixan forces time and again, using raw courage and tactics unfamiliar to the aliens. Sir Roger gains stocks of alien weapons and uses them on their former owners. He even convinces the other spacefaring races in the region to become his allies; it seems that these aliens have little experience in the fine art of diplomacy and intrigue.With the occasional threat of One-eye Hubert -- the Tourneville executioner and torturer -- Brother Parvus gets Branithar to teach the English how to use the alien devices and weapons. While the underlying principles are incomprehensible, the devices themselves are easier to use than the more familiar earthly devices. Soon, women and children are operating these mechanisms while their menfolk are away fighting the war.This story is a classic examples of the SF theme of technologically unsophisticated natives acquiring advanced devices -- including spaceships -- from visiting aliens. Weber's The Excalibur Alternative is very similar example of this approach and Ringo's Posleen War series has this theme in the backstory. A variant of the theme is used in Pournelle's Janissaries series and Drake's Ranks of Bronze, where aliens kidnap a group of Terrans and use them as slave troops on other planets.In this tale, and in The Excalibur Alternative, the installation of a feudal form of government is a significant result of the conquest. The mutual vows of a feudal lord and his vassals are often presented in SF tales as a desirable alternative to looser forms of government such as democracy. Many SF stories (and countless fantasies) have dwelt upon the surety such mutual vows bring to social and personal relationships.This story was written in the first decade of the author's career as an SF writer. It has become a classic in the field and has generated many imitations and stimulations. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Anderson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of swordwielding adventure, political intrigue and romantic misunderstandings.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"What happens when a band of aliens land in Medieval England just as a local baron is assembling his army for war? The High Crusade! Poul Anderson takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to science fiction in this very funny, yet plausible short-novel. Told from the point of view of the local cleric, the story begins when a scout ship of alien beings, bent on conquest, land near the holdings of Sir Roger of Tourneville, who is gearing up to join the king for a war in France. Instead of running in fear, the war-rabid Englishmen suspect a &quot;French trick&quot; and go out to meet the ship. The fun begins when one of the aliens blasts a local, hoping to frighten the natives. Instead, the assembled troops react, only as trained soldiers will, and turn the aliens into pincushions with their longbows. Thus begins Anderson's humorous adventure. Funny as it is, the book has serious undertones in that it reminds us how little society changes despite advances in technology. This book is perfect for younger readers; it is fairly short, fast-paced, and has no offensive language or adult themes, but adults (especially students of Midieval history) will appreciate its wit and satire. It would make a funny movie. Maybe someone should send a copy to Terry Gilliam (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Time Bandits)."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This old \\"classic\\" is a great tour-de-farce that Anderson masterfully keeps just on the edge of plausibility. The premise is simple. A highly advanced alien spaceship, from the \\"Wersgor Empire\\" lands on Earth with the intent of subjigating it. The time is the 14th Century, the place, England.Well, the local horse cavalry surprises and overwhelms the aliens and takes control of the spaceship. The Englishmen then proceed to take on the whole Wersgor Empire by guts, guile, and good old human deviousness. This all makes for great fun. This is a terrific \\"beer and chips\\" novel, which is all Anderson, a Grand Master of SF, intended for it to be. I only gave it three stars because this is not great literature, nor is it the best that Anderson has written. But make no mistake, this one gets 5 stars in the category of readability and fun, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Science Fiction and has a good sense of humor.

Being written by Poul Anderson (I'm a big fan)means he has studied his history so the background details are correct. I hope that doesn't sound dull; it's just the opposite. Nothing is duller or more jarring to a reader than to start thinking, &quot;This doesn't sound right&quot;. The High Crusade is perfect! The story just sweeps you along with its adventure and underlying humor. The humor comes out of the basic situation. A highly advanced but unpleasant group of aliens land in Medieval England. Big mistake. The medieval knights simply clobber the aliens and steal their spaceship. From then on it's medieval knights conquer the universe! Of course there's a personal plot, a marriage that's in trouble and conquering the universe solves that! There's also a wonderful framing device as modern humans go into space and run into their medieval ancestors! Too bad Anderson never wrote a sequel! It's my only criticism. I'd love to see more of this."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This is a classic tale in the 'Terrans Uber Alles' genre. Evil aliens try to take over the earth but the humans triumph and take over the galaxy. The twist to the story which makes it such an engaging read is that the aliens landed in medieval England and a rag-tag band of goatherds and farmers can still win. There are strong elements of the King Arthur plot mixed throughout this story.A very good read."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This book is good fun. It is not hard science fiction by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can suspend your disbelief for just a bit you will have a heck of a time reading this. Mr. Anderson's style really hits its stride with this work. In a way it feels like a reversed 'Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' with the protagonist(s) travelling forward in time rather than backwards. The mixture of drama and satire gives these two works some common ground as well. I am not arguing that this work is as strong as Mark Twain's piece but it at least aspires to be so, and with all the trash out there it is nice to see an occasional gem of imagination."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"High Crusade is one of my favorite SF ever, since it is pure mind game. Despite its wicked humor, it asks a serious underlying question: Can high-tech warfare be defeated by clever tricks and basic weaponery? Poul Anderson used funny - but interesting - tactics to make his point: - sophisticated radars and satellites detecting vehicles and missiles launches can be fooled by wooden trebuchets lobbing tactical nukes; - highly trained firearms soldiers can be cut into ribbons by swordsmen at close quarters.It does not require a vast imagination to transpose the funny context of &quot;High Crusade&quot; in our serious world.When I looked at TV at the wounded US soldiers evacuated from Somalia, defeated by rag-tag local militiamen, I had a thought for this book.In Bosnia, the high-tech occidental armies were almost defenseless against snipers using relatively crude weapons. In Kosovo, the Serbian Army managed to fool the Allied coalition using wooden tanks and artillery, preserving most of their land forces intact despite weeks of bombing.Civilizations expect foes to behave - and fight - like themselves. This could prove dangerous. Thanks for the demonstration, Poul."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"As best I can tell, I read this book about 25 years ago when I borrowed it from the local library, and yet I never managed to pick up a copy for my very own, a failing I remedied when I saw the Baen 50th anniversary edition, with a plethora of loving introductions and the 1983 short story sequel \\"Quest\\". All of those parts add a little more meat to the book, for all in large part they consist of modern sci-fi authors admitting \\"I ripped off The High Crusade when I wrote X\\". Silverberg's introduction also points out some of the humour and in-jokes Anderson slipped in to his work: I'm sure there is a lot more there too.As to the story itself, what can I say? All the other reviews are right: this is about knights in space, full of God and the right and Englishness (in all its Saxon-Viking-Norman glory). The tale is both completely improbable and improbably gripping. You think \\"that could never happen\\" and then you think - because you want to - well, hold on, I suppose...It also helps if you sometimes look around at civilisation and wonder how we'd cope with a sudden invasion of take-no-prisoners barbarians.This is sci-fi, adventure, tragedy and comedy. You laugh out loud at the audacity of writing it, and wonder whether Anderson ever read (and expanded the concept in) Manly Wade Wellman's \\"Day of the Conquerors\\" out of Amazing Stories magazine. Its just good clean fun at its finest. You can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"If you watched many of the old B&W Hollywood knights/swordsman's movies from the 1950's, this book is for you. Anderson may have gotten his idea from this style of film and turned it into one of the classic of science fiction. Aliens invade the Earth and instead of their advance technology overwhelming the medieval knights, the opposite happens and the strong will & cunning of the English conquers the aliens and their known space.

Anderson can write us another one."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"Poul Anderson (1926-2001) was a prolific writer of science fiction. His 34 novels can be categorized as primarily elaborate space-adventure tales. His talent was in creating likable characters and well thought out alien worlds. His stories of aliens, imaginary worlds and futuristic societies were plausible and, equally important entertaining. His novel \\"The High Crusade\\" is, in this reviewer's opinion, a good read for a young teens but adults will I fear not be entertaining.The High Crusade, written early in Mr. Anderson's career- 1960 - is a \\"space-adventure\\" with an odd twist. We are confronted with another of the well-worn themes used by SF authors: the what-if story. An interstellar space ship lands in 1345 England full of blue skinned aliens. Sir Roger and his army of English knights and yeomen overpower the aliens and with the assistance of a captured blue-skin return to the alien's home planet. The English knights defeat the local military; out fox alien armies using 14th Century siege techniques and eventual become Masters of the Local Universe. How this could happen boggles the imagination.In 1960 when I first read this book it was one of my favorite stories. In 2010 I decided to re-read it having obtained a new edition. Time has not been kind to this story. Anderson just glosses over any plot contradictions. Any concepts that may seem absurd are just not discussed. Young readers will probably love it but adults familiar with Anderson's excellent SF novels will be squirming to finish it.I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the most confirmed fans of Poul Anderson. The plot was preposterous and lacked any credibility whatsoever. An alien race with Faster-Than-Light drive, a militaristic society with all the death toys needed to conquer other space faring races defeated by men on horses with swords and shields...you have been warned."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"When aliens decide to add Earth to their list of conquered worlds, they get more than they bargained for upon landing in medieval England. The colorful warriors of the day not only defend their lands valiantly, they decide to turn the tables. The main problem I had with this story is how easily the medieval humans became comfortable with the alien situation, considering the hundreds of years it took humans to cope with new ideas at that time. Just another day at the castle, here, it seems. Otherwise very entertaining and colorful writing. Recommended overall."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This book was a great read. I'm a fan of Poul Anderson and this was possibly his best story ever."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"What a fun read - lots of entertaining creatures and characters as they move out across the stars and looking at a &#34;What If&#34;"},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"The High Crusade is a genuinely different take on the idea of an alien invasion. Aliens, landing in medieval England to capture slaves, get more than they bargained for. The knights who guard this particular neighborhood aren't intimidated by advanced technology. Instead, they attack before the aliens know what hit them, and take over the space ship and then proceed to liberate the planets the aliens have conquered."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"For those who have read the book before, it's awesome it's back in print, even if it's not my favorite format, and there's a couple of tributes to the book in the beginning that are interesting.For those who haven't read it, if you like sci-fi and fantasy crossovers, read it! I don't know what else to say without too many spoilers, just read it."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"Every sf fan is familiar with the alien-invasion motif, but in most examples the aliens come to a modern-day Earth--or at the very least a semi-industrialized one, as in H. G. Wells's prototype novel,The War of the Worlds. In this delightful and suspenseful tale, the prolific Poul Anderson--one of the greats of modern sf and probably my favorite among authors--asks the question, \\"But what if an alien race had attempted to invade Earth in the distant past?\\" The past he chooses is the year 1345, when Edward III of England is engaged in a war against the French. In Lincolnshire, a local baron, Sir Roger deTournville, is gathering a levy of knights and infantry to join his liege when a spaceship descends from the heavens. It belongs to the Wersgor, a rather demonic-looking race with an innate bent toward conquest, who, well aware of the technological inferiority of humanity to themselves, figure that victory will come easy. But while the English quite understandably do panic at first, they soon regain their wits and courage and spectacularly turn the tables on the foe, leaving only one alive. Then Sir Roger gets his Great Idea: with this craft he can not only insure his king's ascendancy over the French, he can even free the Holy Land! Treachery on behalf of the one remaining Wersgor scotches the plan, but Sir Roger and his followers prove flexible enough to adjust to almost everything they encounter in the far reaches of space. It takes a turncoat among their own ranks to threaten their successes--and who should know their weaknesses better?Though intentionally somewhat tongue-in-cheek, the storyline is surprisingly plausible, and Anderson--who was also something of a historian, particularly of the era of his Viking ancestors, and wrote fully half a dozen historical novels--skilfully weaves in such elements as the all-embracing religious faith of the era and the tensions and problems that arise from feudal societal structure and courtly love. Sir Roger, though he has all the faults of his time, is brave and clever and has the advantage of coming from a somewhat tangled political structure, which inclines him naturally to intrigue, a fact that proves useful when he begins trying to rally the other sapient races against the Wersgor. If you're not familiar with Anderson, this early example of his work would be a good one to begin your acquaintance with him."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This is one of my collection of \\"must read\\" SF classics, along with Earthblood, Stranger in a Strange Land, etc. that I have been passing on to the next generation.

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"I first started to read The High Crusade (book #63 of 83 that year) in October 2008 but I accidently left the book on the train into Chicago and it stands that it's the only book I ever lost. But the novel left such a unique impression on my mind that I decided to track down another copy and finish it... without losing it, again.This being my twelfth Anderson novel, I have a pretty good feel for his writing style. The general prose and vocab is similar to his other works of Mirkheim, Horn of Time or Planet of No Return. It's not quite gripping, but when Anderson introduces, rather abruptly, the item of the medieval humans overtaking the starfaring aliens and their colonial planets does one's interest become sated. I've never read a silly Anderson novel before, but how the humans find themselves in situations are lip-bittingly inane, how the humans culturally chest thump is patently absurd and how they defeat advanced aliens with broadswords, cavalry and simple medieval military tactics.Amongst the silliness, Anderson throws in some paragraphs and sentences which read more like poetry than pulp sci-fi. One example: \`...she... stood there denouncing him in the enemy night. The larger moon... touched them like cold fire.' Then there is Anderson at his best when he stirs up some formal English: \`His declensions are atrocious and what he does to irregular verbs may not be described in gentle company.'From the gems I further uncovers after only reading half the novel in Chicago, I'm delighted to have finally finished the novel from cover to cover. The only other silly novel of Anderson's I can recall is Brain Wave, but High Crusade is on a whole new plateau on par with the likes of Sheckley. Not exactly a perfect novel, but a great 160 page romp."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"In the year 1345, an alien spacecraft lands in the small English village of Ansby, expecting an easy defeat of the local primitives. Unfortunately for them, the local primitives are preparing to go on Crusade, and their reaction to having one of their number burned where he stands is a disciplined military reaction. That discipline and the aliens' surprise results in the English capturing the ship. Unfortunately for the English, the last alien survivor manages to lock the ship onto an autopilot program that will return it to its base. Unfortunately for the alien empire, that gives the Baron 10 days of travel time to come up with a plan to conquer the garrison on the alien colony planet...It sounds daft, and it is, but Anderson was a good enough writer to pull it off. Sir Roger may be a mediaeval baron, but he has an open mind, an excellent grasp of tactics, and a sound understanding of practical psychology. That makes him a formidable opponent for an empire that hasn't had to deal with serious opposition for generations. It also makes for a very funny story, particularly when Sir Roger cheerfully lies his way through various negotiations, presenting himself as the representative of a large multi-planet empire.First published in 1960, this is a short novel by today's standards, but just the right length for the story it tells. It's enormous fun, and well worth a read."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"\\"The High Crusade\\" is a fun read.

It would be a good introductory science fiction book for a teenager."},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"This is a unique story and very well told. The beginning of the book stands in stark contrast to the beginning of Wells' \\"The War of the Worlds\\". In that book, the Englishmen are frightened of the extraterrestrials - but not in this one. The Knights are not the least bit intimidated by the Bad Guys and show them on the second page what the true meaning of \\"warlike\\" is. They then go adventuring across the stars and win a kingdom. Some years ago, I found a movie presentation of this book on DVD that had apparently been made in Great Britain...if you see it, do NOT waste your money on it. The movie is only superficially like the book and in fact ruins the tale. Bottom line: if you like high adventure in space, get a copy of this and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The High Crusade","review":"Has it really been half a century since this novel was published? The Baen 50th anniversary edition came out in 2010. Numerous reviewers have commented on the story line, which is sort of the reverse of \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\", where the less technologically advanced 15th Century hamlet of Ansby takes on an advanced alien dictatorship spanning worlds. The tale is told from the journal of Brother Parvus, and the language is what interested me. There are some stereotypes (no, they didn't think the earth was flat), but in a great many places the tone and language are spot on, which gives the book its light humor (\\" all demons know Latin\\"). The SF novel that comes to mind is Richard Purtill's The Parallel Man, which is told from the vantage point of a mediaeval prince. The High Crusade breaks down at one point in some of the alien's speech, which not only falls into current ('60s) slang, but also clashes with the style of Brother Parvus, the recorder.That said, however, it's a light, intriguing read, with a sort of sub-plot which blossoms later in the book. The ending sets up a number of open-ended questions, namely regarding the creation of feudal systems on various planets, which would seem to lead to a sequel, or even a series. However, as has been oft' noted, the book is a one shot. Also as noted, it's clean and old-school heroic, so while teens and adolescents will enjoy it (but possibly miss some of the mediaeval references), adults can settle in and discover how inventive SF once was.In the '60s, this book could ride the revived interest in things mediaeval engendered by Tolkien's Ring books.

The shocking part is that it was written so wonderfully as to make it entirely believable. This book and maybe a couple of others addicted me to Sci-Fi and Fantasy but NOTHING I have ever read combines them so effortlessly and made me laugh out loud in the process. This book is probably one of the great treasures that the author ever wrote and I cannot begin to express my thanks for the wonderful imagination that allowed it to spring forth as this story.

Not so this book, that has to be one of the funniest romps ever conceived. For when the blue-skinned aliens land in 14th century England, they are met by that nastiest of creatures, humans, all dressed up in preparation for a war against France, but more than happy to seize this opportunity to defeat these obvious spawns of Satan.\`Tis a rollicking good adventure spun here, as our knights overwhelm by force, guile, diplomacy, and threats of torture (as only good English knights know how to administer). As the saying goes, the poor aliens never knew what hit them. And there is just enough plausibility to the scenarios and actions that your disbelief can easily be held in abeyance while reading this, as your humor meter keeps itself pegged well into the laugh zone. There's even a message here that many military commanders should heed, that decisiveness, surprise, and strength of will can often defeat an enemy with far greater weaponry and numbers.This work was nominated for the 1961 Hugo Award, where it had the misfortune to be up against the great Walter M.

What this book hopes to examine is the relationship between war and society. The focus is on how this relationship changes from the Roman conquest of Italy through the Republic, and consequently the Principate and the late Roman Empire. John Rich offers a brief historiography in his preface regarding discussions, lectures and literature on war and society in the ancient world. This book is very useful to the student of Roman studies for it examines different facets of Roman history from its earliest settlement times to the end of its Empire. While it is not a complete chronological history of the relationship between war and society in the Roman world, it is a well organized and well written collection of essays from very knowledgeable writers. In addition, there is extensive bibliographic information at the end of each essay which always helps aspiring Classics students better prepare their own scholarly studies."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's insomnia and the causes thereof","review":"From the title, I judged this to be a spoof, and possibly one of the sources of the movie SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.

I enjoyed it nonetheless because as usual, Adam is at his best."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"PD James' books are so engaging due to a combination of a clever who-dunnit mixed with literary observations about the human condition. She elevates the genre head and shoulders above anyone else writing in the same vein. However in A CERTAIN JUSTICE, the mystery side of it is not rewarded by clever deduction but rather by an ordinary chain of events. The solution is not arrived at via sleuthing but by a chain of events that would have occured had anyone been assigned to the case. The opening book is the most intriguing. Downhill from there. Real disappointing."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This book is a great example of why I think that P. D. James is the archetypal crime novelist, someone who combines the elements of a good mystery with strong writing and vivid themes, yet _not_ being pretentious in the process. It is deceptively simple: a variation of the English country house murder with a limited group of suspects--only here the English country house is replaced by various institutions in the British criminal justice system. I enjoyed it a great deal, both as a mystery and as a novel."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Read one PD James novel and you will see right away what separates the truly gifted writer from the merely entertaining. For me, mysteries are a good diversion from the cares of the day, so I tend to read a lot of them. Most are entertaining and written in workman-like prose. Some even have above-average plots that stick with me for a bit longer than it takes to read the book itself.PD James, on the other hand, manages to entertain while also offering readers attention-getting prose that makes one really think about how the characters feel and how events in the plot might actually affect the lives of real people, with pasts and futures, families and friends, fears and longings. Take this passage, for example:\\"I no longer believed in God...I just woke up one morning to thesame grief, the same dull, daily tasks, and knew with certaintythat God was dead. It was as if all my life I had been hearingthe beating of an unseen heart, which was now forever stilled.\\"You just don't get writing like that from the usual paperback thriller. And James also delivers on the plotting details and elements of time and place that mystery lovers expect from a good page-turner. Overall, this is an exceptional mystery, with James' signature detective, Adam Dalgliesh, in true and rare form. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Another extremely long P D. James novel, of the sort she has been writing since A Taste for Death, with more emphasis on loving descriptions of room interiors and architecture than on an ingenious puzzle plot. Here the plot if especially disappointing, with one element evidently borrowed from Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution (the eyeglasses of the trial witness) and very little emphasis on ratiocination on the part of her detectives. Part of the solution is handed to Dalgleish in a confession, the rest he obtains by sheer guesswork, as other reviews have pointed out. The final explanation is one of the most improbable, uninspired fizzles in her work. James might as well have selected the killer randomly.Do characterization and writing compensate for the poor puzzle? Frankly, no. The opening situation is the standard business where an unlikeable person, in this care the lawyer Venetia Aldridge, goes around giving an implausibly large number of people some reason to kill her. After she is finally slain, Dalgleish and his team show up and ask a lot of questions, but get nowhere. Eventually there is a confession to one element, then a long thrill section where a killer is pursued (this reads like James was writing it for the inevitable television adaptation). Then Dalgleish pulls the ultimate solution out of his hat. Along the way, we get a lot of characters, but very few of them are developed (despite all the verbiage). Venetia herself, who starts off as an interesting character, becomes almost an afterthought after her murder. We also get James' usual social observations, with an occasional conservative sentiment concerning the decline of religion or the rise of political correctness, but none of this really adds up to an interesting novel.Earlier James novels like A Mind to Murder and Shroud for a Nightingale, written at a time when Agatha Christie and Nagio Marsh were still alive, show much great ingenuity with plot and have good writing and characterization as well. James' novels for the last twenty years are much longer yet less satisfying."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is my first P.D. James book. Although I love mysteries and usually check back pages to see who did it so that I can look for the clues the writer gives, I did not with this book. I was drawn in by all of characters and liked the way she gave motives for most of them. Any one of a number of people could have done it.I had not guessed who the murderer was and was disappointed by the confession in a long, long letter. The ending was a let down also. Felt it left things hanging.I do enjoy her writing and insights on why people act as they do, but something was missing here. I intend to read more of her books before I form a definite opinion."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"My first PD James, I realized with about 40 pages to go that I had seen this one on the tele, and it was just as boring there. I like character studies. This is a story of characters, with long descriptions of places and people that have little or no bearing on the story's development or understanding how the characters act. As she nears page 300, the author decides it's time to wrap up, and thus uses the gimmick of a long letter to do what she should have been doing all along -- develop the plot. I do see a searing social criticism of English lawyers running through this, but big deal: going after lawyers, especially English ones, is pretty difficult. Overall, the writing is self-indulgent, sort of talented fluff for those carried away by that sort of thing (of which these reviews reveal quite a few). There is lacking what another reviewer here aptly referred to as &quot;soul.&quot;I would love to find a female mystery writer that stands up to the best of the male lot. Unfortunately, if A Certain Justice is typical of James, she's doesn't make the grade."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James' writing takes you so far into the mind of her characters, their fears, motivations, and secrets it's startling.

She walks you down a street and you can feel the wind against your skin. Great."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I have read all of P.D. James' books and was somewhat disappointed.

Few Red herrings, Paints excellent picture both of Scotland Yard's methods and English legal system. If film rights purchased Glenn Close would find dream role as Venetia."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"To be honest I was a little disappointed with this book. It will appeal to those who like the more slow-paced, character driven English detective novel. Noone moves at much more than a measured pace, and the book moves in just that way. There are long passages of description, well written, and evoking excellent word images. It's not enough to enter a church, there is inevitably a few paragraphs of architectural and ambient description. This type of mystery book does have great appeal. The source of my disatisfaction is actually within the plot itself, not the characterisation. The really crucial information, upon which the resolution rests is not really as an outcome of sleuthing, but a convenient device (letter). The characters are quite dour; noone ever seems to have much fun (or even laugh or smile) in a P D James book! James voice is also heard quite strongly, so you have to be prepared for her fairly High Tory conservative social views (hates social workers, believes in innate evil). She does, however, have the knack of lifting the lid on the seething resentments and everything-is-not-quite-as-it-seems behaviours just under the genteel surface of English middle class society! Will appeal to those who enjoy a languid, none too hurried traditional detective story."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"There is little new or surprising in this latest effort from James. There is a certain whiff of snobbery and misogeny about this book. The main female characters (nearly all victims of one sort or another) are portrayed by dysfunction, insecurities and social class, with scant attention to any unique individuality. Few of the characters elicit interest or sympathy. Dalgleish, the most complex character here, is woefully absent for big chunks of this book. I'm not surprised this is getting better reviews in the US, distance from its setting (London, UK) probably enhances its plausability!"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Perhaps PD James will shrug but there's no way I can accept her ending to this otherwise brilliant whodunit. Nor can I believe that Commander Dalgliesh would do so. For me, this was a great read until the very last page. I still rate it high because of the entertainment received."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Deep in so many ways.. exploration of various characters feelings reactions.really brings out how our past,our environment and experiences affect our interpretation an reactions an actions to things in life that hit us.

What's to like?I might have given it 2 stars if it were not for Ms James' extraordinarily irritating verbal tic -- \\"hardly\\". \\"I would hardly ask him that\\", etc. Hardly a common turn of phrase but it appears that Ms James can hardly write a paragraph of dialogue without it."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I thought the beginning was dragged out.

It is a beautifully written and beautifully crafted novel.I will definitely be reading more P.D. James novels"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Think I would agree with the reviewer who said Ms. James is the finest literary British mystery novelist in the world. She is impeccable. This novel is one of those books where almost everyone is glad the victim is dead, and more than one suspect was tempted to kill her. James is not just writing a who done it, she is analyzing human nature and society, and gives more than one profound insight into humans and their behavior.As a minor flaw, I might tend to side with those critics who said this could have been a bit shorter. Once in a while the novel did seem to drag a bit. However, as usual, James is superb.Besides, who doesn't like a book where a repugnant lawyer is killed?"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Her books never fail to keep me in suspense to the end. Always well developed characters and complex plot lines."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Venetia Aldridge, a bitchy, brilliant criminal attorney with a talent for getting guilty clients off the hook, is brutally murdered in her Chambers. Once again, Commander Adam Dalgliesh steps in to unravel a mystery that, as is the case in almost all James' finest novels, lies buried in the past.Though A CERTAIN JUSTICE is not P.D. James' most intricately plotted or fast-paced novel (that distinction belongs to the brilliant SHROUD FOR A NIGHTINGALE), it's a great throwback to her early days, during which some of her most compelling books were written. The central character, Venetia, nearly upstages Dalgliesh here, and with good reason: she is probably the most enthralling, fascinating character James has ever created. She is eminently respectable and thoroughly unpleasant, and because of this she has naturally surrounded herself with a gallery of suspects, all of whom have reason to do her in. The way in which James reveals the true murderer, however, is nothing short of brilliant. In fact, the entire plot is a marvel of construction, with every clue scrupulously laid out for the reader. As always, however, the relatively simple details of the crime belie the emotional and psychological turmoil boiling beneath the surface.What distinguishes A CERTAIN JUSTICE from her more recent books is the quality of the writing. James' technique is as stylish and literate as ever, but so much more readable; she wastes few words on unnecessary details about architecture (as one reviewer aptly pointed out below). The novel is much shorter than A TASTE FOR DEATH, DEVICES AND DESIRES, or ORIGINAL SIN, fine mysteries that were undermined by excessive rambling. At under four hundred pages, A CERTAIN JUSTICE is leaner and cleaner, and also has a thrust and energy lacking in its predecessors. This is truly P.D. James at the peak of her form--an exquisite, beautifully crafted novel that also shows a tremendous amount of grace and restraint."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"No reason for me to duplicate what other reviews have adequately described.The book is well written, engaging, and filled with interesting characters.But the ending is no better than the work of an amateur.I disagree with other reviewers on a couple items. A few reviewers saythat the writing is excessively descriptive. Several reviewers say thatshe dwells too long with character descriptions which are irrelevant tothe plot. WRT the character descriptions, I entirely disagree. If anycharacter were described less, these same reviewers would be complainingthat the characters are stereotypes or shallow. These characters aredescribed as succinctly as possible if they are to be interesting andbelievable. Most contemporary writers use the same number of pages todescribe uninteresting and unbelievable characters. The only otherdescriptions which I think anybody could complain about would be herdescriptions of \\"rooms\\" (furniture, etc.). If you count up the pages, Idon't think they would add up to much. I treat these descriptions justlike observing a room in real life. I'm a typical man who doesn't paymuch attention to \\"interior decoration\\"-- so I read through theseparagraphs quickly and don't pay them much attention. I respect whyJames writes the paragraphs though. Many readers are very interested ininterior decoration, and James herself obviously is. I wouldn't want abook to be dummied down on my account. If you don't think gettinginvolved in interesting characters is a pleasurable experience in itself,then James is not the writer for you-- television is probably much moresuitable to your tastes.A couple writers wrote about the hurdle of learning intricacies ofthe British legal system. I can agree with this only if the audienceis middle school level or below. I knew nothing about British lawbefore reading this book. An ounce of common sense, and looking upabout five words in a hand dictionary was all it took to completelygrasp everything alluded to. Once again, if you want entirelymindless diversion, then James is not for you. If you are like me,you will enjoy the freshness of experiencing things in an environmentwhich is new to you.Some reviewers complained about the (moral) unattractiveness ofthe principal characters. I stand with the great majority of readerswho agree that most of the characters are unattractive, but they arealso realistic and (most importantly) engaging. Some naive reviewerscriticize aspects of characters, for example, picking apart Miskin'sindignation. I have news for you... that is how real human beingsare. James is not trying to describe role models, but realisticpeople. If you prefer your characters black-and-white, there areplenty of other authors who can serve that up for you.I did not like the denouement. Yes, it \\"made sense\\", but, ascapably noted by somebody else, it was not \\"solvable\\" by causalreasoning. Trying not to give anything away here... Whatdisappointed me more than \\"who did it\\", was the unoriginal andunrealistic way that everything was spelled out in the end.I've seen very similar scenes in more than one Columbo ending. Itis really stupid to think that intelligent criminals would take thetrouble to disassociate themselves from their crime until a certaindate X, then all of a sudden they give every detail to the policebecause they are certain they will never be convicted. Ridiculous.Even if anybody could somehow know that no piece of evidence willbe found in the future, the police have ways to trouble people otherthan getting one convicted... in this instance, it would take verylittle trouble for the high ranking detective to turn themurderers's associates against him (by just repeating what themurderer himself has said). And to think that a lawyer would notgive any mind to these concerns... idiotic."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James has come a very long way from her 1962 debut novel COVER HER FACE, and her narrative skill has become increasingly powerful as the years have gone by. A CERTAIN JUSTICE is indeed a showcase for that skill, for her uncanny knack for creating believable characters seemingly out of midair, and for the grace and power of her prose. And it is extremely easy to become absorbed in the novel: although the paperback edition runs well over four hundred pages, I wolfed it down in less than twenty-four hours.A CERTAIN JUSTICE concerns Venetia Aldridge, a criminal lawyer renowned for her skill at defense. But for all her professional renown, Venetia is something of a failure in her private life: high tempered, demanding, and determined to hold others to the same high standard for which she strives, she has a well deserved reputation for coldness and unkindness. Most specifically, she has a need to be in absolute control--and as a result she makes enough enemies both professionally and publicly to fill a telephone directory. And when she is found dead in her offices there are suspects galore.Throughout the novel James revels in the details of the English court system, painting brilliant portraits of the individuals who move across the surface of the law--and sometimes under it. And as the novel progresses she draws us deeper and deeper still into their lives, their motivations, their worlds. It is a brilliant piece of writing. But it has a problem: the ending stinks. After having skillfully maneuvered us through this unique world and held our interest through two murders and a host of subplots, James essentially cops out by giving us a solution that her detective, Commander Adam Dalgliesh, cannot have logically reached--it is pure guesswork, and frankly James would have done better to simply leave Venetia's murder unsolved than to saddle the novel with such an uninspired conclusion.One of the novel's several points is that murder cannot always be proven in a court of law and therefore cannot always be punished, and I certainly have no quarrel with that concept. But the person who &quot;did the deed&quot;--let us say that for all the logic involved, James could have just as easily selected another character and pinned it there. The final chapter is a tremendous let down, particularly in light of the exceptional work that precedes it. Four stars for James' impressive narrative style, but you're likely to be disappointed on the final page.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"~ -~* * * * * P.D James does it again!

She's not really a mystery novelist, she's a novelist who happens to write mysteries. The current book, A Certain Justice, certainly highlights this circumstance, because the characters are more interesting than the plot, and by the end of the book my reaction, anyway, was indifference towards the solution. I give the book high marks in spite of that because the characters themselves are interesting, and it's their interplay that the book revolves around.The story revolves around Venetia Aldridge. She's a barrister (a British lawyer who works in courtrooms: those who don't are called solicitors) who specializes in getting criminals off when their crimes would otherwise dictate convictions. She also boasts an abrasive personality, to the point that she has no close friends, and even her lover is somewhat distant and unsure of her. No one really likes her, she abuses her position when she can get away with it, and she has a wonderful ability to antagonize people. And then she gets killed, and of course everyone's a suspect.Though this is a strangely constructed mystery novel (the killing takes place about 75 pages into the 350+ page book) it's still interesting to see how the detectives go about their job, led by the redoubtable and seemingly unflappable Adam Dalgliesh. The other characters are interesting, though several aren't explored as intimately as you might like. In some ways I think when James wrote her longer books, and explored everyone involved in the crime in detail, she was actually a bit better, but I can see how others would think this had slowed the book down. Regardless, this is a good novel, and is recommended on that level, though not really as a mystery."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"'A Certain Justice' is a crisp, fast-paced read. It begins inside a courtroom, with Venetia Aldridge defending young Gary Ashe for the murder of his aunt. The scene is swift and captivating, and begins to raise the first questions about Ashe's innocence. After the verdict, we are ushered into the life of Ms. Aldridge. Introduced to us are her nefarious legal colleagues in the Middle Temple, all of whom seem to have a problem with her. After an interesting time which peels back the layers of Venetia's life, she is found murdered, and the mystery begins.Commander Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard, the poetic protagonist of many of P.D. James' novels, is soon on the case. There are more suspects than you can shake a stick at, and the book never ceases to be of interest as the plot progresses. Ms. James has succeeded in bringing to us a very modern, very moving piece of mystery fiction, and it is quite a satisfying read.The intricate inner-workings of London's court system is the fascinating setting for 'A Certain Justice', and it sets just the right mood for this sober mystery. The characters, even the minor ones, are well-drawn, and the killer's identity is kept under careful wraps until *very late* in the game, adding even more suspense.The experience of 'A Certain Justice' will most likely go by quickly, as you will have no problem becoming involved in this great police thriller, turning page after page. There is mood, there is action, and there is depth. What else would you expect from P.D. James?Also recommended: 'Death In Holy Orders' - the 2001 novel by P.D. James - very good!"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James is an author of immense skill. Her mysteries plumb the depths of the human soul and illustrate perfectly the fine line that separates the civilized world from the uncivilized.A Certain Justice weaves together several complex and compelling storylines. There is a gradual buildup which begins with the commission of a crime and culminates in the unraveling of all the disparate threads that brought said crime to fruition. The characters are complex and believable and though the mystery unfolds slowly, it is never boring. Each character has a compelling story and James does a masterful job of showing how the choices that one makes in life can either lead to a continuation of the abuses of the past or a triumph over them, with Ashe and Kate serving as perfect foils.Characters are James's strength. Dalgliesh remains rather elusive but the lives and experiences of those who serve under him and those whom he seeks to bring to justice are richly and vividly drawn. James's characters are entirely human and believable and seem as if they could walk off of the page and out into the real world. In short, she is one of the finest mystery writers out there and her novels are always richly rewarding literary works."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I never do fail to find a P.D. James novel rewarding, but &quot;A Cerain Justice&quot; has fulfilled even my highest expectations of her art, its quality reminding me of my favorite of her novels, &quot;Innocent Blood.&quot; In the lawyer Venetia Aldridge, P.D. James has created one of her more sympathetic figures, despite or precisely because of the fact she is difficult and unloved. James, as usual, throws red herrings left and right, in the process painting a nuanced and compassionate portrait of the ordinary anxieties and petty tragedies of life across a cross-section of contemporary English society. With relative economy of means, she fashions complex, fascinating, and convincing characters (though an English person would best judge their verissimilitude); even the &quot;heroes&quot; show weaknesses and unworthy moments (but, being James' heroes, they are introspective enough to recognize their shortcomings). For some reason, I found the plot rather less contrived than those of some of the other novels (the narrative here feels tighter -- or is it just that I finished the book in two sittings) -- that's not necessarily a criticism in any case -- you be the judge. James' maxim that murder changes everything and that merely catching the murdering can never restore the original balance of things is indeed bleak but far more truthful (and ultimately more satisfying) than the more optimistic viewpoints heard from other novelists. Enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is one of the best Adam Dagliesh novels P. D. James has written in years, and is a fine return to the halcyon days on novels like A MIND TO MURDER. James seems much more interested in this novel in character development and interaction than she has in recent years, and she thankfully eschews her obsession with architecture which all but overwhelmed A TASTE FOR DEATH and ORIGINAL SIN. Starting the novel by describing the last few weeks in Venetia Aldridge's life allows the reader to be caught up in Aldridge's world, to respect her if not to like her, and to feel a certain stake in solving the mystery of her murder. It isn't hard to figure out who did it, but that's almost always the case with James's novels: the pleasure is in seeing the complicated web of petty hatreds and resentments drawn out among an interesting group of people. And James in this novel is much more sympathetic to her characters than she has been in recent years: you feel that while Octavia, Mrs. Buckley, and Venetia Aldridge herself are pretty objectionable, you don't feel they are as irredeemable as the loathsome aristocrats in A TASTE FOR DEATH."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"is the only way to describe A CERTAIN JUSTICE, P.D. James' newest Adam Dalgliesh novel. In comparison with her previous work, I would say the most outstanding facet of this book is the remarkable quality of the writing. While James has always been an accomplished wordsmith, this book seems to be written with even greater literary style, and it flows much more smoothly than ORIGINAL SIN, which at times could become excessively verbose.The characters are, as usual, drawn realistically and interestingly. It is unfortunate that the story's most fascinating character is also the murder victim. Bold, ruthless, and basically dislikeable, Venetia Aldridge is a skilled criminal attorney who has no shortage of enemies. Angry colleagues, a rebellious daughter, and one dangerous psychopath comprise the impressively varied list of people who come under suspicion when Venetia is found stabbed to death at her desk, horrifically decorated with a bloodstained wig.The plot is ! not as complex or as elaborate as, say, an Agatha Christie or even one of James' previous novels. Nonetheless, the story is solidly constructed and serves up quite a few ingenious twists before the final revelation of the murderer's identity.

The story is somewhat interesting, but is not well told - the book is far lengthier than it should be given the plot.The characters, normally decent, are very two dimensional with stereotypical old english personalities. All of them are hyper-aware of the feelings of other and all seem to notice small details with clarity (and are only too happy to exposit for pages). Also, James continues to beat the gender-differences drum monotonously, which makes the text seem dated.Overall, I would not recommend going out of your way to read this one."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon has this listed as a Kindle book with no pricing available. Does that make sense to anyone?"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I'm perfectly aware that Baroness James is very highly thought of in both this country and the UK for the literary quality of her mystery novels featuring Commander Adam Dalgliesh, educated copper and published poet, but somehow I've just never been able to resonate with her style. I keep trying, though, hoping to find the facet of her books that will allow me entr&eacute;e into her writing. This one is widely regarded by the reviewers as one of her best, and since the professional world of the law interests me, I gave it a try. The set-up is both straightforward and very complex. Victoria Aldredge, Q.C., is a very fine lawyer indeed; everyone will tell you so. As a person, however, she's often a pain in the ass. She doesn't much like men, she doesn't much care for her eighteen-year-old daughter, she's long since parted from her husband for whom she feels contempt, she often doesn't like the accused whom she defends so skillfully -- and in chambers, she tends to assume her own superiority in practically everything and doesn't really give a damn which of her colleagues' feathers she ruffles in the process. But she doesn't deserve to be murdered, especially with such lack of dignity. And there are lots and lots of suspects. The thing is, James leads us slowly and very thoroughly through the present lives and previous experiences of Miss Aldridge, her father, her mentor in the law as an adolescent, her fellow barristers and solicitors, the Head Clerk of chambers, the cleaners, her daughter, and her daughter's new fianc&eacute; -- who was her mother's most recent client and probably guilty of the murder he was charged with -- building up everyone's character in great detail, and all this takes up nearly the first third of the book before we ever meet Dalgliesh and his elite homicide team. This is not a method of recounting a murder mystery I've encountered before, and I don't really know if it's the author's usual method, but while it requires patience, it generally works. James certainly has an ear for dialogue and an eye for description, both indoors and out. There's a subsidiary killing later in the book which leads to a violent climax, though, and which seems a bit out of place compared to tone of the rest of the story. And that is immediately followed by a much quieter and more intellectual climax regarding the original murder. It's an interesting narrative stratagem. I'll be reading more of P. D. James."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"The key to P.D. James is her profound psyhological insight into her characters. In this novel, you have the lawyer who puts her skills above all concern for the guilt or innocence of her clients and accumulates her personal enemies. The certain justice of the title probably refers principally to the romance that develops between her daughter and a probable murderer she defends successfully. But it refers to the animosity of several who have been affected by her skill in protecting the guilty as well as the innocent, resulting in a number of suspects when she's murdered.This is, as per usual, a great outing for the author and a treat for those who enjoy her style of mystery.\`"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"As always, P.D.James and Adam Dalgliesh make for absorbing reading.

While I agree with another reader- more Adam D.!- I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Only P.D. James can make her characters so real and vivid, you feel as though you're back with some old friends. It's such a LONG wait between books...."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"James' prose and descriptive powers are a pleasure to experience. Her style is distinctive, and each new book is a celebration of the art of good fiction."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"It's ironic that P.D. James's latest, \\"A Certain Justice,\\" is subtitled \\"An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery.\\" It's the first time the detective's name has made its way into the title of a James novel, and yet there's less AD here than in any previous book in the Dalgliesh series. This is the second consecutive book in which Mrs. James has relegated her fictional hero to second-fiddle status. In earlier works such as \\"Unnatural Causes\\" and \\"The Black Tower,\\" Dalgliesh was very much the main character. He wrestled with what today are called \\"personal issues,\\" and his inner monologue proved a fascinating window on a complex soul. But 1995's \\"Original Sin\\" and now \\"A Certain Justice\\" do very little to further explore what makes this complicated man tick. Which is not to say \\"A Certain Justice\\" is not a great read. Few can set a scene or sketch a character with the skill of P.D. James. The victim, Venetia Aldridge, is brought to life in vivid detail, and then put to death in satisfyingly grisly fashion. There is no shortage of interesting suspects with juicy motives. You'll definitely feel you got your money's worth. But there's that lingering sense of disappointment, the suspicion that James has quietly given up on her great creation, Adam Dalgliesh. It takes more than a hundred pages before he shows up, then he disappears for chapters at a time. The setting of the murder provides the opportunity for James to explore Dalgliesh's feelings about lawyers and the administration of justice, but she does not take advantage. Mrs. James -- your readers are getting restless. When will the prickly, moody, demanding Dalgliesh of old again take center stage?"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I have recently read two of P. D. James' Adam Dalgleish mysteries. They seemed to be variations on the same theme. I don't know if this is true of all of her books or if I just happened to pick a couple of books with similar themes.In both books, the primary murder victim is a professional female. In both, she is extremely competent and has reached a position where her actions can affect the lives of a number of her associates. In both books, the consequences that her actions might have on others are of no concern to her, and, in fact, she is contemplating actions that might well cause financial damage and social upheaval to more than one person. She is aware of this but just doesn't care.In both books, these potential victims of our murderee have both motive and opportunity to be her murderer.In both books, at least one other woman, through actions that are less than admirable, also ends up as a murder victim.This said, A CERTAIN JUSTICE is another rather old fashioned murder mystery involving our thoughtful, brooding, Scotland Yard Detective, Adam Dalgleish. Our victim is a distinguished criminal defense attorney named Venetia Aldridge who is found murdered in her locked office in Middle Temple near London's Old Bailey. There is a bloodstained wig on her head. There is a question as to whether the wig was placed on her head at the time of the murder or placed there later by someone other than the murderer.The list of people with motives to kill Aldridge is very long. With the impending retirement of the current Head of Chambers, Aldridges seniority seems to place her first in line to replace him if she wants the position. She has made it known that she does want the position and that she plans to make some changes in the management of Chambers. The man who thought that he had earned the right to the position has a motive to murder her. The Chamber Clerk who needs his job for another year or two knows that Aldridge would replace him. He has a motive.Aldridge has just learned of a long ago bribe taken by another attorney in Chambers and has threatened to expose him. He certainly has a motive. The family of a murder victim who was killed by a man who was found not guilty of an earlier murder charge due to Aldridge's defense certainly has a motive to seek revenge against her. Finally, her rebellious daughter who hates her seems to have a motive to kill her. Aldridge, it seems, has a lot of enemies, and very few people seem upset by her murder.As the novel progresses, there are two more murders that do relate to the main plot line, and two or three subplots, including one that introduces Aldridge's ex-husband that add little to the progress of the novel.One glaring weakness, at least for me, is that Aldridge seems to be entirely without any redeeming characteristics. There must have been something about her to like that James could have mentioned.P. D. James is a talented writer, but seems to have a habit of introducing a little too much superfluous material, at least for my taste. With that caveat, I do like her books."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This book is great if you like to read books for the plot. This is a typical murder mystery, but it's not predictable. P.D. James made a great plot and did extremely well in developing the story line. Each character has something in their past that relates to the main character and gives them motives for the mystery. The book was good, but some of the parts that were meant to keep the reader on the edge didn't really work. The next step wasn't predictable just the excitement wasn't there in some scenes. The end of the book was a bit confusing, but able to grasp. It is a creative ending because there is not an arrest, but the sense of one."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and was certainly interested in the &quot;large print&quot; aspect, but was dismayed to find that the publisher chose to make the print SO large that only one letter would fit per page. While this did heighten suspense in that longer words required quite a bit of page-turning, I feel that Random House may have gone a bit overboard."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I must admit, this was a different type of Mystery for me. Just an average person, I can normally figure out the \\"who and why\\" well before the end of the book. Ms. James did an excellent job of not giving away to many clues so it was impossible until near the end of the book to start piecing things together. I really liked the character of Inspector Delglish. My original thought as I listened to this book was that it would be 2 stars max. The ending of this book caught me by surprise and so I decided to give it 3. If it weren't for Ms. James great detail, I would have probably given it 4 stars.For some reason, Ms. James felt the need to describe every character and place to the most minute detail. This description lent to the length of the book which was extremely long. More then once I thought of not finishing this book. If this hadn't been the audio version I probably wouldn't have finished. I felt the book would have been just as good if not better if some of this description had been left out. About the first 20 chapters (6 tapes) was nothing but a description of the suspects who worked in Chambers. Really, not necessary.I havn't read any other books by Ms. James and am currently undecided about trying another.The only other author I can think of to compare Ms. James with would be Agatha Christie. Both have that passion for describing things in their books to the most minute detail."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"It starts off in classical whodunnit style with a nasty person bumped off in posh British surroundings. The PD James gimmick is to probe her characters in depth. You get told about their childhoods (always miserable) and their parents, and in many cases grandparents, and in some cases their greatgrandparents. A lot of London atmosphere and rather too much about architecture. I always have a problem with her dialog. Characters speak in long complete sentences, which is about believable when they are college graduates, but gets to sound odd for demotic speech. An uneducated young criminal speaks about throwing a knife &quot;under a privet hedge&quot; and goes to a &quot;derelict cottage&quot; separated from thr &quot;North Sea&quot; by a &quot;shingle bank.&quot; Dalgliesh is a plaster saint. He has no orifices. A thing I've done with some PD James, which will horrify purists, but adds to the enjoyment for me, is to peek at the ending when I/m halfway through. Even if this does spoil it for you there are plenty more PD JAmes's. This is the 14th in the Dalgliesh series alone."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"The murder victim was a barrister, Venetia Aldridge. It was necessary to change the head of chambers. Venetia was more senior than Laud. If a vote were to be taken following Langton's retirement it may have turned out that Venetia had secured the victory, thereby disturbing Laud. Venetia's father had been head of a school. As a school girl Venetia had learned about the law from one of the teachers at her father's school. She learned that advocacy could create an atmosphere without scenery, without a curtain, of someone's life.Langton, age seventy-three, experienced an episode in a trial when words deserted him. Venetia's last case had been the defense of a would-be country gentleman. There had been an altercation concerning a protest against fox hunting. Venetia had a not quite bright and unsuitable daughter, Octavia. Octavia had a friendship with a former criminal client of Venetia, someone who had been charged with murdering his aunt. Venetia felt the man for whom she had obtained an acquittal felt contempt for her, not gratitude. He would gladly humiliate her.There is something very bracing about a P.D. James book. She writes that actions have consequences. She does a wonderful job of describing lawyers and explaining the appeal of law, the dream of an orderly existence. A scene with Drysdale Laud and Hubert Langton and Venetia unfolds. A matter of contention is the selection of two new members of chambers. Venetia supports male candidates for both of the slots which is contrary to the position of Laud and Langton.There is a heaviness in P.D. James books. She writes of tragedy. Pain in people's lives often cannot be alleviated because they are faced with circumstances not subject to change. Venetia asks Laud to contact the nearly criminal man with whom Octavia is involved to ask him how much money he would require to leave her alone. Laud declines to undertake such a mission. Piers Tarrant, the possessor of an Oxford degree in theology, and Kate Miskin assist Adam Dalgliesh in the investigation of the murder of Venetia Aldridge. One of the barristers in Venetia's chambers accuses Adam Dalgliesh of a sort of inverted conceit because he is a police officer. It is learned that that Venetia had been difficult in chambers. All of the witnesses agreed that she had been a very fine lawyer.The minor characters are well-described. For example there is Valerie, a secretary, with a mentally ill mother. Mental illness is treated in the round from the perspective of the persons who have to live with it. P.D. Jamers is really at the top of her form in this book. It is certainly understandable that a murderer cannot be prosecuted for a lack of proof. The story is both complex and deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is the first PDJ I read, and it has all the makings of a cheap mystery. In the name of &quot;character development&quot;, all the characters NOT CONNECTED to the plot are given a lot of bandwidth. Half-way through the 'mystery', I figured out who the 'culprit' was, because that character was not being given any importance.I dont understand the similarities drawn to Ms Chrisite. Her books have an aura of spookiness, which PDJ has not achieved in this book."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Unabridged audio Hard to follow. Boring. Too may characters. Not a good audiobook."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Let's see, the writing is slow and tedious, there is very little suspense, the \\"main character\\" is not even introduced until the book is almost half over. The revelations are interesting but do not really titillate the imagination, and parts are rather predictable. In the end, everything is wrapped up a bit too tightly and easily. One comes from this book with a sense of hollowness."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"The book begins with Venetia Aldridge defending Gary Ashe on charges of murder, even though he was guilty. The next victim will be Aldridge herself, stabbed to death at her desk, a blood-stained wig on her head. Commander Dalgleish and his team investigate the shocking events, trying to locate the murderer.This book is for mature readers only. There are minimal uses of offensive language, but there is a description of pornographic pictures, a description of a dead, naked body, and descriptions of sexual encounters. Vocabulary in this book is also challenging. A good murder mystery, though!"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"If \\"A Certain Justice\\" had been written by a man, pickets would have gone up, politicians would have denounced it and the author would probably have ended up on police watch lists. P.D. James's strange obsession with doing violence to professional women reaches a low point in this book, with yet another caricatured, manipulative, nymphomaniac career gal who meets a much-deserved end. James doesn't even try to make Venetia Aldridge believable or bring the setting to life, she just tries to stoke the reader's hatred of Venetia to the point that her death is practically a good deed. And she's a bad mother, too! Not that the setting of a fancy London law firm is particularly compelling - an American reader will find it almost impossible to figure out what's going on at many points thanks to a blizzard of British legal jargon and traditions that are never explained. Several key plot points don't make much sense if you've never sat through a British trial. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this book."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"When it comes to literary British murder mysteries the best living author is the inimitable P.D. James. A Certain Justice was published to lavish reveiw reception in 1997.The Plot: The murder victim in this puzzling case is Venetia Aldridge. Venetia is divorced with a daughter Octavia. Unlike hr glamourous and successful mother, Octavia is a plain eighteen year old girl who has been convent educated. She feels neglected and unloved by her workaholic mother. Octavia will later fall in love with the notorious Garry Ashe. Ashe is a client of Venetia's who is accussed of the murder of his aunt. The aunt was a prostitute who forced Garry to photograph she and her clients in the throes of sexual intercourse. Ventetia is a brilliant defense attorney. She is not well liked as she works her way up the criminal justice system in Loondon. Adam Dalgliesh and his excellent team are called in to handle the investigation.The book is long but has an exciting chase and rescue at the end. The book is the best one by James in years. It is an excellent police procedural. As with all of James works the answers to what happened are inluded in the past lives of the characters. A realistic and grimy trip on the wild side of criminal justice. The usual jealousies and hatreds are manifest. An interview with the author by Jennifer Reese is included in the Ballantine Books edition."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I've read most of James' Dalgliesh mysteries and this was by far my least favorite. Which is not to say that it wasn't good - I have yet to read a P.D. James mystery that isn't engaging and well written. It's just to say that compared to her other mysteries, this one was lacking. It seemed like the main plot (the death of a criminal attorney) was lost in the subplot about the attorney's daughter. The denouement of the subplot was great, in my opinion (well-paced, exciting), but the denouement of the main plot seemed tacked on. The impression I have is that James wrote a draft of the book in which one character was the murderer but decided that was too facile or something, rewrote the ending and added scenes in the beginning and middle so that a different character was now the murderer. It feels like the daughter-sub-plot denouement was meant to be the end of the book and the resolution of the central murder feels tacked on. However, just because I was disappointed that it wasn't quite as complete and satisfying as the rest of the Dalgliesh series, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. If it were written by someone else, I would have given it 4 stars, but I know that James is capable of a more satisfying book."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I've read a number of P. D. James' novels, and thought this one tighter than most, except for the conclusion, which seemed a bit rushed and not so carefully written as the rest of the book. I liked the abundance of detail, and the characters seemed true to life, even the principal victim, the lawyer Venetia Aldridge, who despite a prickly, irritable exterior had done pretty well with her life, considering her family of origin. And her feelings of anger and helplessness at her daughter's taking up with someone unsuitable are something that any parent could identify with.Some readers may fault Venetia for helping killers to go free, but I don't think she was to blame for that. The fact is that whether or not an accused person is appealing, he deserves a fair trial. And if the police evidence is not strong enough to convict him, he should not be pronounced guilty.Like many mystery writers, James points out the evils that can arise when people believe that justice has not been done, and they take the law into their own hands. The truth is that suffering can never be compensated for, and each person has a different viewpoint about what outcome would be really fair."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This book is delightfully complicated and devious, with twists and turns to keep a person riveted and guessing throughout. Venetia Aldrige is a successful and demanding barrister, called to defend a man accused of murdering his aunt. She successfully gets him acquitted, then soon afterward is dismayed and fearful when he turns up in her daughter's life. She tries to get some one to help her get rid of him, but she has a personality that hasn't made many friends and no one will help. Then, one morning she is found dead in her chambers. Chief Inspector Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard is summoned to the case and he and his team set out to unravel the mystery of who killed Venetia and why. As suspects are interviewed and backgrounds checked, several plausible motives are uncovered. In which direction does the truth lie?P. D. James is one of today's top-notch mystery writers. Her stories are complex and riveting. So complex, at times, that you wish you had taken notes in the first part of the book to keep all characters straight. Several of her books have been made into movies for the \\"Mystery\\" series on PBS. Although the story was so complicated at times that my head hurt, I am still giving this book a high recommendation. Ms. James writes books that are held together with a strong story line, not the flimsy sex-violence-vulgar language \\"fillers\\" of many modern writers.I rate this book 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"What a rewarding experience! I didn't think James could better her earlier works but boy, was I wrong! A gripping story-line, an ingenious understanding of human psyche, a realistic appraisal of the criminal justice system - James' insights and prose are second to none. A must for any crime-detective novel buffs and highly recommended to all rookies."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James purists may argue that \\"Devices and Desires\\" is her best work to date, but \\"A Certain Justice\\" is certainly a close second! Granted, while James seems to devote less time to her leading man, Adam Dalgliesh, she nevertheless succeeds in making a more complete story--concentrating more on other characters and events (almost as if she's saying \\"you already know enough about Adam\\"!). Still, Commander Dalgliesh is in command and it is through his brilliance that the case is solved (or in this case, \\"cases\\"!).Basically, Venetia Aldridge, a brilliant, up-and-coming criminal lawyer is found murdered (there can be no other explanation). As Scotland Yard becomes more involved (after all, it is a murder investigation and the victim is quite prominent in London legal circles), facts begin to emerge that picture a not-so-ordinary past. Venetia is no angel (not yet, anyway!)--there are suspects a-plenty and the motives run rampant, from her cleaning lady to colleagues in and out of court and to her own family members. She has a past that certainly has cut some crucial corners. She is also a woman with an attitude--an attitude that seemed not to care about making enemies. she is also the mother of a teenaged daughter, and their relationship, too, has been a bit tumultuous--dicey at best.Venetia is found stabbed to death at her desk, and a barrister's wig placed, askew, on her head. Her body is soaked in blood. A convenient suspect is hurriedly identified (a sociopath whom she'd successfully defended in a murder trial a few years back!) but, alas, he comes up with an alibi and Dalgliesh must look to others, especially some of her jealous colleagues, for his culprit. James' plot is, indeed, convoluted and for the casual reader may be hard to follow. After all, she hasn't been labeled \\"queen of crime\\" for nothing. Trying to follow the plot is more like trying to find the path in a maze, but that is also probably one of the main attractions for a James novel: it's not simple. At the same time, she painstakingly develops her characters, who, simply, are more than one dimensional. While Venetia, on the surface, reflects an organized, planned concept of justice and law and order, James shows us another side--one of justice running amok, of cruelty in the name of the law, and of fair play being something that seems not to exist. And this road to certain justice is one in a state of disrepair, confusion, and blind leads. It is not without its rewards, however, and by the chilling final-chapters' climax, it is, once again, a jury victory for James!. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I am a big P.D. James fan and eagerly await every Dalgliesh mystery that she writes. Although A Certain Justice was not her best Dalgliesh novel (Devices and Desires is her best), I really enjoyed it and could not put it down. Thematically this novel is about what happens to people who are deprived love, and it is interesting to discover how this situation affects the several of the main characters. Also the way she began the novel, which was from the victims point of view before she was murdered, was very interesting. What I didn't like was that we did not get to spend enough time inside Adam Dalgliesh's head, which is usually a very interesting place. I recommed this novel to any fans of mystery and any P.D. James fans."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Venetia Aldridge is a top notch criminal lawyer. She hardly ever looses a case and is able to find the holes in any argument. Her personal life isn't so rosy, however. She is basically estranged from her daughter and considered a problem by her co-workers. Her life really begins to unravel when her daughter announces her engagement - to a man Venetia has recently gotten off for murder. But when Venetia is found dead in her office two days later, it's up to Adam Dalgliesh and his team to figure out who killed her. And with all these motives and suspects, it won't be easy.I'd heard much about P.D. James, but this was the first time I'd actually read one of her books. I found the writing style engaging and would have a hard time putting it down once I started. On the other hand, I'd have a hard time picking it up again. The beginning especially seems to give us too much background on our characters, stuff we don't need to learn until later if at all. This really slowed the story down for me.The more I got into it, the better I enjoyed it, however. There were some nice twists along the way with an intriguing sub-plot. The last couple of chapters did seem a little anti-climatic considering what had gone before, but I was surprised by who the killer turned out to be. Using multiple view points greatly added to the story most of the time, although it did confuse me some as far as timeline goes.I can understand why P.D. James has such a fine reputation. She can paint a picture with words like few other writers currently writing. While she may be a tad too slow for my normal taste, I'm certainly glad to see what all the talk is about. Her reputation is well earned."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is the first P.D. James book I picked up. I was disppointed by the way the resolution was presented, by letter, not through sleuthing by the detective, Adam Dagliesh. It has an interesting plot and some interesting characters. I expected James could do better in presenting the plot and the characters. The bloody scene created by Ashe towards the end of the book reminded me of some cheap pulp fictions. James did better in her other books. In my first encounter with Adam Dagliesh in this book, I hardly knew him. A shift from Christie, I was terrified that in James' world, there was little love. It was a world of hatred and coldness in James' books."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James has populated this Adam Dalgleish (AD) outing with a large cast of largely unsympathetic characters.The first quarter of the novel is spent setting up the murder and establishing motives for over half a dozen could-be killers. In the middle half of the book, AD and team (Detective Inspectors Kate Miskin and newcomer Piers Tarrant) explore these suspects and discover a few more, without making any real progress in the case-and the progress they do make is due to evidence being (literally) handed to them, rather than the result of any actual detecting. Almost the entire final quarter of the book is devoted to a second murder and its fairly-straightforward resolution, with the first murder all but forgotten. When AD comes up with the identity of the first murderer in the final chapter it seems arbitrary and feels unsatisfying.Enjoyment of the mostly fruitless investigation is hampered by DI Miskin's near-constant interior monologue alternately ruing the privations of her lower-class upbringing and feeling superior to the middle- and upper-class characters she encounters. DI Tarrant's green navet&eacute; and arrogance don't help the portions of the book told from his point of view. And while James gives the reader the opportunity to see behind AD's emotionally-detached faade, it seems that what Miskin and Tarrant need to fully develop their personalities (and James her characters) is this same understanding of their Commander. (To be fair, Miskin may learn a little of this at the end of the book, but like the denouement, it seems tacked on rather than being part of her inherent growth.)The book isn't all bad; James' writing is able to shine through her tarnished characters. Unfortunately, the uneven pacing and victims and suspects the reader cares little to nothing either for or about results in a novel that fails to satisfy."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"IMHO P. D. James is the best living Mystery writer and her Adam Dalgliesh is the most well developed character in the modern novel. I wish Dalgliesh had a larger role in this particular book. &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; delivers a wide array of interesting personalities involved in a complex and unpredictable mystery. Lots of fascinating details about the English system of Law."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"James has insight into the heart of darkness of each character she writes about. James goes beyond the surface nicities of life to the inner mind and thoughts of the characters. Each one operates in its own world, and these worlds collide with others, etc. until they clash. James is able to in this particular book show how the past intrudes on the future, so that the past sufferings of the characters motivate their future actions, thoughts and feelings. She is also very honest about how petty, spitful and malicious even the most educated and articulate people can be, as people use words instead of daggers to hurt their victims. She also shows what an &quot;eye for an eye&quot; truly means to someone, and how rage can undermine and control even the most ordinary of human lifes. James knows her people are real people, they are complex and do things for the most basic reasons, love, hate, rage, pain, jealousy, greed, etc.,and the person you least suspect is as capable as the person you most suspect of the most terrible revenge, if pushed to far. She is the most fascinating writer."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"As are all of P.D. James novels, this is very involved with character development. I felt that the effect s of obsession was the main theme of the novel. Kate's character is further explored. Ms James also delves into the divergent paths taken by Kate and Ash who are born into the same appalling circumstances...Kate becoming a police officer, Ash, a sociopath. The effects of love of all kinds... or the lack of it... is also explored. Dagliesh in this novel does not do much except glue the pieces together. All in all a most fascinating book which is more than an ordinary mystery and happily filled the hours driving a 1500 mile trip."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Anyone who enjoys a murder mystery with a complex plot will be delighted with &quot;A Certain Justice.&quot; As other reviewers have pointed out, however, the case is solved by patience and industry rather than by any flash of genius. The plot is tangled and intricate, but logical. I advise you to make a list of the dramatis personae and their relationships as you go along, just as if you were reading a long Russian novel. Dickensian coincidences abound; the niece, former mentor, or cleaning lady of a character will turn up in some other connection. Middlebrow &quot;fine writing&quot; in the characters' meditations will make you think the book is somehow good for you. The author gleefully recounts how the first victim, Venetia, verbally zaps her male colleagues--she needs plenty of enemies for the sake of the plot. The characters and locales are interesting enough. If you like this book, I suggest you read something by Iris Murdoch, such as &quot;The Book and the Brothe! rhood.&quot; Her novels are not murder mysteries, but her characters are even better, and you can NOT predict what is coming next."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is the first P.D.

It added to my knowledge gleaned from Rumpole. And Ms James's descriptions put me there. Also, since the other books seem a little complicated and I get lost, this one was more readable. If I were a Dalgliesh fan, for instance if it been Dexter writing about my hero Morse, I would have been really disappointed since there was little of AD in this one. But I enjoyed getting to know Kate better. I plan on rereading the earlier books in order so I can become better acquainted with them both. But I could hardly put it down and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I greatly enjoy P.D. James's literate and exciting style, and I certainly recommend &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; to her fans. BUT.... This book couldn't decide who it was about. By the time Ash took center stage, I felt that his story would have made a much more compelling novel. By the same token, Ms. James might have spared Venetia Aldridge for a starring role in her own novel. Also, as others have noted, there wasn't enough of Dalgliesh to satisfy his fans. I was also displeased at the book's presumption, via the Ash character, that those who suffer abuse as children are destined to become psychopathic criminals. Surely the author knows better than that. This is a calumny on everyone who is struggling to overcome the legacy of abuse."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James has provided me with many entertaining hours and this book was no exception. I find she is one of the few authors that can effortlessly slip between characters without throwing off the pace of the book.It wasn't as difficult to figure out the who done it part of the book but I really didn't mind. I enjoyed the fact that she featured Kate more prominently it made it very interesting. Although I was somewhat expecting to have some of Kate's questions answered in this book it didn't happen. But knowing PD James we will all have to wait for subsequent books. So if you like PD James you will like this book but be forewarned it's not as intricate (clever) as some of her plots in the past and she doesn't dwell on the inner workings of AD that much."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Once again The characters are realistic and could be the next door neighbor. We reap what we sow is made clear, here. All of Venetia's roles were left wanting.

Jame's primary character like shakespeare's Lady Macbeth finds herself &quot;unsatisfied&quot; with merely being a woman. Venetia and Lady M take off the feminine psyche and become un-natural creatures...out of place in both worlds, space and time. A wonderful read. I highly recommned this novel for lovers of the British mystery novel at its best."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"As usual, P.D. James has crafted a mesmerizing mystery with \\"A Certain Justice\\". Various reviewers have seemed to criticize the fact that there is more story than mystery to James's works, but that is what sets her apart from other mystery writers; her world and characters come to life through her writing. The reader learns so much about the characters that the reader feels as if they know them personally, and therefore take an interest in what happens to them.\\"A Certain Justice\\" centers around the murder of Venetia Aldridge, a criminal lawyer who was good at winning but perhaps even better at making others dislike her. Like most P.D. James books, \\"A Certian Justice\\" begins by sketching the lives of the characters who will intersect through murder before the second part of the book. Before Adam Dalgliesh even enters the scene, the reader is introduced to a wide cast of characters, some who have been given means and motive to wish Venetia Aldridge dead. Along with his investigation team, which includes Kate Miskin and Piers Tarrant, Dalgliesh sets to interviewing the members of Venetia's law offices to try to unravel the mystery of her death.As is to be expected in any mystery novel, twists and subplots are thrown in that weave around the central plot. In \\"A Certain Justice\\" they are well-written and do not distract from the story at hand. Some reviewers have written of being disappointed by the ending to this novel, but it is a reflection of reality, and the system that Venetia Aldridge worked in. James has never been an author to lay everything out for her readers; rather she leaves little clues along the way, which may seem insignificant at first, for her readers to piece together the author of the crimes committed in her stories."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I must admit, this was a different type of Mystery for me. Just an average person, I can normally figure out the &quot;who and why&quot; well before the end of the book. Ms. James did an excellent job of not giving away to many clues so it was impossible until the end of the book to start piecing things together (or so I thought). I really liked the character of Inspector Dalqliesh. The narrator gave him the personality of a hard core detective without the crudeness you see in so many books. My original thought as I listened to this audio book was that it would be 2 stars max. The ending of this book caught me by surprise and I decided to give it 3 stars. If it weren't for Ms. James great detail, I would have probably given it 4 stars.For some reason, Ms. James felt that every character, and place needed to be described to the finest detail. This description lent to the length of the book which was extremely long. More then once I thought of not finishing this book. If this hadn't been an audio book I probably wouldn't have finished it. I felt the book would have been just as good if not better if some of this description had been left out. About the first 20 chapters (6 tapes) was nothing but a description of the suspects who worked in Chambers. Really, not necessary.I have not read any other titles by Ms. James. However, not being one who discounts an author after I book, I will most likely try another in the future.The only author I can think to compare Ms. James with would be Agatha Christie. Both have that passion for describing things in great detail."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Though I am not usually a fan of PD James's detective fiction featuring Adam Dalgleish other than via the PBS dramatizations of her novels, I must admit the pull to read &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; after dipping into only the first chapter was irresistible. Fans of John Mortimer's Rumpole series might imagine themselves well at home among the denizens and vagaries of the English law courts. Like Rumpole, Venetia Aldridge is a criminal barrister but there the similiarity ends. In Venetia Aldridge, James has created what someone once described as the perfect fictional character. I did not tire of her doings, she riveted me when she took center stage, yet Venetia is the kind of person I would not like to know in real life. A complex character much like Jane Austen's Emma Woodhouse, Venetia Aldridge is handsome, clever and rich. Yet it is these very blessings that, in combination with her having been born female, make her such a monster. As social commentary, James highlights the bigotry successful women must endure. A woman cannot it seems compete in a &quot;man's world&quot; and retain her femininity, her likability. Only in the briefest flashes is the reader allowed to glimpse Venetia as the lonely pathetic and frustrated individual she is. In contrast is her male counterpart, Drysdale Laud, who is just as selfish, if not from a more privileged background, than Venetia. Yet he's not described to be as inhuman as Venetia. It is a pity, though crucial to the plot that Venetia die.Fans of Adam Dalgliesh might balk because the Dalgleish character doesn't take center stage in this novel. Indeed, Dalgliesh doesn't appear until a good 100 pages into the narrative and thereafter only sporadically. To appreciate &quot;Justice&quot; a reader must bear in mind that James is delving into &quot;character.&quot; In &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; almost all the characters save Dalgliesh had something in their pasts with which they continue to struggle, to try to outlive. Human frailty is the key. James understands that the more fascinating aspect of a mystery is really the &quot;whydunit&quot; rather than exclusively &quot;whodunit.&quot;I am a convert and will eagerly await the next PD James novel."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This is a mystery concerning love and hate and all the shades of emotion in between. London criminal lawyer Venetia Aldridge is not particularly likeable, and indeed, she is not-so-cordially loathed by quite a few people: her lover, her daughter, other lawyers, and certainly some criminals. No surprise, then, that someone plans to kill her."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"When I reviewed Lady James' \\"The Children of Men\\" I remarked that her novels are very cerebral, but that that novel was too much so for my tastes. I've gone back to those writings of hers that I love - those featuring Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard, the only policeman I can think of who can truly fit the description of a modern-day Rennaissance man.This time around Dalgliesh and his squad tackle the case of a barrister who is murdered in her chambers. There are apparently plenty of people who wanted to see Venetia Aldridge dead, both within and without her profession and offices. It is Dalgliesh's job, of course, to sort out all the motives, alibis, etc. and determine who it was that killed the woman.Along the way we learn quite a bit about the victim, her family and family life, and the people who enter her orbit in her profession, including a man who turns out to be one of the most evil people I have encountered in my recent readings. All of the people in this novel are described - physically, mentally, and emotionally - down to the minutest detail. I could actually picture them in my head, although to me Dalgliesh will always resemble Roy Marsden, the actor who has portrayed him in several TV adaptations of James' novels.From a policeman's or investigator's point of view the ending of this novel would, I suppose, be very unsatisfying. From this reader's point of view, though the ending wasn't what I hoped it would be, it proved to be something of an anticlimax, and fit in well with the rest of the plot.The nice thing about the Dalgliesh series is that James writes her stories and describes her characters and situations with such detail that, had they been written by anyone else, would have invited extremely harsh words from the vast majority of the critical world, which would probably have included some phrases along the lines of, \\"who told you that you could write?\\"But Lady James has such a wonderful command of the English language that this incredible attention to detail only serves to whet our appetite as we continue to read. And she's only gotten better with each novel. The bio for this book doesn't say, but I have to wonder whether she ever taught English or a related subject in a previous life.I'm reading the series out of order, but I would like to pick up other Dalgliesh novels. The hints that James dropped concerning Dalgliesh's erstwhile partner, Inspector Kate Miskin, were too intriguing to ignore. I hope she wrote about Miskin's \\"troubles\\" in an earlier book."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This detective story is a lot more than a detective story.1- It is a new stage in the English genre. Sherlock Holmes was an outsider competing with the police. Hercule Poirot was Belgian, so twice an outsider. Here Dalgliesh is a member of Scotland Yard. This book is, in a way, a vindication of Scotland Yard.2- It contains a deep reflection on social determinism. Both one of the criminals and one of the coppers (a man and a woman) were born and raised in a socially derelict apartment complex and neighborhood for the poor. They both had the same choice, and they chose two different ways.3- It advocates a certain vision of managing people. Dalgliesh is both strict on basic rules with his subordinates, but also extremely humane, even with unprovable criminals. It is better for a useful man to continue to be useful than to spend years in gaol .4- It displays a deep understanding of human justice and perticularly that fundamentally British principle that it is better to let a criminal go free than to imprison an innocent. This principle is surprisingly original, and also irritating for the judicial system, in foreign countries, in Europe or the USA. Any doubt about the guilt or the value, the force of a piece of evidence has to benefit the accused, no matter what. We suddenly think of Mumia Abu Jamal's case which exposes the radically opposite functioning : contradictory testimonies should benefit the accused. In this case the textimony that does not support the guilt of the accused is overlooked, if not purely negated.5- Finally, this book is Dickenbsian because it gives us a phenomenal description of the psychology and the social background of all characters, policemen, policewomen, suspects, criminals, etc... We have here a fully developed social tableau of modern time Great Britain.A masterpipece in the genre. When the British set themselves to doing something good, they are excellent. And the detective story genre is one field of absolute perfection for them. Three details though. The keyring of the first victim is overlooked during most of the investigation. A drawback. A jacket belt that is not in the proper place at the end. A shortcoming. What about the never answered question : Why did he ask me to inquire about the spectacles she was wearing ? A flaw. But such details do not reduce the value of the book as a fantastic description of modern British society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"&quot;A Certain Justice&quot; delivers a very intensely-woven mystery with a plethora of suspects and very human characters and situations. It was a very quick read for me, however I did find certain parts of the plot a bit contrived, and I didn't appreciate the killer being revealed only until the very end of the book. The disappearance of Dalgliesh during 3/4 of Book Four was also disconcerting. I have always felt that Ms. James' novels were a bit rushed towards the end, but she is still a suberb novelist, and this book is a very enjoyable read. Insightful and engrossing."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Although the trappings of the tale are very much 1990's -- sexism and &quot;queen bee&quot; behavior in a law firm, financially stretched two-income families, a career woman who has no satisfactory personal relationships, etc. -- this book felt very &quot;old-fashioned&quot; to me. The plot is well constructed and well thought out, but some devices (e.g., a letter mailed by someone just before she is killed) are awfully Agatha Christie. I didn't think that &quot;coincidence&quot; was overused; what seems at first to be coincidence often turned out to be deliberate behavior by someone with an agenda. And the violence in the subplot wasn't gratuitous -- it made perfect sense given the characters involved. I felt that the &quot;whodunit&quot; aspect was the least interesting part: the murderer HAD to be one of a limited set of people, so the element of surprise was missing (I figured it out long before the conclusion!).To me, the chief pleasure of James' novels is how she creates an entire &quot;world&quot; peopled with believable, memorable individuals, then uses a crime as the force that disrupts the orderly motion of everyone's lives and brings out hidden aspects of their characters. She's excellent at conveying the atmosphere of a firm or an institution -- every one she's written about in her novels is unique. And her ability to convey the &quot;feel&quot; of someone's life with a few well-chosen details is unsurpassed. From this standpoint, I found the book just about perfect, and I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"As with &quot;Devices and Desires,&quot; a sociopath plays an important role in &quot;A Certain Justice.&quot; This time around, however, P. D. James offers even more insight into the life events that have shaped the sociopath--in this case, one Garry Ashe, who at the opening of the novel is being defended on murder charges by a brilliant lawyer, Venetia Aldridge, who, in many ways, is as unsavory a character as Ashe.The way in which people are shaped by their pasts has become an increasingly important concern in James's works. In her previous work, &quot;Original Sin,&quot; the characters' pasts were integral to the plot, yet it could be argued that they were expounded on at too great a length. In contrast, &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; is absolutely seamless in taking us between past and present, especially in the details of Venetia Aldridge's troubled life. For this reason, &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; supplants &quot;A Taste for Death&quot; as the best written of P. D. James's works.The mystery itself is as intricate as ever, and only after the last chapter do we fully understand the significance of the book's title and realize the message that James has imparted on us."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I must admit, this was a different type of Mystery for me. Just an average person, I can normally figure out the \\"who and why\\" well before the end of the book.

I really liked the character of Inspector Delglish. My original thought as I listened to this book was that it would be 2 stars max. The ending of this book caught me by surprise and so I decided to give it 3.

James' courageous publication of such a fact pattern in fiction form in this book offers simultaneously bone chilling suspense as well as refreshingly gratifying relief. This book reminds me that it is appropriate to pray that God grants each of us the courage to disagree, be different and be the person God meant us to be by shedding hautiness developed from certain associations inflicting in some perilous projection and dull mind."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Like most of James's books, this one was a bit slow to start. There are a bunch of characters all introduced and it takes a bit of time to sort them all out. And, I admit, I thought the middle of this story dragged a bit more than a lot of the others. It just didn't grab me in quite the same way, perhaps because I had no feelings one way or the other about many of the characters - including the deceased. Still, the story came together in the end, even though it was a little bit of a stretch plot-wise. Not the type of mystery you're likely to be able to solve yourself, with all the odd twists and turns. But it was those odd twists that, in the end, kept it interesting.It's worth reading, but not the best P.D. James book by a long shot. Two better ones that leap to mind, for me, are The Murder Room and The Lighthouse."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"P.D. James is an amazing author. I really enjoyed A Certain Justice. The book was lengthy, yet very readable. The cast of characters and their dirty little secrets are brought to life in evocative fashion. James clearly has an immense understanding of the criminal justice system, which certainly was gained from her time as a magistrate and while working for the British Civil Service.I notice that several reviews speak of a \\"weak\\" ending. I disagree. The ending is not only plausible, but possible.It is always a treat, when reading one of Ms. James's novels, waiting for the first appearance of Adam Dalgliesh. Amazingly, the story proceeds and is very intriguing before he and his murder team generally enter the fray. Yet, one he arrives, the book then becomes very difficult to put down.It should be noted that Ms. James introduces us to one of her most indsidious and evil characters to date.A strong 5 star read."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Why is it rare these days to encounter a mystery that hasn't been obviously dumbed down for a general readership? Perhaps the British market is more demanding and, yes, I obviously need to read more of Ms. James--yet I can't help but be impressed by an author that has command of her subject sufficient to write a conclusion that is all too familiar to anyone who has practiced law. To say more risks a spoiler warning but suffice it to say that the law does not have as good a track record as that of most literary detectives.The exposition of the life of a barrister was particularly interesting to me--an attorney toiling away in the overworked American interpretation of a dispute-resolution method over a thousand years old. Frankly, I wonder how many of my colleagues could reasonably discuss Magna Carta (but I'll bet that they can discuss OJ) One need not worry about the specific terms of art--an English Type-A personality is very similar to the American Type-A personality so far as obsessive focus on professional requirements is concerned.Not only are the characters fully and expertly developed, not only does the author have much to say about the spirit and purpose of the criminal defense, there is an intricate story of revenge that says much about the meaning of justice. What is more just? Self-help? Letting the system have its way?The ending of this book, apparently unsatisfactory to many, is in reality a great achievement--it is the perfect resolution. No spoilers here, the title says it all. Here's the highest recommendation I can give, I have ordered the first Adam Dalgliesh mystery--Cover Her Face--and look forward to some excellent reading as I work through each and every one of these mysteries."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Especially if you're looking for the fun escapism of an old fashioned murder mystery, P.D. James' \\"A Certain Justice\\" fills the bill perfectly. The structure is more complex than your average whodunnit (due primarily to the large number of characters), it includes the fine deductive powers of Inspector Dalgliesh, and a lawyer that most people in the story don't like is killed. So how bad can it be?I've read that some of James' more constant readers don't care for the ending, but I did. After all, if everything always worked out as \\"expected,\\" life (and certainly these mystery books) wouldn't be nearly as interesting.One note if you've never read P.D. James before: I find her fun to read because she's great with language and serious about wanting you to \\"know\\" each character well. Thus, while it IS fun reading, it's not always exactly \\"light\\" reading, in that interuptions to the flow of her descriptions can make her books tough to drop at a moment's notice and pick up easily later. She's always well worth the effort, though."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed 'A Certain Justice.' Being a huge PD James fan, I was very anxious to read her new book and I wasn't disappointed with her effort.

She gets stabbed with a letter-opener and Dalgleish and his sidekicks must find out who killed her.This book is a must-read for mystery fans and even people who don't particularly like mysteries will most likely enjoy this one. For no one understands the dark workings of the human heart as well as PD James does."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Another clever psychological thriller from P.D.

The plot is complicated by the attitude and actions of her daughter, Octavia.Ingenious and beautifully written, A Certain Justice is P.D.James at her impressive best. She's become one of the national treasures of British crime writing, and this is one of her triumphs. A real page-turner of a plot, but leading to a slightly less than satisfying conclusion. Hence only four stars."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"This rolling murder mystery takes you from the chambers of Venitia Aldridge to the squat where Ashe, a former client, runs away to with the Venitia's daughter Octavia. The pace is set in the novel from the first page when Aldridge is defending Ashe, and gets him off despite his obvious guilt.The plot turns constantly, focusing the readers attention to almost everyone involved with her life. The intricate details of the novel bring you into their sitting rooms while they talk to the police, and James' famous &quot;A.D.&quot; The story leaves you wondering why Venitia wasn't killed much much earlier in her carreer as the most ruthless defense attorney alive. In one scene she tears apart a kind old lady, who naively plays into her hands.As the novel progresses, the relationship between Venitia and her daughter also comes to light. This turn in the novel leads the reader down an entirely new path in the story line, lending more depth and feeling to the work as a whole.Having read &quot;The Black Tower&quot; and &quot;Death of an Expert Witness&quot; I would have to call this her best work yet, and would be remiss in not recommending that others read this exciting, page turner of a novel."},{"Title":"A Certain Justice","review":"Though not a mystery lover in general, this one is better than most.

That being as it is I can safely say that this happens to be one of the very best comics publications I've ever seen.Particularly to this book, it's a history of some of the most notorious underworld figures in the United States. Except for the masterheads of crime it also includes some characters which became famous rather for their lack of intelligence. In the 63 stories included are also figures which were well known in their time and faded into history afterwards but whose story is extremely interesting nevertheless.Impeccably researched (as usual) and with that subtle sarcasm or cynicism that this series is well known for, this is an absolutely must-have item.It's been often after I've read issues of the Big Book series that i went on to further reads because of what i discovered in these books.

On all these counts Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose. There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.

Even though it is 15+ years old, it has much value still for libraries and media centers with large collections of 398's. The subject index allows you to find many stories about almost any subject you or your students can think of. It also helps to find that partially forgotten story you heard once upon a time. An ethnic and geographic index also helps teachers and librarians fit stories into themes. All stories, compiled from more than 2000 folktale collections, are arranged in Stith Thompson order, so stories on similar themes are easy to find. Its only drawback is its date - but many libraries still have these collections on their shelves, and many of the collections are being reprinted.

Of course, the Outer Banks are hardly deserted--the locals have printed up Wege's infamous photograph of a packed stretch of Coney Island with the caption &quot;Nags Head, circa 2000 A.D.&quot;--but there we are on an island for seven days, my husband experiencing near death in the waves while I read. Sometimes we stop these pursuits and prowl the beach. Mostly we live as if we're the last two people on earth (which is easier in the off-peak season).I've learned that not every book is right for this way of life. The perfect desert island book has to celebrate the place you are in, not transport you. It should offer a tinge of society, because, after all, a human is a social animal, but it should not make you yearn achingly for what has been left behind nor should you be so repelled by it that you will never fit in again when you leave the island (you always leave the island). It should have some narrative sweep to withstand the competition of the seascape. It should make you think, at least a little: you want the stress to wash out to sea, not the little grey cells.Cape Cod by Henry David Thoreau is the benchmark by which I've chosen beach material for several years. it is the quintessential celebration of littoral life. If you are on the beach, you appreciate it all the more; if you are not, well, at least you know vividly what you are missing. There is drama, as in the specter of villagers racing to the shore at the news of a shipwreck. There is information, as in what part of the clam not to eat, how the Indians trapped gulls for food, how a lighthouse really works. There is Thoreau's contagious respect for solitude, his occasional crankiness, and that magic trick of his that can suck in high school sophomores and get them through his books without so much as a whimper.There is one flaw to Cape Cod: brevity. It lasts about a day and a half on the Robinson Crusoe plan. This is not to say that it does not withstand re-reading, it does, but at some point after you have committed it to memory, you may wish for the collected works of Shakespeare and move onto the Bard's beach play, The Tempest."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"This hardcover edition from Peninsula Press is unquestionably the best available edition of Thoreau's Cape Cod, for these reasons:1) While all other editions are based on Thoreau's journal entries from only his first three visits to the Cape, this edition includes an epilogue compiling Thoreau's notes from his fourth and final visit, in which he traveled south to Chatham and Monomoy.2) This is the only edition to translate the many, many Greek and Latin phrases Thoreau includes throughout the work, and it is also the only edition to provide illustrations, maps, and sidenotes in-text.3) This is the only indexed edition ever created.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of both Cape literature and Thoreau in general."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"You will forget about the outside world when you read this; nothing but sand, wind, and water. Plus some natural history, local folklore, a few shipwreck tales. Typical Thoreau; he finds beauty, interest, detail in the wilderness. The desolate landscape will help to clear your mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"Thoreau visited Cape Cod in 1849, 1850, and 1853. These trips formed the basis for a series of essays, several of which Thoreau published in magazines. After Thoreau's death, the essays were gathered together and published as \\"Cape Cod\\" in 1865.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is different in tone in theme from his earlier books. The tone is leisurely and light. Instead of solitude or the wild woods, the picture that remains with me from this book is that of a long walk, or, as Thoreau puts it, a \\"ramble\\" through the sand and dunes of Cape Cod. The book is picturesque, full of humor and wry observation. Thoreau unforgettably describes the ocean, in its storms, vicissitudes, and moments of peace, the fish and the fishermen, the sands, birds, plants and lighthouses of Cape Cod, and the people. I have visited portions of the Masachusetts coast, but I have never been to Cape Cod. Thoreau took me there in his book.The book is arranged into ten chapters. It opens with a description of the shipwreck of the St John on a rock off the Cape. Thoreau then describes a ride by coach across the Cape. But the heart of the book lies in the following chapters in which Thoreau with a companion walks the 30 mile beach from Nauset Harbor to Provincetown with many stops and diversions along the way. I felt the salt air and saw the fishermen and the sandy beach as I walked with Thoreau.The most vivid characterization in the book is in the chapter \\"The Wellfleet Oysterman\\", as Thoreau describes a grizzled, taciturn, and ancient native of Cape Cod and his family who offer him hospitality for the night. Another memorable chapter involves the description of the Highland Lighthouse, no longer standing, and its keeper. The stops with the Oysterman and the Lighthouse punctuate Thoreau's long walks through the day over the beach and his meditiations about and descriptions of what he finds there.Thoreaus walk ended at Provincetown, on the northernmost portion of Cape Cod, with its wood walkway, shanty houses, and ever-present scenes of fishermen, boats, and drying fish. Thoreau offers what I found an affectionate portrait of these hardy fishermen and their families. Following a description of what he found at Provincetown, Thoreau offers a great deal of historical background on the exploration of the Cape, from the Pilgrims reaching back to earlier French, Icelandic, and English explorers.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is a worthy companion to his books describing his experiences inland, on Walden Pond and on the rivers and woods of New England and Maine. It is beautifuly written with unforgettable descriptive passages. It made me want to get up and go from my life in the city, and over 150 years after Thoreau wrote, wander and walk for myself along the dunes and sands of Cape Cod."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"This is a comment about the edition rather than the book:I bought this edition based on the review about the very helpful index. Please be careful about what edition you are actually buying. Many of these reviews are about different editions. I bought the BiblioLife paperback book with a picture of the green bicycle on the cover. I just received it and there is NO INDEX.It looks like the original text from an original printing (with smaller physical dimensions) was photocopied page by page and put into this paperback book. This will do the trick but I am a little disappointed and wish I had bought a different edition.It is confusing on amazon because when you click \\"look inside\\" it shows an index, with a tiny note saying the \\"look inside\\" refers to a different edition."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"This book details the flora, fauna and people that Thoreau found in Cape Cod in the 1850s. Thoreau organizes the book around a single trip to Provincetown, although much of the material that he uses in the book came from various visits to the Cape, and to the ocean in general. He starts with a description of a shipwreck at Cohasset, then a stagecoach ride from Plymouth, then a walking trip with a companion along the outer shore to Provincetown. Along the way, he describes not only the plants and animals he encountered, but also the people who he met. The book finishes with a lengthy academic historical account of the discovery and mapping of the Cape.I found this to be the most humorous of all Thoreau's work. The character sketches he provides in this book, sharpened with his trained eye for observation of natural phenomena, are legendary. The cultural description of the Cape and its environment is quite fascinating for those interested in the history of daily life in 19th century Massachusetts. As Thoreau describes the desolate, treeless desert that made up the far reaches of the Cape, one begins to comprehend what it meant for an economy to be based on wood and whale oil for fuels. Thoreau stresses how valued driftwood was for residents of the Cape, as one of their main sources of heating and cooking fuel. Doubtless, he would not recognize the Cape today with its lush new forests. Or its Wal-Marts--switching to an oil economy has brought mixed blessings for the Cape. For those who think Thoreau to be a humorless didactic philosopher, this book shows a very different aspect of Thoreau as a writer."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon identifies Josep Moldenhauer as the author of this book which is in fact written by Henry David Thoreau.Cape Cod is made up of his rambling observations he ambled about the Cape with an unidentified \\"companion\\" during the 1850's.I was looking forward to an evocative description of the unspoiled Cape which, even today in its over commercialized state, is redolent with romance, timelessness, and above all with the sea. Instead, the reader is exposed to dithering minutiae, delivered in a style that often borders on the unreadable.Here, for instance, is what must be one of the longest sentences ever written in the English language. It deals with the act of looking into a house on the beach through a knot-hole in the door. Hold on - you're not going to believe this.Here goes...However, as we wished to get an idea of a Humane house, and we hoped that we would never have a better opportunity, we put our eyes, by turns, to a knot-hole in the door, and after long looking, without seeing, into the dark, - not knowing how many shipwrecked men's bones we might see at last, looking with the eye of faith, knowing that, though to him that knocketh it may not always be opened, yet to him that looketh long enough through a knot hole the inside shall be visible, - for we had had some practice of looking inward, - by steadily keeping our other ball covered from the light meanwhile, putting the outward world behind us, ocean and land, and the beach, - till the pupil became enlarged and collected the rays of light that were wandering in that dark (for the pupil shall be enlarged by looking; there was never so dark a night that a faithful and patient eye, however small, might at last prevail over it), - after all this, I say, things began to take shape in our vision, - if we may use this expression where there was nothing but emptiness, - and we obtained the long-wished-for insight.Can you believe it?This monster sentence says that they looked into a house through a knot-hole, and since it was dark it took some time for their eyes to adjust, but eventually they were able to dimly make out the interior. That's it! And yet it contains not less that 207 words, twenty-four commas, seven dashes, and one semi colon.Anyway, apart from this sketchy style, Cape Cod is eminently forgettable."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"Cape Cod, by Henry David Thoreau, a book reviewReading Cape Cod is like visiting with a distant relative or a fond acquaintance. Thoreau, who we have all heard about for most of our lives, rarely lectures or preaches on these pages. The chapters ramble through a Cape Cod of yesteryear and are comprised of articles and journal entries from Thoreau's walking holidays in 1849, 1850, 1855, and 1857. He describes the countryside, the tame and wild vegetation (complete with botanical names), architecture, people, food, farms, ships, fishing, economic activity, and everything else that presents itself to his view.While Thoreau waxes poetic, and even philosophical, from time to time, this reads like a casual travel log, albeit from a very learned and intelligent scholar. The text includes quotes in a variety of languages, including Latin, Greek, and French, which are not all translated. Those looking for uncommon quotes are sure to find a few juicy tidbits. If you are looking for encouragement for reading the Christian Bible, exhortations against organized religion, or beautiful thoughts on nature and solitude, you will definitely find them here.What I found most fascinating, is the ecological destruction that had already occurred in the area. Some native shellfish had been nearly wiped out, and \\"seed stock\\" was being imported from other areas. Trees no longer reached the height that they had originally grown, crop land was no longer as productive, and erosion was enough of a problem that the government had stepped in with programs and regulations. Thoreau documents that the people blamed \\"Providence\\"--meaning the Creator--when their crops or natural resources failed them. It seems it never occurred to them that their own actions might be detrimental to their environment.Thoreau also documents the thinking about the ocean and its resources back in those days. Even he sees the ocean as nearly infinite and unlimited. This thinking is reflected in the fisheries and especially in the take on what they called \\"blackfish.\\" The \\"blackfish\\" is a small whale, or perhaps a dolphin, with a blunt shaped head. Schools of these creatures are chased aground by men and boys in small boats. They are then murdered for their blubber and left to rot. Thoreau asks one of the \\"fishermen\\" if the meat is good to eat, and the fishermen replies that he prefers it to beef--when it is fresh. Thoreau's only comment on this waste is that the poor soil needs the nutrients that this \\"manure\\" supplies.The edition that I read, which was arranged with notes by Dudley C. Lunt and was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1951, contains a history of Cape Code in the appendix. This history, written by Thoreau, is rambling and disjointed, but worth reading. We all know that we have been sold a bill of goods in regards to Plymouth and the Pilgrims. A close reading of this history emphasizes just what a good sales job it was. The first thing that really grabbed me is the fact that three prior successful, permanent, European settlements had been established in North America (before Plymouth); one in Florida,--one I believe he said--in New Mexico, and one in Nova Scotia. (The one in Florida I have read something about before. When doing some research on the first Thanksgiving I ran across an article about a Florida town that claims it was celebrating Thanksgiving before the Pilgrims even thought of coming to the \\"New World.\\") Thoreau also documents early Viking and French visits to the area, and quotes texts that claim European people had been fishing in or near Cape Cod for many hundreds of years before \\"America\\" was \\"discovered.\\"Anyone researching the history of the East Coast, New England, or early contact between the two continents will find this a rewarding read. Thoreau sites the documents he quotes and others that may contain valuable information. However, you don't have to be a scholar or a student with a project to enjoy this book. Anyone with an interest in sustainability, history, botany, or the writing of Thoreau will be enriched by the time spent between these pages."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"(My review is on Thoreau's Cape Cod rather than this specific edition).While some literary critics seem to slight this work by Thoreau, saying that it is not as \\"powerful\\" as his other works, etc., I personally find this one very enjoyable. Sure, it does not have as much \\"philosophizing\\" as other books by him, but it is full of humor and very fun to read. The part where he describes the old man spitting into the hearth is particularly hilarious. The part about him sleeping in a lighthouse is also very funny. It lets us experience the more jovial side of Thoreau. This is probably one of the easiest to read among Thoreau's books.Published posthumously, this volume is surprisingly consistent and complete (unlike \\"The Maine Woods\\" which is chopped into three different parts), it gives one the feel of walking along the entire cape, although the materials are quarried from several different trips. One only wish Thoreau had lived longer and had seen the West, imagine him taking a trip in the Sierra! Oh, well, meanwhile, we still have this one to enjoy."},{"Title":"Cape Cod (Apollo editions)","review":"Love it....Love it!

So far, it has been a pleasant read as Thoreau points out and comments on people, geography, history of the Cape, and events that occur, e.g., a shipwreck -- to which many people not directly connected to the tragedy don't seem to care a 'hoot'. The book was recommended by a friend who is an English professor as we in a book group were discussing 'The Thoreau You Don't Know' by Robert Sullivan -- which most of the group enjoyed and learned from. The recommendation came up after I mentioned I was reading 'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' which I retitled 'An Infinity on the Concord and ...'. That has to be the most boring book I ever read next to 'Vanity Fair'.So far, 'Cape Cod' is written in a relatively lively style compared to other Thoreau writings I've encountered.

Thoreau is at his best here in his descriptions of nature and the people inhabiting this (then) difficult place. The book really is a paean to the Sea...Thoreau is awed by its power and beauty. Much of the work tends to be descriptions of the sea or its influence on the land. More than once he mentions that one is never far from the noise of the breakers or the winds. He also discusses man's influence on the land (usually negative), yet how mankind is still dwarfed by the power of the sea. Even if you are not a Thoreau fan, read this.

LaGard Smith, and while Brother Smith offers excellent devotional commentary, more helps such as a running commentary below the text, maps & charts, dictionaries, concordances, and topical references and cross-references are lacking. What ends up happening is after I've decided to shut the door to get cozy with God and read some passages, I have to get up, leave the room, search out my own study Bible, and then try to juggle the two on my lap. It kinda defeats the purpose of someone arranging scriptures Chronologically for us once you have to do all that.

Also weaved into the story was Frank, the best man, a successful business man, though slightly less successful in the affairs of the heart, Father Hurley, the priest who married the couple twenty-five years ago, and feisty Maureen, Deirdre&iexcl;s best friend.These were ordinary characters, but what would make the reader go on is that each of the character had its own unique tale to tell, from managing family relationships, to hidden and secret affairs of the heart.I felt a slight disappointment, however, at the end of the book as it left me with a sense of non-fulfillment. We were given insights to the problems but were not shown solutions. For instance, Deirdre&iexcl;s uneasy relationship with her children did not appear to be improved and Maureen&iexcl;s relationship with Walter did not develop further. Maybe this is the author&iexcl;s reflection of the real world, that not every question has an answer to it."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This was only my 3rd book by Maeve Binchy, and compared to Evening Class and Echoes, Silver Wedding wasn't near as entertaining. I feel that if Binchy made the novel a bit longer to allow for better character development, Silver Wedding would have been quite a page-turner. However, I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and I will continue to read anything Maeve Binchy has in print."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"I've been reading Maeve Binchy's work for years. I was looking for entertaining summer reading and couldn't resist reading Silver Wedding (read it before, years ago). Ms. Binchy gets into the characters' heads and takes the reader along for the ride. Following the main female character through the story is entertaining; you can't help but think \\"I'm glad she isn't in MY life!\\" I've read everything that Maeve Binchy has written (I think) and this book is one of my favorites. If you enjoy her writing, then you have to read this one."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"I seldom keep books after I read them to minimize clutter.

The characters come alive and feel like oldfriends. You will laugh and cry with them!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"A thought provoking, funny, heart-warming story.Enough tied off ends to be satisfying yet enough loose ends to leave one wondering what would happen next."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This is a collection of six interlinked stories about a family preparing for the parent's silver wedding anniversary, it gives a description of some of the family and also some of the closer friends who will be attending the wedding. We have Anna the oldest daughter, she is organising the anniversary party, and worried about what can go wrong and whether her brother Brendan will show up at the party. Brendan has all but removed himself from the family as he is tired of the acting that goes on with his mother Deirdre who's always worried about what people will think. Theres also Anna and Brendan's sister Helen a very confused, accident prone and annoying character who is trying to become a nun to get away from it all. There's the parish priest who has his own secrets and other various family and friends.This is a short book which I read in a few hours. I think if you have read the Lilac Bus and liked it you will probably like this one as well."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Not one of her better efforts.

She enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This was good, but unlike most of MB's novels, the characters were not developed enough for my taste.

Some people are kind and some people are bad."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This was a wonderful reading experience."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This book was a good read until the last chapters. The story line begins to unravel a bit toward the end. There are pieces left unfinished and the ending itself was so poor that I thought my copy must be missing the last chapter. Most of Binchy's novels are beautifully polished. Unfortunately, this one leaves the silver somewhat tarnished."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Another great book by Maeve Binchy ! I love most of her books. This one is no exception. The characters become real to you, and you tend to miss them when the book is over. My only complaint would be that after all the painstaking attention to detail about each character, the Silver Wedding anniversary party comes and the book is over ! I'd have liked a little more of an ending, not quite so sudden an ending."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Most of the characters were annoying in this book. I do like how each one got a chance to tell \\"their\\" side of the story.Not one of her best but still made for a pleasent read."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Deirdre and Desmond are planning a party for their 25th. wedding anniversary. They are helped by their daughter Anna, who is just getting over an unhappy love affair. Less helpful are their other two children, Helen, a hopeless bungler who is hoping to be taken on as a nun, and Brendan, who has escaped his childhood home and family to take up farming with his Uncle Vincent in Ireland. Other guests include the best man Frank, who has become much more successful than Desmond and the maid of honor, Helen, both of whom have their own problems. Deirdre is extremely concerned with appearances, since she married &quot;beneath her&quot; 25 years ago, and her gentle falsehoods and nervous posturings effect her children and others around her. Each of the eight main characters is introduced in a chapter and they all come together for the celebration at the end. This book does not have the depth of other Binchey novels, nor the redemption of all of its characters, but it is an interesting read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"Maeve Binchy continues to explore in depth the characters of her writings with Silver Wedding. In this book each chapter is dedicated to one of the interesting and unusual characters. There is much development of their relationship to the others and well as their own personalities. This is the second Binchy book I have read this summer and was sad when I came to the last page."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This book did not give the depth that Binchy usually has. It had a very week storyline and the reader did not get to truly know a character. I am a great Binchy fan, but was disappointed in this one.

I would recommend these novels to anyone (females)"},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"I read the book to the finish but found that her writing style was the same for each book I had read and the characters were boring by this time."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"As always a Maeve Binchy feel good story. Fast read but once I pickup any of her books, I cannot put down until I finish. Characters had depth. Would recommend any of her books."},{"Title":"The Silver Wedding/Audio Cassettes","review":"\\"Silver Wedding\\" by Maeve Binchy made me feel like a part of a warm and caring neighbourhood, with all its flaws and frailties.

Probably because publishers are jerks, this book is billed as a mystery. It isn't. There is very little suspense, and no mystery at all. This book is erotic fiction. If you know that before you read it, so that you are not disappointed by the lack of mystery, you may well enjoy it very much: it is *very* good erotic fiction"},{"Title":"No Score (Chip Harrison Mystery)","review":"Let me say right up front, I think Lawrence Block, the winner of numerous Edgars for his mystery novels, is one of my favorite novelists of all time. His Matthew Scudden novel series and Bernie Rhodenbarr/ Burglar series are, in my opinion, without peer. I even took one of Block's 2-day seminars in the mid 1980's called \\"Write For Your Life.\\" That's how much I love Lawrence Block.But this book \\"No Score - A Chip Harrison Mystery\\" is not a mystery at all.Block wrote this novel in 1970, and it's nothing more than the rantings of an 18-year old boy in the quest for his first sexual experience with a woman.That's the plot!So in effect, there is no plot.Sure, there's a few laughs along the way, but not one reason to continue reading, which I sadly did, to the very end.It was a huge disappointment, to say the least."},{"Title":"No Score (Chip Harrison Mystery)","review":"No Score refers to the title characters inability to complete the sex act with numerous partners throughout the story. Lawrence Block is one of my favorite authors. He must have written this book when he desperately needed the money.

Bay's book is good in that it teaches you to read music while you learn to play your instrument, and it gives you a CD featuring several of the pieces in the book - a huge benefit. The oversights I've noticed are a)there's barely any instruction on breathing method and b)\\"tongueing\\" (a very basic must-know skill) isn't explained at all. I found myself spending time on the internet to supplement these oversights, and even had to re-train myself on how to produce clear notes."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Recorder","review":"I bought this along with a Soprano recorder. The CD and Video are a valuable addition to a so-so book. They still do not aid you with breathing techniques or when to apply grease to your recorder. Having a teacher or an experienced player to guide you is a must."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Recorder","review":"I love this product. It has everything - pictures, big print, and a CD so you can hear what you are supposed to sound like. Best of all, the CD has accompaniment, which makes playing the pieces really fun. It progresses in a very logical way, and I found that it was a very easy way to learn. I'd buy it again and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Recorder","review":"I have found this book / DVD / CD combo to be THE ticket to accomplish 2 things.....1. To learn how to play the recorder properly2. To learn to read musicSimple great sounding songs that work step-by-step upward will have you jamming with the written notes VERY quickly. After 2 months I could actually look at simple / adv beginner sheet music from other publishers & the library and play it, no problem.I bought 2 books to get both the DVD and CD, but really all you need is the CD version.If i could give it a 10 I would!"},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Recorder","review":"Okay, this is a good series and this particular book does not belong among the rest of the Teach Yourself. First, it will teach you how to play the scale notes, sharps, flats and so on. However after about 20 pages you get the idea the tunes included in the book are not anything you'd seriously want to play. Most are at least a hundred years or so old, under unrecognizable titles, and just plain silly. If they want to charge so much for this set, then update the music to things more current and some actual classical pieces.As for the CD and DVD, well, they're okay. The DVD is just great if all you want to do is watch a guy play the recorder. It's boring and is not very instructive.This purchase is, in my opinion, a waste of money."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's You Can Teach Yourself Recorder","review":"I love this book! Not only did I re-learn the recorder very quickly thanks to the combination of intuitive music selections and a CD of most of those selections played by a master musician, but the DVD allowed me to see the kind of posture, mouth and fingering positions that are required for consistent results."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"but a decent book nevertheless, Eve's Tattoo is more about it's heroines journey through middle-age crisis and less about the Holocaust. Yes, Eva indeed gets a tattoo of the number of the woman from her photograph which reminds her of herself, and yes, she does tell interesting 'tailored to suit stories' to everyone that asks her about it (which is not uninteresting) but on the whole the book mostly deals with Eva's life - her tattoo is a way to show herself that she has some meaning.I got this book because it was on sale - and I was in army and had nothing better to do. I can say it didn't disappoint me. It's moderately interesting and somewhat even intriguing read - but don't expect it to be life-changing. I'd say borrow it from a library instead."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"In today's news, 25% of Germans felt that Nazi rule was not all bad citing the Nazi \\"high regard for the mother.\\" If not for this book which I agree was not fun to read, I would not have the \\"trivia\\" of what it meant to be a German woman in Nazi Germany permanently embedded in my brain. Thanks a lot, Emily Prager. The Nazis turned their aryan women into baby machines compromising the health of women and shortening their life spans all in the name of patriotism. Do you think it was only scary for Jews under Nazi rule? This book tells in a roundabout way how Nazis were/are also the enemy of women."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"Prager's novel does suffer at times - there are two or three scenes that don't seem to quite make sense. The character relationships are not as well-developed as they could be. However, it was interesting for me because it explored the female side of the Holocaust: how could Christian women continue to be involved? Eve's motivation - keeping the memory of the victims of the Holocaust alive - is admirable as she forces friends and strangers to remember that no one was safe. The stories that Eve produces, allegedly concocted from her research, are intimate and tailored to her audience. The best scene in the novel to me was when Eve encounters a male Holocaust survivor. Prager's books are hard to find, so good luck at your local used bookstore or library."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"This is an incredible book. It is thoughtful, haunting, and tells the story of an uncompromising heroine"},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"Loved the book. Had a lot of history regarding women in the during the early years of the Third Reich that I wasn't aware of. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"When I first heard the premise of this book, I had my doubts about it. But I found it to have a lot of depth and historical interest. Very well written, and really made me think about my own life, history, and (lack of) generosity to and empathy for others and their varied situations."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"I came across this book whilst doing an American Literature course in my English University. I am a self professed literary snob but will read anything that is offered to me, note recent delves into Snagged by Mary Higgins Clark and Lost by Gregory Maguire. I love literature in all its shapes and forms, the printed word is a beautiful thing. Having said that this book is not merely an affront to anyone remotely connected to any war or human induced suffering, but is an affront to language itself. Prager's self obssesed heroine and the author's inate ability to make mountains out of molehills and vice versa combine in a glorification of self indulgence and narcissism. It is not an intriguing study of a mid life crisis as is claimed. As a fan of Bridget Jones, Little Nell and Bartleby I hate this book."},{"Title":"Eve's Tattoo","review":"From the very beginning, the premise of Eve's Tattoo is an affront to those who suffered in the Holocaust. The protagonist is a vapid, self-indulgent woman experiencing a mid-life crisis. By getting a tattoo of a Holocaust victim she has seen in a photo, she creates a counterpart about whom she can weave tales of what the Nazis did. She can go into a discotheque and point out to her \\"victim\\" the tattoos painted on the young musicians. This is not what the Holocaust is about. The way that this character embellishes her tales to indulge herself is a trivialization of the true catastrophe. This novel feeds into the deceit of Holocaust deniers and revisionists because the protagonist creates victims' stories for her own egocentric purposes. A reader can get no insight into the true nature of Nazi evil by reading this book. It is an exploitation of the topic and has no redeeming value. Actually, I would use it as an example of how the Holocaust is diminished by bad pop-art."},{"Title":"Traditional Quilts for Kids to Make","review":"This book is full of beautiful photos and wonderful instructions. Some great quilt ideas for boys too.An excellent book for beginners, young or old. I love the variety of blocks, 15 of them in all. Most books for kids do not contain as many. Kids Start Quilting with Alex Anderson, for example, has only 5 blocks to choose from.The author's other book, Kids Can Quilt is also wonderful and I recommend having them both.I wrote my original review for this book many years ago and it is still my favorite quilt book. Considering I have a book case full of quilt books that says a lot. I am a big fan! Buy this book."},{"Title":"Traditional Quilts for Kids to Make","review":"Barbara Eikmeier's Traditional Quilts For Kids To Make expands the quilting idea to children's hands, presenting classic patterns which have been selected and sewn by kids. Where other titles limit projects to wall quilts and blocks, this provides larger more satisfying kid-friendly projects for 15 traditional styles and larger pieces."},{"Title":"Traditional Quilts for Kids to Make","review":"This book is very concise and yet includes all of the details necessary for completing a first time quilt or instructing a child to create one of many quilts. I like that there are instructions given on how to deviate from the sample to create your own unique quilt. The tips for teaching children are excellent. The tools and supplies section and finishing techniques are also very helpful. I will be refering to this book when I plan my next children's quilting class. A must have reference for any new quilting teacher."},{"Title":"Boomtown","review":"Boomtown is a great, fast-moving novel that takes place in New York City during the pre 9-11 dot-com bubble. New York City serves as a glittering backdrop for the very compelling characters, the delusional dot-com schemes (\\"it was another great week for Biz Dev\\"), and painfully fragile relationships. The characters are entirely believable, and I felt genuine sadness for many of them. They get swept up in something much larger than themselves, and soon find themselves and their beloved city caught up in a new cycle of \\"creative destructiveness\\", seeing relationships end, seeing dreams end, but still holding on. This book struck a deep chord with me, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Boomtown","review":"A highly enjoyable, engrossing read, \\"Boomtown\\" (not related to the excellent but short-lived NBC series of the same name) charmed and delighted me. Moving quickly through the New York dot.com landscape of the year of the bubble burst, Williams uses his own experience (including perhaps his undergraduate major) to write a story that kept me turning the pages from start to finish -- with great interest -- in one satisfying day.The ensemble cast includes the functional (and, at times, dysfunctional) protagonist, Brad Smith, the PR vice president for a content-free start up. We never really learn or need to know what it is they are selling; this makes for a good parable about the entire dot.com mirage/mania. Smith provides the central point to the strange populace from his firm, including the duplicitous general manager, the former stripper turned PR assistant, the Middle Eastern investor, the oversexed personal assistant, and the nerdy tech guy. They are an interesting crew and Smith stumbles aimlessly, drunkenly for much of the novel before finding some light at the end of the dot.com tunnel, most of it from a fellow traveler who wants something quite different than what Smith seems to be seeking.In a parallel world, Nicole Garrison, aspiring actress, leaves her unfaithful boyfriend, spurns a calculating but clueless Wall Street type, earns her big break, loses it, and...well, let's not give away the entire plot.The crash of the greedy, paper-rich Internet employees of the end of the last century provides good fodder for a \\"Bright lights, big city\\" like romp through the bars, bedrooms and refurbished office space that makes New York such an interesting setting for the book, much better than any bone-dry Silicon Valley setting. The characters, perhaps based on Williams' own experiences in this era, may be a bit stereotypical, but they are fun to watch. Sort of like \\"Sex in the city,\\" only with more realistic work schedules.Williams provides some personal insight about the dot.com collapse, some philosophy about contemplation, and a beguiling, almost too quick close to the story. The story would make a great movie and the conclusion provides the lead-in to a possible sequel.A great way to spend a hot summer day."},{"Title":"Boomtown","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this account of the dot.com world. The star of the book for me was the wondrous Sierra who is a former stripper hired into the firm for her obvious attributes. Endowed with more smarts than her resume might indicate, Sierra identifies the power behind the throne, Farouk Kharrazi, who has too much money and one wife too many. Sleeping your way to the top may not be the most ethical business practice, but Sierra uses what she knows best and does an end run around the manager Jonathan Scarver and his right hand man Brad Smith. Ultimately, \\"Boomtown\\" comes down to a question of values. No amount of money in the world brings peace of mind, although it can bring a nice luxury apartment in New York City. There is a bit of a high-tech comedy of manners as computer geek Steven Bluestein reads everybody's email and then creates a virus that sends their emails to everyone else. This spirals out of control as the virus spreads around the world, bringing in the FBI to investigate the origins of the hoax. Greg Williams does a wonderful job of painting this world and making us care about it. I kept picturing Marge Helgenberger from CSI playing Sierra in the movie version.

Ignore that; it won't affect your enjoyment of the book.The story is about a scam-artist who must save a Jeckyl-and-Hyde community, with the aid of some magical, but not entirely reliable or discreet, companions. Not as good as The Ballad of Wuntvor or the Ebenezum Trilogy, but an enjoyable light read."},{"Title":"Wishbringer","review":"I read the book cause I'm a infocom game fan.

I've yet to play Infocom's Wishbringer, so I can't compare the game and book directly, but it's clear from the start that C.S. Gardner took the game's world and made it his own, allowing the book to escape the 'adaptation' stigma.As a child I was a huge fan of Gardner's Ballad of Wuntvor series and Robert Aspirin's Myth series, as well as the Infocom games and their stellar writing, so Wishbringer was an easy buy for me. I recall reading it in only a few nights, unable to put it down. Recently, my wife and I rediscovered the book while going through a box of old memories. We read it together, once again in record time. Surprisingly, it still held it's appeal for an adult audience.It's a lighthearted page-turner, very much in the style of Gardner and Aspirin's earlier works. Aspirin excells at writing cliffhangers that keep you coming back for more. The story is silly, eccentric, peopled with an odd assortment of creatures with kooky senses of priority. The book features a likable protagonists, an ocassionally likable love interest, and a cast of creatures with no business co-existing in the same world yet do so with ease. At times it can be repetitive and even childish, but remember that it's aimed at kids. There were a few situation which (for the time it was written) seemed a bit too sexual for a kids book. And there are plenty of bits designed to entertain adults as well.On the whole it was a fun, original ride. I always wished there'd been a sequel, and it's a shame there were only a couple books in this game adaptation series."},{"Title":"Wishbringer","review":"This book is based on the Infocom game of the same name.

The text--limited to a bank of about 30+ words--is very simple and repetitive helping young readers learn words, the drawings are brightly colored and detailed as Freddie and family go to a zoo and see many animals, and I thought it was neat how a reader can compare/contrast the types of pictures and animals (and even family members) both by Freddie's pictures at the end of the story as well as illustrator Susan Miller's.

A MUST READ"},{"Title":"Pioneers in Canada","review":"This book is probably misleadingly named for today's average reader. I thought initially on reading it, that it would dwell on the general experiences of Pioneers to Canada in general and came to realize quickly that more to the point, it is focused upon Explorere of Canada. That's a fine point perhaps, and it may be defensible given that the book is older and in the vernacular of its day the meaning was more generally understood.Reading the book today however, there is good information to be gleaned if the modern reader can get past some of the bias present in the book, that today wouldn't be readily tolerated. In particular, the view taken of the native population is both prejudicial and exagerated in a manner reminiscent of how a book on the issue of slavery might be written pre-civil war. The typical stereotypes abound and when positive statements are made, they appear to almost be apologetic and set in contrast to the focus upon hygene, morals and cultural differences that are laid out in a manner that can only be called self-aggrandizing.In this regard, there's a value to the book for the manner that it demonstrates the bias of the time in which it was written. Certainly there is good objective information present. Just be prepared to have to wade through enough of the other elements that will test the patience of many of its readers today.4 StarsBart Breen"},{"Title":"Pioneers in Canada","review":"For History Buffs,only those who like to read \\"through the eyes of those who were there\\" would enjoy this book"},{"Title":"L. A. Breakdown (Great American First Novels)","review":"Lou Mathews' work seems to function on the level of touch and smell, with an electric, atmospheric sense of what lies just beyond the skin. The writing is spare but fraught with a complexity of emotion all the more powerful because it is neither dissected nor explained away; it is simply there. The obsessions and irrational choices of these young working-class mechanics, their humor, the joy taken from careful, painstaking work ratcheting up their cars, their vicious infighting over rank, the adrenaline rush of the race, the bitterness of thwarted desire, the &quot;fun&quot; stubbornly snatched in the face of financial hardship, abuse, the dictates of family, Army and Church, all merge in a fleeting snapshot of the moment when youthful hope gives way to the grim uncertainties of adulthood."},{"Title":"L.

It is written in simple English, reads fast and easy, and had me empathizing with several characters. The storyline translates into visual imagery well without becoming overly engaged in meaningless detail or clatter.But what makes this such an easy novel to read is also its main drawback. I found myself wanting for more detail. In liking the characters, I wanted to know more about them and also wanted a good reason to slow my reading pace.As Lou Mathews is a multiple award-winning author, it is my contention that he purposely chose this light style to make L.A. Breakdown read fast. In doing so, the book becomes its own metaphor for the story within. Teen summers are a breeding ground for tales beginning with &quot;You guys should have been there when...,&quot; are all too brief, and end with a feeling of uncertainty.L.A.

The book is written by physicians for parents wanting to make informed decisions for their sons. I wish I had had this information long ago."},{"Title":"Doctors Re-examine Circumcision","review":"A must read for anybody considering circumcision. I was a parent believing that circumcision was the &quot;RIGHT thing to do&quot;. I did not know that at the birth of my twin sons in 1997, that no medical orginzation in the world recommended circumcission. I was told that circumcision is your choice and was recommended by my doctors. Never did those doctors tell me what this book reveals. It is an easy to read source of information for any parent thinking of circumcising or to simply to educate yourself about the implications of circumcission. This book contains documented and well supported information about why you would not want to circumcise. I have not circumcisied my third son."},{"Title":"Doctors Re-examine Circumcision","review":"This book should be required reading for all expecting parents and their doctors. This book makes it clear that routine circumcision has NO medical benefit. Because it has no medical benefit, NO medical organization in the world recommends it. For example, circumcision does not prevent urinary track infection (urinary track infections are lower in Europe where circumcision is virtually unheard of) and many studies have shown circumcision to increase the rate of HIV infection and the rate of transmitting HIV/AIDS to the female partner (UNAIDS calls using circumcision to prevent AIDS playing Russian Roulette).Circumcision was started as a \\"cure\\" for masturbation. Since then it has been a procedure in search of a disease. To little attention is paid to the life long harm done to the child. For example, circumcision is now believed to be a contributing factor in male sexual dysfunction since the procedure removes highly sensitive sexual tissue and the unprotected glans becomes desensitized through a hardening of the skin in a process called keritinization. Also, the foreskin protects the infant from infections since it keeps feces away from the urethra. In addition, the foreskin has major immunological functions including secreting a chemical called lysozyme (an ingredient in mother's milk) that has been show to kill HIV, the virus that causes aids. This fact alone may explain why the AIDS rate in the USA is three to twelve times higher than any western European country.Routine infant circumcision not only is medically unnecessary, it is harmful. It is only a matter of time before the procedure will be outlawed. Until that happens this book will give parents the information they need to protect their sons from this destructive practice."},{"Title":"Doctors Re-examine Circumcision","review":"With books like this one, I learned there are no medical reasons to consent to circumcision when I gave birth. Why cut my babies? Previously, like most young parents, I had assumed that \\"Doctor Knows Best\\" so when I first read this book and discovered a controversy amongst doctors themselves about a taken-for-granted surgery, I deepened my life long investigation into the consequences of circumcision. I recommend this book for parents who place their trust in obstetricians and pediatricians, indeed for all people who care about the future -- it is an alarming wake up call to a culture asleep at the wheel of creation. What are we doing when we hurt baby boys for no good reason? In studying the warring cultures of the world, one thing we consistently have in common is the genital mutilation of our children (amongst other things). If we truly want to co-create a peaceful world, let's begin with our babies.

This book has been updated from the original older version."},{"Title":"Doctors Re-examine Circumcision","review":"Physicians Thomas Ritter and George Denniston have found a new publisher who has just reprinted a larger-format, lightly updated edition of their straightforward yet deceptively powerful book, formerly entitled \\"Say No to Circumcision.\\"\\"Doctors Re-examine Circumcision\\" devotes between one and six pages to explaining, in simple layman's terms, the meaning and ramifications of each of the authors' forty reasons to say no to circumcision. The reasons themselves ably summarize the various relevant issues: Circumcision is very painful and traumatizing, produces psychological and emotional pain, and creates unnecessary surgical risks and complications. The foreskin is normal and natural and in fact enhances sexual pleasure (two reasons), and the glans is intended to be an internal organ. Circumcision is a disservice to both the male and female, and removes a lot more than a little snip of skin. Males with foreskins will have a lot of company in the locker room, and the history of circumcision is filled with hysteria, bias, and misinformation. Even some Jewish people are changing their minds about the procedure, and none of the many suggested health reasons (penile and cervical cancer, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS--three reasons!) hold up to careful analysis. Major medical associations say circumcision is unnecessary, and some insurance companies are no longer paying for it. Finally, if you're not sure, don't do it! Say no to circumcision!The book opens with five pages of fine prefatory material, including thoughtful messages to parents who had their son circumcised, to new parents, to circumcised men, and to doctors who circumcise. A useful summary of American medical policy in 2001 is provided. (Fair disclosure: an academic article I co-authored on the inadequacy of parental consent to neonatal circumcision is quoted at length.) Famed anthropologist Ashley Montagu provides a persuasive introduction aptly addressing the remarkable persistence and vitality of cultural myths. Perhaps most valuably, a full page is devoted to a tabulation of some thirty fallacies and myths of circumcision. These are the very beliefs that will be debunked in the following pages, and they are so widespread that nearly everybody without an in-depth familiarity with the subject is likely to believe many if not most of them. And yet none of them is true: Circumcision does carry serious risks. Doctors cannot necessarily be relied upon, particularly in the United States, to provide accurate information regarding the procedure. Circumcision does not prevent premature ejaculation.Repeatedly throughout the book we have the opportunity to hear \\"victim's voices\\" and to be exposed to ideas about the procedure which have been raised by numerous other authors and organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics. On one page, the reader will encounter some photographs which may be painfully graphic in depicting what can go wrong with a circumcision. The drawings scattered throughout the book usefully elucidate the text.The authors possess a charming simplicity and directness in their writing style from which many if not most professionals such as lawyers and physicians could learn. Many of us can also learn much from the physicians' admirable brevity. Under one hundred pages to comprehensively cover the subject! The larger, full page format makes this edition much easier to read and use. Three cheers!To purchase, contact MusiciansUnited@aol.com or call (717)285-2839.

It will spark your imagination as the author, an experienced veterinarian, promises. I had been to all sorts of internet sites trying to find a good name for our new kitten. Finally I bought this book on my Kindle and it helped me come up with a couple of good name ideas, Hucklepurry being one idea (from literature section -book reminded me of Huckleberry Finn and our kitten is so purry!). Author suggests sticking with 1 or 2 syllables that your pet will recognize (so now we are thinking of what we could shorten Hucklepurry to). Even if you don't use any of the names suggested, this book will help you think of some things you never thought of before and jump start your own creativity to come up with your own original name. The book is broken down into different chapters with each chapter being a different category: appearance, personality, human names, terms of endearment. literature and art, pairs, greek & roman mythology, and many more. I loved the cute illustrations for each chapter too. I think I'll probably buy this book in book form too b/c it's so fun to read and browse through.The only negative comment I have is with the Kindle formatting. Each chapter had a lead \\"intro\\" then next comes the list of suggested names for that category or topic. The font size on the suggested names in some of the chapters are very very ridiculously small and the font/text size adjuster on Kindle only adjusts the text of the text in the intro for each chapter, not the part that lists the suggested names. It was pretty frustrating to be straining to read the names. The name part is why I bought the book!! I finally figured out to adjust the orientation to landscape which seems to somewhat increase the names font sizes so that you don't feel like you are going to pass out, they are readable. I suppose these types of problems with Kindle formatting are to be expected while e-readers are so new. Regardless of this issue, I found the book very helpful and entertaining and I would recommend it. I don't want to scare readers away from the Kindle edition, you CAN adjust the orientation and see the names and the problem doesn't occur with all the chapters. It just took me a little time to figure out how. I think this kind of formatting issue should have been addressed when they were formatting this book into an ebook. GREAT BOOK though, really!

I have read a few of Mr. Nasr's book and he is truly a great scholar of Islam. I did find the last portion of the book which dealt with the last trip of the holy prophet to Mecca and his speech regarding Ali, may God be please with him, rather surprising and, to be honest, troubling. If this story is true, then certainly holy prophet would have given a strong signal as his intention of making Ali as community's guide after his departure. I talked to the imam of our mosque and of course, like a good imam, he was of no help except saying that I should not bother reading books written by Shia authors since shaitan will get a hold of my mind. I told my dear imam, &quot;look, is stupid written on our foreheads that you treat us like kids?&quot; I have been in the US for 15 years and have a PhD in my field, do you really think this answer is going to satisfy me. When my wife, then a Christian, was considering Islam, she got the same non-sense from her family and friends, that Islam is a strong hold of &quot;Satan&quot;, it is amazing how similar we are in our tactics towards each other. I must say that at the present I am neither a Sunni nor a Shia until I investigate this further. My commitment in to God and his holy Prophet and not to anybody else, and if Prophet wanted Ali as the guide then so be it, you will not get an argument against it from me. I really do hope that sincere scholars try to present what Prophet really wanted as &quot;Islam&quot; and not what tradition and history has apparently forced upon us."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"While the book itself spans over about 60 or so odd pages, there are two aspects of Muhammad's life that are treated with meticilious care. The noctrunal journey, or his ascension, which he regards as \\"the example of spiritual ascent and the model for spiritual life\\", is treated in 8 pages. The horizontal ascent that took him from Mecca to Jerusalem and his eventual vertical ascent from Jerusalem to the heavens, is shared in detail with writings of both Shi'i and Sunni'i scholars, thus highlighting the importance attached to this event depicted in the Quran, vide XVII:1. He also upholds the metaphysical nature of this journey, criticising that modern science tends to study the \\"physical\\" reality, and not spiritual.Perhaps the underlying tone of the book is the constant jihad (exertion) of Muhammad against the heathens of Mecca, against all odds that opens up various levels of meanings to the affairs that seem very mundane in the biographical accounts of his life. Striking symbolism with events are unfolded with the writings of Rumi and Sa'di.The most striking piece is with reference to the last sermon of Muhammad, delivered at Ghadir Khumm, where he exemplifies the \\"universalityy\\" of Islam and her ordainment as a \\"chosen\\" religion by God, vide Quran V:3. He brings to reference a Shi'ite text of the sermon, that characterizes the nomination of 'Ali, as a point of departure between the Shi'ites and the Sunnis over the issue of succession after Muhammads death. He admits that while both Shi'i and Sunni'i attest to the truthfulness and the veracity of the sermon delivered at Ghadir Khumm, proclaiming 'Ali as the 'mawla', they differ on interpration over the word 'mawla'.Lastly, he concludes the title with a section on the relevance of Muhammad's life, his treatment of the Youth and the normativeness of his life, i.e the sunnah, \\"a vast treasury of examples of behaving and acting in various circumstances\\".Before I end it would be worthwhile to comment on his treatment of the Shi'i and Sunni split over the matter of the caliphate. Elsewhere in a book [Shi'a, 10-11, Tabatabai] in the Preface he states: \\"The Sunni-Shi'ite dispute over the successors to the Holy Ptophet could be resolved it it were recognized that in one case there is the question of administering a Divine Law and in the other of also revealing and interpreting its inner mysteries. The very life of Ali and his actions show that he accepted the previous caliphs as understood in the Sunni sense of khalifah (the ruler and the administrator of the Shari'ah) but confined the function of walayat after the Prophet to himself. That is why it is perfectly possible to respect him as a caliph in the Sunni sense and as an Imam in the Shi'ite sense, each in it's own perspective.\\"That title will some day will be a review in iself,Thank you for reading. ..."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"Often my friends ask me why I chose to become a Shia. My answer is very simple, if Quran is a &quot;Perfect&quot; book, then we need a &quot;Perfect&quot; teacher, otherwise Quran by its virtue of being Perfect will become useless and of little practical significance for Moslems. The fact that so many contradictory philosophies had emerged in the history of Islam, all relying on Quran as their primary source, indicates that Quran by itself could not be of much guidance. The fact that Islamic world collapsed, as did Communism, indicates that Quran was not in charge of our mind and lives.Quran is a book of &quot;Light&quot; of &quot;Clear Guidance&quot; and yet Islamic world is so confused and lost. Obviously something is very seriously wrong, and I don't believe it is Quran. Rather it is our approach to Quran is wrong and has been wrong for centuries. Yes, I was a Sunni and I got tired of not knowing what Quran is all about, what is its inner meaning, what is its &quot;True&quot; message. I got tired of hearing all kind of speculations about the True meaning of Quran and knowing all too well that we all just guess and not a single one of us can say for sure what Quran means. Even the most fundamental principles of Quran which Al-Tawhid is a subject of dispute between philosophers, Sufis, theologians, all pointing fingers at each other and blaming each other for having missed the &quot;True&quot; meaning of divine unity. Enough is enough. I thought all this is Prophet's fault. How can he expect us to figure out what Quran is all about? If he did expect us to figure it out, then obviously he was mistaken as centuries of history is a witness.I always thought that Prophet was the only one who knew was Quran was all about, and after his death, Quran too died, or should have died and saved us from so much pain. As long as he was alive, his was the last word, there was no maybe, could be, &quot;God knows best&quot; answers to questions put to him about verses of Quran, there was no uncertainty, no confusion. Only if he could live forever among us. But later I came across some books written by Shia authors, such as Dr. Nasr, and I realized that Prophet did leave us a point of reference someone whose views of Quran wasn't a whole bunch of best guesses. I don't blame Prophet anymore for the mess we are in, or have been in for centuries, I blame us. We did what Jews did to Isa- Jesus- in spite of his greatness, and having been promised by previous Prophets, his people decided to push him aside or attempt to kill him. The fact that history repeats itself was no mystery to me, it was just that I was too arrogant or stupid to see the truth and blamed Prophet of Islam for our misery and confusion instead of blaming ourselves for it.I no longer believe that the &quot;as is&quot; Islam is the Islam that Prophet had in mind. The Islam of Prophet would have brought us Light, Clarity, Guidance, Peace, instead of confusions, darkenss, misery, which finally resulted in a total collapse and to this day we moslems are trying to figure out a way out."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"I respect the Author very much, and I really like this little short book about the Prophet. I also find the comments written about this book equally interesting and enlightening. Unfortunately growing up in Middle East we don't get to question our faith or our understanding of our faith. Only when we leave that environment we get a chance to really reflect about some very fundamental issues about Islam and history. Realizing the collapse of Islamic world, I have often wondered about the truthfulness of Islam, and been struggling with this question for a few years. The usual answer of &quot; America did it&quot; doesn't make it either, at least not for me. Reading the history of Islam I really don't see anything divine about our Islamic empire. Islamic empire was like any other empire, and finally, like any other empire collapsed under its own weight. I cannot see anything divine about it. Sure we made some progresses in Math, astronomy, medicine etc, but so did other empires in the history. We had some ugliness associated with our Islamic Empire and so did other Empires. I see nothing special and divine about the inner workings of our Islamic Empire that could clearly distinguishes us from others in the history. So what difference did Quran make except in uniting us Arabs into one nation, which ended up in creating our Empire? If Quran was supposed to create a Divine Utopia, I have no other choice but to say that Quran has failed in this regard and again this failure can not be blamed on &quot; Amercia&quot; since the history of this failure pre-dates America.It seems to me that Shia philosophy does provide some answer to this question and it makes me wonder. Their &quot;claim&quot; is that it is not Quran that has failed but rather &quot;we&quot; have failed in understanding Quran, it is our understanding of Quran that has failed. I very much like to read more about what Shiism has to say and to my surprise I found out that there aren't many books by Mr. Nasr on Shiism. My question to Mr. Nasr is why doesn't he write about what Shia has to say about Islam. Given the current situation on Islam, and the fact that many people like me are struggling with some serious questions about our faith, I think an alternative way of looking at Islam is a welcome news."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"The book vividly illustrates why the Prophet of Islam continues to influence the world today and into the future, more directly and with more impact than any person in history. Nasr is an inspired writer."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"This little work by Dr. Nasr is an excellent little introduction to the life of the Beloved Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) which concentrates on the spiritual nature of his perfect life. In this manner it is different from most other biographies which concentrate on the political events. This book is important also in that it relays a little of the awe and total respect in which Muslims have traditionally held their Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). Also, though Dr. Nasr, is a Shia he does not allow that to cloud his objectivity.Commenting on one of the earlier reviewers I will say that orthodox Sunnis too believe the Prophet of Islam to be perfect, and infallible and sinless both before the proclamation of Prophethood and after it.This book is a good introduction, especially for younger readers or those who do not have the time to read a longer book."},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"As a person who knew little about Islam before taking a class in college, I thought this book was very interesting. It's short, but it's full of detail!"},{"Title":"Muhammad: Man of God","review":"There exist a great deal of confusion surrounding this historic character, Muhammad. A lot has been said and written. There is a book written in early days of Islam by Ibn Hisham, Sirat al-Nabi, which supposedly gives a good account of Prophet Muhammad.First let me tell you that this book is not a worthy scholarly work whatsoever.The author is clearly obsessed with Islam and the character of prophet Muhammad, so no one who is after reading an objective research should expect an unbiased account being produced by this author. He is as subjective as one could possibly get. What you probably get out of this book is no more than what you would get by going to a mosque in your city and listening to a cheap Mullah. Don't waste your time and money on something that you can get on any Islamic website on the net for free.The best work that I have come across so far is 'Twenty Three years, a study of the prophetic career of Muhammad' authored by Ali Dashti.Ali Dashti neither was an Islam basher nor an Islam-intoxicated like Nasr nor did he have any political motivations. In his work Dashti uses a wide variety of references, starting from Quran itself, Hadiths, and other important Islamic references.First I thought to give the Nasr's two stars, but it isn't really worth it."},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"Lesley Pearse wrote another goody in this story of two sisters. Dulcie Taylor, and May her younger sister were raised in an orphanage by nuns who were as cruel as it gets. They were sent there from the time they were very young because their father murdered their mother and was sent to prison.Dulcie was the more sensitive sister, and May the more charming one, knew how to work the nuns to get her way. When they were sent to Austrailia to another orphanage, knowing it would be better there, it was anything but that. The nuns worked the girls like slaves, and the least little incidents were very severely punished. May was the favored one, but there were secrets there no one knew about until much later.Dulcie found jobs much later when she was old enough to leave the orphanage. She was treated shamefully in her first job as servant to the Masters, and finally after about 2 years could stand it no longer. From there she found a loving family who loved her like one of their daughters. It was at that time she met Ross, a boy who also grew up in an orphanage and was very embittered by that. The two of them got married eventually, but it was not a good thing.Dulcie connects with where May is when a letter arrives. Feeling she must find her sister, she leaves for Sydney, and finds that May has turned to a life of prostitution and stealing, which she had done all along. And another shocking thing was that May had had a baby she couldn't take care of. So when Dulcie finds the terrible state of neglect the child, Noel, was in, she manages to take him into her care. The child's father Rudie gets custody of Noel, and eventually, he and Dulcie fall in love and the chips will fall where they may there.The book is a bit lengthy and has many details. It is impossible to go into each one of them here, so I have mainly summarized the story. It is very worthwhile reading, and Pearse is one of the best!"},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"As I read this wonderful book on my Amazon kindle I kept thinking how near to the truth it was. All along I thought that Bindoon and the notorious Keaney were fictional. Only at the end, reading the Afterword by Bruce Blyth was I made aware that Lesley had used a real place and name. I have read most of her books but found this the best so far. Probably because of the reality, as well as her great story telling. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"I was so impressed and upset by the content of this wonderful saga that I carried out research into the subjects covered, only to find how comprehensive the research by the author has been and indeed how true - shamefully so. The story covers the suffering of children in homes by both nuns and priests and the absolutely uncaring manner in which children were farmed out and exploited, both sexually and as beasts of burden to work in colonies and is soundly based on factual evidence. Excellent reading which you will not want to put down but it may have you in tears."},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"This book was excellent. It's impossible to put down.

I think TRUST ME is probably the best I've read of hers. That's possibly because the storyline is based on fact and somewhat controversial, but at the same time she manages to weave a wonderful human interest story to cover a scandalous topic."},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"The story told by Lesley Pearse holds your attention from start to finish. Although this story is fictitious it is based on fact and the stories of so many \\"orphans\\" sent to Australia. This is an atrocious part of both England and Australia's history and certainly makes you question the actions of the \\"do gooders\\" of that era."},{"Title":"Trust Me","review":"Incredible book. Kept me interested the whole time. Those poor children having to go thru all that trauma. Recommend a must to read."},{"Title":"The Usborne Book of Animal Facts (Usborne Facts & Lists)","review":"As a parent that is constantly looking for ways to make learning fun, I couldn't offer this book a higher rating. My 8 year old and I have read parts of this book every time we visit the doctor's office, and each and every time she asks if we can buy it for her to keep and bring to school for science. She even remembers interesting facts and questions other family members at the dinner table. My mother (her grandmother) has also asked for a copy for the other grandchildren based on my daughters excitement. It also drives my 5 year old crazy that she is just learning to read and can't compete with her sister for family honors at the table. An example is the fact that when babies are born they have over 300 bones, and as they age, some grow together to give an adult a total of 206 bones. The examples are that short and yet that interesting. I admitted to her that I was completely unaware of this and other facts. Buy it, you won't regret the time and fun you can have sharing the facts with your children."},{"Title":"Consolidated tax returns: Current issues, developments and opportunities","review":"The Pupil is interesting as a piece of biography, and as a first-hand account of how an English progressive school operated in the 1930s. Not a great piece of writing, but a valuable piece of documentation."},{"Title":"Business Japan: A Practical Guide to Understanding Japanese Business Culture","review":"When you order this paperback and it arrives you see that it is only 53 pages. Now that may sound like a lot, but some pages have as little as 4 sentences. (Page 18 may have the record with 3 whole sentences on it.) The book is small and the print is very large. The first seven pages are generic introduction about business today without reference to Japan. The has about a dozen phrases in Japanese (goodbye is sayonara). No mention is made of things like gift-giving, how to exchange cards, tact, norms in socializing, when/if to bow, much about proper ettiquete, etc. Other books tout authors that have lived in Japan and worked with the Japanese for many years. Curiously, the bios of these authors make no mention of either having any experience in Japan what-so-ever or even having visited there. I could write this book based on one two-week visit or a quick read of any other book out there.Seven bucks for something anyone visiting Japan could write in a few hours.The other book I got for my visit to Japan (by Rowland) was a dense 300 or so pages with glossary, and dozens and dozens of contacts in Japan and the U.S. and advice on every conceivable subject.I would advice you to get another book. There must be others.I feel incredibly and utterly robbed."},{"Title":"Business Japan: A Practical Guide to Understanding Japanese Business Culture","review":"I am a consultant helping US companies enter the Japanese market. Often, I am asked to recommend a book. This tiny book (paperback - 55 pages!) is one of the best presentations of the crucial cultural differences between Japanese and American business cultures. Its size is perfect for two purposes: slipping into your hip-pocket for quick referencewhile on the road (I can imagine its user excusing himself from a business meeting for a quick reference to the booklet in the bathroom stall: &quot;he closed his eyes and smiled while listening to me! what does it mean?&quot;) and for rote memorization. In fact, memorizing its central chapters (Understanding Japanese Culture, Japanese Business Etiquette, and Japanese Gestures) is probably its best single use. The weakness of the book lies in its brevity: its ratio of meaning to words is very high and there are no illustrations or examples at all, making it very likely that the reader will miss something very important. The best way to deal with this risk, I think, is to read it over and over and to think very intensely about every sentence in those three chapters. Its second shortcoming from the point of view of our visitors is that the book contains no advice on how to enter the market and how to solve practical problems. Why that should be is easy to understand: the books aim is to help dispel misunderstandings and prevent cultural gaffes. And this aim it achieves superbly. At its price the book's well worth every penny."},{"Title":"PENSION FUND POLITICS: THE DANGERS OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING.","review":"I bought \\"Pension Fund Politics\\" in an attempt to balance the views expressed in another purchase, \\"Socially Responsible Investing\\". Balance and revelation are not quite what I found in this little tome. For example, Entine's introductory chapter asks, \\"Should we encourage public pension funds to boycott tobacco companies, natural resource firms that do not embrace global warming initiatives, or firms that utilize genetic engineering in agriculture ... ?\\" Yes. I'd say a pretty clear yes to that.In the second essay, Munnell and Sunden conclude with \\"The primary goal of investing retirement funds ... should be achieving the maximum returns for a given level of risk.\\" According to each of our values, I think these words speak clearly for themselves."},{"Title":"PENSION FUND POLITICS: THE DANGERS OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING.","review":"The idea of corporate executives looting and mishandling pension funds (defined benefit programs) and harming their retiree's sickens all of us. Those that abuse these trusts (sacred trusts, in my book) should be punished. And if the law can't get them, they deserve every bit of public opprobrium we can send their way. However, it is vital to realize that the boardroom is not the only threat to pension fund well being. This book talks about the threat from those who would use the treasury of the funds they have been entrusted to administer for political and social engineering ends; too often at the cost of the people who depend on that money for their retirement.This book consists of four essays; each discussing a different aspect of the ways in which the politicization of the administration and investing of pension funds puts the beneficiaries (actually, owners) of the funds at risk. While the book does not claim that pension funds are currently at risk of failing because of this activity, it does point out the ways in which such activities are costing retirees millions upon millions of dollars. That some claim this is small potatoes compared to the billions under management shows the danger of this collectivist mindset. If those millions are measured against each individual retiree, how many pensions are effectively squandered? That it might be claimed it is only pennies is beside the point. Whose pennies and dollars and tens of millions of dollars are being co-opted to indulge someone else's agenda?The first essay by the editor, Jon Entine, lays out the nature and scope of the problem. While still small, the Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) movement is a disturbing trend. He does point out that that a CalPERS president had to be removed from the board because of his efforts to use the fund's great power to intervene in a dispute between Safeway and the union for which he was also executive director.The second essay describes the different approaches to SRI and its financial realities. The approaches range from screening (hospital worker's funds not investing in tobacco stocks) to activist approaches to management (CalPERS) to transforming the corporation into a social entity with effects on its products and policies. The paper concludes that the amount of SRI is actually quite small and overstated. That its effects in the marketplace are nill and the purported benefits to investors is ambiguous at best. The paper concludes that screening is probably harmless because there are other investors to step in when the SRI fund pulls out. Screening makes sense when the members of the fund are like minded. However, in large funds with very diverse memberships, it is difficult to reconcile such deviations from the fiduciary responsibility maximum returns with such non-financial considerations.The third essay lays out why the growth of these non-financial considerations and approaches threaten the property rights of the beneficiaries of the funds. The sheer volume of the money available attracts those who would use it for their own purposes. The author also compares the fiduciary responsibility required by these property rights versus the purely political Social Security program, which confers no property rights. The federal program versus state laws and regulations are also compared.The fourth essay powerfully pulls together these threads to demonstrate the social agenda of many of these pension boards, how interconnected they are, and exposes their statements of these purposes. The seemingly benign but actually very radical notion of stakeholder ownership of corporations is also discussed. This popular doctrine is gaining ground in developed countries. The threats are not only to pensioners, but to the real owners of the firm, the shareholders, whose property is being disposed of by people who do not share their risk.This is an interesting set of papers that I recommend to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of this additional threat to the pensions of millions of Americans. As an aside, I think this book provides yet another reason to switch to defined contribution plans from these defined benefit programs that are failing at an ever increasing pace for a variety of reasons."},{"Title":"Color Blind","review":"&quot;Color Blind&quot; is the story of Eli Jones, a black man who is a farmer during the Great Depression in Rual Oklahoma.

This book tells a story in an original perspective, one where a black man in a desperate moment after the loss of his wife and child, finds a baby on his doorstep. The baby happens to be a white baby in a small Oklahoma town in the 1930s. Unable to find the parents and with the support of the sheriff, this man raises the child as his own. The story tells the trials and tribulations of raising a child during that period of time and how the color of skin played a part in the lives of these two people and how love overcame it all. It is refreshing to read a book that can strike so many emotions as it is read. This book is a must for readers that are looking for a special story."},{"Title":"Color Blind","review":"This story will move the hardest of hearts.

Who wouldn't like to feel that they were going to be able to find the places that make a city memorable, and that they weren't going to stick out as easy pickings while doing so?These guide books promise, essentially, that you will know what you are doing before you've actually had the experience, removing some of the nasty anxiety of going horribly wrong as you set out to find urban magic. Some of their features are excellent. The hotel section, for instance, is comprehensive and gives several ways of looking for a hotel that might match your needs. Neighborhood overviews are also very fine.HOWEVER! other aspects are both annoying and silly. Addresses are often wrong; hours of operation ditto; information about public transporation is (to be charitable) out-of-date. Nothing quite beats hopping confidently onto a bus with a pocket full of dollar bills, only to discover that busses only accept tokens or quarters.They don't do badly at explaining what attitude you need to take to manage in New York, but neither do they do well. They hint, for example, at the importance of tipping, but do not convey the underlying fact that tipping in NYC is essentially small-time protection money. Not that that's a bad thing. Similarly, restaurant coverage was unimaginative, but maybe there is no way to predict whether a tourist would prefer a very very safe and bland experience, or is more adventurous and would prefer places where the locals eat. Even then, which locals?This book helped us find a hotel that pleased us.

There are a group of about 3-5 texts that are now the most popular for graduate Quantitative Analysis (QA). These include the Swift text (most popular in Europe) at from $40 to $80 US (Quantitative Methods: For Business, Management and Finance), the Render Quantitative Analysis for Management text (Quantitative Analysis for Management (11th Edition)), $175 for the 11th edition, and the very thorough but NOT for self study Anderson text (Quantitative Methods for Business (with Printed Access Card)) for $250.QA is a really tough course for people with less math background such as liberal arts, nursing, etc. students going for an MBA, and a bit easier for math and engineering majors in undergrad, because it involves modeling, using a lot of fairly advanced math. Typical QA courses include linear programming (not really linear, and not really programming-- it is about objectives and constraints stated algebraically to find \\"optimal\\" graphic or corner solutions to problems such as mixing, profit maximization, or cost minimization); queueing problems; statement analysis; Decision analysis; Project Management; Forecasting; Inventory Control; Logistics; Markov Analysis; Stats; Integer/ nonlinear/ goal programming; regression modeling; simulation; probability, and possibly some econometrics. Most grad (MBA) courses don't go as far as differential equation modeling (frequent models in physics, biosciences, ecology, etc).The Swift and Render texts are the most popular, and the Anderson text a distant third according to publisher's (QA!) data on course use and sales. Both Swift and Render are frequently zinged in reviews for broken or less useful software and models, but this is an unfair criticism. Swift gives numerous (although London oriented) model examples, and Render has their own internet models available. The reason both of these criticisms are unfair is that there are numerous plug ins for Excel that do all the analysis, statistics, programming solutions, etc. you will need regardless of which text you use. The Library Picks team chose Render as the top pick, but due to expense, if you're doing self study, Swift is also a good bet.If the included websites, plug ins, templates and downloads aren't working for you from a software/ modeling viewpoint, here is a brief list of outstanding Excel options that will do the same thing, many for free:--Statistical Analysis: Microsoft Excel 2010--Business Analysis: Microsoft Excel 2010 (MrExcel Library)--Predictive Analytics: Microsoft Excel--Microsoft Excel 2010: Data Analysis and Business Modeling--Charts and Graphs: Microsoft Excel 2010 (MrExcel Library)These will take care of the problems metioned by some reviewers that it is hard to stay up to date on models. In particular, Microsoft has now migrated their SQL server business analysis package to a new language called DAX in the FREE Excel plug in PowerPivot. These plug ins, many free on the web, will work perfectly with the examples in Swift and Render so you don't have to sweat the included QA software if it crashes.One caveat: many reviews complain about QA software with \\"bugs\\" when in fact it is the reviewer's computer at fault. To run modern QA programs with lots of modeling, you need a modern dual core processor with at LEAST 8 gig of ram, preferably 12 or 16. The reason for this is that with pipelining, the old \\"math coprocessor\\" hardware has given way to sharing between CPU and GPU for floating point, and recent software-- even SPSS -- will crash older machines or appear to be buggy. Excel with a plug in also is a great answer to this, because you can get away with much less power if your machine is already doing well with Excel. PowerPivot is intensive, but only if you have huge amounts of data. The typical mixing problem is no problem even with a computer that's say, post 2009."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"This text is very well written and is easy to read and understand. I'm definately not a \\"math person\\", but this text begins at such a fundamental level and is so thorough that even I am doing well in my online course."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"Good book. Easy to read and understand. It was a required textbook for Quantitative Methods graduate course. It really helped understand the material."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I had only heard horror stories about this type of class. Either the class isn't as difficult as expected or the book is helping clarify the concepts. I liked the alternate solutions that were explained using Excel QM as well. This class and book brought many new concepts to me that are invaluable in the world of business."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"This text is one I filled with notes and highlights as I made my way through a quantitative analysis course in a project management master's program. I'm not that great at math but still found the subject interesting. If I hadn't had an excellent instructor and team members for our final project it would have been difficult for me.That isn't to say the book isn't well-written. It is. I'm just WAY out of my league on this type of thing. This was for my first class in my master's program and it sure did open my eyes to things managers have to worry about and figure out."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I bought this excellent textbook new at the school bookstore for fifty two dollars in 1990. This was the third edition. I looked at the eleventh edition recently and there were minimal changes. A third author was added and -- since I saw very few significant improvements -- I have no idea what value he is adding to this already excellent textbook. More importantly, Amazon is supposed to be a discount seller, and so I can only imagine what exactly is the school store price of this textbook? The price truly boggles my mind, and my mind was trained in quantitative methods!Look, in 20 years the price inflation rate of this textbook apparently exceeds the official monetary inflation rate of the USA, by a long shot. I am not sure why. Professors who can figure this question out are officially invited to solve this book's pricing question.In summary, I can wholeheartedly recommend this excellent textbook....... but at the price I purchased it in 1990, BEFORE the massive productivity improvements that the USA economy demonstrated since then."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"Good book with interesting information; expected level for Master's class. The main issue I had with the book, was I had to search the publisher's website to verify the correct CD companion. Bought the CD entitled \\"POM-QM for Windows, version 3\\" from Amazon.com,POM-QM for Windows, version 3. Although not required for class, the CD did help completing assignments, so it wasn't a bad investment. However, I wish it was included with the price of the book (which I bought for $186).Pearson Higher Ed also has a useful and free student companion website."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I opted for the Kindle version as I need to travel with my textbooks. In this regard, the Kindle version is an excellent resource for searching, highlighting and portability of course. The content of the book is extensive and will certainly become a reference book for future efforts beyond academics (after finishing my MBA). The information is presented in an easy to understand format, understandably \\"easy\\" is a relative term. However for the amount of information required on this subject this book is very thorough. It provides numerous case studies, references to real-world examples and plenty of chapter review questions."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"Got the book in good time, was in good shape, and definitely save some money so I am happy!"},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I ordered Quantitative Analysis thinking it was new since it was listed as new.

My book looks like someone took the original, and photocopied it in black and white, and then bound it with a glossy cover. Based on the tables in the chapters and break out text boxes, there used to be light coloring or shading. This is not the case in the text book I bought, which has grainy/fuzzy tables that are in shades of black or white, or grey. Overall, I'm not super impressed with the publishing quality based on the price I paid for the book, since it was new.I've never have issues with Amazon before, but I'm disappointed with what I got this time."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I guess they wanted to fit a lot of material into a small book so they made the font tiny. It looks like an 8pt font to me which makes it hard on the eyes after a long period of time.The included software is quite helpful and I recommend having the software open as you read. Personally I found it helpful to use the QM software to do the problems in each chapter as I was reading.None of the math in this book is much beyond algebra but there are a LOT of equations. Heaven help you if you have an instructor that expects you to memorize them all for exams.Also, on mine, they put the cover on backwards. It isn't really a big deal but considering how much I paid for this book I think they should get the cover on correctly."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"Ordered this book from Amazon as new - and did not receive the software. I discovered on day 1 of class that the QM Software is required for class and now I am scrambling and will probably have to buy a legit copy of the book from my college book store at a ridiculous price of almost $300."},{"Title":"Quantitative analysis for management","review":"I ordered the book and it was in pristine condition.

Nothing wrong with the book though."},{"Title":"Silent Missions","review":"READ THIS BOOK!!!...Please.This is the biography of a rags to riches story. No not monetarily, but rich in experiences and wisdom. In the unique position of having fluency in French (Vernon's Dad was an insurance man in France for an English company), Walters was called upon to be the interpreter of many of the giant figures of the mid-twentieth century during the watershed confrontation...World War II. Truman, Eisenhower, De Gaulle are but a few of the people who knew him on a first name basis.Not being the decision maker himself, he bore witness to the decisions and personalities, making his perscective all the more unique. This is, in fact, the perspective the average citizen, like us, might have if ever in such a situation.I had not believed that one man could make a difference in the evolving of events, but after this read, I am sure that one person can. His being by the side of great men allowed him to see what the measure of greatness is. This he confides to us in a well paced, action oriented narrative. I, too, am taken with his humbleness and believe in God. I'm unsure that this generation of leaders has such humility, which is why this read renders some melancholy. Will our leaders measure up to our forebears?To anyone under 40, if you think the most important things that ever happened happened in your lifetime, read this.To anyone over 40, you will recognize all the characters: Truman, the Kennedys, Nixon, Kissinger, Ford, Truman...the list goes on and on.The most profound notion I took away from this read is the idea that the fullness and richness of one's life should not be measured by money. These day, it all too often is. There is no substitute for the wisdom that experience gives you. Vernon Walters never made a higher salary that that of a General. That earns a fair salary, but not putting him in the wealthy or even upper middle class. But he lived as rich and fulfilling a life as any man.BK"},{"Title":"Silent Missions","review":"I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.This book is an almost auto-biography of an american and cold warior, the general Vernon A.

General Walters, who started as a private in WWII, dealt with everyone who was someone during the Cold War: Churchill, De Gaulle, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Adenauer, Mao, Chou, Chiang, Franco, Tito, Castro, Eva Per&oacute;n... the list is endless. Five U.S. Presidents, three Popes, two Generalissimos, several kings and lots of statesmen in between. From Wake to Watergate, he was not only a silent witness but an effective operator. One could say he was the usher of the XXI Century when he entered the Chinese mission in Paris with a secret message from President Nixon. Little did he know how much history he was making.His last chapter is quite moving and foretelling. A must!"},{"Title":"Silent Missions","review":"In his Silent Missions Vernon Walters tells of more than his story and more even than history. He tells what makes history: the right order of devotion, amidst all the competition, allurements and dangerous forces of the world.

Hey it caught me and I'm glad it did. I will not get specific in the actual content as it is my belief that it ruins the book for most. You have to draw your own conclusions!To be honest, I didnt read any of the reviews posted here until after I had finished the novel and I must say I am a bit surprised at some of the comments. I like a book that keeps you going, keeps the plot moving or several in this case all to come together in the last 100 or so pages.The Straw Men is frightening. Not just because of his writing style which is very good or even the content, but the mere fact that the scenarios created could actually be true! The book is graphic and at times I honestly could not believe what I was reading....he never went too far over the edge though and it made me want to turn the page (albeit reluctantly at times)to find out what happens next.I disagree with everyone who said it was a book that made you turn back to figure things out.(ie confusing) I too had to flip back in the book a few times, but welcomed the fact I was reading something that had enough substance to merit the returns. Every time I flipped back I saw something else that helped in my understanding/enjoyment of this novel. I felt compelled to look back at times not to clear up some confusion but to gain some more insight. At the books conclusion, which is outstanding, I went back to the begining to see where in the novel the first mention of \\"The Straw Men\\" was mentioned. (Idol curiosity-p125) I seriously thought about re-reading it now that I had so much insight at its conclusion.Overall an outstanding read! I would recommend it to all, with a caution to some of the content. It is believable! There must be a sequel."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"This is the type of book you will find yourself getting off the phone or turning off the TV for. You will even find yourself trying to sneek a page or two at work.You have no idea where the plot is going, whats going to happen next, or when this collection of pulp fiction style of stories are going to come together. That is why this is a must read. Please, read it now!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I bought this book because of Stephen King's recommendation on the front cover and I am very glad that I did.

Some conventional twists are thrown in, most work and some are done like never before. A good one.Action on par with the best."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Mr. Marshall tells an enthralling story about seemingly unrelated and violent random events that become entertwined through good plot twists and great character definitions. This is a great book if you like conspiracy theory meets psychosis kind of fiction. I, personally, do. Besides the characters which I felt were well done, if slightly stereotypical, the plot of this book kept me guessing. I couldn't figure it out. I was very excited when I realized the bigger picture this book shows to the reader piece by piece. I really didn't want to stop reading until I was through.Of course there are downsides to the book. Among these are the disjointed way that the writer changes point of view. Many times I found myself having to reread sections to figure out what I had missed. I also found some of the dialogue to be a little too tongue-in-cheek. Sometimes the witty banter between the two main characters overshadowed the excellent story line and sometimes simply annoyed. Finally, I didn't like the ending the reader was left with, although I would be hard-pressed to suggest any alternatives.Overall, I recommend this book for an interesting read -- whether you're on the beach or just needing a little escapism at home. I also think it would make a great film. I kept visualizing what actors would play the characters. I'd certainly go see it."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I picked STRAW MEN up on a lark, and I'm glad I did. This is a \\"thinking man's\\" thriller, with prose of astonishingly high quality.I agree with one of the prior reviewers that there are many sentences in this novel that you re-read, simply to enjoy the high caliber of the writing. Marshall is a very philosophical type of writer, and his prose offers many insightful ruminations about the nature of life, aging, and other deep subjects. This is the type of book where the author will stop the story to spend a few pages making some social observations. I found much of them to be funny and enjoyable -- perhaps the best aspect of the book.That being said, the plotting in STRAW MEN could have been a little better. This is a relatively slow paced book, burdened by excessive description and commentary by the author. If you're looking for a scary thriller with lots of action, this probably won't satisfy you. This is more of an atmospheric thriller, where the story takes a back seat to the writing itself. It is ultimately a very literary sort of book.Still, STRAW MEN is highly enjoyable for what it is. Also, just for the record, this is not a \\"debut\\" novel, but is a novel written under a pseudonym by Michael Marshall Smith, who has written several bestselling science fiction novels in Great Britain. Regardless of this fact, this book is a terrific read and I heartily recommend it for fans of good writing."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Wow!! I am not sure where to start. This book has a little of everything: suspense, drama, humor, horror, you name it, you can probably find it somewhere within its' 389 pages. This is the type of book that truly grabs you and holds on tight, long after the last page is turned.I don't want to spoil anything for you and you are capable of reading the back of the book yourself, but let me take a moment to say that Marshall has written as close to a perfect work of fiction as I have ever read. The characters are alive, warm, wonderful, hateful, believable... all that AND a bag of chips!!There is more than one plot taking place here, Ward is trying to make sense of his parents death, which is further complicated by a note and some video he stumbles upon in their home. A young girl is kidnapped right off a busy street and held hostage in a most horrible fashion, and somehow, all of this is related.Buy this book, borrow this book, steal this book.....just whatever you do, READ this book. You won't be disappointed. There is a sequel to this book that I have already purchased!!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I just finished this book this morning and enjoyed it immensely. The Straw Men are literally the most frightening and evil people in modern suspense novels. The idea of organized mass murderers is sadly not quite as unbelievable in the aftermath of September 11. I won't give away much more than to say that there is one twist and turn after another, shocking revelations and the ending is left open to make a sequel. Hopefully, there will be one.So why the four stars? Most people might disagree but the main character, Ward, was unsympathetic. He made constant insults about almost every human being he saw which would be the last thing I would do if I was mourning the death of my parents even if they were estranged. The social commentary is sometimes dead on, but abrasive and it detracted some of the enjoyment for me. It came across kind of smart mouthed which nearly made me put down the book. Towards the end, I was glad I stayed because I started to like Ward a little more. A friend of mine hated this book because of that.Other than that, its worth a read and if you are a real cynic, you will probably come away with a different opinion. I still gave it four stars due to its intense and unstoppable action. A great book, a little flawed but worth your time. Almost a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"It took me a while to get into this book, maybe 80 pages or so. The story picked up and held my attention and then bam!....it switches off to something or someone else before I even knew what hit me.

This book won't get recommended to my large group of reading friends."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"very good. hes up there with stephen king and dean kootz.will be getting more of his books. hard to put the books down."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Because from start to finish this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. One extremely freaky book, a secret society of people who do what they want, when they want, how they want and with whom ever they want. No one but themselves know they exist, and of course they're fingers reach into everything. But the worst one of the bunch just so happens to be our lead character's brother. His twin brother. More scary and disturbing than any horror book (though not really a horror novel) I ever read, and why? Because it deals with a tangible issue, and one that was happened in the past and occurs everyday, though maybe not so organized. This group will make the Nazis seem like pansey's. You'll be begging to know just who the Straw Men are what they've done. Though if you want to the whole story you'll have to read the sequel, Upright Man."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I didn't expect much from this paperback; as a rule I avoid modern novels and stick to non-fiction. But several people whose opinion I trust advised me to give the book a try, and I'm glad I did.First, Marshall is a seriously good writer. Not great, but good. His prose has muscle and style, which is more than you can say for about 95% of the other writers at work today. Second, he has a feel for character -- Ward Hopkins and his companion Bobby are especially well-drawn.That said, the book has some weaknesses, the worst of which is overplotting. Marshall wants everything to be tied up in a neat little bow, and he telegraphs his intentions from a mile off. The motivations of his characters are also often murky; I didn't always buy the actions of Nina Baynam, for example. She seemed to do things only to service the plot, not from any inner compulsion or desire.Also, the switching between first and third-person narrative was clumsy. I hope Marshall avoids that in the follow-on book.The ending was compromised badly by Marshall's desire to write a sequel. After many harrowing adventures, things just...peter out. Nothing is really resolved. It's meant to whet our appetites for the sequel, I know, but I found it irritating."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Michael Marshall's \\"The Straw Men\\" has some interesting elements but as a whole is not as captivating as one would hope from a mainstream thriller. It does not know if it is a plot driven thrill ride or an exploration of what people are capable of doing to each other.The novel tracks two different story lines that converge about through the book and then ride together to deliver the climax. Ward Hopkins, estranged from his family comes to Montana to clean up the estate of his parents who have been killed in a car crash. But are they really dead? At the same time a serial killer, The Upright Man, re-appears after dormancy and is tracked by an ex CIA agent Zandt and his ex-partner Nina.The book begins promising, and Michael Marshall has some keen observations on the evolution of evil in society and the unpredictability of individuals. The main theme is the old clich&eacute; that you never know what is in an individual's heart and the cruelty humans are capable of to fulfill selfish desires. \\"They came in all shapes, sizes, and types. Some were monstrous, others were fairly decent individuals - aside, that is, from the propensity to kill other people and ruin the lives of those who had loved them\\".The problem is that Marshall's observations, however insightful, are delivered within a few sentences and then not built upon. I would have been much more interested if one of these observations were explored deeper. Instead you are left with a few thought provoking ideas inserted into a story that is more concerned with moving a convoluted plot forward. Unfortunately the plot is not at all convincing. There are a lot of plot conveniences and the revelations are a bit ridiculousThe Straw Men certainly has elements that prove Michael Marshall is (or is developing into) a decent author with a very nice writing style. However, the novel is tedious and not very believable, even as you suspend your disbelief and try to enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I wanted very much to believe the Stephen King blurb on the front cover, and for the first 100 pages or so I found _The Straw Men_ to live up to its billing. Initially I found it stylish, smart and creepy-- exactly the feeling you want to have from this sort of read.Unfortunately, Marshall wasn't able to tie it all together at the end in a way that's at all satsisfying (at least not satisfying for me). In order to get the explanation he needs to end the book it felt as though he really had to torture the plot. I got confused initially, and finally ended up annoyed.Enough promise to read more by the same author, but this book isn't all that it could have been."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"One thing is absolutely certain about Michael Marshall's novel \\"The Straw Men\\": once you begin reading this suspenseful psychological thriller, you will not be able to put it down. Job, school, and family all fade into insignificance with the turn of a page in this awesome novel. Even categorizing \\"The Straw Men\\" as a suspense novel probably does not do it justice, as Marshall throws in copious amounts of horror and action to make a pungent stew that will have your stomach churning and your pulse racing. Books such as this make surfing the Internet worthwhile because that is how I stumbled over this little known, downbeat novel.Marshall begins his dismal story by telling us about three seemingly unrelated events. The first occurs at a fast food restaurant out in the sticks, where two heavily armed thugs mow down dozens of people in cold blood. The second incident takes place in Montana, when Ward Hopkins returns home to wrap up things after his parents die in an auto accident. A note found in his father's favorite easy chair leads Ward to believe that his parents are not dead, sending Ward on a convoluted investigation that casts doubt on his own life as well as the lives of his parents. The third situation deals with the abduction of a teenage girl in California by a sicko known as \\"The Upright Man.\\" In a writing style that is both smooth and taut, Marshall brings all of these disparate elements together as the reader discovers the shrieking terror of the Straw Men's underground world.As the madness unfolds, Marshall introduces us to his characters. There is Ward Hopkins, a former CIA employee drifting through life until he receives word of the death of his parents. When Ward finds a strange video in his late father's house, he brings in Bobby Nygard. Nygard is an agency spook with intimate knowledge about the Internet, firearms, and an ability to find people. Together Ward and Bobby attempt to track down a shadowy group known as the Straw Men. Their efforts uncover terrible secrets, trigger-happy people anxious to kill them, and enough twists and turns to make an ice skater dizzy.As the tale progresses, Ward and Bobby run into FBI agent named Nina and former Los Angeles homicide detective John Zandt. Zandt and Nina are investigating the disappearance of Sarah Becker, a young girl abducted in California by a serial killer who escaped the clutches of Zandt years before. Known as \\"The Upright Man,\\" this killer likes to abduct girls and then leave a sweater on the doorsteps of the missing girl's family. The killer weaves the names of his victims into the sweaters with human hair. The four realize they are working on the same case from different angles and decide to team up, resulting in an explosive showdown loaded with violent death and the answers to some ominous secrets.The pacing in this book is phenomenal. Marshall bounces back and forth from unfolding horror to fast paced action with little difficulty. Repeatedly, the author delivers shock after shock to the unsuspecting reader. Most effective is how Marshall makes you sympathize with Ward Hopkins. Ward really is not the nicest guy in the world; he is self-serving, slightly corrupt, and narcissistic. But when the chips are down, he never backs away from a fight and follows leads with the tenacity of a bulldog. Marshall brings Ward to life by using narrative in the first person to tell Hopkins's story. Ward as a character works so well that the Nina/Zandt storyline seems less interesting by comparison.The conclusion to the story is ambiguous, but does not detract in any way from the enjoyment of getting there. \\"The Straw Men\\" is an immensely enjoyable read, with enough bloody violence to draw in the horror fan without sacrificing a detailed plot that suspense and mystery readers always enjoy so much. I am hoping to see another suspense thriller from Michael Marshall; he has a real flair for the written language and a sharp eye for detail. \\"The Straw Men\\" is an early pick for my favorite mass-market paperback of 2003."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"The beginning of THE STRAW MEN opens with an intriguing mix of events: in a variation of the Happy Meal, two gunmen methodically mow down eighty-nine (you must be kidding!) lunchtime customers in a backwater McDonald's; a man returning from his parents' funeral finds a note in his father's handwriting that says, \\"We're not dead\\"; a young girl is abducted from a shopping promenade in full view of customers inside a B&N; bookstore. (Well, I can understand the last. When I'm browsing in a bookseller and totally focused, Bin Laden himself could charge down the street on a camel firing his AK-47 and I wouldn't notice.) I looked forward to a clever and entertaining connection between these disparate events. But, alas!The \\"men\\" in the title is misleading. There's really only one villain of consequence, The Upright Man, who remains a relatively nebulous figure to the end. There are two principle good guys in the story, John Zandt, an ex-LAPD homicide cop whose life was ruined when his own daughter was abducted and never recovered, and Ward Hopkins, an ex-CIA employee who resigned before his financial misconduct on the job could be discovered. It was Ward's parents who'd ostensibly died, killed in a highway accident. Both John and Ward have sidekicks, the former an FBI agent in official disfavor named Nina whose only claim to notoriety seems to be that she once had an affair with John, and the latter a wise-cracking buddy named Bobby still with the CIA. What a motley group! None of the four had attractive enough personalities to engage this reader's sympathies. One of the two pairs should have been perhaps edited out to yield a tighter storyline.For me, the biggest problem with THE STRAW MEN was a largely incomprehensible plot. The motive for all the evildoing revolves around some murky theory that what is called \\"civilization\\" is but symptomatic of a virus infecting the human genome, and to kill is to be truly free. (Gee, and I thought society's ills are caused by excess fast food consumption. Well, golly, I'm going out for a triple cheeseburger after I finish here.) In any case, the fuzziness of the whole concept culminates in a muddled ending that's both unsatisfying and the apparent basis for a sequel in which (at least) Ward continues to battle a nefarious conspiracy. What nobody told the author, however, is that a follow-up book requires the first offering to be at least above average. For me, THE STRAW MEN isn't, and I'll not pour any more money down this black hole."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"A really good story, although I was a little perplexed at the ending.Reads really quickly though, and pulls you right into the mysteries of what's going on.Great for those who love a good thriller!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"THE STRAW MEN plays out like a dream-team collaboration by Stephen King (who hailed the book a masterpiece), Dean Koontz, Thomas Harris, and Michael Slade. Deliriously paranoid, lightning paced, crammed with surprise and invention, action and terror, humor and heartbreak, this is the kind of book that lesser writers will envy and everyone else will just admire to no end. And the happiest part? The formidable Mr. Marshall is clearly here to stay, as evidenced by the recent release of a sequel to this book, entitled THE UPRIGHT MAN. Discover this guy as soon as you can - once everybody is reading him and hit movies are being made from these books, it's sure gonna be fun to be able to say &quot;Oh, yeah, I've been reading him from the beginning!&quot;"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Excellent read. The Straw Men has it all. Intriguing main characters, compelling plot, and mind-blowing plot twists. I have no idea why others hated it. I guess there's no in-between. I would highly recommend The Straw Men. I cant wait for the follow up novel."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"In reading a review of \\"The Straw Men,\\" I found out that Michael Marshall has also written under the name of Michael Marshall Smith, and \\"One of Us\\" was his. Wow...has he EVER come far!\\"The Straw Men\\" is one of those books you can't put down. Marshall creates a web of mystery and terror that has long been missing from recent thrillers. His mastery of the English language is awesome, and his use of both the first person and third person works beautifully, and he is to be commended for pulling it off so well.The heroes are all well-written and not without their flaws. Wade, Bobby, John and Nina are all flesh and blood humans, with dark secrets, hurts, and fears. The villains, of which there are many, are surprising and unrelentlessly wicked.The book has a lot of stuff going on, and if there is a tendency to get a little confused, it merely adds to the emotional impact of the book.The plight of fourteen year old Sarah Becker is well-developed and one can't help but empathize with this poor girl in her terrible situation. Although there are obvious hints to the true identity of the main villain, The Upright Man, his identity still comes as quite a shock, and the \\"resolution\\" of the novel is frightening in its implications. I sincerely hope Mr. Marshall plans on a sequel...this is great stuff.HIGHLY AND UNRESERVEDLY RECOMMENDED.ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Out of books and unsure of what direction to go in while choosing a new one, I grabbed this book based on the intriguing synopsis as well as the cover art which I found to be mysterious. I agree, not great reasons to buy a book, but I don't regret it.One thing lacking in todays literary wasteland of consumer oriented fluff and knock off thrillers is the skill of being able to turn a word. Michael Marshall has that knack. He is able to write sentences that, on thier own, are interesting and worth a second read. I found myself continuously re-reading certain sentences or paragraphs, fascinated at Mr. Marshall's take on a certain subject or situation.Though this book is very well written with a strong sense of how to write a compelling sentence, it is not without its faults. The plot can be a bit muddy and then too easily cleared, the switching between the first and third person is an interesting literary trick, but executed in a way I found confusing until the last part of the book when events helped the reader understand why it was written that way. Maybe a pointer earlier on would have helped.This book sets itself apart from the sludge being published by the corporate entities of Koontz and King by challenging your mind to think about the words and what they mean outside of the obvious being described in the story. Though a highly commercial story, obviously geared toward selling movie rights, Michael Marshall cannot hide the fact that he has the ability to turn a word. I look forward to his future work with the hope that with success comes the ability to free his writing from the commercial underbelly of publishing."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Who are the Straw Men? Are they real, or myth? How do the three storylines twisting through this book connect? What did it mean when the dad on the video asked his baby, \\"What will you become?\\" Who is the girl in the floor, and why is she there? Can an ex-cop and an FBI dame resolve their relationship issues long enough to get a bead on a Hollywood kidnapper?I loved this book, and was drawn in to the narrative fully. I loved the part where the protagonist waxes poetic on why there should be geriatric gang members trolling the malls of America. I recommend this to any fan of thrillers, and look forward to treading the sequel."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"This book is a pure, white-knuckle, fast paced, thriller. It has a very dark and paranoid feel to it. I loved it and have read it twice now. The sequel \\"The upright man\\" was not nearley as good but had the same dark feel to it. The last in the trilogy \\"Blood of angels\\" is better but doesn't quite live up to the original. I suggest if you read this book (and I really suggest you do!) than prepare to read the other two because you wont be able to stay away from Michale Marshall's dark,twisted, creepy and paranoid veiw of the world!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I started reading this book because it was the only one in the house I hadn't yet read.

It's a shame more people haven't heard of him or more importantly, his book, The Straw Men, which is really more like two books in one.

Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"It's not often these days that a book can genuinely frighten a voracious and jaded reader like yours truly, but this book gave me the heebie-jeebies. There may not be anything revolutionary in the central conceits of this novel, but the execution is sterling. The characters feel real and the dialogue is never forced or trite. The real accomplishment however, is the mounting dread which builds regarding who and what &quot;The Straw Men&quot; really are or might be. There is a scene set in the house of the main protagonist's dead parents in which an old video tape is viewed and the internet history of a home computer is investigated with unsettling results. Nary a drop of blood is spilled nor a smidgen of gore spattered, but...Yikes!! A darn good read."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I really liked the idea of this book, and it is much better written than the average, so much that I think it leans more toward Stephen King than Lee Childs. However, like a Jack Reacher novel from Lee Childs, it's a mild mystery with a lot of action and exploration of interesting circumstances. The plot itself becomes apparent after the first third of the book, at which point it detours from X-Files/Stephen King supernatural scariness into the more literal fiction of Lee Childs, where a social phenomena is made into a tangible, shadowy, micro-conspiracy that then needs destruction by brave heroes. Like many books, the last third is where the author loses his nerve and gets too linear in his writing and also too vague, as he tries to massage together loose ends. I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but found the conspiracy of an overdone archetype, and finished reading without any real sense of mystery."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"This is a good debut novel by the writer and will satisfy the reader if one is willing to overlook certain issues that were noticed by this reader. The character development leaves much to be deired as the featured members in this novel seem to lack depth. The story is a good one with the writer crafting three stories that seem to be divergent into one as this story develops. Unfortunately, the stories do not converge into a solid story until one has completed nearly one fourth of this book and makes for a somewhat confusing and tedious read. The story finally does take off into a good read for the second and third quarter of the work. When the writer brings everything together in the last fourth of the work, the reader is left with a story that is so unrealistic that it detracts from the earlier writing that has been done. The book is fair and this writer shows some positive flashes, yet nothing really special."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Wow, this is a pretty weird book. Nothing too sick, but just enough character development to keep you interested.

Surprising twists left me hoping for the next book. His writing style is witty and sharp. Great book to take to the beach."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I picked up this book as an advance copy at the store I work at, and I could not put it down. I felt that the story was very well thought out, though it couldve used more description, it was a well written book. It is slightly reminiscent of early Dean Koontz works. Based on that, I have personally sold about 25 copies of this book in the 2 months it has been out, and have not had a complaint yet."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Great concept, well put together and explores some interesting issues. But, unfortunately, I have to say it is certainly not on a par with his previous novels: Only Forward, Spares, One of Us and, if you like scary stuff, his book of short stories: What You Make It. I almost get the impression it was written with the intention to get it on to the big screen. (I am sure it'll make a great movie).We still love you Mikey."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"It is rare that you find a passage in any book depicting a funeral service and burial that causes one to howl with laughter. However, Michael Marshall pulled this feat off so smoothly with a sprinkling of cynical and hilarious lines that reflected the thoughts of surviving Ward Hopkins as he endured the service. I was reduced to the state of being in stitches during the death of one of the major character's parents. Of all things! Yet I felt not a twinge of shame.Pretty masterful stuff and an indication that Michael Marshall has not completed his journey of seeking his rightful place in literary best-sellership. However, he has far to go. The Straw Men was definitely a good read but it was marred hopelessly by overstated righteous indignation on the parts of the good guys. Sadly, the Straw Men finally dies on its own sword -- the author's excessive proselytizing about the decayed state of today's world. Snore!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Michael Marshall, The Straw Men (Jove, 2002)Okay, let me get the bad out of the way first: there's a plot hole in this book big enough to build a development full of multi-million-dollar homes in. And it's been gnawing at me ever since I realized it. But I can't dock the book any stars, because in every other respect, The Straw Men is just about the perfect thriller, a book that grabs hold early on and refuses to let go. (I read the bulk of it, excepting twenty pages in the beginning and twenty pages at the end, in a single day, dropping everything else I'm reading to do so.)The story centers on Ward Hopkins, whom we meet just after the death of his parents in a car accident. He heads to their house in the small town of Dyersburg, Montana to put his life-- and their lives-- in order. Everything changes when he finds a note that says \\"Ward, we're not dead.\\", and he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy in which his parents may, or may not, have played a part. Meanwhile, in California, and FBI agent and a grizzled ex-cop are hunting a serial abductor of middle-class teenage girls who's just taken another one-- one who still may be alive.Once you've got your mind around everything and you get to know enough of how Marshall foreshadows his twists and turns, the end becomes obvious, but this isn't a mystery novel, it's an action thriller. The point isn't whodunit, but whether the good guys will find the bad guy before something very bad happens to the victim. That's where the thrill ride comes in. And Marshall nails that aspect, keeping the pace frantic, the humor with the odor of the gallows, and his descriptions absolutely top-class for a novel of this kind. I was very impressed with this, and have just now found out it's a trilogy, so I'll be getting to the other two books ASAP. Great stuff. If you're a thriller fan, Marshall is one to check out. ****"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Despite what this book might tell you, it is not the first work of Michael Marshall. Look for his other three novels under the name of Michael Marshall Smith which included, &quot;Only Forward&quot;, &quot;Spares&quot; and &quot;One Of Us&quot;. Those books have a very sci-fi, Douglas Adams, type feel tot hem while &quot;The Straw Men&quot; has a lot more of a horror slant. It takes a little bit to get running and could have benefited from being a little longer so some of the explanations could have been more detailed. Also the switch from first to third person when jumping from character to character was a bit jarring. That said, the novel is a brilliant work, truly scary with a sharp sense of humor that you will not expect."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Well crafted and written with a sense of style and humor. If the narrative throws you you might be better off sticking to books that requires the assistance of crayolas. I am looking forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"The Straw Men by Mike MarshallTwo men walk into a McDonald's in Pennsylvania and kill dozens of people with automatic weapons. A youth walks into a school and kills over a dozen classmates and faculty with a similar weapon. A man in England goes berserk and kills dozens. Sound like your typical latter-day headlines? They are but they're incidents in Mike Marshall's timely debut novel, The Straw Men, a story about an international cabal of mass murderers led by a serial killer self-named The Upright Man.This premise was used to lesser effect in the Sylvester Stallone thriller COBRA and is therefore not a new one. However, an intriguing storyline adds heft and some coherency to this novel, one in which two widely divergent storylines are finally united in the thrilling climax.Former CIA analyst and professional slacker Ward Hopkins returns to his hometown in Dyersburg, Montana after the abrupt and violent death of his parents. Ward finds a note in his father's chair containing the short but cryptic message: \\"We're not dead.\\" Upon further discovering a videotape made by his father, he begins to investigate his parents' deaths and immediately comes up against stiff resistance from a shadowy faction that is concentrated in the ultra-exclusive housing development known only as The Halls.Meanwhile, former LAPD homicide detective John Zandt is called out of retirement by FBI agent Nina Baynam, with whom he'd had an affair after Zandt's own daughter was abducted and presumably murdered by the Upright Man. Another girl, Sarah Becker, has been snatched from a mall in California and all the clues point to the fact that the Upright Man is back in action.Marshall, in my opinion, took too long in finally intertwining these two different storylines, in which Zandt and the underachieving Hopkins, aided by Ward's close friend, CIA operative Bobby, attempt to take down the man or men responsible. Marshall's characterization is vivid and his dark humor is only slightly less sharp than that of a John Connolly. The Upright Man, a keen student of paleontology, hence the moniker, is until the end someone only seen in glimpses through the eyes of his latest abduction, the fourteen-year-old Sarah Becker, whom he keeps hidden and trapped under his floorboards, one of which created entirely out of matchsticks struck by other people and varnished until it matched the real ones. Such patience and deliberation, in artificially crafting something more easily made through mass production, is one of the most chilling facets I've ever read of a serial killer's psyche.This book cries out for a sequel and those who have read it will see why. It is an intriguing study in duality, with the timely message that perhaps the random acts of violence that make the headlines virtually every day are perhaps not so random, after all."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"In a fast-food restaurant in the midst of Nowhere, USA, things seem gripped with the normality of people burrowing into their daily grinds. Some are locals and others tourists, some reserved and some rather talkative, but all have one thing in common. They, by some misfortune birthed by Nokkon Wod, are at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two gunmen enter, spraying the place with weapon fire, killing more than sixty percent of the people inside and nobody is the wiser as to why. Outside of a bookstore where a teenage girl is supposed to be meeting a friend, she runs into a stranger that she's never met with one thing in common with her; a love for England. Despite being 14 and knowing better, she converses for a few moments and then, in a burst of events that go from somewhat frightening to downright tragic, disappears in almost plain sight. Credit goes to a serial killer, The Upright Man, for yet another horrific deed. A man who has just seen his parents killed in a car wreck and is buried in a cemetery of internal grief goes to their home to mourn. While there, he finds a book with a note stuck in it that states, in his father's handwriting, \\"We're not Dead.\\" In many ways these events seem to all be disconnected from the other but, as our main characters soon find out, they all link to people that simply call themselves The Straw Men.Much to Michael Marshall's credit, he knows how to detail characters and the world around them with illustrate terminology that is, in a word, refreshing. His use of descriptiveness is so vivid and crisp that it painted everything transpiring with such clarity, keeping pace with the tones of both events happening and the madness floating through many of the character's minds. At first the book seemed to have more than one storyline running through it that made it seem a little confusing, with the tale of Ward (who lovingly found the hidden note) trying to find out what has happened to his parents and two individuals - an ex-cop and an agent - trying to apprehend The Upright Man. Sometimes this seemed a bit claustrophobic and threw the pace off a bit, pushing you from the subjects you've just delved deeply into and switching gears to another focal point. It all starts to make sense after a time, though, and the connectiveness drawing the two seemingly unrelated events together is interesting to watch develop. Added to this is the fact that The Straw Men and The Upright Man were well written and a bit on the depraved side of the spectrum, always throwing problems into the fray and making the read an entertaining one to work through.For an author's first work, I'd have to call this a masterful one and worthy of recommendation to anyone interested in the exploration of the depraved side of life. It does have a few scene in it that might be a tad on the graphic side, but these are few and placed well, and some of the ideology presented might find some viewers offended by such notions. Still, in the world of serial killers and mass murders, I suppose this reaction would be the one that is being tried for and grasped onto well. It works as a chase, throwing characters a little cat-and-mouse in the toyland of sensation, and comes highly recommended for those who want something dark to coat their mental corridors with."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"This was my first experience reading a title by Michael Marshall, but it won't be my last. I heard about \\"The Straw Men\\" while reading the dust jacket for Marshall's new title, \\"The Intruders\\", and was intrigued due to the fact that my favorite author, one Mr. King, called it \\"scary as hell\\". If you're looking for monsters or ghosts or demons, you won't find them here. The monsters in this one are the ones are the most dangerous ones of all; the human ones. Marshall creates an intricate plot, develops great characters, and leaves you thinking. Could this really happen? In today's world, I would unfortunately have to say yes. Ward is an awesome character and one that grows on you as the book progresses. The same is true with Zandt. I did wish that Zandt had been even more developed, but to my delight, Marshall did leave this book open ended, and I found that \\"The Straw Men\\" is book one in a trilogy. Believe me, I will read them, and I hope to enjoy them as much as \\"The Straw Men\\". And for those out there who haven't read book one, do so. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Here's what Stephen King had to say about Michael Marshall's The Straw Men:\\"Just when you think there's nothing new in the world of the suspense novel, along comes one hell of a nasty spider called The Straw Men. It's brilliantly written and scary as hell.\\"Agreed. Marshall (a.k.a. Michael Marshall Smith, author of Spares, One of Us and Only Forward) really delivers in this tale of paranoia and despair, told, until late in the novel, on two parallel tracks, one dealing with the LAPD Homicide Detective John Zandt's hunt for The Upright Man, a serial killer who taunts the authorities with a unique calling card, the other with ex-CIA agent Ward Hopkins' search for the truth behind his parents' untimely death. Their independent investigations lead to discoveries that rock both their worlds.Besides providing plenty of fast paced, top-notch suspense, Marshall also dishes out plenty of droll humor, as when Hopkins reflects on an aging population:\\"I don't find it surprising that super old people are so odd and grumpy...I don't blame them for being out of sorts. I'm just surprised that they don't take to the streets in packs, swearing and raising hell and getting drunk. With demographics going the way they are, maybe that's going to be the next big thing. Gangs of octogenarians, taking drugs and running amok. Though walking amok is most likely, I guess-with maybe an hour of dozing amok in the afternoon.\\"The book's full of unconventional observations like this, expertly interspersed with the grim discoveries Zandt and Hopkins make along the way. Besides provoking laughter, they also provide insights into the minds of Marshall's offbeat protagonists, insight that proves useful once the **** really hits the fan late in the novel."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Whilst King continues his genteel slide into overwriting (Someone should be brave enough edit his books, for goodness sakes: If only Insomnia had lived up its title) and Koontz grows ever more smug, we genre-lovers need another generation of thriller writers who are both good plotters and inspired wordsmiths. And in Michael Marshall, whoever he is, we might, just might, have found one.Firstly, he is fresh and funny about little everyday things, like a good stand-up comedian. Art from classical naked-lady statues to Duchamp's urinal to some indi movies, is all about making you look at familiar things twice, and he succeeds in that.Secondly, he is an ambitious and surprising plotter, not above melodrama admittedly, not entirely plausable in this book when you allow the heat to cool, but well ahead of the wannabe pack. You went along for the ride, and, unlike after so many books and films, did not feel cheated at the end.Publishers, like Hollywood film-makers, love franchises, so maybe there are another two books out there to wrap up the dangly bits of the plot. If so, and if MM half-succeeds in this daunting task (stamina, MM, stamina!) , this is an author, one of very few, that I would buy in hardback. And given the price of hardbacks, even on Amazon, I cannot give higher praise than that."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"i was amazed at the skill of this author. he builds a tale that captures your attention completely. the characters jump out of the pages to you. this is a complex tale that is totally coherent. so glad i discovered this writer."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"If you are a fan of John Connelly, then I would recommend this book.

I have now read two of the series and waiting for the 3rd installment. I like this author alot."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"This book flips between two different storylines which appear to be completely unrelated. These dragged out way too long. Eventually they intertwine but I felt the connection to be too contrived and implausible. Just never connected to the story and honestly glad when it ended."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"It could have been an interesting read, a gripping story and even a terrific movie script. But Micheal Marshalls writing leaves quite a bit to be desired. If you are used to reading \\"fast reads\\" and Stephen King, so be it, you'll probably like this kind of tripe. But even Stephen keeps his political commentary to a minimum and stays on track.If Mr. Marshall would have kept the narration in the first person - or just stuck with one POV throughout - I'd have really liked this book much better He switches tacts at least 4 times, and that really starts to make things confusing. As well, there are too many \\"quick fixes\\" to his plot line which make the seemingly two seperate story lines come together rather conveniantly.The completely unnatural dialog is laughable in places, nearly sounding like a bad Japanese re-write for American cinema. Examples:\\"That's the web for you, a deaf and dumb oracle with amnesia\\"\\"I feel negative, good thing I've got a happy android for company. But if you use that voice again and I'm going to knife you\\"\\"I think now would be a good time to blow Dodge\\"and on and on.He tries hard to save the book with gratuitous violence which seems to serve no purpose other than make an OK story seem bigger than life and also tends to ramble on (through the character's voices, of course) about humanity, the human condition, America, society, et al. It just gets old and also gets in the way of the story.The epilogue is just about the worst part, a 5-page rambling that could have easily been boiled down to 2.A good book for the 20-something crowd, but seasoned readers will find too many similarities to X-files and other TV-genre pulp. Is Mr. Marshall aiming at Hollywood? Perhaps, but in the end, (and unlike many other reviewers here) I found this not to be a page-turner, but a slow read that I slogged through just to say I finished it. Guess I'm just that kind of guy, I want my money's worth. As I turned the last page I felt pretty ripped off, however."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I'm a lover of good writing and good thrillers in particular. This book is well written, however I found it sickening in its relish for brutal, evil violence, particularly to young children. Especially if you are a parent I strongly consider giving this book a miss. I bought it on the basis of exceptional reviews. I was not, however, prepared to read its content and have since removed it from my library."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I read this book because Stephen King called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. I soon came to realize that Mr. King probably read something else, or his brief review was taken way out of context. The author has tremendous potential as a writer, and he uses language in interesting ways, but he's no storyteller. This book is three times longer than it should be because long passages of useless gibberish fill the page rather than advancing the story. And the finale is disappointing. Moreover, I'm not sure he knows anything about cops, or CIA, or lawyers.This book could have been a raucous good read, but it wants a good editing, first. Mr. Marshall is about two books and a good editor away from becoming a an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"\\"The Straw Men\\" 's strong beginning, with keen observations on our relationships with long lost friends and relatives and good commentary on society, is left almost forgotten by the time the final page is read.Our first protagonist's (Ward Hopkins) regrets about not fully knowing his parents is right-on and--as with the whole book--is well-written. His search for his mother and father is the best of the three concurrent stories that eventually come together in the last 100 pages.The other story lines concerning a former cop looking for a serial killer, and (far shorter story) a girl's ordeal with her kidnapper, are fine, too, but all three tales are awkwardly combined.When our first hero, Ward, finally discovers the truth about his parents, the parents' small circle of past friends' reactions are not what the reader expects, and those reactions are never explained. For instance: Ward, upon finding one of his mother's and father's acquaintances, says, \\"My parents are dead.\\" The friend replies, \\"Good\\". Why does he have this feeling? We don't learn why. Even the double-crosses at the end make no sense.Marshall's description of how a kidnapping takes place in front of a self-centered populace always on the run, is done very well.In our next story, former policeman John Zandt's explanation to his (completely-miffed) female partner about how he found one of the Straw Men is totally far-fetched. He says, more or less, \\"a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend....told me...\\" We are left out of this detective work, and are asked to just take this character's word on what he has found out.This is a mystery-suspense novel that allows us to follow how the characters get to where they are except when it counts the most: during the last quarter of the book, when it seems Marshall has simply run out of ways to tie things together.It's not even that we're disappointed with the end, though I found it odd; it's simply wondering how exactly we got to this point that lessens the book's overall affect."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Michael Marshall used to publish great sci-fi novels under the name Michael Marshall Smith. But when his books didn't sell well in the States, he took his publisher's advice and reinvented himself by changing his name and by chosing to write fiction in a whole different genre. But as they say, some things are better left untouched. There is very little enjoyment to be found in this story that's just too complicated and too full of incompatible ideas for its own good.The novel follows two different stories. The first is of a man who's parents died in a car accident. A conspiracy is soon unveiled, one that puts doubt over their death and over the man's own past. Then, you have the sad, broody cop who's hunting a killer who also kidnapped the cop's daughter (how original!).Eventually, these two stories meet. But the reader is left in the dark for so too long that he soon loses interest. The connections between the two plots aren't strong enough to be believable. The moment the two stories meet, the book collapses, falling into a mess of subplot after subplot that never leads anywhere. The author just seems to be digging his own grave.And the fact that the author never really explains anything doesn't help matters. I hate a book where everything is given to you. The reader should be left to discover SOME things by himself. But not everything. Marshall is so vague when it comes to explaining the plot that the reader is left wondering if the author every really knew himself what was going on.The Straw Men is a mess of idea that never seem to mesh well with one another. And that's a shame, because Marshall can write very complicated and fully fleshed out stories. He can write great characters that are intriguing. But none of that is to be found in Straw Men. Maybe Michael Marshall should leave the Dean Koontz territory to Dean Koontz and stick with what he knows best: Sci-fi."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I managed to wade through this book to the end, although I now wonder why I bothered. Probably a Puritan work ethic remnant.The author combines a preposterous plot, unrealistic characters and vague psycho-babble into a thoroughly unsatisfying read. If Amazon allowed less than 1 star ratings, that's what I would give it.The only positive I come away with is that I borrowed the book from the local library so I haven't done anything to encourage the author to continue his \\"writing\\" career. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Like a few other people here, I bought this book for its cover -- not very smart, but I was curious. (Stephen King's blurb on the cover didn't make any impression on me -- I mean, come on, hasn't he blurbed even John Saul?) The book started out intriguingly but lost its way quickly amidst too much descriptive prose, making it a chore to finish reading it. While there were flashes of humor I liked, they just weren't enough to save the story. Not a keeper."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I think this book was written in a weekend. I'm serious, it's that bad.It starts off just fine, with several seemingly disconnected and shocking events that you assume will be tied together later on. And they are, but when you finish the book, you'll still be scratching your head. The ending just doesn't make sense, neither do any of the character's motivations.The characters are hard enough to keep track of, because besides being stiff and pale representations of real people, they keep being referred to differently by the author. First he's talking in third person, then he's back to first person. It's disconcerting, hard to read, and I can't believe that this book was published without being hacked into a million pieces by an editor. Or perhaps it was.Like another reviewer here, I finished the book, but wish I hadn't."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"&quot;The Straw Men&quot; 's strong beginning, with keen observations on our relationships with long lost friends and relatives and good commentary on society, is left almost forgotten by the time the final page is read.Our first protagonist's (Ward Hopkins) regrets about not fully knowing his parents is right-on and--as with the whole book--is well-written. His search for his mother and father is the best of the three concurrent stories that eventually come together in the last 100 pages.The other story lines concerning a former cop looking for a serial killer, and (far shorter story) a girl's ordeal with her kidnapper, are fine, too, but all three tales are awkwardly combined.When our first hero, Ward, finally discovers the truth about his parents, the parents' small circle of past friends' reactions are not what the reader expects, and those reactions are never explained. For instance: Ward, upon finding one of his mother's and father's acquaintances, says, &quot;My parents are dead.&quot; The friend replies, &quot;Good&quot;. Why does he have this feeling? We don't learn why. Even the double-crosses at the end make no sense.Marshall's description of how a kidnapping takes place in front of a self-centered populace always on the run, is done very well.In our next story, former policeman John Zandt's explanation to his (completley-miffed) female partner about how he found one of the Straw Men is totally far-fetched. He says, more or less, &quot;a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend....told me...&quot; We are left out of this detective work, and are asked to just take this character's word on what he has found out.This is a mystery-suspense novel that allows us to follow how the characters get to where they are except when it counts the most: during the last quarter of the book, when it seems Marshall has simply run out of ways to tie things together.It's not even that we're disappointed with the end, though I found it odd; it's simply wondering how exactly we got to this point that lessens the book's overall affect."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I never thought I could express myself this way about a book (after all someone set days and night to write something to succeed) but this book is simply...

I couldn't stay with it, couldn't get into it, didn't care about the characters, the story, or anything.

This was the absolute worst book that I have ever read! I will go on to say that this book got on my nerves. I got to page 221 and deceided that I would not take anymore of this and I just gave up! Please Mr Marshall &quot;DON'T WRITE ANYMORE BOOKS LIKE THIS&quot;"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I've absolutely devoured every one of Michael Marshall Smith's books (that's the name under which his past works were written, in case you'd like to find more of his work.) Another book released earlier in the year by a different writer named Martin Smith called The Straw Men likely precipitated the change of pen name, although why the publisher calls this \\"his debut novel\\" is puzzling. His books are bestsellers in the UK.As someone said earlier, Mr. Marshall (or Smith) really knows how to \\"turn a word.\\" As wonderfully dark and fast-paced as this book is, I, too, kept finding myself re-reading certain paragraphs here and there, just because the author has an incredible gift of being able to sprinkle profound insights amidst a breakneck plot and non-stop progression of the story. His literary prowess never gets in the way of the story.For horror buffs, this is a completely fresh, wonderful read, and it's indeed a shame that the author has not gained the stellar notoriety he so rightly deserves. (Although two of his prior works have been secured for VERY large sums from movie studios, including Spielberg's Dreamworks, who paid a whopping seven-figure sum for the rights to Spares.)To the story: The book centers around two different protagonists, each tracking down what appears to be a serial killer, but in the end, turns out to be much, much more. The main, first-person protagonist attempts to unravel and come to grips with a very intriguing set of clues that shed light on an extremely bizarre past that he'd never imagined. At the same time, a pair of detectives are drawn into a similarly bizarre serial killer case that turns out to be much bigger than what appears on the surface, and as we come to learn, anything the world has ever seen. As more is learned and the story progresses, the two sets of protagonists find themselves on the same case, with a satisfying conclusion that still begs a sequel. Not to be trite, but this truly is one of those rare page-turners that melts the hours away as you read it.One thing that I really like about Marshall's (Smith's) books is that unlike many horror stories or thrillers, his lead characters are strong and intelligent - not the typical meek, everyday Joes who end up embroiled in some kind of dark situation, as many horror novels tend to be. His characters drive the story, and are not \\"passive\\" about it in the least. I just like that. I wholeheartedly recommend this book as a must-buy, and all of Smith's past works as well (which venture more into the \\"light Sci-Fi/horror\\" realm.)One side note: Smith is British, and if you go the amazon.co.uk site, you can find a collection of short stories published in a book called \\"What You Make It\\" by him that's not available in the states, which is also a wonderful read, and well worth the airmail surcharges to import. If you enjoy Smith's work, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Jove's packaging of this book is a little puzzling, seeing as this author has three other novels and a short story collection to his credit, albeit under a (very slightly) different name: Michael Marshall Smith. Check the copyright page, since the novel is copyrighted under his full name; or check the author's website (the full name, plus a .com... since Amazon doesn't allow URLs). I can understand their desire to not have the novel confused with another _The Straw Men_ released just last year by another Smith, but aside from the \\"debut novel\\" statement being a lie, it deprives many readers of the chance to check out his old work, and it means that many old fans won't know a new book has come out.Okay, enough of that...This novel starts a bit slowly, setting the scene and scenario, developing characters, and slowly working towards the revelations that kick the plot into motion. Like another reviewer stated, the less said about the details the better, but suffice to say, once things start to move you won't be able to put this book down.Also, it is a very well writen novel, and there is a fair bit of social commentary there if you want to look for it. However, this book can be just as enjoyable as a page-turner, if that's what you are looking for. But be warned, it is a very, very bloody book. There is a good deal of violence, especially towards the end, and there are some graphic scenes involving children (though not of a sexual nature).As it stands now, this is my favourite new novel of 2002, and I only hope that Michael Marshall (Smith) won't take as long to finish his next novel as he did to finish this."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"A nice surprise amongst a bunch of books I purchased at a sale recently. I was into it from the beginning, the style of writing and humour made it very comfortable to read. It's always a pleasure to find an author at random who can deliver the goods.Without going on about the well-told story, my only complaint is the far-reaching abilities that ex-cops and their FBI friends seem to have here in the supposedly real world. It reminded my of \`Trace', the last Kay Scarpetta novel I read, where a quick phone call or access to a computer provided too many answers, too easily.I enjoyed the story, and look forward to reading the remaining books."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I have to say that \\"The Straw Men\\" is pretty unusual. The blend of horror, suspense and mystery thriller is pretty different. And the use of first person and third person points of view scattered throughout the story in also interesting. I liked the premise of the book, and for a debut novel, Marshall does a really good job of building suspense, and creating a mood. There isn't much character development found here, but the fast paced story will carry you along so that you barely notice. I think the biggest problem I had with this novel is the vague ending. I guess Marshall is intending to create a series following the Upright Man and his pursuers...? If not then we are left hanging with what amounts to an unfinished story. I wouldn't recommend this book to squemish readers either. While Ward and Bobby seem like lighthearted characters found in quite a few \\"detective\\" stories, some of the brutality found on the pages of this book does hit a little hard; especially concerning the various children sprinkled throughout the story. And in light of some of the celebrity trials, and tales of misdeeds done by major corporation CEO's flowing through the news wires today....can the story of the Straw Men be too far off?"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Three horrific events separated by time and distance are united by a hidden, cunning conspiracy that threatens the foundation of civilization.I happened across THE STRAW MEN totally by accident. I was checking out a hotel sundries shop one rainy Sunday morning in New Orleans and saw the book on one of those wire, wall-mounted paperback racks popular in hospital gift shops and airports. Two things attracted me to it: the name of the author, \\"Michael Marshall,\\" was the name of a kid I went to grade school with; and the two word cover blurb by Stephen King: \\"A Masterpiece.\\" I picked the bad boy up; the story looked intriguing, and I scraped some bills together and bought it. It was the best several bucks I've spent in quite a while.The Michael Marshall who wrote THE STRAW MEN is not the kid I went to school with. This Michael Marshall is from Great Britain, and his name is actually Michael Marshall Smith. He's published three books, I believe, under the latter name, works of speculative fiction that I'm going to get into as soon as I finish keyboarding here. Why he has been abbreviated to Michael Marshall is a question I can't answer; it's confusing, apparently, even to his publisher, which on the back of THE STRAW MEN, describes this book as his debut novel.Regardless, this guy is incredible. Let me put it this way: I was firmly convinced before I was a third of the way through the book that Michael Marshall was one of those Richard Bachman identities that Stephen King comes up with. Or, even more improbably, that THE STRAW MEN was some collaboration between King and Dean Koontz. Marshall writes as if he is possessed with the strengths of both writers and bereft of their occasional weaknesses. But he apparently is his own, real person. Why angels are not calling his name right now, I don't know, and why THE STRAW MEN went straight to paperback, as opposed to getting a huge hardcover release first, is a question I can't answer. This novel, however, is incredible.Marshall starts things off by recounting three separate, seemingly unconnected events. The first is an occurrence at a fast food restaurant; the second is the abduction of a teenaged girl named Sarah Becker from a Santa Monica mall; and the third is the death of a husband and wife in an automobile accident. Their son, Ward Hopkins, finds a note in his father's handwriting stuffed into a chair, reading \\"Ward, we're not dead.\\" Hopkins, a ne'er do well who has been at loose ends for most of his life, haltingly begins an investigation and in the process begins to connect the random dots of the three events, revealing a horrific plot that stretches across the country and fifty years into the past, involving his parents and ultimately himself. At the same time, an FBI agent and John Zandt, a retired and grief-stricken Los Angeles police detective, investigate the Becker abduction, an incident which is tied to three prior abductions --- one of which involves Zandt's own daughter.As Zandt races against time to rescue Becker, his path becomes intertwined with Hopkins as they race toward a tumultuous, apocalyptic conclusion. Marshall keeps the suspense level ratcheted to atmospheric levels practically from the first page, so that the reader turning the page while actually fearing what will come next. Marshall is a master of the unpredictable; nothing is as it seems, and no event can be anticipated, from the first page to the last.With THE STRAW MEN, Marshall demonstrates that the Next Big Thing is already here. If you wish you had held on to that first edition of CARRIE, here's your second chance. This guy is a marvel. Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I recently adopted a no more 5 star review policy. Nada, nothing, except maybe my grandmother's sour cream pound cake. But then I picked this book up and had to recant. This is a terrific book and this guy, of whom I'd never heard, is one heck of a writer. It's not often that someone's prose has the ability to inspire terror and incite laughter in the same sentence. This guy has a keen insight on the things that make my generation laugh, cry and feel a little nervous. I hear there's a sequel out already, and sequels, especially to great books and great movies (see Jaws II) always scare me. Great expectations, I suppose. But, in the end, I'll have to see. By all means, read this book."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I bought The Straw Men on impulse while wondering through a book store trying to find something different to read. And I got it!I couldn't put the book down.. I read it straight through. Michael Marshall has a wonderful way with wording, I found myself greedily reading each phrase and sentence once after the other.His switch between first and third person might seem awkward to some, but I found it intriguing and a nice a change as the book went along, adding a more personal view from the character who was probably the most confused and traumatized by the truths that began revealing themselves.The end could have been a little deeper, a little more informative, but it stuck with the mystery that had surrounded the plot throughout the whole book and was obviously (I hope!) left open for a sequel.I would suggest this book to anyone who looking for a chilling, different read. You'll certainly find it here.And to all the other reviewers who let us in on Mr Marshall's other books, thank you!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Ward Hopkins returns home to Dyserburg, Montana only to step into what seems like an episode of the Twilight Zone when he finds a book taped to the underside of a recliner. Contained inside the book is a note that states his parents aren't dead. Tearing the house apart, he stumbles upon a video showing his parents and two twins, one who they leave behind in a crowded area. Unable to believe his parents are capable of such an act, he along with his CIA friend Bobby discovers that there is no record of Ward's birth.While Bobby and Ward seek the truth, a teenage girl is kidnapped in Santa Monica with the FBI believing they are once again dealing with the Upright Man serial killer. Former cop John Zandt and his friend FBI agent Nina look to find Sarah before she is killed like the three others before her. John and Nina cross paths with Bobby and Ward. They begin working together making the necessary connections to find the Upright Man and his supporters the Straw Men.Eerie, gothic like suspense that has more realistic twists and turns than the world's most serpentine roller-coaster, THE STRAW MEN never slows the ride until even Yogi would agree it's over. From the very beginning readers connect with a befuddled Ward at a very fundamental level. Fans root for him and his cohorts to succeed in their interconnected missions that seem so hopeless. Michael Marshall's debut novel is a very special reading experience for crime thriller fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Marshall hits the ground running in one of the best mystery/thriller debuts this year. I picked up this book due to Stephen King's review that it was scary as hell. King was right. Marshall sure knows how to build the suspense as he plots seemingly random events and connects the dots well into the book. It looks to be the first book in a projected series and I can't wait for the continuation!For those of you who hate shifting viewpoints, you may be disaappointed, but Marshall does pull it off well without distracting from the story.If you're in the mood for something scary, something mysterious, by a new writer...this is a darn good bet!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Michael Marshall (a.k.a. Michael Marshall Smith, author of SPARES, ONE OF US, and ONLY FORWARD) has written one of the best novels of 2002-THE STRAW MEN. Unlike his previous futuristic novels, this one takes place in the present day with flashbacks to the past. It's actually two stories (each story could have easily been turned into a successful novel) in one, which come together in the last hundred pages to create an ending that will scare the living daylights out of you with regards to the evil that mankind is capable of perpetrating. The first story deals with Ward Hopkins, ex-C.I.A., who returns home to Dyersburg, Montana to attend the funeral of his dead parents, both of which were killed in a tragic car accident. What Ward eventually discovers while going through his old home is that his parents may not have been who he thought they were and that quite possibly they may still be alive, but in hiding from a deadly organization that refers to itself as The Straw Men. With the help of his good buddy, C.I.A. agent Bobby Nygard, Ward starts searching for answers and inadvertently sets in motion several attempts by The Straw Men to eliminate both him and his friend. The second story deals with a serial killer known as The Upright Man who takes his victims from the Los Angeles area of California. When young Sarah Becker disappears one evening while sitting in front of a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Santa Monica, waiting for her father to return, F.B.I. agent Nina Baynam realizes that The Upright Man has returned after being dormant for two years. She enlists the help of ex LAPD Homicide Detective, John Zandt, who'd once helped her to hunt this serial killer, until his own daughter became a victim. John, however, is determined that Sarah Becker isn't going to die. He's going to do everything in his power to save her and to kill The Upright Man in a final act of revenge for destroying his life two years before. Both stories will slowly converge into one as Ward, Bobby, Nina and John discover that's there something much more deadly out there than just a single serial killer, and that it's going to take all of their strength and courage to fight this force of evil that's killing our children. THE STRAW MEN is a tour de force for Michael Marshall. The plot is intricately woven with strong, compelling characters that drive the story forward like a battering ram. Mr. Marshall knows how to end each chapter with a hook that keeps the reader glued to every single page in a frantic attempt to find out what's going to happen next. The last forty pages of this novel blew me away and will leave you literally speechless, not to mention fearful that the possibility of what the author suggests is, in fact, true. I sincerely hope that Mr. Marshall is already at work on a sequel to this breathtaking, utterly scary novel about man's capacity to commit evil and that Hollywood, if it has any sense, has already picked up the screen rights. THE STRAW MEN is one of those tremendous surprises that all readers of suspense crave from the inner sanctum of their souls. Buy it, read it, pass it on to your friends, then see if you can sleep at night without having nightmares that The Straw Men may be coming for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Although presented at first as a standalone thriller, Michael Marshall's The Straw Men eventually became the first volume of a tightly-linked trilogy. This matters because, although a satisfying read on its own terms, the novel is structured more like a \\"part one.\\" Two storylines, the first-person narrative of a grieving estranged son and a third-person account of a ex-cop on a serial killer investigation to which he has a very personal connection, run in parallel for much of the book's length, only coming together about two-thirds of the way through. Both stories are interesting, but neither has the fast pace usually expected in a thriller, and the style, which strives for dark insight into contemporary life, has its drawbacks. There are, however, enough twists and turns and effective passages to keep up the reader's interest right through to the explosive finale.Ward Hopkins, formerly a low-level CIA employee and now floating through life as best he can, is the prodigal son returning home, but for a double funeral rather than a joyous reunion. Guilty over his distance from his parents and having trouble processing their deaths, he enters entirely new emotional territory when he finds a carefully hidden note that says \\"Ward, we're not dead.\\" His search for an explanation leads him to a videotape, a private enclave for the incredibly wealthy, and a shocking secret about his parents. Meanwhile, former police detective John Zandt, tracked down by his FBI agent ex-lover, is once again searching for the serial killer known as The Upright Man, who had once kidnapped Zandt's daughter; her body was never found. Now another young woman has disappeared, and Zandt must confront the terrible secret he's been in flight from for so long.As this summary suggests, the plot of The Straw Men is laced with thriller-style implausibilities. (Criminals in fiction, evidently feeling a deep concern for narrative urgency, are forever targeting relatives of investigator protagonists; has this ever happened in real life?) Some of the eventual twists, though clever, are so unlikely they make the novel feel more garishly lurid than the genuinely dark story it's supposed to be. Marshall touches on topics of great contemporary relevance-- inexplicable and frightening mass violence, the isolated and self-indulgent lives of the super-rich-- but the narrative elements involved are so out there they can function solely as a kind of grotesquely exaggerated metaphor for those topics. Which works, but only up to a point.In keeping with this flawed ambition are the two narrative voices. Both Ward's first person and the third person describing Zandt carry a biting cynicism not unfamiliar to readers of crime fiction, and in both cases the cynicism soon becomes a little wearying. In Ward's case, it's because he's not well-developed enough as a character to generate either sympathy or interest. His sorrow and regret over the loss of his parents works, but that's quickly displaced, and then all the reader has is his habit of describing what he sees with a mocking edge, as though he feels superior to everything and everyone. Of course this attitude conceals some degree of self-hatred, but that isn't brought into the foreground enough to balance the character's glibness. The third-person prose is more obviously philosophical, and has a stylistic sharpness that makes it enjoyable to read, but its observations tend toward the well-worn. Here is an excerpt to give a flavor:\\"Lights and signs in the darkness, half-seen faces, the rustle and honk of life on just another of those evenings in a city whose heart never seems to be quite where you are, but is always around a corner, or down that street, or the other side of hulking buildings in some new club whose glory nights will be over before you've even heard of it. Between there and here a clutch of cheap hotels, dusty liquor stores, car lots selling vehicles of dubious provenance; a tatty herd of people waiting on street corners with nothing very positive in mind; a veldt of concrete bunkers housing businesses that will swallow countless hollow lives without ever being quoted on NASDAQ. Gradually the change to residential streets, and then into Venice. From the outside, on the right streets, Venice can look like it's trying to claw itself back upmarket. Some of the property is expensive, in a [lousy] International style. Every now and then you'll see a tattered piece of 1950s signage, something exuberant that harks back to flash bulbs and frozen glamor. Most have been torn down now, replaced by brutal information boards stamped out in Helvetica, the official typeface of purgatory. Helvetica isn't designed to make you feel anything good, to promise adventure or gladden the heart. Helvetica is for telling you that profits are down, that the photocopier needs servicing and by the way, you've been fired.Finally, Santa Monica. Nicer houses, small offices, places to get Japanese food and the London Times. The sea, with a pier that was born in sepia but knows those days are over. The Palisades up above, busy Ocean Avenue, then the first line of hotels and restaurants. The sense, from somewhere, that this suburb had once been a town. Perhaps it's the sea that makes it feel that way, that gives an impression that this community is here for a reason. In places it still is, still feels as if it has a relationship to its environment that goes beyond simply having flattened it. Stores and cafes and places to be, places to walk into and to buy from. You could live there and understand where you were, as the Becker family had until recently. It's not a real place, but then so little of Los Angeles is real, and the parts that are real are the places you don't want to be. Real is for people with guns and hangovers. Real is what you want to avoid. LA believes itself full of magic, and sometimes can even feel that way, but much of this is a mutually agreed upon sleight of hand. You can stand in one place and believe that one day you'll be a movie star -- stand somewhere else, and you'll believe that you'll soon be dead. You know that what you see is a trick, but still you want to believe.\\"That's mostly a nice piece of writing, although it has its excesses (\\"the official typeface of purgatory\\"). But what is it really saying? That big cities can be grim places, that they offer none of the sense of community that some people derive from smaller places, that they are often built on illusions never to be realized? We've heard that all before. Less elegantly expressed, it's the theme of many a cop movie or detective novel, and while it makes for powerful images, it doesn't tell us anything about people who live, and live happily, in such environments. The pessimism of dark crime fiction can, in the hands of a stylist like Marshall, be a strangely dazzling thing, but its insights have their limits.These complaints are mostly about less-important aspects of The Straw Men; I focus on them only because I, and maybe some other readers, have high expectations for Marshall based on his other work (much of it published under his full name, Michael Marshall Smith). As an entertainment, the book works very well, balancing its plotlines and secrets so well that despite the slow pace it's never boring. Marshall is unafraid to examine the darkest impulses at work in modern life, the ways in which seemingly ordinary people do monstrous things for money, for power, or to sate their own terrible appetites. All of this can make for uncomfortable reading. Perhaps this should go without saying about a serial killer novel, but those bothered by direct (but never exploitative) descriptions of sadistic violence and cruelty should avoid The Straw Men. But if you're looking for a stylish thriller that confronts, if a little awkwardly, some of the darkest aspects of 21st-century life, check this one out, and look for its sequels, The Lonely Dead (US title The Upright Man) and Blood of Angels."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I had read and liked this book years ago.

I understand this was Marshall's first book, so he'll probably resolve that with more practice. Obviously this is not great literature, and I don't think it was meant to be. But this book has me practically holding my breath for the next installment (which I'm sure there will be.) I really enjoyed the characters, and would like to see them again in a sequel. The story line had a very relevent message that might not interest everyone, but it sure interested me. It was an idea I'd never thought of, and once presented it grabbed a hold of my imagination to the extent that it actually began to become plausible. The way he brought the characters together was logical, and I appreciate that. Also, a silly little thing, but I really enjoyed Marshall's vocabulary. It's not often you find a paperback with a decent turn of the word. I think this book was a good read, especially for a vacation or travel when you've got the time to read it straight through, because that's what you'll want to do once you buy into the plot. And then you'll do what I'm doing, looking for a way to get a head's up when Michael Marshall writes his next book.-c"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I tend to read compulsively and not only could I not put this book down, I didn't even think of putting it down. I sailed through it without a care in the world as to how much time I was spending. My only complaint is I think the book should have been twice as long to flesh out the multiple plot lines and logical jumps that are a little shakey. The plot is so original I felt a little shortchanged at how \\"conveniently\\" he wraps up certain threads and glosses over numerous details. If you're asking me the book felt edited with a sledge hammer. Also, to be frank, I just didn't want the story to end!What a great writer Marshall is, too. Turns a phrase as well as anyone, has ideas as grandiose as, say, \\"The Stand,\\" but gets into his characters heads and hearts better than King. If this book were as fully developed as \\"The Stand\\" it would stand as a real masterpiece on the order of The Lord of The Rings, which, King's little blurb aside, it misses. Still, if you like suspense, mystery and conspiracy fiction, don't pass this one up.

The book is great for taking what happened or in 68 what was happening and see what this guy has to say about it in Vietnam. Then, voila, just look to Iraq. For instance if you read 'the initiative has passed from the insurgents to the American forces and their allies' you'd think maybe it was Rummy telling us about the Iraqi Army. But it was McGeorge Bundy in 1965 telling the American people all is well with the war effort and our troops had only been in Nam six months then. Another problem in Iraq is that our 'allies' the Iraqi police and so called Army selling our guys out. For instance in this book they mention the problem of the 1968 Tet Offensive and how the attack on the US EMbassy was led by Embassy employees. Great book that validates we just might be in another Vietnam and not know it because as quoted back then in the book 'it seems that the majority of official reports on the situation there have been untrue\\" Good book"},{"Title":"Our Own Worst Enemy","review":"I left the army in January of 1967. I was totally hawkish and blase about the involvement in Vietnam but I had read Lederer's \\"Ugly American\\" and when I saw this book in 1968 or 1969 I thought \\"Here is a guy who really can sort through the nonesense and explain what's happening\\". Lederer, as I recall, was a graduate of one of the military acadamies and had spent much of his career in diplomacy. A true patriot and very credible. I was stunned. He totally dis-assembled every myth and lie of American policy in Viet Nam.A great book and should be required reading for every person who cares about our international stature or is even thinking about getting involved in foreign policy."},{"Title":"Our Own Worst Enemy","review":"Read this book and then reflect on what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. Look for similarities in policy at the highest levels and at the execution of this policy in the streets and villages of these countries. I read this book in the late 1960s as I worked on a paper. I have to admit I didn't revisit it until I read of the death of Captain Lederer. It would be worth a reprint. I encourage all international affairs specialists to devote an evening to reading this book, it isn't too long, and then reflect hard and long over what is said in the book and what is going on in the world now.

I remember, even as a particularly dim-witted eighth grader, thinking, while reading this book, \\"Just how stupid do they think we _are?_\\"Yes, I know I must take into consideration what age group this book is for. But in grade eight, when I was twelve, and that IS in the suggested age group, the teachers all seemed to think that not telling people exactly what you're thinking all the time was a concept SO complex that required pages and pages of explaining a five year old could understand, and really cheesy metaphors.And the entire second half of the book, when everything finally starts going right for Oliver was very, very bothersome. He makes peace with all the evil teachers, makes best buds with the bully... fact is, stuff like that doesn't happen. Usually, if someone hates you, they hate you for a long, long time. It doesn't tend to change overnight like it was portrayed in the book.So basically, I found the book to be unconvincing in general. Sure, it had its moments, but it was just so... cheesy.

Oliver met a kid named Harry and they were good friends. Then he met Gus the school bully. When Oliver started to understand Gus they became friends.I can see that happening because there is a school or class bully everywhere and my friends and I are friends with him. Friends are very importent people in your life because you can talk to them, and playwith them, and tell them how you feel.

Questioned by the authorities, the they reveal a sordid dalliance, rending the careful fabric of Alistair's life, his blameless wife and family the beneficiaries of this shameful event. Soon after, Alistair's wife, Rosalind, receives a call that that her husband's mother has died. This call is yet another shock to Rosalind, who was told that Alistair's parents died when he was young. Suddenly, the carefully woven past Langford has assembled falls away and he is forced to account for a history of deception, all in service of hiding a past defined by poverty and a mother's questionable lifestyle. Deeply embarrassed and ashamed, Alistair has come to the moment of truth; whether he can accept his own history and make amends to his wronged wife is another matter, as Langford is a proud and cautious man.Alistair requests the help of his popular and successful son, Luke, unable to drive himself to Dover to make arrangements for his mother's effects. For his part, Luke, a self-styled clubber, partier and bon vivant, is floundering, recently released from an amorous relationship with a narcissistic actress, Arianne. Luke cannot break free of his obsession with Arianne, positive she will realize her mistake and return to him. Under her spell, Luke's vulnerability is painful to observe; he remains oblivious to Arianne's manipulations, a shadow of the man his friends know. While in Dover with his father, Luke befriends two refugees from Kosovo, Mila and Goran and it is through these characters that Stevenson artfully skewers the pretensions of the middle class, the \\"egocentric complacency Western money can buy\\". Goran eventually learns to detest Luke's simplistic self-indulgence, \\"he hated Luke for his pointless angst, which was the agony of privileged people\\".Stevenson has a firm grasp of her characters, their flaws, fears and inability to ask for support from one another. In this acute novel, all are forced to confront their pretensions, insecurities and motivations, their perfectly orchestrated public facades. Alistair's existence is defined by lies, infidelity and denial, his family passively absorbing the price of their position, a profoundly casual acceptance of middle class values and aspirations, assuming they are superior, untouchable, until the collapse of their false security. Peeling away the distractions that shield each character, the author exposes the minutiae that fill every waking moment of the Langford\`s. In the end, everyone is vulnerable to fate's intervention, distractions crumbling before fear and self-doubt, the lesson unmistakable, a class-conscious society unmasked. While it may be premature to credit Stevenson with the attributes of a Henry James, to her credit, this author can wield a scalpel, making precise incisions into English sensibilities. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"Exposure","review":"Just finished this book. Wow! I need to take a breath. As cliche as it all sounds, a tour de force truly. A keen breath-taking observation of human frailty and strength, of the human condition in all. Screaming with emotion, these characters come ALIVE. Alistair, Rosalind, and Luke... Stevenson captures it beautifully--the beautiful and scary isolation of being a human being in this world, and those ties that bind these solitary entities to the family, that thing that is both their downfall and their salvation. Inherently an optimistic book, the plot centers around the emotional lives of these characters in a way that makes you feel as if you're watching a densely plotted movie even though all that's going on is a severe and gut wrenching process of human awakening. That rare gem of a book... Read it now! Your life will be the better for it."},{"Title":"Exposure","review":"The plot line of Exposure is aptly summarized elsewhere, so I will not re-summarize it here. Rather I will address some of its strengths and weaknesses, as I see them.I was thoroughly engrossed by this book. The author involves you in each of the main characters - Alistair, Luke and Rosalind especially - and some of the lesser ones - Goran and Mila - by switching the (often stream-of-consciousness) narrative from one character to another (and back again) as the story progresses. The plot has enough major events to hold most readers' interest. The author engages the reader early on by alluding to the major tragic events in Alistair's and Luke's lives but withholding the details, as well as the underlying reasons for and causes of, these events until midway through the story. She devotes the rest of the book to the events' resolution (or not). It is noteworthy that this 28 year old female writer most successfully inhabits the psyches of two men - one her age and the old enough to be, ....her father - who carry the story line from beginning to end.Ultimately this book is less about class differences than about the nature of love in all its manifestations - sexual, spousal, maternal, paternal, et. al. The author plays with this subject over and over again throughout the book and succeeds in making the reader care about her characters. Anyone who has lived through the break-up of a passionate liaison will identify with Luke's emotional highs and lows. Alistair provides a much more complex set of emotions that may be harder to grasp, but nonetheless are elaborately realized in this book. Late in the book there is a moment of emotional exposure and communication between father and son (Alistair and Luke) that, while emotionally restrained in the British manner, was deeply moving.With apologies to the author, I found some of her meditations on the many facets of love a bit longish and sometimes a bit unconvincing or inconclusive. At times, I found myself skipping over some of the longer and more meandering dialogues. Perhaps this due in part to the youthfulness of the author, who cannot fully capture the perspective of a 63 year old lawyer, husband and father. Nonetheless, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Exposure","review":"Exposing the hypocrisy and duplicity of British upper middle-class society, author Talitha Stevenson's exquisitely written novel, Exposure recounts what happens when sexual obsession threatens to break down the carefully drawn faade, the finely drawn pretense of a London well do to family. Caught up in a web of lies, the Langford family is rocked by scandal and heartbreak, their carefully planned and well-ordered world gradually collapsing around them.Alistair Langford has a successful is a career as a prosecution barrister at London's Old Bailey. Married to the elegant and loyal Rosalind, Alistair has everything he could possibility wish for - a lovely house in Holland Park, two healthy children, Luke and Sophie, and a beautiful wife, but Alistair has spent his whole life seeking to escape from his working class past; his bourgeois existence built on lies and deception.Resenting his uneducated single mother, who entertaining numerous single men and wasted her life running a boarding house in Dover, Alistair yearned to escape, managing to obtain a scholarship to Oxford. Finally able to associate with the educated upper classes, \\"he had chosen a clean ordered world with no smell of fried breakfasts or of large unknown men,\\" Alistair has learnt to take nothing for granted, he's proud of his accomplishments, thankful that his past has been forever buried.But one night, while leaving a dinner party, Alistair is brutally attacked by two unknown assailants. With his kneecap shattered, his pride and sense of self worth devastated, Alistair is forced to confront his terrible mistake, his squalid dalliance in a hotel room with a young girl, a witness for the defense in a case that he was currently trying. Shamed by the public, his family outraged at his infidelity, the aging barrister must, after years of marriage, account for all his years of deception.Previously, Alistair had exercised a life of such intense self-control, relishing his imprisonment in his own ambitions, ritualizing it like an act of obedient prayer. But now his past rockets back into his life, his memories of his mother coming back to him intact \\"with her curlers, and her fears.\\" He had wanted to forget where he grew up and lose himself in another world, but now he's in a state of perpetual war with himself, appearing constantly in a state of dualistic adoration and loathing of his own wealth.With his mother now dead, Alistair entrusts the help of his son to drive him to Dover to tie up the lose ends of his mother's estate; it is here that he is forced to confront his life of secrets, betrayals, and longings; his grief, pride, and heartbreak, and the duplicitous of his ambition. Meanwhile, the spoilt and facile Luke has his own demons to contend with. He's become dangerously obsessed with Adrienne a gorgeous and selfish ex-girlfriend, who moved in to his Notting Hill apartment and than promptly dumped him for another man.Sexually obsessed and wracked with grief, all Luke wants to do is to get closer - always closer to Arianne, \\"he could not bear to lose her for even a second to her modes of escape. Arianne had a sense of fate; it heaved outsiders into mystified passivity.\\" To Luke, this passivity was just one more mode of sensual abandonment; she transfigures the guilt about life that Luke feels, \\"drawing the waste the hours spent in bed ignoring his work ethic, into the realm of self expression.\\" Only through giving shelter and food to Mila and Goran, two refugees from Kosovo, can Luke perhaps achieve any hope of redemption and fulfillment.Stevenson skillfully explores the dark undercurrents of deception, sexual longing, and betrayal through her characters' distorted vision, the plot deftly heightening the main characters journey into moral ambiguity, exposing their deepest insecurities and fears. A dreaded feeling of inevitability steadily permeates the narrative, as Alistair desperate to save his marriage, must finally confront Rosalind, while Luke, high on drugs and alcohol, comes, once and for all, face to face with Arianne, his beautiful and destructive nemesis.Stevenson writes with an astounding self-confidence, totally in tune to the all the restrained hypocrisies of the English middle classes. Alistair sees himself as a man of accomplishment whose only mistake after almost forty years of marriage is to seek the comforts of an extra-marital dalliance, while Luke is ultimately blinded by the enormity of his loss, deluded by the pain of unrequited love.The characters in Exposure are vulnerable, exposed; haunted by the practice of deceit and the ineffable urge to tell the truth, to uncover a web of lies and falsehood that seems to be forever entwined.

What a shame, for it is a grand city, the home of India's greatest poets, writers and philosophers.Morhouse opens his excellent book with this: Very few people have ever said anything good about Calcutta, unless they were Bengali. Churchill told his mother: I shall always be glad to have seen it - for the same reason Papa gave for being glad to have seen Lisbon - namely, that it will be unnecessary for me ever to see it again. Mark Twain thought the weather of Calcutta was \`enough to make a brass doorknob mushy.'The research on the early days is excellent and the portraits of the Raj are exquisitely drawn, warts and all - and oh, what warts. Moorhouse tells us of the mixed bunch of men who had only one common trait: they believed in the rectitude of their rule. Some were arrogant - Lord Amherst who never moved from one room to another without being preceded by a column of mace bearers and, riding in the Maiden, who wouldn't allow his wife to approach closer than his horse's backside. One or two genuinely loved as was Lord Canning. The more dangerous were thickly impervious as was Lord Curzon, who wrecked almost every good thing that had preceded him the moment he arrived.Still if you wander up College Street even today, you'll find \`the biggest second-hand book market in the world, shop after shop of literature for perhaps half a mile. And the bookseller will be well content with your company long after he has realized he is not going to make a sale. He is part of a climate that is as inseparable from Calcutta as the monsoon.'And this quick portrait of a stroll along the main drag: Walking under the arcade, constructed chiefly for the shelter of the British masters, you will fall into step behind a pair of Sikhs who are holding hands or who, if they are not doing that, are each, for some unfathomably Sikh reason, cradling their testicles in one careful palm as though they might suddenly drop off and go rolling down ChowringheeThe book is dated, written in the late 60's and published in 1971. Not updated, it leaves Calcutta in one of its worst times. Says Moorhouse: Breugel would have been at home here.But read it for its early history and for its still valid portraits of the people and go visit one of the most fascinating cities in the world."},{"Title":"Calcutta","review":"This book is a description of Calcutta from the point of view of a British colonialist. It begins with the history of the city, noting how it was officials from the East Indies Company who selected the site of the city and developed it from wilderness. Later chapters fill out the description of the city by taking up various topics in turn. These topics include economics, population, colonial buildings and institutions, development since independence, and 1960s local politics.Overall, the text is somewhat informative, though the prose can be rather dull. Moorhouse does a decent job at juxtaposing historic details with his own personal experiences in Calcutta. However, from his descriptions, he comes across as a British colonialist lamenting the direction the world has taken since granting independence to the colonies. To the extent that his observations about life in Calcutta are valid at all, they are clearly primarily shaped by his background and point of view."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"Fifteen (Avon Camelot Books)The Luckiest Girl (An Avon Camelot Book)Sister of the BrideJean and Johnny (Avon Camelot Books)If you're a fan of Beverly Cleary's \\"mid-century\\" teen novels, you're sure to like \\"Green Eyes.\\" I'm a youthful and hip (no, really - think Reba McEntire or Susan Sarandon or Candace Bergen; my son, nieces and nephews will back me up on this) 50-something woman, and my most vividly remembered teen romance novels (read as an eager pre-teen, of course) are Cleary's \\"Fifteen\\" and Ms. Nielsen's \\"Green Eyes.\\" The Lizzie McGuires and Hannah Montanas we have now are also great, but it's amazing how fresh and heart-warming these wholesome 50's/ 60's books still are today. And retro can be hip, too, right? Maybe a more zealous typist will add a plot synopsis in a later review (and the item description really should be revised to add one), but I'll just note that it's a warm story of a high-aspiring teen caught up with feeling that she's not sufficiently pretty or chic (gee, these issues seem to still be around) who gains insight that life continues after high school, and that some of the girls who weren't very visible as teens get a chance to shine in their 20s or 30s or 40s or whatever...Here's an excerpt from the book (from its back cover):\\"I was just thinking about the play,\\" Danny said, his usually candid eyes not meeting hers. \\"It's going to be out of this world.\\"\\"And that's exactly what we'll say in our editorial,\\" Jan agreed.\\"I was being personal, not editorial,\\" Danny explained painfully. He went on slowly. \\"I was thinking of how much I'd like to ask you for a date to go to the play if I weren't afraid you'd snap back that you had to work or you wish I'd drop dead or something.\\"On another day, she might have snapped at him and refused his offer because she was embarrassed. Today it seemed perfectly natural to lean over the banister, smile, and say, \\"I'd love to go to the play with you, Danny.\\"[...]\\"Written in 1955, this is a story about a high school girl - Jan - who is passionate about journalism and her work on the school newspaper, to the exclusion of her social life.It some ways it's heavily stamped by the time period in which it was written. For example, getting interested in clothes and making her appearance more attractive seems to be a big part of the growing-up process. On the other hand, here is a girl who is more focused on developing her talents than worrying about her looks or boys or dates, and that doesn't completely change at the end. Perhaps even more importantly, we see that part of the reason Jan's mom is such a nutter is that she so completely gave up her own aspirations and personal development when she got married. So overall, I think it was a pretty progressive book for 1950.Some of the dialog seems a little forced, in a shove-the-lesson-down-your-throat sort of way, and there's a major plot event at the end that seems way over-the-top coming right after some of the major events that have already happened, so it's not a perfect book, but I did stay up way too late last night finishing it, so that says something about it....\\""},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"Janice \\"Jan\\" Morgan, 15 at the start of the story is naturally elated when she is elected editor of her school paper. Jan's mother, a bitter woman who spends her days worrying over Jan's brother Andrew, 12 often rebuffs Jan's efforts and refuses to attend academic awards events. When Andrew was 8, he fell into an icy puddle. He then got an earache which developed into rheumatic fever. He missed 2 years of school and as a result, their mother indulges him to the point of excess. Their father is a lumberman who works in Cascadeville Washington's lumber camp and comes home on weekends.Jan is a refreshingly progressive protagonist who claims that her mind is her best feature. She is not a girly cliche. Although she maintains top grades and racks up academic accolades, she is not immune to boys she likes, particularly Danny, who is on the newspaper staff. A highly responsible girl, Jan saves to buy her own clothes and yearns for a typewriter and a chance to attend college. The Morgans' resources are so strained from Andrew's illness that they cannot afford a car; a modern kitchen with a refrigerator and an electric stove or even a move closer to the lumber camp.Alice Morgan, bitter at giving up her dreams often takes her bitterness out on Jan. She gives Jan ever reason to feel \\"pushed clear out of the family circle\\" and does not seem to appreciate Jan's maturity, foresight and ability to plan for her future. She lashes out at Jan over trifles. Andrew delights in baiting Jan and rebels against their mother's directives that he not play outside or resume outdoor activities with the Boy Scouts. Andrew lives for the day when he can sled down the mountains and play in the snow with the other kids. Despite it all, he has a group of friends who fortunately stick by him.Andrew's illness has made her overprotective. She won't let him play outside for long and the two have locked horns about this. On Christmas, Alice buys Andrew two extra gifts, even after they all agreed that Jan and Andrew would get one gift apiece due to financial strain. This effort fell flat as Jan railed and rightfully so at the unfairness and Andrew wept that he didn't want more than his fair share. To add insult to injury, Alice has the temerity to tell Andrew that her gift of a building set was better than the Scout knife from Jan. That was cruel. The Morgans had a heated quarrel about this and Mr. Morgan later tells Jan that they have agreed to send the extra gifts back and the money would be applied to Jan's typewriter and a sled for Andrew.I loved this book and read it as a child. I especially loved the parts about the Preston family whose infant son Jan babysits. In one memorable part of the book, Jan's young charge Johnny, 1 came down with diptheria. Fortunately, Cascadeville is such a small town that the one doctor is always available and makes house calls. A kind, brusque man, Dr. Conners has made it plain that he cares about the \\"two generations he brought into the world\\" and how he thought diptheria's reign ended during the 1910 epidemic in their town. Fortunately, Jan's ministrations and the doctor's diligent treatment pull Johnny through. I like the way the Prestons are presented in an \\"adult reader\\" light so that young readers get a better understanding of adult interactions and concerns.During Johnny's convalescence and subsequent quarantine, Jan has some time to do some serious thinking. She discovers her own inner resources in helping her young charge pull through. It was Jan who stayed up all night with Johnny until the doctor arrived while the Prestons were out of town at a party. Alice Morgan could not leave as she risked being quarantined as well and worried about leaving Andrew alone. It was Jan who followed through on Dr. Conners' directions. It was Jan who, to a certain extent saved Johnny.Jan shows her mettle and in time Alice Morgan comes around. Thanks to Mr. Morgan, who has made it plain that he will do his best to see that both children are treated fairly and that he will no longer stand for being treated like a guest of honor in his own home when he is there on weekends, things change for the better. (This theme is revisited some 10 years later inAmy and Laura, two sisters whose father tells them never to bring problems to their mother, who has returned home from the hospital after surviving an accident. The girls' mother insists on being part of their lives and not to be protected from things that crop up). Alice appears to have lived by the Glen Campbell song, \\"The Dreams of the Everyday Housewife.\\" Dr. Conners, a delightful old school doctor gives Alice Morgan some plain talking to and when Jan herself is in an accident, she discovers who her friends really are. Alice discovers a place to showcase her talent and also blooms. Andrew gets a green card from the doctor to resume normal activity, which is what he wanted all along and he finally gets his sled.This is an excellent, classic book that covers a bygone era and has a rich cast of good, strong characters."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a teenager, and I was delighted to find it again and re-read it. Even though our lives are not anything at all alike, the internal struggles that Jan deals with in the book were similar to mine, and even now, in my 50s, it still speaks to that teenager inside of me, and shows me how far I've come as an adult. It is the story of an unhappy girl, trapped inside herself with hurt, jealousy and unfulfilled dreams, and that was sure me. It is well written, and shows how Jan learns that even though some of her hurts are justified, a lot of them were more her perceptions after they were filtered through those hurts. She begins to see the truth, deal with the hurts, and re-interpret the rest without the filters of anger and jealousy, and in the process she begins to blossom and realize some of those dreams. It is a story of growing up. I recommend it to any teenager struggling with growing up, and even adults."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Artyom Borovik was the Russian version of Geraldo Rivera, a journalist who wasn't afraid to bring the public at large the real news, but unfortunately couldn't keep himself out of the story, which is a faux paus for a journalist and a major drawback to this otherwise good book.Borovik not only supplies an account of indifferent, corrupt Soviet leadership, but sagging morale among the troops on the ground and all the horror one goes through in a war, including post traumatic stress disorder afterwards. The book is also a preview of NATO's 21-century involvement in Afghanistan, all the way down to a fanatical enemy and the unreliable and treacherous Afghani government troops.The book is a grim look at an army plunged into a hell-hole, an army full of deserters and drug users and who would sell their weaponry to a population that would use it against them -- Apocalypse Now Soviet style.Sadly, the book and its information is nonlinear and somewhat muddled and at times Borovik, when he's not saying \\"I, I, I\\" as if he's the story, waxes poetic with strange rhetorical questions (\\"What kind of dreams does the wind see?\\") or proffers non-journalistic observations (\\"War is nothing more than the tears of Death\\").Borovik captures well the indelible sights, sounds and smells of war in all its hell. If this book captures your interest, you should also look into another one, only from a Soviet soldier's perspective, in \\"Afghanistan: Soviet Vietnam\\" by Vladislav Tamarov.\\"By now it should be apparent that Afghanistan wasn't so much about Communism conquering the world as much as it was a conflict with Muslims. I recommend two other books that illustrate this both from a Russian viewpoint and that of a Pakistani journalist. The first is one of the all-time best war memoirs (set in Chechnya): \\"One Soldier's War\\" by Arkady Babchenko (a Russian version or Eugene Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed). The journalistic account \\"Jihad\\" by Ahmed Rashid gives unmitigated insight into the whole Central Asian conflict -- past, present and future. I also recommend two books by Robert Baer -- \\"See No Evil\\" and \\"Sleeping with the Devil,\\" along with \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" by John Perkins.Nothing happens in a vacuum. Even though it's decades old, \\"The Hidden War\\" is but one piece of the jigsaw puzzle that defines our world today and what it will likely be for some time to come."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Having spent more than a couple of years fighting in Afghanistan, this book is a must read.

Written by a Russian reporter who was at the time only 25-30 years old, it is a moving piece of war-reporting that thoughtfully portrays the realities of life for the Russian soldier during their ill-fated invasion of Afghanistan. It is not lost on me that many of the stories related here must also reflect those of our own US troops serving in Afghanistan these past ten years. It is full of emotive detail and the writing is outstanding. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"This is a fascinating book, as much a document of the social upheaval of the Soviet Union in the 80s as a narrative about the Soviet Afghan War.It seemed to me to be a Soviet equivalent of Dexter Filkins' recent book on America's war on terror, The Endless War. Filkins, also a reporter, knit together his reportage and personal experiences throughout Af-Pak and the Middle East to give a more personal and intimate sense of the struggle the US in engaged in.Borovik does something similar, cobbling together his own reports for Soviet publications dating from the early and late years of the war. Other reviewers have noted the stylistic and reportorial disconnect between the first and second halves of the book, the former seeming more gung-ho, while the latter is pessimistic in tone. However this must be seen in context: it is attributable to the huge and unimaginable changes that were taking place in the USSR. In the first years of the war, almost nothing was publicly said about it, other than vague references about helping a comrade socialist state with their \\"socialist revolution\\". Many Russians were under the impression that their soldiers were mostly building schools and irrigation canals. There were no announcements when a soldier's body was shipped home in one of the notorious sealed zinc coffins.Borovik's early reporting was, therefore, already pushing the official limits in terms of its honesty about the conflict; but as Gorbachev's Perestroika gained steam it became possible, even fashionable, to openly criticize the war and the corruption of the Soviet Army.It's not entirely clear from the narrative how much actual combat Borovik personally witnessed, although he does seem to have been present during a successful night-time Soviet platoon's ambush of a mujahidin mission; he also describes embarking on a long-range reconnaissance patrol, but then shipping back early to base with several soldiers whom he describes as malingerers. Borovik leaves unsaid why he decided to desert the patrol but one imagines that fear played a role!Perhaps the most gripping part is the description of the final Russian pullout, which Borovik narrates through a conflict between two Russian officers, the stuttering but compassionate Lt Col Ushakov and his superior, the corrupt and cruel Col Antonenko. After a soldier is shot, Antonenko orders the massacre of an entire Afghan village in retaliation and later tries to bully Ushakov for not using such heavy-handed tactics. Ushakov, in turn, sees Antonenko's behavior as indicative of the rot and corruption plaguing the whole Soviet system, and a symptom of the failure of the Soviet project in Afghanistan.Finally, Borovik tells the sad story of Igor Liakhovich, the last Russian casualty in Afghanistan.Sadly, Borovik himself died in 2000 at age 39 in an airplane crash that some deemed suspicious, as he was openly critical of Vladimir Putin in his reporting.The Hidden War is a riveting document from a unique writer and reporter."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"The Hidden War gives all the clues we could have wanted to have avoided costly mistakes in Afghanistan. It's rugged country where mechanized forces operate at forbidding costs. A show of force in Afghanistan does not win hearts and minds. In such a place, you have to know your strategy before you commit, and then you must commit in only the most cost-efficient manner for a long term. The Soviets discovered all this at great price. It's all in the book.Critics say that Artyom Borovik did not write the definitive book. Who cares? We now have lots of great books on our Vietnam War and they all have merit. This book has valuable facts and interviews. Former Soviet soldiers, veterans of the war, tell their story. We should care, because some of these lessons are timeless. It doesn't matter how devoted and brave the soldier if the political system commits to war without clear strategy and runs out of resources.The Hidden War gives insight into why Soviets went to war in Afghanistan. Apparently, it was the path of least resistance for top political leadership at the time. In this way, the Soviet War in Afghanistan is like our Vietnam War and current wars. Things make sense in parts but in aggregate tend toward entropy. A lot of people suffered. This book gives meaning to that."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"As a Vietnam combat veteran I found Artyom Borovik's book, THE HIDDEN WAR, to ring so clear, true and familiar that I didn't mind the puzzle-like story pieces that made up this remarkable and historic account. As a journalist Borovik covered many aspects of the Soviet War in Afghanistan during the years and accurately and vividly reported what he found. From the lowly infantryman, the elite airborne soldiers, helicopter and MiG pilots, field and political officers, and various mid and high level commanders we get more pieces of the puzzle to slowly put into place as we read. And too there were the rebel dukhi, the 'Black Tulip' casualty flights, the deserters and traitors who fled or fought against their own, the ever present dust and harsh cold of the mountain campaigns, the criticism or resentment the war veterans received at home afterwards, and so many other interesting bits that by the end of the book a better overall picture of the war emerged to contemplate.I have new respect for the Soviet veterans of Afghanistan and salute their service, sacrifice, and courage in their hidden war. Is Borovik's book the definitive history of the Soviet war in Afghanistan? No. But it is nonetheless a remarkable achievement."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Provides the answer to the question, \\"What were they thinking, and why did this seem like a good idea?\\" I thought it was a worthwhile purchase and a good read, if not a little dry."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"History always has lessons for today's policy makers.

Borovik's account reads like a Rolling Stone article - it is purely grassroots, from the author's limited perspective and first-person interviews with Russian soldiers and officers. No academic analysis of Russian strategic and operational moves here. Nonetheless, Borovik manages to touch on nearly every tactic that insurgents are using against coalition forces in Afghanistan today. Although not nearly as detailed as Bernard Fall's \\"Street of No Joy\\", \\"The Hidden War\\" has many lessons for anyone involved at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels in Afghanistan.

However, I enjoyed gaining insight into what Soviet soldiers thought about this conflict. I found it ironic how Americans in Vietnam and Soviets in Afghanistan thought about their respective wars in such similar ways. Also, Soviet officers seemed to have targeted their blame for failure in Afghanistan at many of the same targets American soldiers did. At the same time, though, this book is very different from American soldiers' memoirs on the Vietnam War in that this book is a bit more introspective and at times reads almost like poetry, although perhaps this is due to cultural differences. I also enjoyed the author's interviews with deserters who are now living in the U.S. For those who enjoy this book I would suggest Bob Shacochis' The Immaculate Invasion which focuses on the most recent U.S. intervention in Haiti."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"... I try to read widely to discover which books succeed and which books fail. ... Mr. Borovik's THE HIDDEN WAR succeeds. It provides a view of a superpower befuddled in a war with an impoverished nation that failed to understand the basic truth that poor countries must always let the superpowers have their way. THE HIDDEN WAR reveals the Soviet government's confusion with its war and its aims in that land now called Afghanistan. It reveals how Soviet soldiers lived, fought, died, and felt during that national misadventure. There are obviously echoes from another superpower's misadventure in another chunk of Asia--to the south and to the east. This book is important. It needs to be read by anyone really wants to be an informed citizen."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"If you are looking for a historical account of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, this is not it. This book was written by a Soviet journalist and recounts many of the experiences of the Soviet army in the last couple of years of the war. He also interviews some Soviet troops that either defected to the Mujaheddin or were captured and later went to the US to live.Anyone even remotely familiar with the US experience in Afghanistan will get a feeling of Deja-vu. The experience really is no different than how it is now for our guys. You really feel bad for the Soviet soldiers as they not only have to deal with the enemy, but with corrupt and incompetent officers, a home front that either doesn't care about them anymore or is even hostile, and the inability to get even the most basic of comforts and supplies.It is not quite certain what the strategic aims of the invasion were as most of the top leaders of the time are dead and the documents still state secrets, but one of the biggest apparent reasons was to keep the up and coming Muslim extremism from boiling over into Soviet southern republics.

Good book."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"A nice book about the Soviet-Afghan War. The author spent the first 100 pages describing the initial invasion. The last 180 pages was spent on the final two months of the war. This is a great contrast. The initial hope of doing their international duty is followed by the final exit of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.There are a lot of interesting contrasts in this book. First, deserters who end up in America living the good life but looking back at what they lost. Then there are the Soviet troops trying to keep from being the last killed. This followed by Soviet paratroopers going on a murderous binge in the wake of their commander's death. This shows the lack of control after nine painful years of war.The journalist writes from a Russian perspective. However, he does list some of the problems/issues Russian soldiers created in this country. One wonders whether the West backed the right person in this war as highlighted by subsequent actions. I think this is a great read. The one problem is how the author jumps around in his writing, leading the reader to wonder where the author is in the story."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Colonel Zakharov, Sergeant Dzhabarov, and Defector Peresleni walk with author Artyom Borovik through war-torn Afghanistan. As they travel, the soldiers shoot the breeze and reveal innermost thoughts and feelings with the adept author.\`The Hidden War' humanizes many Soviet soldiers, while others are vilified for greed and murderous actions. Always the soldiers come across as real people.Some Soviet Army defectors, Peresleni for example, eventually wound up in America. In Borovik's eyes the defectors are neither happy nor unhappy. They find themselves in a new land dealing with the challenges of a new place and poignant homesickness.The book's many anecdotes offer unique insights into current events. For example, Pereslini's main reason for defecting was not idealism, confusion, or hatred, but that his fellow soldiers, many of whom happened to be Kazakh, would regularly beat him up. They beat him up for being a Muscovite.Borovik also meets with Sayed Ahmad Gailani in London. His account of the meeting left me with much to think about the interactions western leaders have with those in the middle-east.As the former Soviet Union's offspring make their voices heard, the \`Hidden War' offers a starkly different view of the Soviet soldier than I've previously come across.

Time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"A few years after the U.S. extricated itself from its Vietnam quagmire, the Soviet Union embraced its own foreign entanglement with the invasion of Afghanistan. Within several years, even though we were still engaged in a Cold War with the USSR, one couldn't help but feel some small degree of sympathy for the poor devils. After all, we'd recently been there and done that, so to speak.In THE HIDDEN WAR, Artyom Borovik, a journalist for the Russian magazine Ogonyok, recollects his experiences during two visits to the Afghan mess in 1987 and early 1989. During the former, Soviet forces were still fighting as if they could win. By the latter, the Kremlin had thrown in the towel and was withdrawing its troops towards the country's northern border and a February 15 exit deadline. And why was the USSR there in the first place? According to Borovik, one of the reasons was Brezhnev's fear that American troops were poised to invade the Union's soft underbelly through Afghanistan. (And is that so wild-eyed a view? After all, hadn't the U.S. been in Vietnam to forestall the \\"domino effect\\", whereby the fall of South Vietnam to the Red Menace would eventually lead to jackbooted commie hordes goose-stepping down the center line of Main Street, U.S.A.?)For me, the principal value of THE HIDDEN WAR was to see the conflict from the other side, albeit belatedly. My perceptions of the war at the time were mediated by on-the-spot reports from scruffy American TV-news personalities scrambling around the Afghan badlands with the mujahadin. (However, as Artyom points out, those ragtag fighters had American Stingers.)Unfortunately, because Borovik's book is apparently a series of stitched-together magazine articles, the text lacks seamless continuity, i.e. the author hops around a lot for his interviews - from Afghanistan, to New York, to London, to Afghanistan, to San Francisco, and back to Afghanistan again. The only unifying theme is that the 1979-1989 invasion was a complete boondoggle. The point is well taken, but more continuity of place would have been nice. And there was surprisingly little reporting from actual live-fire engagements between the two sides.Despite my reservations concerning Artyom's style, I'm glad I read his book. He successfully conveys the notion that Afghanistan is a wretched place to fight a war even insofar as the little things:\\"In Afghanistan, thirst can actually make you stoop to drink from a puddle of camel urine. (Every Soviet solder, in fact, carries a miniature water-purification device for just such an eventuality.)\\"American forces have recently been, and still are, engaged in Afghanistan against the Taliban.

We can only hope U.S. military planners learn from history."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"When I was in Soviet Army our officers did not allow us to read the articles from this book in magazines.

My two cousins returned back from there in 1984 and 1986. And they were crazy we thought. I had to go there too, but one officer saved me. My close friend was there.

I must say that I was very disappointed with Artyom Borovik's book.Given the author's vast personal experience and newly acquired literary freedom, the work should have provided priceless insight into the Red Army and combat in Afghanistan. Instead, the book was nothing more than a series of interviews with officers, soldiers, statesmen, and deserters. Keeping in mind that Borovik was a writer for a Soviet magazine at the time, it shouldn't be too hard understand how he could have dropped the ball. The book reads like a long magazine article.There were only descriptions of two brief actions in the entire book. One was in the opening chapters and the other was at the end of the story. To make matters worse, Borovik rails on about bloodshed, nightmares, and the countless horrors of war he's witnessed, but never gives any details. It is very frustrating for the reader.One should also keep in mind that this book was written originally in Russian, intended for people who had been living in a society without freedom of the press. More ground breaking than anything else to them is the mere fact that Borovik was able to write a story stating that Moscow possibly wasn't telling the truth about the war, or that her soldiers may not believe in the communist cause, or that corruption was rampant in the Red Army.That's all old hat to American readers and makes for dull reading."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"This is the first I've read of Mr. Borovik and I hope he's a better journalist than book writer.

Pretty boring read overall."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"The \\"The Hidden War\\" is a remarkably powerful work about the physical and mental scars that war can leave. What it is not is a detailed history of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That's not to say that one can't find lessons for our current situation, but they aren't the ones you might expect. There aren't any clues as to how to fight the Afghans in this book, and the Soviet Army bears essentially no resemblance to our current force structure. They were fighting a war of aggression, were ill led and were provided with almost negligent training.However, \\"The Hidden War\\" provides tremendous insight into the Afghan mindset: why they fight (or don't), why their country lies and ruins, and why they have such conflicted feelings towards the West. More than anything this book teaches us what we shouldn't do: We shouldn't try to hold large areas of territory, we shouldn't alienate the average Afghan with our superiority, we shouldn't disrespect their culture, however alien it may be to us.If you're looking for a parallel to this work, I personally found myself time and time again thinking of Michael Herr's \\"Dispatches\\". In the same way that he captured the nightmare maelstrom of drugs, violence and disillusionment that was the Vietnam War, so too does Borovik paint a picture of a hopelessly misguided Soviet effort. He leaves no doubt as to the futility of fighting a conflict with no strategy (let alone tactics), no goals, and no support at home...."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"This is a great book. I just bought it a couple of days ago and have been reading it constantly. It is trilling, and tells the story of the Soviet/Afghani soldiers during the Russo-Afghan war. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to read a real good book on this subject. I also suggest reading 'Afghanistan: Soviet Vietnam'. These two books are the best about this mainly unknown subject to the Western world."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"I purchased this book a few years ago and read it at the time. Then after the events of 09.11.01, i had to pull it back out and give it another read. This work shows how a war in Afghanistan was fought in the 1980's. It shows the fears and fraility of soldiers at the fore frontof a war without front lines. It gives graphic accounts of the difficulties found in fighting the Afghanis. It is a book the leaders of the world who will be deciding on whether to put ground troops into Afghanistan should take heed of and take copious notes.Mr. Borovik does the fighting men of the then Soviet Army a proud service by showing the war as it was, not as the Soviet propaganda portrayed it.His insights are invaluable to todays fighting men and women who may be going into harms way in the near future."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"As an avid enthusiast of all things Russian, Soviet, etc. and especially the failed occupation of Afghanistan, I found this book at a book store going out of business. What an incredible find! It was an original first print (Different cover picture) and was written from a Russian point of view, through Russian eyes, but not necessarily a military view. Artyom Borovik was a journalist covering the war. A combat correspondant...sorta. All I can say is READ it since this tells the story of an event that ultimately leads to the fall of the Soviet Union and also leads us to September 11, 2001 and the World Trade Center tragedy. This is where the recent batch of fundamentalism in the Islamic world got it's fire...fighting against an imperialist super-power. The same fire we face today. Just as we fought the Soviets through the Vietnamese, they fought us through the Mujahadin in Afghanistan. Another good book told through Soviet eyes, although fiction and way out of print, is &quot;Red Army&quot; by Ralph Peters. It's a book about a war that never happened. :) If you can find it, it'll be worth it!"},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"First: I am a big fan of Military History. I love first-hand accounts, books that relive strategies/tactics/lives.This book was good, but it was missing something... First hand descriptions of what actually was going on.Borovik references a great deal of events, but never delves into them. This comes about primarily because the book is a collection of articles about the Soviet-Afghan experience. Mainly though, it was a depressing half-hearted diatribe against Soviet authorities who drove the war effort.Being a student of Soviet Studies, it was clear to me that the style was quintessentially Russian. Meaning, it talked about hardships, was vivid in visual details, and rich in melancholia. However, it lacked details on what really happened there, how troops conducted themselves, what the Afghans were like, and how the war was waged.Frankly, the book left me a bit cold. However, if you are looking for a book that gives the somber nature of the Soviet feelings towards the Afghan war, this is a decent book to read."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"This book has the taste and smell of war in it. You see the Kishlaks passed by at night, raging gunfire spewing forth through the day, you taste the axel grease, bake in the heat of the desert. Artyom Borovik captures the experience and the personality of the Afghanistan War that the Soviets unwillfully got bogged down in through the 80's.Though there are several things this book is, there are also things it is not. It is not a higher level capturing of the causes of the Afghan war. It doesn't analyze the history. It is not linear. Instead it takes a broader look at what it did to the psyche of the soldiers that fought there. It spans the globe to follow those that escaped the war to America and yet yearn to return to the rodina. Borovik's writing reads like a novel and you'll find yourself caught up in the details of military operations and wonder how he got out of there alive with a soul intact.The Afghanistan War closely resembles our Vietnam and strangely enough doesn't mirror the current war waged on terrorism, but there are lessons to be drawn from here. Outside superpower influence in countries to topple governments and sponsor leaders almost always seems to turn out poorly. The real lesson learned is to go after Bin Laden like a tribal warlord in a land where there are many factions, the terrain is unforgiving, the people strong and willful. One gets the sense that war is eternal in this country and that the people pay the price. So if we don't get diverted from our initial objectives, keep those objectives clear, we can avoid the pitfalls Borovik tells of when superpowers become involved in Afghanistan.Don't hesitate to go get this book and internalize it. Knowledge will pull us through these times."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Not only does Artyom Borovik clearly show that the USSR's occupation of Afghanistan was militarily and politically parallel to the US in Viet Nam, he does it in a style that holds our attention when the images want us to turn away. The writing is as clear and personal as anyone could be after witnessing the endless crushing brutality of Afghanistan terrain, climate, and rebel attacks.The lengthy Introduction contains many valuable conclusions, one of which is merely: stay out of Afghanistan and they will probably continue the war with each other."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Is what this book's main feature is. That, and interviews with three Soviet deserters. Most of the highlights (soldier killed 3 times, cheating wives, going back home) are the same kind of things soldiers trade over chow. The only military application you could get out of it is: Always bring sappers. The complaints of corruption, brown noses advancing over hard workers, unclear mission and directives, are in every army that has ever been. Overall, it did not live up to the hype, but I did learn allot of slang off it."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"There are actually 2 books combined in \\"Hidden War\\". The first is a few years in to the war when the writer a journalist, who has been to the USA several time and knows a bit about the west, writes as a adventure, propaganda piece. He includes the feeling of the soldiers and commanders at the time. Several years pass and the writer has been back to the USA and interviewed several soldiers who have surrendered to the mujahadin and been expatriated to the west. Also Glasnost or Openness is in full force in the USSR. The army is pulling out after 8 years of a war that produced nothing. The change in tone of the second book is sharp when compared to the hope of doing their duty in the first book.Mistakes are made by people attempting to draw parallels between America's wars in Vietnam or Iraq. This would be a mistake and reading 'Hidden War' would prove this. The United States is not the Soviet Union, decayed and on the brink of collapse. No is the media as tightly controlled as in the first part of this book (the book was written after the Soviet Union imploded, it could not have been published before then). There are no conscripts in the American Army as there is in the Soviet or Russian armies.This is a good book about a war many in the west have forgotten due to the current war in Afghanistan."},{"Title":"The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan","review":"Borovik died before getting the chance to re-edit the book, so what you'll get is a striking juxtaposition of stances toward the Russian-Afghan war. The first section of the book was written in 1987, when Borovik was working for the Soviet magazine Ogonyok. It's the sort of patriotic, sentimental journalism you'd get a 19th-c. British or 20th-c. American reporter: lots of conversations with goodhearted, homesick grunts, but very little thought about what they're doing or whether it's working.The second part of the book describes the very messy withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Afghanistan. It was written only two years later, but it's a completely different style of journalism. With the Soviet verities crumbling, Borovik can describe the chaos and folly of an Imperial war gone wrong. His account of the Soviet convoys trying to get through the Salang Pass without being ambushed is a weirdly lyrical, beautiful description of military failure as high drama.This isn't an account of the war, nor a carefully-crafted essay on war journalism. It's a collection of articles by a very good journalist describing the collapse of his country, as refracted in the latter stages of the disastrous Soviet Afghan adventure."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"This book is long, complicated, lots of flashbacks, historical references, and thoroughly engrossing. When I first started it I read a few pages and decided I didn't like it. I put the book aside for a day or two, then went I picked it up again, I became so interested in the story I could hardly put it down. This is the second book I have read by William Martin, and I must say, he can sure tell a good story. I glad I gave the book a second chance. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"a family saga told in parallel histories of the early 19th and the mid to late 20th centuries, spanning six generations. historic boston makes for a prominent backdrop for an elaborately plotted metropolitan treasure hunt doomed by a fatal curse. contrivances aside, an entertaining, nearly folkloric tale."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I bought this book based on several 5-star evaluations here in Amazon, but I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed (which doesn't happen very often). I admit that the plot was interesting and I learned more about Boston than I knew before. However, many of the characters (especially the present-day ones) seemed very two-dimensional. It was hard to tell who was supposed to be driving the action -- it wasn't entirely third-person (which would have been logical in an historical novel) and it wasn't written through the eyes of only one or two characters. For example, a lot of space is given to Fallon the contemporary writer, and he seems to be the one that should draw our focus, but his intentions are all over the map. In fact, every time a new person is introduced, we get glimpses of that person's point-of-view too. I found it disconcerting to read the thoughts of a character in one paragraph, then have to guess what might have motivated their actions in the next one.Maybe it's an older style of writing (the book was originally written in 1979), but I found the descriptions of relationships between people especially clumsy. I don't know if I'd have finished &quot;Back Bay&quot; if I hadn't been on a trip to a foreign country with no opportunity to find something else in English. I certainly appreciate Michener more than I did as a result of reading this attempt at his kind of storytelling."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"This is my first review so bear with me. This book required a fair amount of concentration on my part - I couldn't always fly through it which I sometimes like to do. It has a lot of detail and historical information which was fine but as I said requires concentration. There's a good mysetery at the center of it. I will read more William Martin but I'm taking a break with an Amanda Quick novel."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"Well-researched, dense and exciting, Back Bay is a near-perfect historical thriller. The fate of a priceless Revere tea service made for George Washington and missing since the War of 1812 is the mystery around which Mr. Martin tells the story of Boston. Alternating between the search for the tea service in the present and its past adventures in the custody of the Pratt family, the events of Back Bay have the ring of truth. Impeccably researched and starring some great characters both heroic and villainous from all eras of American history, Back Bay is a great story told by a wonderful story-teller.My only complaint is that the dialogue didn't flow very well, but I think the author will improve with practice. I can't wait to read the other two books in the Peter Fallon series; Harvard Yard and The Lost Constitution. I can't believe I missed these books when they first came out!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"Having so thoroughly enjoyed my first William Martin novel,moving immediately to another one was the only obvious choice. Fortunately, Mr. Martin has a wonderful catalogue going back several decades, and a nifty website to aid in such decisions. After starting with his latest novel, \\"Lost Constitution,\\" (please see also) going back to his initial book seemed logical.\\"Back Bay\\" is an amazing story. Once again, this author's unique style of meshing two completely separate story lines, divided by hundreds of years, into one incredible plot made this tale a pure delight for a life-long lover of historical fiction. One can't help but wonder at times if the creators of the wildly popular National Treasure stories are also devotees of this remarkable author, so similar are parts of the concepts of both books and movies. (Martin's came way before Cage, however.)And it was indeed pleasantly surprising to find the genesis for his continuing characters in this great story as well.The amount of research which Martin VERY obviously puts into novels leaves the reader to ponder whether or not he perhaps knows something the rest of us don't: is he possibly privy to long-lost knowledge beyond the realm of regular research? Is some of his fiction possibly NONfiction? His books are so cleverly crafted that one is honestly left wondering at times. YES!! This book really is THAT GOOD.Blending an amazing Paul Revere tea set, long lost to history and therefore questionable in its provenance, with the very beginnings of what will become the fantastic cosmopolitan majesty of early Boston,and ample early political intrigue thrown in, Martin lays the foundations for the earlier of the two stories. Then jump ahead to the present, and take the same ingredients, add some eccentric family members, a grad student, the required ne'er-do-wells,and stir well. Read deliciously till done. Voila!! A tale of universal appeal for readers of several genres. It is highly unlikely that ANY reader could not find it fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable, start to finish.This book is unquestionably worthy of topping a need-to-read list.What a tale it tells!!!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"Over the past year I have become a huge fan of William Martin. I discovered THE LOST CONSTITUTION by accident, and after reading it, soon worked my way through BACK BAY, HARVARD YARD and CAPE COD.BACK BAY is a terrific tale of the depths to which some will go to pursue the target of their vanity. With twists and turns in every chapter, you'll be entertained and surprised."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"One minute you are standing beside Dolly Madison breathing the acrid smoke of burning buildings in DC, the next in a mud bog watching the White House tea set being buried, then a headspinning rip through time to current generations seeking the tea set. Dynamite igniting, people dying, history being relived and right when you almost have your hands on the Paul Revere silver beauty.....well -- you MUST read this book. This is the best of the best. I am making my way through all of Martin's books -- and I have not yet been disappointed."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"William Martin is definitely a master storyteller. If you add the historical events, it makes this book a sure winner. I live in Boston and I loved this book, I could not put it down. His Cape Cod book is another win. You learn history without having to memorize dates!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I found Back Bay fascinating the way it traveled through the generations back and forth. First you are in 1789, then next chapter in the 1970's,, then in 1800's. Yet it all flowed as you discovered information about the generations of the Pratt family. Fast moving. Great story writer."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book and &#34;the lost constitution&#34;. W.

The plot is exciting. I also really enjoyed his book \\"Cape Cod\\"."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"It's not easy to describe this book. After all it's long and it's very very deep with a lot of characters that you may not realize their significance at first. But in the end, and thank goodness for the family tree at the beginning, you realize why everyone was mentioned and their significance.I'll admit there are some parts in the beginning that can be confusing, and it's difficult to understand their significance. Also, some characters aren't fully understood until after their characters have been in the book for a little while, which is a very interesting style of writing that I found fascinating. For example, you will be dealing with a character who you have met, and learned about on the surface, for a decent amount of time. But until you are maybe halfway or further into the book their significance isn't entirely clear. This may be a determent for some, but when things start to be revealed all the pieces fall in.I loved this book. I found it amazingly gripping and outstandingly interesting. The characters all fit their parts, and there are many of them, and all are interesting even the seemingly insignificant ones. The beginning is a shocker, when you figure out what it's leading to and certain other parts...it's just unbelievable. I highly recommend this book, and though some people seem dissatisfied with the ending I encourage everyone to read it and you'll realize why William Martin ended it the way he did. Because in my opinion it makes sense."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"this is my first William Martin book ive read ... i've lived in Boston for a few years and LOVE the city this is such a perfect book .. its gripping, surprising and such fun to read! great blend of history and fiction"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"This is the first William Martin that I have read. I enjoyed the story although the characters were a little too predictable. I was disappointed in the history. I had hoped for more color of the times, this was history 101 and I wanted more depth. The ending was disappointing. This is not a totally negative review. I enjoyed the description of the development of Boston. I will read another but I am not really impressed."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"This is the second book I have read by William Martin (I previously ready THE LOST CONSTITUTION and have just started my third -- CAPE COD) and he is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors. Most appealing to me is the way he interweaves a history lesson with a compelling plot and a present-day story. His books help you understand the connection of the past to the present while never ceasing to entertain. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the path our nation has taken from the years just after the revolution to the present day, as well as to anyone who enjoys a fun and plot-twisting treasure hunt!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"Though written 30 years ago, I found this book incredibly entertaining while at the same time challenging.

An enjoyable read at the beach or on the train."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I read this gripping saga when it was first published some 20 years ago. Since then, I've recommended it to friends and to newcomers to Boston. Recently, I bought a copy at a local library sale and began to re-read it. I am as caught up in it now as I was all those years ago when I first read it. Martin's &quot;Back Bay&quot; does withstand the test of time. The story is cleverly told by the use of flashback. The reader learns the secret and the mystery of the Pratt family early in the book but must wait for the revelation and solution along with the characters who live in the 20th century. The story is a marvelous blend of fact and fiction and is a must read for anyone who loves Boston, history, and mystery. I would also recommend, as a companion book, Walter Muir Whitehill's topographical history of Boston."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"William Martin takes his place as the premier historical novelist of our generation. He capably wears the mantle passed down from Michener as story telling historian. He makes us want to learn history. His stories are living entities not a collection of memorized dates. Back Bay carries on the tradition of Cape Cod in both educating and entertaining the reader. This is an art he has refined in Annnapolis and Citizen Washington. While I loved Michener, I often found his introduction a bit laborious. Martin immediately immerses the reader in the story and pulls you along with such compelling force that one rarely knows when to one can take a break. Having live in Boston, I learned more intwo days of reading than in the 3 years of living. From South Boston to the Commons and Beacon Hill, this story brings one of America's first cities alive. The city is the main character."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I am not always much of a reader, but this book caught me from the first pages. It is a MUST for anyone who knows and/or loves the city of Boston and the history that goes along with it. I found myself visualizing the streets and areas of Boston as I read each chapter. My only disappointment was the ending...I could not believe that I was on the last page! I wanted it to end differently for the characters (thus, only 4 stars), but overall I was quite satisfied with the book. I am now going to dig into Cape Cod, but the same author."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"With HARVARD YARD, William Martin's current bestseller, still fresh in my mind, I decided to re-visit an old friend, his first book, BACK BAY. I wanted to re-acquaint myself with the younger Peter Fallon and the Kennedy-esque Pratt family, whose 'march across the 19th century,' as Martin explains, was 'a parade as sweeping, in its own way, as Sherman's march to the sea.' I wanted to once again walk the streets of that old Boston through Martin's eyes and imagination. And, of course, I wanted to re-join Peter Fallon's quest for the Paul Revere Golden Eagle Tea Set, lost to the Madisons when they left Washington. My re-visit was every bit as enjoyable as the first time around, about a quarter century ago, when BACK BAY was first published. That it is still in print, so many years later, attests to the popularity of this effort.William Martin writes enduring stories with enduring characters while ably illuminating the history of the times. If, by chance, the recent HARVARD YARD was your first of Martin's books, don't miss the opportunity to pick up BACK BAY and start from the beginning. It's a very good place to start!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"unfolds through the clever use of past history with present day characters.

It remains hidden and the facts from the past intertwine with modern characters. It has greed, power, lust, murder, and mystery all in one excitingnovel. Martin's scenes of old Boston are a wonder. I can't say more about the plot without ruining it foryou, but I will say this book deserves more than the 5 stars they will allow me"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I am a Historian so I thought that this book would be an interesting read. All in all this was a good book. I liked the way Mr. Martin would weave the past with what is going on in the future. It was an intriguing story and for the most part I really enjoyed the book. The problem was the ending. Without giving too much detail, the ending of this book was disappointing. After all the build up, it seemed as though Mr. Martin did not know what to do with the ending. I was left with this sense of, \\"I read this whole book for that?\\" feeling. I am willing to give this author another shot. He is a good writer and he does a good job of weaving history throughout his books. I just hope my second read does not end the way the first one did."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"I read the book in just three sittings because I couldn't put it down! I was tempted to go to Boston and look for the treasure myself! It was great to see the tea set make a guest appearance in Martin's &quot;Annapolis&quot;! If you're just getting into reading historical fiction, or have been reading it for years, this is a great book to add to your collection! &quot;Cape Cod&quot; is right up there with it! Lots of history and lots of mystery!"},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"This was a lively read about a wealthy family in Boston. The story is told in chapters that alternate between modern times (the late 1970s, anyway) and the past, as the family is haunted by its relationship to a Paul Revere tea set. The story is well told, but it seems obvious that the author is a historian -- the story and characters in the past, with a few exceptions, seem much more interesting.Still, this is a fun read, particularly if you're interested in Boston's history."},{"Title":"Back Bay","review":"If you have never been to Boston you will like this book. If you have been or live in Boston, you will LOVE this book. The story is great and William Martin takes you on an adventure that keeps you turning the pages.

Before the ending, there is also very sloppy plotting - two 'bad-guys' who have been killed at an apartment in Cambridge turn up a few chapters later digging a hole in a basement! While the weaving of the plot through Boston's history is clever, and is the best part of the story, the motivations of the main characters in the present day are not clear, and there are jumps in the story that don't make sense. It is OK as a Beach Read, so long as you can suspend disbelief and ignore the errors and inconsistencies in the story structure.The same writer's 'Harvard Yard' is a much better book, but also has a weak and disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Hospital industrial engineering;: A guide to the improvement of hospital management systems (Reinhold industrial engineering and management sciences series)","review":"This book, published in 1966 by Reinhold, pioneered a new approach to the improvement of hospital systems. It was superceded in 1982 by an updated version entitled \\"Hospital Management Engineering\\", published by Prentice-Hall. Both of these books had a profound impact on the development of the field of hospital systems. However, one should not look to either of these books for guidance in today's environment. Significant changes in information systems and in reimbursement arrangements have created an entirely different milieu.

I give this one three stars because it doesn't particularly flow. I think it could also stand to have something of a history on the Promise Keepers at some point, but I'll get to that in a minute.I read this book because I work with the editor of the book, Rhys H. Williams. The book is essentially six academic papers/essays reporting findings on the Promise Keepers . Rhys H. Williams gives an introduction to the book and his sister, Gwyneth Williams gives an epilogue/postscript exploring the change roles and expectations of men as father's and husbands.In the introduction, Rhys explains how the book came together and of what it consists. He also briefly talks about how difficult it is to approach a social phenomenon and gain an understanding of it. And, Rhys includes very brief comments on each of the chapters in the book. I felt the introduction could have better grounded the reader by first including a history of the Promise Keepers. It would not have to be a very long history, but detailed enough for the reader to understand the group that that is being studied.The chapters include qualitative and quantitative studies examining different aspects of the Promise Keepers. The chapters range from how the Promise Keepers view race to the different gender roles that are espoused by the movement's leaders and the movement's participants.After reading the monograph (it isn't really a book), I did feel that I had a better understanding of the Promise Keepers. As the monograph explains, the Promise Keepers, though definitely situated further on the right than on the left in political and religious terms, are not exclusively so. There is a wide variety of views within the group and an increasing variety of educational levels and ethnicities.Overall, the book is academic in nature and not for the average reader. In a sense this may be 'too bad' because the information contained in the monograph could be very useful for individuals that are considering joining the group but would not be readily accessible as easy reading for them.If you have an academic interest in the Promise Keepers then this book is likely a must. Or, if you interested in social movements and religion, this book might also be of interest to you. But for the average layperson that does not have a background in the social sciences, this probably isn't the book you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Formula For Happiness","review":"Finally! A commonsense approach to improving one's life! Unlike other authors and psychologists who insist that one's level of happiness is dependent on how you were raised, your station in life, or biochemistry, this book puts it firmly in the reader's control. In simple, down-to-earth terms that anyone can easily follow, the authors outline a step-by-step course of action toward obtaining greater happiness in life from right where you are. When this 'formula' is applied on a day to day basis, it can improve anyone's quality of life, regardless of education level, social standing or religious or philosophical belief system. I've just finished reading The Formula for Happiness for the first time, and it's given me a lot to think about. It's also given me the motivation to look at the areas in my life that could stand improvement as well as the hope that I have the ability to change those things for the better and enjoy a greater level of happiness and contentment in my life.
