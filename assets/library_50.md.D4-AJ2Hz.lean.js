Arguably the creator of what we now refer to as \\"modern dance,\\" Isadora Duncan certainly filled her \\"sensational\\" personal life with a series of adventures and misadventures while struggling to sustain a career during which so many of her knowledgeable contemporaries praised her artistic talents and achievements. Consider these comments:\\"I got an impression of enormous grace, and enormous power in her dancing -- she was very serious, and held the audience and held them completely.\\" (Frederick Ashton)\\"She moved with those wonderful steps of hers with simplicity and detachment that could only come through the intuition of genius itself.\\" (Tamara Karsavina)\\"She incarnated music in her dance.\\" (Serge Kousevitsky)\\"The soul becomes drunk with this endless succession of beautiful lines and groupings [of movement].\\" (Ernest Newman)\\"The greatest woman I have ever known....Sometimes I think she is the greatest woman the world has ever known.\\" (Rodin)Impressive accolades indeed which, for me, increase the poignancy (at times the tragedy) of her poor judgment and irresponsible behavior when not performing before an always adoring audience. Even for those who know little (if anything) about dance, Kurth has written an absorbing, at times compelling biography of a woman who (in the words of a contemporary, Janet Flanner) embodied \\"the grandeur of permanent ideals...[but was] too expansive for personal salvation.\\"By the time I approached the final chapter of Kurth's biography, I had observed a number of similarities between Isadora's life and the lives of Edna St. Vincent Millay and Sylvia Plath. For example, their original and substantial talent, their excessive self-indulgences, their passion for experiencing (both physically and emotionally) as much as possible each day, and their vulnerabilities which so many others exploited shamelessly. With Whitman in mind, Robert Gottlieb observes: \\"For Isadora there were no rules, there was only the Song of Herself; she lacked the discipline, the emotional and moral resources, to keep liberty from lapsing into license.\\" Such is often the fate of a genius which, by most accounts, Isadora Duncan was. \\"Sensational\\" indeed."},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"I have read many biographies, from Saint-Exup&eacute;rie to Rockefeller, and thanks to the feedback system of Amazon and the editioral reviews, it is quite possible to filter out the good ones from the mediocre.Needless to say this biography stands out from many others and I think it is one of my favourites I have read so far. I said in the title that it should have won the Pulitzer price, although I do not know whether biographies are eligible for this. But it shows why Peter Kurth, the author, needed 10 years to complete it.What can my review add on the information available?First of all, read the editiorials, they give good information on what this book, and what Isadora is about. Usually only the positive reviews are kept, but in this case, for a reason. This biography is indeed written as all biographies should be written; well researched, not confusing, as detailed as possible without getting boring, and intertwined with the times that in this case Isadora lived, and finally neutral in style yet intriguing.Peter Kurth does all these things. Even the title does her life justice, for after reading this book, one can only conclude her life, as well as her death, truly was sensational. Especially for a woman in those days to achieve and do what she did is amazing. Even now, a Madonna would not make the grade in comparison to Isadora.Isadora virtually created the 'natural' modern dance as opposed to the Russian ballet, which she considered merely as stiff and hysterical hopping that proved flying indeed was impossible for human beings. As some said, it was as if she gave something back to the people, something natural that was lost and found again.She was probably as influential as Martha Graham was later in the century, but totally opposite style. Some said you should have seen her dance to die happily. We will never know, since apart from all the crowds she drew which no longer are with us, she was never caught on film. Maybe better that way, since it only adds more to the cachet of legend she has and had.It is just wonderful to read a story on how some humans do it; rise from nothing to stardom, 'just' with hard work, perseverance, good ideas, and genius. Her life was a constant struggle to renew her art and to sell her idea to the world that often was not ready for it. Of course like all of us she needed love, and she knew how to get it. But just like Callas' tragedy, or Dalida's dictum \`my life was a success, but what was it, really?', it also casts yet another light on that mystery called fame, and the Faustian bargain that somehow always comes with it. When Isadora met her mother years later, she asked herself; \`We had set off to look for fame and fortune. Both had been found, so why the result was so tragic?'The reason for this was that her life was not only full of the glamour of travel, intrigue, and meeting everyone from Steichen to Fairbanks to Valentino to Chaplin, but also because it was full of tragedy.She never really found the right lover, or husband in her life. She never could keep a secure fortune, and like so many artists, she could not really cope with aging.But perhaps her life is also a glorious proof of how wonderful life is, no matter the tragedy, and how she somehow was always driven to go on with her art and her glamorous lifestyle, despite even having lost all of her three children. In short; what a life, and apart from the tragedy, what fun she must have had! Her equally legendary death only adds to the thrill of this all!"},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"This is an excellent biography of one of Art's greatest figures. It is a long, thorough, detailed look at every aspect of Isadora's amazing life and career. She lived life to the hilt. She spent more money than she could earn. She loved sex and champagne. She didn't care whom she shocked. She lived, danced, and loved by her own rules. Expose your breasts in Boston?--why not? Advocate Communism in the U.S. hinterlands?--of course!From her early scandals to her incredibly grotesque death (much worse than portrayed in the Vanessa Redgrave movie), Isadora moved in an elite heightened world, drinking and carousing with the other great names of the European modernist movements. This book lets us view a lot of those encounters. Epigrams fly like lightning bolts. Insults are flung like spears. We get 558 pages of main text, heavily documented. Letters are quoted. Other writers are cited.The book is well-written. (I object to \\"vocal chords\\" on p. 29) If you want to bathe in the hothouse world of famous influential artists who changed our world, you should read this great biography, which not only gives you a total picture of Isadora's life and impact on dance, but also lets us enjoy the many other famous artists whose orbits often crossed hers. There are lots of good pictures, which give you an idea of how people were mesmerized by her posings, posturings, and gestures. I can recommend this wonderful book without any hesitation."},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"Isadora was as beautiful dancing as she was a person, being one of the most remarkable individuals and talented dancers of her time, perhaps of all time. She was the matriarch and patron saint of creative self expression, by inventing her own physical language to express the spirit that touched the soul with simple but beautiful movement. She was a pioneer in the dance world, being in possession of a name that is synonymous with originality and distinctiveness, a beholder of spontaneity and intrigue. Her tragic death in nineteen twenty seven came as a shock, as she was strangled by her own scarf during a joyride on the French Riviera; that some say was a dramatically fitting end to a remarkable life. This is an incredible biography of a magnificent, generous and gallant woman who was also sadly fated with a life that was full of tragedy (such as with the drowning of her two children). She was plagued by alcoholism and frowned upon at times with scorn, as she did not always act as she should, especially in one particular instance during an American tour in Boston where she expressed no reserve. This account of a most astounding woman and dancer is very detailed and which uncovers the mystery behind the passionate artist, giving the most accurate account of her life.Complete with stunning photographs, complimented with a beautiful cover, this is a book to treasure. She brought ancient Greek dancing to life with her energy, skill and expressive dancing that was so full of energy and emotions, making one feel as if they were watching something of myth or legend right in front of their very eyes. It also delves into her personal life, loves and the Duncan school in Grunewald that was such a significant part of her life as she traveled between Greece and Berlin. When she then journeyed to America her story really comes alive, in those moments on stage that will always be remembered. Her constant exploring from France to Vienna and England kept a restless soul at peace, as she continued to raise a family and support her husband whilst retaining that deep seated love for dance. Her second school in Bellevue was a turning point in her career, as she takes on the role of a mothering teacher who guides the next generation forwards with love and the knowledge of her craft. Performances such as La Marseillaise spring to mind, as you think of this iconic figure within dance history, who was a pioneer that established the first foundation blocks.Just exceptionally brilliant and unforgettable this fantastic biography is one that all dance lovers (both Greek, classical ballet and modern dance) lovers will cherish."},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"This is a great book that you cannot put down. The author does an amazing job telling the story of Isadora's life and giving the picture of the importance of her work in its historical context. I learned so much about her life, her work and importance of it related to what we see as modern dance and theater."},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"Isadora Duncan was a larger than life figure of the first part of the century. Both her work and her lifestyle guaranteed her the attention of the world. Mr. Kurth's biography brings the innovative dancer back to life clarifying many details at the same time. Ms. Duncan tended to either gloss over or sensationalize various aspects of her history and this book separates fact from fantasy. The photographs are very good, as is the narrative."},{"Title":"Isadora","review":"Yes...save our souls. I realize that Morse Code is sadly no longer in use but for a perspective of women denied, degraded, diminished, deadened by cultures throughout history both metaphorically and literally insofar as their vast contribution to art, this book is simply divine! It is not only a page-turner, it is a classic and stellar contribution to understanding a complex soul, who sought dignity and got the back-of-the-hand from many in the world of her time. Her courage alone is worth reading about. I cannot judge her. I didn't know her! But this is a fine work and brings the reader into a realm of both this woman's glory and grief such that it really focuses the lense on how hard human beings can be with one another.

Vol. IV : The 20th Century in Europe; the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Churches","review":"Kenneth Scott Latourette (1884-1968) was an American historian of Christianity, who had been a missionary to China in the early 20th century; he is also the author of the comprehensive 1953 history,A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)andA History of Christianity, Volume II: Reformation to the Present. This volume was first published in 1961; the last volume in the series isChristianity in a Revolutionary Age. Vol. V : The 20th Century Outside Europe; the Americas, the Pacific, Asia and Africa, the Emerging World Christian Community.He begins by observing, \\"One of the most thought-provoking facts about World Wars I and II was that they centered in Europe. There Christianity had longer had a nearer approach to free course than anywhere else on the planet.\\" (Pg. 2)He notes, \\"The Lateran Accord eased but did not fully remove the friction between church and state. Complete accord could scarcely be expected. Here were two powers, each believing ... conflicting convictions as to the nature of the state. Pius XI did not hesitate to criticize (Mussolini's Italy). He declared that a good Catholic could not assent to it.\\" (Pg. 34)He comments, \\"An effort to bring back to the faith the class where de-Christianization had proceeded furthest, the labourers in mines and industries, was made by the worker-priests. It attracted much attention... The adjustment to the life of the working classes required courage of no mean order.\\" (Pg. 141)He summarizes in conclusion, \\"In some ways the Protestantism of Europe appeared to have responded less successfully to the challenge of the twentieth century than had Roman Catholicism... The Industrial Revolution had had its beginnings and earliest development in Protestant Britain... the most daring and disturbing studies of the Bible had been by Protestant scholars, and the convulsive nationalism of the twentieth century had had its most assertive initial expression in the predominantly Protestant Germany of the nineteenth century... European Protestantism might seem at least to be succumbing to the forces which it had helped to evoke... Undebatable was the fact that ... its share in the world-wide spread of the faith was much less than in the nineteenth century.\\" (Pg. 541-542)This series is a very helpful supplement to Latourette's 'A History of Christianity.'"},{"Title":"The Viking-Age Rune-Stones: Custom and Commemoration in Early Medieval Scandinavia","review":"Rarely does a book come out with such good work on the subject, due to its lack of commercial \\"sex appeal\\" for buyers.Heck, this is not an 8th grade level book and you will need some knowledge beforehand to make your own decisions about its subject matter.But a splendid book over all, a MUST have for serious Nordic study's I just wish the author had the time (and funding) to write much more on the area!"},{"Title":"Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars (Studies in Popular Culture)","review":"The material is fascinating, and leaves you wanting more. Hazelgrove has trawled through mediums' biographies, books on spiritualism, novels based on the subject, accounts of visits to seances. From this wealth of forgotten literature she has distilled the essence of attitudes to spiritualism that spill out into wider considerations of religion and science. She has the current feminist academic attitude. She doesn't judge on the truth or otherwise of accounts of messages from the dead, or the appearance of ectoplasm. Instead she considers what these happenings meant to the people involved, and to society who viewed them with ambivalence. But she is by no means as fair as she pretends to be. She can't mention science without an ill-concealed sneer, always referring to it as 'the Englightenment/scientism project' or some such cliche. I agree that ideas of the soul, or of women's place in society, are part of narratives - stories that people tell themselves. But when she considers actual narratives - the autobiographies of mediums - she accepts them at face value instead of seeing them as the literary genre they obviously are. And surely nearly all of them were GHOST-written? No one can fail to sympathise with the distress of medium Helen Duncan, who was subjected to painful indignities disguised as scientific tests of her powers. But what part did her husband play in forcing her to produce phenomena? The testers paid handsomely, probably more than the bereaved sitters who came to her seances. Hazelgrove clearly inhabits a society in which the 'scientistic paradigm' is by no means a dogma, and I suspect she objects to science because it makes belief in a spiritual realm difficult. That's just a speculation on my part, but it's mild compared to her - I can only call them dogmatic - statements about the unconscious, the psyche, the other, the mother and whathaveyou. I enjoyed this book, but I'd love to read a much longer and less prejudiced work using the same material. She writes well and clearly, despite feeling obliged to use words like 'hegemonic' and 'interpellation.'"},{"Title":"Snare in the Dark","review":"Frank Parrish's Dan Mallett novels are unjustly neglected little gems, with twisty plots and lyrical descriptions of the English countryside. His detective is an unusual and memorable character; pushed into a banking career by his ambitious mother, he takes up his father's &quot;career&quot; of poaching after his death. When his mother needs a hip replacement and refuses to go to the public hospital, he begins stealing to save up the necessary money.A Snare in the Dark is the third in this series. Dan is preparing to snare partridges from a game preserve when he witnesses the murder of the gamekeeper. Fearing that the police suspect him, he goes into hiding while desperately trying to find out whom the gamekeeper was blackmailing and therefore who killed him. Following a false lead almost exposes him, and he goes to ground in a nursing home, where he finds a new lover and grave danger. As in the other books in the series, wonderful outdoors scenes (the fox cub hunt is a memorable sequence), interesting facts about poaching, and a twisty mystery -- and at the end of this one, a hint of a new relationship with the local police.If you like M.C. Beaton's defiantly unambitious Hamish Macbeth, you may also enjoy Dan Mallett."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Anne Shirley, now a teacher, has still got that admirable enthusiasm and optimistic spirit within her that keeps the reader's spirit up and interested.

She always seems to make out the best of unpleasant situations that come her way. She takes the time to look past the negative subject and searches for an optimistic point instead. This book is full of Anne's ability to handle things with a joyful attitude (, for example with the unfortunate conditions of Marilla's eyesight).

Additionally, I feel like I as a reader got demoted. While Anne and Gilbert have their lives, the reader gets relegated to the kiddie table to see what hi-jinx the children are up to. I'm sure the children are great, but I've followed Anne from eleven years old, and I want to stay with her. I felt condescended to.The quilting chapter bored me utterly to death. The other characters that were introduced came and went too quickly...except for Aunt Mary Maria, I felt cheated out of getting to know anyone. The whole book is too much telling, not enough showing.

How often spoken or written are those words? I believe that phrase is something young girls must recognize as well as understand in life. For beauty is fleeting and knowledge is eternal.

Although she is now sixteen and a fully fledged schoolmarm, she still displays the irrepressible knack for getting into scrapes that she had as a child, which include falling through a roof, dying her nose a ghastly colour, losing her temper with the irrascible Mr Harrison, her next door neighbour, and sowing the first seeds of love with Gilbert Blythe.Millions of readers around the world are forever thankful that Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote several more books about Anne's escapades, for if she hadn't, we would forever be wondering what would have become of Anne, asking ourselves what kind of teacher would she have been like, would she have gone on to university, would she have married Gilbert Blythe and borne his children? When we contemplate asking ourselves these questions, we would perhaps feel amazed that a mere literary character has had such a profound effect on our lives.

The book revolves, mostly, around the adventures of Anne's children, none of which were in the least bit interesting. Her children's stories all follow one main plotline. 1: I'm going to be naughty even though mother and everyone says I should be good. 2: Oh, it really was horrible wanting to be naughty, because it all turned out badly in the end. 3: Mother's holding me and everything's all better again. About half way through the book, I really began to wonder how two such interesting characters as Anne and Gilbert could have possibly had not 1, but 6 dull, rather stupid, flighty children. Even their imaginings, which, in Anne seemed so interesting, were all terribly lackluster and idiotic in her children. There was absolutely no character development of Anne or Gilbert, which, I rather felt there should have been, considering the book takes place over quite a number of years. Anne is nothing more than window dressing, brought in and out of the scenes in the most haphazard fashion. Gilbert spends the entire book going from work to more work, and yet another spat of work, before starting it all over again. Everything that I enjoyed so much about their earlier romance was gone completely, and the end, to which the back of the book aludes is flat at best. Anne does nothing to 'win' Gilbert's love all over again. It's practically all of one chapter. 1: Anne has a fit, and is sure Gilbert no longer loves her(which, if I were writing Gilbert, considering how utterly boring Montgomery writes her out to be, would be completely understandable). 2: Anne gets jealous. 3: Anne and Gilbert come home and suddenly everything's right in the world again. I was thankful to finally finish this book, something I've never felt with the first 5. With those it was always, Good grief, it's over already? All in all, if you're HUGE Anne fan, you might want to read this book simply to have read another book into which Anne figures. But don't expect her to be anything like the old Anne so many came to love and respect."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" is the sixth book in L.M. Montgomery's \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series, but it was the last of the eight books written. Montgomery had originally ended her series in 1920 with \\"Rilla of Ingleside.\\" In 1936 she wrote \\"Anne of Windy Poplars,\\" which became the fourth book and fit in between \\"Anne of the Island\\" and \\"Anne's House of Dreams,\\" covering the three years the red-headed orphan spent teaching while waiting for Gilbert to finish medical school. \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" was written in 1939 and is set ten years after \\"Anne's House of Dreams,\\" and before \\"Rainbow Valley.\\" This allows Montgomery the opportunity to retroactively foreshadow what would happen to her son Walter in the World War and other aspects of the final pair of books.At this point Anne and Gilbert have five children, are about to have a sixth, and have made Glen St. Mary into a home. But then Gilbert's maiden Aunt Mary Maria arrives and puts a serious damper on the happy household. Anne's primary focus is on her children and their daily little crises, although Jem wanting a dog turns out to be a constant concern. It takes a little get used to Anne Shirley being a mother, but what is impossible to believe is that Anne is suddenly worried that Gilbert no longer loves her. But Anne is not only convinced of this, but is equally sure that Gilbert is interested in somebody else, the widowed Mrs. Andrew Dawson of Winnipeg, who was formerly Christine Stuart. Yes, the same Christine Stuart that Anne was jealous of in \\"Anne of the Island\\" when she thought Gilbert was dating her, even though the truth was he was simply providing her with an escort since her fiance was out of town. Apparently our Anne-girl can be fooled twice and the entire business is carried all the way until the final chapter, which is why I round down on this one. It has to be clear to all those who love the character of Anne Shirley and the writing of L.M. Montgomery that this novel is on the bottom shelf and it is there for good reason.This was Montgomery's last novel, her previous effort being \\"Jane of Lantern Hill\\" in 1937. That was a solid story about a young girl reconciling her parents, but \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" really does seem like Montgomery took everything she had left and mixed it together for a last novel. At the end Montgomery describes Anne in her white gown, her hair in two long braids, looking, \\"like the Anne of Green Gables days . . . of Redmond days . . . of the House of Dreams days. That inward glow was still shining through her.\\" That is what we want to hear, but it is really too little too late. However, just accept that this book is an abberation. Even though the Blythes are secondary characters in the next book, \\"Rainbow Valley,\\" is it one of my favorites and the story of the Blythes during the World War makes for a fascinating ending to the story, even if it is far removed from where we started with the red-headed orphan who was adopted by Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This book is awesome! Although I have to admit, that some books are better, say \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\". I've recommended the \\"Anne\\" series to all my friends and they've promised me that they'd read it, for my sake. Even my librarian is as desperate as I am trying to find the rest of the books in the series. \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" has it's ups and downs but mostly it's all ups!"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This books was only written in 1939, three years before Montgomery's death and slipped in as the 6th volume long after what is now volume 7 and 8 were published. It has little of the lightheartedness of the earlier Anne books. It is more like a collection of short stories, were chapters are dedicated to the different children of Anne. Many of the stories are filled with bitterness and spite and bad gossip. Gossip has always been a part of the Anne books, but here it shows its nasty side, its destructiveness. It is not the entertaining gossip of good hearted women like Mrs. Rachel Lynde or Miss Cornelia. The children have again and again very painful experiences within their social circle and their disappointment in friends somehow doesn't seem to be theirs but the authors. To make matters worse, the book has no story line and is barely held together by the cycle of the year with its seasons.It feels very much like this book was not written because Montgomery wanted to, but she had to, whether under pressure from readers, the publisher or others and she did not enjoy it. It reflects a negativity and bitterness that is hard to take and one has to wonder what frame of mind she was in when she wrote it. Fortunately, as the book was added later, it is not necessary to read it to understand the later books and can be easily skipped which is my recommendation."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"First of all, Anne does NOT stop being Anne (with an e), for example, on page 8 Anne says \\"Don't talk as if our day was ended, Diana. We're only 15 years old and kindred spirits. The air isn't just full of light ... it is light. I'm not sure that I haven't sprouted wings.\\" My favorite part of the book was when the ladies were gossiping, it was really funny. If you skip that part of the book how do you know it's boring?Susan is definatly the funniest character in the book. And who says Anne has to be a feminist?If you like Anne you should like these books."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I can't understand why so many reviewers don't like this book.

I guess I cheated by jumping right to Anne of Ingleside,but I was anxious to see how she fared with five kids, six actually, because she's pregnant when the story opens.I read it and all I can say is what a sweetadolescent book:) This story takes us on an adventure of Anneand her family. Mostly each chapter is devoted to a single family member's adventure. With three girls and three boys, there are many adventures, like the time when an aunt came and wouldn't leave,or the lesson about false friends.This was a fun book to read and I definitelygive it my highest rating:)"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I think this book was absolutely fantastic. I read this book first and then I read the others though I still have to read a couple more. A flaw in all the books I have so far read about Anne is that the author has created no romance between Anne and Gilbert . I mean a little kissing wouldn't hurt at all and it would make the books so much more romantic and sweet . I don't mean to say that the author has to be totally Danielle Steel but it would have been nice if she had made her books romantic. The worst thing in this whole book was the incessant gossiping of the old ladies at the sewing party. I skipped it because it was so boring. Nevertheless I really like these books and I think the author has described the natural beauty very NICELY. You would feel as if you were there.I find Anne's children very adorable. And I would like to inform the other readers out there that Anne has six children:Jem, Walter, Di, Nan, Shirley and Rilla. I recommend this book to all as it is full of laughter and fun."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I loved Anne of Green Gables as a movie, and I liked it even better as a book, but when I found out there were seven more books in the series I went wild!

Fortunately,the ending is better.Anne is back to the Anne of Green Gables ."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of Green Gables, but Anne of Avonlea is devoid of all that made the first lively and captivating. We rarely see the world through the descriptive lens of Anne's eyes and colorful words in the second book as we did with the first. Instead we are bludgeoned over the head with narrative bucolic scenery after narrative bucolic scenery. Gone is the tension between Anne and Gilbert and gone is the hilarity of Anne's growing pains, and no sympathy is created for the twins Anne and Marilla have adopted. It's as if Montgomery has dumped them into the story and left them there to fend for themselves. I am only halfway through, but the narrative has become so tedious and dull with scenery and very little story, that I may not be able to wade through what should have been edited and rewritten."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"this book is harder to follow but its still as good as the rest.

I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles!

Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender.

Anne's children are sweet and wonderful, and it's good to know that Gilbert still loves her after all those years! I only wish there were a book in between the previous book and this one.

I was pleasantly suprised. The wit and whimsy that was so common in Anne of Green Gables is even stronger in Anne of Avonlea. Anne never ceases to amaze me with her creative view on life. This is also a very positive story, and the emotional ending nearly brought me to tears. Another must-read in the world of Anne."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"When I first read this book, I disliked the new characters, and wanted to know about Avonlea, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde, and Diana.

At just sixteen, Anne is also the new village schoolmarm, full of good intentions for molding young minds. Many of her school mates are still in Avonlea; her beautiful Prince Edward Island home is hers to conquer.Anne will face many challenges in the next two years. She discovers the theory and practice of teaching can be quite different. Marilla's decision to adopt the orphaned young twins Dora and Davy will thrust parenting responsibilities on the willing Anne. Anne and her friends form the Avonlea Village Improvement Society, and find that the best of intentions can lead to the strangest of results. Anne's sympathy for her eccentric neighbors will lead to some interesting adventures. Her rich imagination will get her into more than one delightful fiasco.If \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" was a rounded story, complete of itself, \\"Anne of Avonlea\\" is a bridge across the last of Anne's girlhood to the woman of her future. Montgomery has the delicate touch to linger over Anne's enthusiasm for natural beauty and her delight in many deep friendships, from the lonely little schoolboy Paul Irving, to her best friend Diana, to the reclusive spinster Miss Lavender. Along the way, Anne's growing maturity is the reader's to share. In a touching final scene, Anne finally comes to glimpse clearly the future of her relationship with the handsome and patient Gilbert Blythe, a signal of childhood's end.\\"Anne of Avonlea\\" is most highly recommended to fans of the irresistable Anne Shirley and the \\"Anne\\" series."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I use to loves these books as a child and now my 8 yr old just finished Anne of Green Gables in 2 days and is hooked.

Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy&iexcl;s idea of fun includes violence and humor &iexcl;V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne&iexcl;s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her &iexcl;Sweet Teacher&iexcl;. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair &iexcl;carrots&iexcl;) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn&iexcl;t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger.

Both Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are books i bought, and will give to my children to read when they are old enough to appreciate them.I never read them as a child. I wasn't even introduced to them until I was planning a vacation to Prince Edward Island three years ago, and I read the first book. I also watched the movies which were both such wonderful adaptations.Anne of Avonlea picks up where the first one left off. Anne, who I think is the best female fictional character I've ever had the priviledge to read of, is now a teacher. She is growing up, but she still has her adventures with Diana, and her other friends.There are a few new characters are introduced, and although you don't instantly fall in love with them like Ann, they grow you. All but Davey, this character was just so annoying. THis boy was just a bad apple.I'm sure LM had good intentions, but I was utterly annoyed and it brought my feeling of the book down a bit.IF you loved the first book, you will probably enjoy this as well. There is a long series of books by LM. I am currently on break from reading her.She was a great writer, able to bring a great deal of sense of humor in her storytelling, and she is very descriptive. She really brings the characters so true to life, especially Anne.I do recommend this despite my problem w/ davey.Anne will always remain forever in my heart as a true heroine of classic literature. One of the best character to ever be put on paper..as she is kind, funny, good spirited, and what an imagination!"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"It seems that Montgomery didn't know what to fill this book with. There are some nice stories about Anne's children (who are very sweet kids indeed), but there is also the extremely boring chapter about the gossipy Ladies' Aid meeting, or the too lengthy presence of the personage of aunt Mary Maria. Anne herself has turned into a common housewife, and there is nothing left of the good naughty little girl with the great imagination or the clever and ambitious young woman. Gilbert is a doctor, Anne is &quot;Mrs Doctor&quot;, and we almost forget about the earlier school and college competions between both of them, where they are equal and both interesting. Reading the previous books one could think Anne would become a famous writer, not just the shadow of man she loves.

If you read the collections of her short stories, you realize that &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot; was slapped together with some chapters almost word-for-word her short stories, while some are more subtly lifted, while she does some original stuff to tie it together. This patchwork approach shows in an uneven story.

Is he still attracted to his college sweetheart?I didn't feel that Anne had developed enough as a character to be worth another book - maybe it's because her children (lovely as they are) are starting to dominate the book. Maybe it's because unlike the previous books, the changes in her life (e.g. moving to Ingleside and having kids) was not a major &quot;bend in the road&quot; but rather a walk down a straight one from her last book, and even though the road might be a lovely one, it does not contain as many surprises as a bend would. All of her other books had a bend, or a little twist, between them, and I feel I miss it in this book.The main characters added to this book are the children, and Susan. The children are all somewhat similar to Anne, they are not Anne herself as a child, and they all seemed a little &quot;bland&quot; to me by comparrison to her. Even though they were all difference ages, which would have made them more likely to experience different events on different levels, they do not, which is a little disappointing.Susan, on the other hand, is nothing but bland - she has her own ways, her own opinions and basically - a woman who knows her own mind, unusual as all of those above might appear to be.

The twins are kind of annoying and don't have much of a role in the story - they just kind of pop in and out. Anne's relationship with Paul Irving seems a little creepy. My daughter found Miss Lavender really creepy. When we were introduced to her - all dressed up with formal tea set out even though no guests were expected, a mute servant girl whom Miss Lavendar didn't even bother to call by her real name - my daughter said \\"I would be running out of there!\\" She reminded me of Miss Haversham in \\"Great Expectations.\\" I know she's supposed to be whimsical but she just comes off weird.

Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel.Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude.Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Maud's &quot;Anne&quot; series has captured my heart since I was a young girl. I can relate to Anne because we share a lot of the same characteristics. We are both hopeless dramatists and romantics. Anne is as hilarious as she is touching. I know I will share this beautiful story with my own daughter some day. A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This insightful, tender novel really touched on my feminine side. It is the story of the spunky Anne and her adventures in dealing with the twins, her school, and her best friends. Yes, I know, it is hard to be a 16 year old male avid L.M. Montgomery fan, but without her books, I would never have realized the world of wonder attached to novels commonly thought of as &quot;girl's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Since this book was in hardcover, I was assuming, in the lack of a date or description, that it was an earlier edition.

Anne of Avonlea is historical fiction.This book is about a girl named Anne Shirley who lives at Green Gables after being adopted. She starts teaching school at Avonlea after her education at that school and another school farther away. She stays in Avonlea and teaches at the Avonlea school for two years before she goes to college. When living and teaching at Avonlea, Anne gets acquianted with many new people, but also gets into trouble as she always does. Her new neighbor she meets when he visited her, in a very bad mood, bringing her Jersey cow back after it had eaten some of grains. She soon becomes friends with him. Her other friends she doesn't meet as abruptly and in a nervous manner as she did Mr. Harrison, the old man that brought her cow back to her. She soon becomes more like a woman and less like a girl, but she still daydreams.I liked this book because it was enthralling and made you want to keep reading it. This book was very enjoyable and you never knew what would happen next.

However, Anne learns through her failures and to my contentment, ended up with the one person whose heart truly belongs to her."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"a lovely book-though not as beautiful as the other Anne books. I was terribly disappointed with the names of Anne's children. Imagine naming your child after your sur name!(Shirley). And it seems so stuck-up somehow to name your child after yourself(Anne or Nan) I think Montgomery could have been a bit more original with regard to the names.I like their system of naming your children after people you love-like James,Walter,Rilla,Diana. So why on earth could not Anne do the same with Nan and Shirley? Otherwise quite an entertaining book- I'm a HUGE fan of all Montgomery books and my personal favourite is Rilla of Ingleside.Makes for good reading and the language is flawless and absolutely beautiful...."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"The narrator is the worst; she makes this book imposable to listen too. At first it was funny, but then I thought about how much money I wasted on the book, and how I knew I could never listen to it, then it was not funny anymore. Save your money, otherwise it is \\"your money or your sanity.\\""},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"You can tell Maud wrote this book when depressedbecause it almost tries to hard to be happy. In many ways it is a feminist's nightmare. At the end maud confronts her old Redmond class-mate Christine. And snubs her because she is childless! She is afraid that Christina is prettier than her, etc, and that Gilbert has forgotten about her. We are lead to believe that a woman is nothing without children, that her only aim in life is her children. However it is interesting to read about the birth of Rilla. That's probably the most interesting part in the book. Anne does not really have much of a role throughout the novel. It is only stories of her children. I enjoyed finding out more about them, but there were some problems. I know this book and Anne of Windy Poplars were written after the other books in the series and this may be the reason. Nan was imaginative in this one and Di, Gilbert's favorite, was the practical one. In Rainbow Valley Di is the imaginative one and Nan the practical one. There is very little of Di, the red-headed twin, in this book. If you thought there was little of Gilbert in the previous books, then be prepared for next to nothing of him in this one. He is totally seperated from his family, all he does is work. I would like to see him interact more with the children, etc. Aunt Mary Maria makes life hell for them for awhile, but in my opinion she leaves too soon for things to become too interesting. We needed some more conflict, perhaps if Aunt Mary Maria stayed and Anne and Gilbert's marriage became threatened by her....if we had been taken into Gilbert's mind: Ok, so now he has to choose between his wife and his kin who according to the book he cannot bear to bar from his house. (That is why he does not bar the horrible aunt Mary Maria out.) In addition, he character was not developed enough. There must have been something good about her! The book gives us the impression that it is trying to be too cheerful. I know L.M. need not write like this, just read \\"Emily's Quest\\" for example.In short this was my least favorite L.M. book ever. I know she wrote this and Anne of Windy Poplars at the urging of her publisher and so I forgive her."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Anne of Ingleside is the sixth book in L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series. This novel takes place about seven years after Anne's House of Dreams (book 5,) and Anne is the married mother of five children.Anne in her mid-thirties is not as fun-loving a character as she was in the earlier books. She has much more responsibility now and this is plainly illustrated for the reader in Anne of Ingleside. I understand that Anne's freedom has been curtailed a bit by her choices, but Montgomery paints her life in such a negative light that I can't help but wonder what happened to the real Anne? Anne Shirley was always a \\"when life gives you lemons, make lemonade\\" kind of girl, but as a wife and mother she seems bitter and resentful of the people around her.Most of the story however is really about Anne's children in this novel and unfortunately, they all seem like paler versions of their mother. They are a little boring and ill-formed, and their so-called \\"adventures\\" are not very interesting at all. All in all, Anne of Ingleside was a disappointment and I am worried about the next two books..."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all. The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series. My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them. Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time. This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues. I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"After reading this book, my first impression is that I wanna be a mother too! I wanna be the kind of mother like Anne...who is so comforting, understanding, caring, loving and wise all the time.

I think if I were to become a mother in the future, I would act like Anne too!"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This classic story is ruined by the wooden voice of the narrator, making it very hard to listen to. All of L. M. Montgomery's characters are so vibrant, and to hear this story read in such a deadpan fashion is awful. Even Anne sounds dull, and that's hard to achieve when you're telling the story of one of literatures most lively characters."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This sequel to Anne of Green Gables is perfect for any advanced elementary or middle school reader and is still great for all ages. If you like Anne of Green Gables, this sequel will not disappoint you. The book itself was softcover and a bit wider than average, but it was not unwieldy and I kind of prefer more text per page. No illustrations."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"My daughters and I are reading through the works of L. M. Montgomery.

Her guardian Marilla Cuthbert has adopted again, this time mischievous but adorable twins. In the midst of school and home escapades, Anne and her friends run an Avonlea Village Improvement Society, which almost backfires when the first project is a disaster. Anne also meets new neighbors. One is the irate Mr. Harrison whom everyone assumes is single and whose parrot always greets Anne with the insulting, \\"Bless my soul, what's that red-headed snippet doing here?\\" The funniest incident involves the town's weatherman, who is famous for his inaccuracies but manages to have the last laugh. As you can tell, Anne of Avonlea is a fun cozy book about small-town life.Now just because I connect with Anne on enough levels for me to consider her a kindred spirit doesn't mean everyone will. Some readers might feel that the way she can win over all but the most cankerous is too Pollyanna-like. I love Anne for this reason. She is an exemplary model of how to deal with the nice and not-so-nice people in the world. Other readers might tire of her prattle and her flights of fancy. Again, I love Anne for this reason. Once I get over being shy, I love to chat and to imagine. Anne makes these traits feel desirable. Mark Twain once called Anne \\"the sweetest creation of life ever created\\". Yet this does not mean Anne is a saccharine character. She has her errors in judgment and spitfire moments, which bring balance to her character, making Anne someone who everyone can love. If you add to this, gorgeous scenic descriptions and cozy character portrayals, you have a great sequel to the beloved Anne of Green Gables story."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Anne of Ingleside is one of the best books that I have ever read!

The quality of this series has really gone downhill since Anne was a girl, or even a young woman. Now that she has children, the book no longer focuses on her, which was really the main reason the books seemed to come alive in the beginning. Now, they drag on and on. I found myself having to skim large sections simply because nothing happens. One of the longest chapters is a quilting circle's gossip- and that's it. And it's not even gossip about characters we know or care about! A genius to the early books was that Anne either had many problems, or believed she did, and we could join in the child's angst about life. But now Anne has the ideal life she has always wanted. And there is no conflict. And hence, much of this book is simply boring. There are times when things pick up- like when her children get into trouble. We start to see something similar to the adventures of the Anne we knew. But each issue is quickly resolved within a chapter, and nothing encourages you to go on to the next pericope. There is some hope when Anne starts to dabble with match-making, but this is quickly ended before it could get very interesting. Aunt Mary Maria is a pill of a woman, and she makes for some very interesting reading- but then she leaves after the first quarter of the book, never to be seen again, and with everything unresolved.When Lucy writes of Anne's son, Jem, there is something missing. He doesn't seem like a boy somehow- or else not like a real human. And I realized that this is further developed in Lucy's treatment of Gilbert, who seems to be amazingly absent in these later books. There is no great undying love between her and Gilbert as there was in earlier books. Yes, it is mentioned, it is assumed, but we don't see it. Gilbert does very little thought or action- he is mostly wallpaper. Lucy doesn't write convincing male characters.The last third of the book picks up somewhat, with a few more conflicts for the children, and Anne's marriage appears to be in jeopardy. But I finished this book really unsure as to if I wanted to read the final installment- despite the foreshadowing of the last two pages."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Enjoy the CD book you loved as a child.

Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to \\"create\\" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in \\"Rilla of Ingleside.\\" There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is \\"Christine,\\" the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to \\"steal\\" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.

These final two books in the series tell more of Anne's story through the exploits of her 6 children and are well worth a read - both made me laugh and cry in equal measure.All of these books leave you wanting more from Anne and I believe that is the mark of a truly fabulous book! :)"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"A very fun and joyable book where L.C.

The story was so different from anything I remembered and, at the time, I reread the first three books. The television show departs drastically from the books, give or take some minor similarities. The book is charming, a little more romantic as Anne plays matchmaker and watches her friends slowly fall in love. Things at Green Gables change but Anne, herself, is still enchanting as she dreams through her life but also does what needs to be done, growing into the kind of young woman who manages to maintain her innocence and imagination.I'm curious to see how I respond to the rest of the books in the series.

There's also the arrival of GIlbert's aunt, who wears out her welcome quickly but the family has to ensure her presence because Gilbert is too clannish to simply tell her to go home. However, a gesture of thoughtfulness turns out into the unintentional mishap that sends her home, much to the joy of the children and the relief of the parents.One thing I remember fondly is Anne visiting Green Gables (with Marilla still alive) and spending time with her and her best friend Diana. When she goes back to Ingleside, she says a lovely and very Anne-like thing. I don't remember the exact words, but it went something like 'It was nice to be Anne of Green Gables again for a while, but it's a thousand times lovelier to go back as Anne of Ingleside' Ahh, home sweet home.I do wish that Anne hadn't given up her teaching job or other employment. I understand this was written back then where women were expected to be homemakers and the like, and in this book, the year is around 1899-1900, but Anne is a very intelligent and spirited woman, I'd have liked to see her juggle a part-time job or something. :P"},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"Anne of Green Gables was a wonderful debut novel for what would become a memorable series starring one of literature's most beloved characters - Anne Shirley.Anne came to Green Gables as a girl, but in this book, she is growing into a fine (but still spirited) young lady.

You will only regret the purchase."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"If I could have, I would rate this book a three star one. But I had to rate it higher, just because it's an L.M Montgomery book, and an Anne one.This book features a few new characters, one of them is a queer, bad-tempered bald man, called Mr. Harrison. Anne and her friends also start a club to improve the community, although some parts are interesting, this bores me a bit.Gilbert is not shown a lot in the book, and when he is, it's usually for a few moments or for A.V.I.S, the club. Same with Diana.You will find that this book is true to it's title, it focuses A LOT on the Avonlea school. Most of the book is about the children, one dreamy boy in particular.Marilla and Anne also adopt two twins, a troublesome, yet lovable boy Davy, and the prim, unemotional Dora. They have a lot in the book.Oh, and Anne meets a new kindred spirit, Miss Lavender, the spinster in the cozy cottage. Anne reunites Miss Lavender with her old, old sweetheart. And Miss Lavender gets married to him. This was sweet, but somewhat dull. At the very end of the book, Gilbert does give a hint to Anne, about how he feels about her.Overall, this book was mostly disappointments, although I would highly recommend reading it. If you expect to be about Anne getting into interesting scrapes, Gilbert being romantic about Anne, and seeing Anne's old chums a lot, than stop expecting. But as I said, I would still suggest this book."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"I was so disappointed with this book! I was driving from North Carolina to Austin TX, and Anne of Green Gables narrated by Barbara Caruso was great (even though she pronounced Avonlea as Aay-von-lee instead of Ah-von-lee). This one was terrible!! The woman speaking has random inflection, putting the wrong emph-A-sis on the wrong syll-A-ble, if you will. It completely sounds as if she's reading words that she doesn't understand the meaning of. And the voices she uses for characters! My sister and I literally tried to talk each other into listening at least to the first chapter, to see if we could adjust, but we had to turn it off. It was unbearably painful to listen to. Who hired that lady?? Her voice itself is nice enough, but good lord was her inflection awful!

Anne and Gilbert have been married nine years and live in the large house they call Ingleside. Gilbert has a thriving medical practice in Glen St. Mary; he and Anne have five young children, with a sixth on the way. They have also the unique maid of all work Susan Baker.The story centers around a lively series of domestic crises, large and small, delivered with humor and gentle wisdom. Some are typical childhood events, such as the death of a treasured pet or the consequences of a lie. Some affect everyone, such as the prolonged stay of Gilbert's ill-tempered Aunt Mary Maria, whose pessimistic posturing threatens to unhinge the whole family. Some are quite frightening, such as Anne's near-fatal bout with pneumonia.Near book's end, Anne suffers a crisis of confidence in her marriage. Her fears are triggered by Gilbert's air of preoccupation and a visit by an embittered Christine Stuart, whom Anne once saw as a rival for Gilbert's affections. Anne's imagination will lead her down a dark path to an empty marriage sustained for the sake of her children, before a fateful conversation with her husband.\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" and \\"Anne of Windy Poplars\\" were written years after the original six \\"Anne\\" novels, to fill in gaps in her story. Montgomery cleverly uses \\"Ingleside\\" to update the reader on characters previously introduced in \\"Windy Poplars\\", including Rebecca Dew, Jen Pringle, and the now grown Elizabeth Grayson, as well as to drop one or two hints of the future.\\"Anne of Ingleside\\" is rich in the details of a maturing marriage. It is also an introduction to the little Blythe's, each healthy, imaginative, and unique, of whom we will see more in \\"Rainbow Valley.\\" It is highly recommended as a very good read to \\"Anne\\" fans of all ages."},{"Title":"Anne of Ingleside (Anne of Green Gables novels)","review":"This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables.

It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first). Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change).

Coming from a background of 28 years on Wall Street as a broker and chairman of the American Stock Exchange, Levitt joined the SEC as the bull market of the 1990s was getting underway and would remain through the bust of the technology stock bubble, leaving the agency shortly before the accounting scandals of Enron, WorldCom, et al exploded into the public eye -just the sort of accounting deception he had fought to prevent during his years at the SEC. \\"Take on the Street\\" is a memoir of Levitt's years at the SEC and an argument for his philosophy of investor-friendly regulation. But, more than that, it is a how-to guide for small investors that explains the \\"web of dysfunctional relationships among analysts, brokers, and corporations\\" and how to avoid falling victim to them, whether you research and buy stocks yourself or invest in the market through mutaul funds or a 401(k).\\"Take on the Street\\"'s 10 chapters are each dedicated to one issue -usually a conflict of interest- in some stage of the investment game, which can cost the investing public a great deal. Levitt explains each issue in detail, with examples, as well as what the SEC tried to do to remedy the problem when he was in office. And he always includes advise on how to avoid the pitfall in question. The first chapter is about brokers. The second addresses the \\"Seven Deadly Sins of Mutual Funds\\". Chapter 3 reveals the conflicts of interest faced by many analysts. Chapter 4 discusses Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) in detail, which prevents analysts from getting earnings information before it is announced. Chapter 5 addresses the issue of accounting standards, which would come to a boil shortly after Levitt left the SEC, including his crusade to prevent accounting firms from providing both consulting and auditing services to the same company. Chapter 6 is a lesson for investors in how to read company financial statements or 10-Ks. Chapter 7 explains how stock orders were placed and filled on the NYSE and the NASDAQ. (Note that this is not up-to-date, as the NYSE just converted to a computerized system.) Chapter 8 talks about the role and failures of corporate governance boards (boards of directors). Chapter 9 is about Levitt's experiences with the powerful business lobbies and their influence on Congress. The last chapter, \\"Getting Your 401(k) in Shape\\", tells investors what they need to do to get the most out of their 401(k) retirement plans.\\"Take on the Street\\" offers a lot of useful advice for the average investor. Even those who know little about their investments and prefer that others manage their money will find the chapters on mutual funds and 401(k)s invaluable. They just might save you a lot of money. Arthur Levitt is opinionated and is sometimes accused of advocating over-regulation. But he is, above all, an advocate of transparency, without which the stock market and all of its participants are ultimately imperiled. As in any memoir, Levitt takes the opportunity to grind his axe against his foes: the politicians who opposed the SEC's regulatory agendas during the 1990s. In Chapter 9, he says just who opposed Regulation FD, auditor independence rules, and expensing options -many of whom had to eat their words in the wake of the Enron scandal. But \\"Take on the Street\\" is mostly a book for the average American investor, whose cause Arthur Levitt always champions, if not always flawlessly."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"If people get rewarded for bad behavior, and punished for good behavior, very soon they will practice bad behavior and think it is ok because everyone else is doing it. The author shows readers how securities brokers are paid and how this affects their advice to their clients. Brokers get paid commission, and they want their clients to sell the securities that they already own and buy ones they do not own. The higher the turnover, the more money brokers make. As Warren Buffett once said, brokers make money on activity and investors make money on inactivity.The author started a career as a broker, became an executive of a brokerage firm, and was appointed to be a SEC chairman. It is really fascinating to read about how Wall Street works from the eyes of a person who has been on both sides of the fence. I highly recommend this book to any investor.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

This is for everyone who ever feared being labeled an apostate for speaking the heresy about conflicts of interest between Big 5 auditors and consultants and also investment bank analysts and underwriters.The book may strike some as self-righteous, but politics aside, this is good insight and plain talk from an insider. I hope Levitt's &quot;Chinese wall&quot; becomes a frequent discussion topic at business schools.I listened to the Audible version and from that perspective, I found the reading a little disorganized. I would have appreciated more references to the overall timeline and big picture, but that is always a risk with any audio version of a print book."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Arthur Levitt's \\"Take on the Street\\" is a worthwhile read for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the inner workings of investment banks, \\"numbers games\\" played by public companies to smooth earnings, and the role of regulators. All three are imperfect. Levitt exposes many of the abuses that have been known to most public market insiders. He has done much, helped by the market meltdown in 2000-02, to rectify some of these abuses.He provides extensive background, from his point of view, on the difficulty of making the markets more transparent and consumer (retail) friendly. He details his butting heads with Wall Street chieftains, corporate CEOs, the high tech industry, and the very agencies and oversight boards charged with insuring fair markets.There are many gems that are instructive. For instance, I was surprised to learn about the matching of buyers and sellers within a single organization, like Schwab, that increased profits...but to the detriment of customers. Now that there are new rules on this, I understand why Schwab and others are struggling with profitability and must redefine themselves. Schwab's success initially was derived from a rules change Charles Schwab supported, and now its difficulties are derived from a rules change the firm fought.Levitt also shows regulatory zeal in areas requiring much more discussion and debate to insure the public good. Single-minded regulators, while they can do good, can also inflict great harm. While stock options may need a change in accounting treatment, we must make sure that we understand the \\"how\\" to insure that we do not drive a stake into development stage companies that have led the world in innovation, job creation, and value creation. Levitt's single-mindedness on this issue is scary.He showed ignorance about development stage companies and the role of stock options. He frequently used companies like Cisco, Microsoft, and Intel as examples in his discussion. These are growth companies but they are no longer development stage companies. Stock options are a critical tool for the growth and survival of a true development stage company. Most, if not all, development stage firms only offer healthcare benefits, non-matching 401k plans, and an opportunity to fail (80% fail). Stock options provide an off-set to the personal and career risk one takes to join a start-up.Development stage companies have proven crucial to the health of the US economy with jobs, and global leadership in areas like health and high-tech. We are the envy of the world. We as country must make sure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.Those who are interested in these subjects and controversies will enjoy getting a behind the scenes view, courtesy of Arthur Levitt. A good book to complement \\"Take on Wall Street\\" is Andy Kessler's \\"Wall Street Meat\\" - a first hand account of a Wall Street analyst on the abuses Levitt moved to correct. These two books could serve as bookends!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"While Levitt provides some very good information for the average stockholder--about the dirty tricks that brokers play, the mismanagement of mutual funds, tips on reading financial reports, and background info on how certain regs came to be--I found myself fairly disappointed.For one thing, this book is not about you or your 401(k) or your other mutual funds, stocks, or related investments. It is draped in CYA; this book is ALL ABOUT ARTHUR LEVITT!!! This is another case of a former Clinton official writing a book to defend his performance in spite of his commander-in-chief.Don't get me wrong: like other SEC chiefs, his successes were mixed. Some of that was his fault; some of it was not. I don't expect any SEC chairman to bat a thousand. Levitt brought many good ideas to the table and I can't help but give credit where credit is due.That said, why was Levitt not providing this information until now? He ran the SEC for 8 years; why was he not sounding the public alarm about corporate shams during the Clinton years? If Howard Schilit and Martin Weiss could keep tabs on these financial shenanigans, then where was the SEC?Levitt has the same problem that Harvey Pitt had: they have each been beholden to the system all their lives--Pitt as an accountant, Levitt as a broker.How can they bring fundamental reform to a system that desperately needs it? Levitt was a stockbroker himself, and yet he acts as if he never pulled any of those dirty tricks. Give me a break! He rose to the top of his industry; he did not get there by being Mother Teresa.If you want to read a good book that gives the same advice minus the partisan CYA, read \\"You Got Screwed\\" by James Cramer. In addition, \\"Financial Shenanigans\\" by Howard Schilit is very good reading.If you have more than $10,000 invested in the stock market, I highly recommend \\"Fundamentals of the Options Market\\" by Michael Williams and Amy Hoffman, and \\"The Ultimate Safe Money Guide\\" by Martin Weiss.No one should think about investing heavily in the stock market without knowing how to implement some form of hedging, whether it is in the form of LEAPS or reverse-index funds."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"After 40 years in the securities business (minus a few years running a political newsletter), Levitt apparently realized the entire game was rotten and he needed the catharis of telling us about it. This is a good book, if you are looking for a guide to investments and markets. It is written for the novice investor, so more experienced investors will probably skip some sections, such as the last chapter on 401k's. However, there are real insights here for everyone. I have a master's degree in finance and I picked up a few things as well. Levitt also tells his autobiographical story in some detail, with especially interesting sections on his long relationship with his former partner and boss, Sandy Weill, now Chairman of Citicorp. Levitt likes to exaggerate his common-man rags-to-riches lifestory, only occasionally mentioning that his father was NY State Controller for 30 years, while prefering stories of his school-teacher mother and immigrant grandparents. Levitt is also cagey about how he became SEC chairman, only mentioning that he played a minor role in raising money for Clinton in 1992."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"From the vantage point of being the SEC chairman who headed the organization during the frenzy days of the 90's, Arthur Levitt uses this book as an opportunity to explain his attempts to bring the madness under control, provides advice to small investors and use it as an opportunity to grind an axe against Scott Chambers, Steve Jobs and others. For someone who, at that time, was totally new to the mechanics of the market, I found certain sections of the book to be pretty helpful (ex. beware false profit); but if the objective is purely on learning about the market and the associated pitfalls, you will find other books with exclusive focus on those topics."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"This book shows a lot of tricks your broker is probably usingto take advantage of you.Your broker may act like you best friend but he may just bereally interested in gaining your trust so he can get away witha lot of hidden fees in those ridiculously statesments theysend you.It's well know that Mogan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have beenfined repeatly for \\"not acting in the best interest of theirclients\\"But this but revals some of the methods these full servicebrokers use to rip off their client's money.&lt;.....The book gives plenty . examples of how a ruthless brokerstakes your money. ....Read this book and his new book too,it's your money don't be a sucker."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"As a new investor in her mid-20s, I found this book to be very insightful. Levitt does a good job of explaining behind the scenes details of how the stock market works. I learned a ton from this book. It's easy to read and understand. I would highly recommend getting this book from the libary. He tells about traps to be weary about and you finish the book with a better understanding of what you are facing when investing. For the newcomer to investing, I definitely would recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"This is a combination of a great cautionary tale, sound advice, and juicy inside baseball. I highly recommend it to anyone even thinking of getting into the market in a serious way. My only reservation is that Levitt is no longer the SEC chairman. Arthur, where are you when we need you?"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"The perspective of the former SEC chairman can be very useful for ordinary investors. I learned, for example, how and why some important accounting standards were changed in recent times. This helps me to read financial reports with a better focus. The politics of the investment community was also very interesting. The letters from politicians to the SEC, questioning SEC's proposal to limit the amount of consulting work that accounting firms could do for their audit clients, were particularly enlightening. The expose of how a small group of people can influence policies of public interest is already worthy of the price. I was not completely naive before, but reading such letters from people who gained power by claiming to be protectors of public interest swings the argument for more safeguards for small investors. Self-regulation of professional bodies simply does not work, at least as far as the accounting profession is concerned.I would have been even happier if the book were to go deeper, and gave more examples, on the issue of number games, in place of the last chapter, on 401K. But the existing chapters on accounting tricks already contained more beef than those in the other book, 'Financial Shenangans' by Schilit, which were very repetitive and not much depth."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"This book's audience is best suited for those who have not been in business school for awhile, or those of us who need a bit of a refresher. This isn't in the style of Susy Orman, but the book does offer common sense advice to the individual investor. He demonstrates that you are the responsible for your destiny, and some extra steps you can take in investing. For example, do your homework when it comes to brokerages, how is your broker being paid. A broker's best interest, it not your best interest.He takes a commonsense approach to uncracking the code of balance sheets, income sheets and much more for the common investor. A quick look will often lead you in the right direction. You don't need to have a business degree for implimenting any of his suggestions.Levitt's style of writting makes for an easy, unemcumbered read. He speaks in layman's terms so if not a business person, this will make sense to you. I recommend this book to all that might want to brush up on common corporate practices."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Arthur Levitt tells of his years as Chaiman of the SEC and some of the changes he sought to level the playing field for the small investor. That he met strong resistance every step of the way is not surprising. Those who made their money and maintained their power by keeping public investors in the dark were not about to allow Levitt to change the old way of doing business. He persisted and progress was made under his administration. Even more changes have been made since he retired from the SEC as the debacle of Enron and others made it apparent that the old system no longer worked.This well-written tale deserves its best-seller status."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Mr. Arthur Levitt has written a valuable memoir full of insights and honesty that benefits all of us, young and old. That he is a true friend of all investors comes through clearly. He is a friend of all small investors who need his advice and insight to understand the workings and limits of the various markets and how to evaluate corporate reporting.. He is also a friend (in the true sense of the word) of large investors and corporations by highlighting their failures in the past and stressing their ethical obligations to be forthright and fair in all their corporate operations and reporting. He has used his gifts and opportunities well, especially, as Chairman of the SEC to regulate our nation's corporations and hold them to their responsibilities.I have sent a copy of Mr. Levitt's excellent book to all my children who are now grown and are making investments of their own. His excellent and clear presentations will benefit them, as it has me, in making wise choices as they become part of the great small investor base that keeps our country productive and the greatest place on earth to live and raise families."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I worked on the street for 20 years. I think Levin was more than fair. It is a rigged game. We need more guys like him watching out for the little guy.

An entire section of potential for accounting irregularities is something that can be found in Mumford's book \\"The accounting numbers game\\". This is a book by an expert in accounting, which Levitt is not.I found the discussion of lobbyists and the accounting and technology industry interesting. There are obviously great stories which can be ventured into, but i don't think Levitt went into too much depth. He is passionate in his protection of the investors, but seems hesitant to take a stand against the special interests. They are lining there pockets at the expense of the individual investors. It is a collabarated efforts on the part of politicians, the brokerage industries, accounting industries, and ceo's and numberous others. Unfortunately they hold all the power in the U.S. & this will continue to increase the discrepancy between the wealthy & poor / working class. I guess what I'm saying is Let's call a spade a spade not tapdance around the issue.He explanation of hidden commissions is good for people who are unfamiliar with this area. There is a book called \\"License to steal\\" who spells it out in plain english what this is really about. This is a story written by a broker / salesman.Overall, I thought it was a good read, & somewhat informative. Well worth the few days or so it took to read."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Arthur Levitt's analysis of Wall Street helps level the playing field for individual investors. Written in clear, simple prose, this book can be instrumental in helping novice and veteran alike navigate the financial treachery that is all too pervasive in the stock markets. He guides the reader through the steps that are necessary to becoming a smart, well-informed, dupe-free investor. The faults I find are two: in an effort to be simple and clear he tends to be redundant. Secondly, he injects himself into too much of it; recounting his attempts to establish a fair system that gives no advantages to insiders. He assumes a defensive posture too often, explaining events which are of little use to making a naive investor a wise one.Nevertheless, his points are strong, his advice is solid and his central point germane: you must take responsibility for your investment strategy. With Levitt's book as a guide that responsibility is a lot less daunting."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"The topics discussed in each chapter exudes the experience of the author. The down-to-earth narrative style used in the book makes it readable to even absolute novices in the investment domain. For the individual investor, three specific chapters are of utmost importance - the one on mutual funds, one on reading financial companies, and the one on 401 (k) plans. The rest of the chapters explain very convincingly the author's views on what is 'wrong' with the ways in which corporates and brokers make money. Arguably, there is nothing wrong with them trying to make a profit for their services, but the author questions the not-so-ethical ways in which it is done.The book also provides some insights as to who are the most &quot;vocal&quot;, if not influential, U.S. Senators/Representatives for legislation concerning the problems identified by the author.At various chapters, the author also provides some interesting websites that can aid any individual investor to know more about the ways in which corporates publish their earnings and income statements, and the ways in which brokers go about their business.A must-read for anyone who has a single dollar in the financial market."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"\\"Take on the Street\\" should probably have been titled: The Most Corrupt Industry in America. Over the last 100 years (and more), the brokerage industry in America has to comprise the most corrupt bunch of crooks of any industry past, present, and hopefully in the future. Because of deception played upon investors with the full knowledge and intent of the major brokerage houses, individual investors lost trillions of dollars they had invested in the stock market. All the major brokerage houses practiced the art of recommending stocks to their 'customers' while knowing full well those stocks were already vastly overpriced.Arthur Levitt has intimate knowledge of the situation having been the Chairman of the SEC. He pulls no punches in telling the secrets of the industry, even naming names of the biggest culprits to this travesty. When you read how these companies swindled their investors, you will get sick just wondering how the government could let them get away with this for so long. But, of course, significant political contributions by the brokerage houses have a way of making the government look the other way.Are all of the abuses now in the past? It's doubtful, although Levitt is to be highly praised for his accomplishments in getting things at least to their current level of open information sharing for all investors. But, after you read this, you will think twice before you ever think about trusting a stock broker again."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"It is damn good book worth reading in terms of range and depthit covers."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I am about halfway through this and really impressed!

As far as any portfolio use, chapter ten is 26 pages of 401(k)tips. Otherwise there was nothing truly useful for investing. I am self-employed, so this one chapter was of no help to me either. No disrespect to Arthur Levitt and his understanding of the market but this is more of a non-fiction or autobiography than a guidebook to \\"Take On The Street.\\" If you like direct and helpful books such as the \\"All About ....\\" series of books by Richard A.

But what blew me away was what I read in the acknowledgements. Mr. Levitt, a former stockbroker, credits Warren Buffett with informing him about the core of broker comepensation and mutual funds compensation. Gee, didn't Mr.Levitt know the core of these issues when he was at the SEC? It just strikes me funny that a long time vetern of the securities industry would tip his hat to Buffett on such basic issues. Outside of this the book is a gathering of books that combines the worst in biography, advice and expose. Mr. Levitt admits that his poweres were limited by Senators like Phil Gramm, but his book is also limited with few insights worth paying for. Two stars for the insider scoop, but it is really a one-star book!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Reading the book was slow and painful. I'm sure Arthur is a very nice man and honest, but did he have to go on for over 200 pages making that point.

It is a real shame that he worked at taxpayers expense, yet at times he did little to help average investors. Regulation FD, whihc he lauds in the book has made corporate reporting just a marketing tool and while it is true that Levitt complained about auditors--that is all he did--since no legislation took place while he was SEC chariman to remedy their conflicts. Only now are research analysts being investigated and auditors being treated with a critical eye. The problems with stock brokers he details are pretty much on the mark, but during his tenure he did nothing to stop sales contests held at brokerage firms that compromise the interests of investors. He also talks some about the problems with IPOS, but during his tenure he did nothing to stop brokerage firms from treating small investors differently than large ones. The entire book makes Levitt look like he is giving readers something new and fresh, but most of the information has been detailed before in books published years ago. Levitt toots his own horn in trying to sell his book, but if he had a louder voice when he was SEC chairman many investors would have saved a lot of money."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"First of all, readers will know most of the information in this book by reading the headlines in recent newspapers. The behind-the-scenes material is interesting, but it is so weighted in the author's favor that it lacks a sincere element of truth. Instead of writing a book about what investors don't know about Wall Street, I wish Arthur Levitt would have spilled the beans while he was the SEC's chairman. To make money by writing a book based on what he should have told investors long ago does not sit well with me. As an investor, I feel cheated and as a reader of this book I felt like the message was too little, too late!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Book has some fluf, but it's interesting.The book give some insight into how courupt Wall Street and many brokers are."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Take on the Street bogs down in detail, which makes reading it a lesson in patience. It is often hard to see the forest for the trees. One of the most interesting facts in the book was how Levitt got his job. He says he contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign. It seems that the best person for any job in Washington is the person who raises the most cash!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"This book is stupid, boring, helpless, and poorly written. This guy was supposed to be a chief regulator and policemen at the SEC and sounds like some boy scout who got lost in the woods. Wall Street sharks played him like a violin and pols in Washington rolled him over on every issue. This guy is SEC chief during the biggest stock market bubble the world has ever seen, with all the attendant massive fraud and financial misdeeds, and Arthur just wants you to know that he was a good boy scout working on his SEC merit badge.What is amazing is that after he gets through telling us how he got rolled by politicians, his wall street friends and acquaintances, accountants, and lobbyists, etc., ad infinitum, then he regurgitates all kinds of \\"good investment\\" advice for dummies on every subject in the financial universe. Do we have to hear about how stocks beat bonds again for the millionth time?The most unbelievable part of the book was this insane chapter titled \\"How to be a Player\\", where Arthur tells us that if we keep up with all the good information in internet and all the great websites he has found and tells us about, then we too can be a \\"Player\\" on Wall Street. Huh?Apparently Arthur was never a player at all, just a eager boy scout who discovered the joys of internet while earning his SEC merit badge."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Chances are anyone who rates this book as a 1 is a broker, member of AICPA, or serves on the Senate Banking committee. I am an investor who is very concerned about the greedily protected lack of transparency in the way public companies report their earnings or lack thereof, so I am giving this excellent book a 5.The book is useful because it describes how securities markets really work. It also functions as practical investment advice which details what is happening with your money after it leaves your hands. It should be required reading in MBA programs. Finally, voters will be much more informed about how Congress, through its protection of accountants, investment bankers, and brokers, is interfering with the efficient allocation of capital in the US economy."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I really appreciated the honest insight that this fascinating book gives into the \\"shady\\" corporate dealings of Wall Street companies, their greedy, dishonest CEOs and ineffectual Board members. It also provides good, sound help for the trusting investor with practical advice on how to read between the company statement lines and cautions the investor about the many potential pitfalls of corporate corruption. I just wonder, if such shenanigans were so well known to the SEC, why was it allowed to continue and fester for so long? Anyway, Mr. Arthur Levitt's willingness to at least assist investors is to be highly commended.While reading \\"Take On The Street\\" I was reminded of another book that preceded this one, entitled, \\"MANAGEMENT BY VICE\\" by the author/scientist C.B.DON. I would very much recommend that any wary investor interested in the high-tech industry sector also reads this marvelous book. The lessons and advice in \\"Management By Vice\\" are there for all to see in episodes of sharp, candid satire with a touch of wicked humor as it provides a very important insight into the inner workings of industry life, and in genuine \\"satire\\"-style, reveals the \\"vices\\" and follies of managers, the frustrations of high-tech technical staff, their \\"caveats\\" to investors and sheds a spotlight onto typical high-tech mis-management going on right now in such company settings.As \\"Take On The Street\\" focuses on Wall Street trickery, so \\"Management By Vice\\" frankly exposes true-to-life examples of project blunders, corporate misrepresentations and misappropriations, management greed, managerial/corporate abuses, ignorance and bluffing and attitudes towards investors, to name but a few. Both books are indeed a must-read for cautious investors, though from different \\"insider\\" angles...and both arm the reader with information that is pertinent and all-important.Only by reading eye-opening, superb books, such as this Wall Street insight, \\"Take On The Street\\", and the employee-inventors' perspectives/warnings of \\"Management By Vice\\", can we learn what to look for on corporate statements, which tough questions to ask of company managers or analysts, how employees view their company management and what demands to make for corporate accountability!!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Levitt's book should be used by business schools scrambling to put together courses on business ethics and corporate governance. As a student working towards my MBA, I found this book to be of great value in an environment that lacks a curriculum to explain many of the issues underlying recent corporate scandals.As a young professional, this book has also helped me better understand and manage my mini-portfolio, including my 401K. Truly a valuable read that has given me much to think about as I manage my financial future."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Anything Warren Buffett recommends cannot be bad in terms of books. I read this book and found it to be extremely relevant given today's market backdrop and the corporate shenanigans on Wall Street. Levitt names names and points his finger at those he KNOWS are responsible for much of the questionable behaviour. Recommended reading for anyone who wants to know about the back room games played and how to protect one's self from being played by the big boys. Do yourself a favour and read this book."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I'm really shocked at all the negative reviews this book is getting. I think they are totally unfair.A lot of the criticism of this book is by people who claim to be disgruntled investors who lost big in the stock market. They seem to be taking it out on former SEC chairman Levitt. They are dead wrong!Arthur Levitt championed the cause of small investors. He championed investors' rights against tough opposition from the Big 5 (now Big 4 sans Andersen) accounting firms, some (but not all) Wall Street financiers, etc. Levitt stuck to his principles in spite of tremendous opposition, personal insults, and threats to the SEC. The ONLY reason he lost in his attempts to defend small investors was because some members of Congress were bought off by Levitt's (and investors') enemies. This isn't just something that Levitt believes; almost everyone who has followed the issue on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill (EVEN Levitt's enemies) ALL agree that the above were the facts. In spite of the opposition, Levitt did manage to get some issues on the table (Reg FD - 'Fair Disclosure' - and trying to make accounting for derivatives as well as the co-habitation between accountants & consultants issues for public debate). All of that was accomplished by Levitt even when some in Congress threatened to cut the funding to the SEC.Mr. Levitt's book recounts his heroic efforts, in the face of fierce opposition, to reform a flawed system. His book should be applauded for those reasons alone! On top of that, Mr. Levitt offers some sound advice to investors that would have helped to prevent many of those who have lost their shirts (and foolishly bash Levitt's book) from getting fooled into bad investment decisions.Do I think Levitt's book is perfect or all that it claims to be? No. But if people are going to bash a book, they better back it up with facts and review a book in a thoughtful and logical manner rather than getting the facts wrong, lying, and/or going off into a world of their own.Bottom-line: If you want the truth about Wall Street and politics, Levitt's book is a great read. If you want to criticize this book AFTER you actually read it, then please do so in a honest, factual, and logical manner rather than in a dishonest and irrational manner as some of the other reviewers have (unfortunately and unfairly) done.Edit (11/17/02): I whole-heartedly agree with the review by Phillip Brown (Pennsylvania, .... Note (11/20/02): Apparently the rest of my edited review was deleted by Amazon thus making me look bad. Which begs the question: Why aren't they similarly editing out the 1-star reviews of this book that are clearly slanderous? I'm actually doing Amazon a favor by making sure that accurate, fair, and positive info about this book gets out there which will lead to more sales for them. The looney 1-star reviews would lead to poorer sales. So what gives?"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I have the audible format, but I am going to keep a print copy. I follow stock market every day, i know the tricks of the analysts. They downgrade stocks when those have already depreciated almost 80%, and upgrade and make 'strong buy' recommendation when stocks have already rocket high. Why? you know why! Luckily, we still have some good stock analysts, though there are not many.I absolute agree with what Levitt says: brokers are no more than a salesman.... Don't listen to your broker for using margin account... Should avoid using margin account at all cost..What have happened this year on the Street? Why the big invesment firms have to pay 1.4B fines last week? As an individual investor, you know why.I highly recommen this book/audible listen to individual investors and those who wish to revisit how they make money from making untruth recommendations to their clients."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"Mr. Levitt's brilliant and direct assessment of what's wrong with Wall Street should be high on everyone's list with a dollar in a 401(k) plan or with a brokerage.For all the money spent on educating market professionals our country has apparently not been well served. In fairness that's an overstatement, but it does illustrate that for all the CPA's, MBA's, and CFA's carrying a brief-case around America, technical knowledge means very little if people cannot tell the difference between ethical and unethical, a lie and a truth, or good and bad behavior.In reality we should all perhaps strive to take several pages from Warren Buffett as well: get a hobby, buy value, mistrust Wall Street, don't gamble, choose your friends wisely, when you're on the mainline to Chicago from NY there are no side-trips in Altoona, etc...Above all else read Benjamin Graham's 'Security Analysis'. If you have any trouble understanding what it is you are buying, you should not be laying down your money. PERIOD!Every best wish to Mr. Levitt on the success of this book!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I found this to be a informative if depressing read. For all the one star reviewers, Levitt did speak out during the Clinton administration. But politics aside the book offers a behind the scenes view of the SEC and its relationships with Congress, FASB, industry etc. The view is not a good one. Read it and take heed. Hopefully it will help prevent another Enron. Maybe people will finally learn about financial mania."},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I can't tell you how eye-opening it was to read the honest, clear words of a person who truly seems to care about the small investor. This book should be mandatory reading for every american with a dollar in the stock market!"},{"Title":"Take on the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know","review":"I don't know if the feeling I got back from reading this book was put by Mr. Levitt intentionally or not, I just think that all what this book is about are, in a nutshell:1 - apologies (i.e. author apologizes because he was not able, as an SEC President, to stop the madness of the speculative bubble that left many small investors bruised);2 - explanations (why he was not able to stop..., you know what);3 - remedies (how to avoid making again the same mistakes); and4 - thanksgiving to all those supporters that let him do a tremendous work during those very difficult years.How actually difficult were those bubble years? Let's see just an example, in the author's own words:\\"When (...) tried to stop abusive practices in the way that many companies accounted for mergers, two of Silicon Valley's VIPs, Cisco Systems Inc. CEO John Chambers and venture capitalist John Doerr, tried to persuade me to rein in the standard-setters. When I refused, they threatened to get \\"friends\\" in the White House and on Capitol Hill to make me bend.\\"One entire chapter is devoted to \\"Regulation Fair Disclosure\\", certainly the best success achieved by Mr. Levitt:\\"In the summer of 2000, the time had come to give final approval to a controversial new rule, Regulation Fair Disclosure, or Reg FD.\\"\\"I think it's important that investors know how the rule came about, and why the securities industry bitterly opposed it. Even today, Wall Street firms would like nothing better than to turn back the clock and either erase Reg FD or water it down.\\"He tells us of how the Security Industry Association put on a lobbying blitz to urge him to back down; there's and interesting - if worrying - account of how big businesses influence politicians to act against the interest of the people.This book is five-stars one, it is a must if you are a novice investor in the stockmarket: \\"By learning about conflicts, motivations, and political favoritism, investors can become more discerning in how they use the power of their money and the power of their shareholder vote. I hope this book makes you a more informed, skeptical, diligent and successful investor.\\"While I rate it as a three-stars one, if you are an experienced investor (you should already know a lot about what's written here) - so this is why my overall rating is just four stars.Levitt about brokers:\\"How serious are the conflicts between broker and investor? Serious enough that a former top official of a major brokerage firm confessed to me privately that he would not send his mother to a full-service broker.\\"The stockmarket is no shortcut to riches: investors have responsibilities and have to do their homework:\\"In the end, investors must change their behavior, too. You should not follow the herd and grab for shares just because the headline on a press release trumpets an increase in pro forma earnings per share. Conversely, investors should not abandon ship just because a company fails to meet analysts' expectations. It's your responsibility to dig deeper to see what the company's true prospects are. It's a lot safer to own shares in a company that believes in transparency and whose earnings have not been gilded than to own shares in a company that smooths out earnings by manipulating reserves. (...) If you demand more transparency and an end to the numbers game - and you back up those demands with your investment dollars - companies will have little choice but to change their behavior, too.\\"I have three last questions for the investor-taxpayer-consumer: How much money makes the SEC President?

The last half seemed to fall into more of a political mode. Mr.Levitt allowed his democratic leanings to show when he started to blame republicans for his failures.

More funny than bitter, Clayson's experience as a rock musician informs his understanding of the music industry and Winwood's remarkable career. In this sense the book is almost as much about the British pop music industry in the 1960s as Winwood per se. Definitely a cut above the usual pop star hagiography, despite lack of access to its subject (Winwood did not cooperate in the production of this book), a surprisingly good book."},{"Title":"The Skull Measurer's Mistake: And Other Portraits of Men and Women Who Spoke Out Against Racism","review":"The Skull Measurer's Mistake: and other portraits of men and women who spoke out against racism.

There is a chapter on Dwarfs, African, and American Ciclids. There are a few pictures. It was an annoyance that she described one particular cichlid as being one of the most beautiful, but didn't include a picture of that one.Some of the descriptions were more complete than others. Some just had a few sentences. This is a cichlid. It likes this water. It is aggressive during mating. Some had a page long description.There is a fairly complete chapter on cichlid behavior and the various reasons for aggression. That was a very interesting section.It's an OK book. I'd give about 3 stars. I would call it a beginner book, except there are several important things missing (like cycling and acclimation).

The arrival of Mr. Herbert, son of an old friend of Canon Jocelyn's, brings much excitement for Mary, who falls in love with him. But life is much more complicated than that, and Mr. Hebert marries Kathy, a younger woman who is Mary's polar opposite.FM Mayor novel is character-driven rather than plot-driven. It seems as though all her life, Mary has been waiting for something--anything to happen to her. Her life at the vicarage in Dedmayne, severely curtailed by her father, is constricting. And yet Mary spends most of this novel (covering a period of about ten years) letting things happen to her. I found it very hard to like Mary at times, considering she's not really an active participant in what goes on in this novel. She's not like her friend Dora, a really engaging spinster who's embraced her unmarried status with perhaps a little too much gusto. It seems as though Mary wastes her whole life catering to the needs of other people, rather than doing things for herself. And yet, there's a quiet passion about Mary, a desire in her to see more of the world.The book also highlights the contrast between two generations: one of the late Victorian period, the other of the early 20th century. Although the book takes place presumably at the time it was written (1920s), the feel of the novel is very Victorian, and it may have something to do with the more or less repressed Canon Jocelyn, unable to express the way he truly feels. Mary is stuck between the two generations, unable to escape the confines of her own narrow world. It was very hard for me to understand why Mr. Herbert does a 180 in regards to his feelings for Mary; it made me dislike him all the more for being shallow. Still, FM Mayor really gets to the heart of her characters' emotions (or lack thereof). Susan Hill put this book on her list of 40 books she'd take to a desert island. While I enjoyed this for the most part, this isn't that kind of book for me. But it's still very good."},{"Title":"The Rector's Daughter (Modern Classics)","review":"this is my favorite book. beautifully written, enthralling plot, characters so real you could touch them, poignant message. it meets all my requirements! highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rector's Daughter (Modern Classics)","review":"Virago Classics at its best in this engrossing tale of plain middle-aged Mary, daughter of a stern but loving clergyman.

A short book, it is well written, with some archaic language. I suspect Herrick was a painter, his imagery is so vivid. The subject reflects the utopian tendancies in late 19th century New England. But that does not explain why I reread it every year. The story is about a doctor who heals men with broken spirits in his &quot;Inn&quot; in Albany.The first half is about the Inn and it's Master. The simple telling of the story is moving. I can feel the bracing cold water of the morning swim, smell the fresh mown hay, hear the excited chatter of the table talk, see the glow of the pipes in the night down in the garden. It has some of the feeling of &quot;Lost Horizons&quot;, but more real. The Inn is a haven from the cruel world outside, but here the shelter seekers invariably return to the fight. Each time I read it, I yearn to meet the Master and join the &quot;Brethren&quot;, if only for a season.The last half unfolds a different story, not simply a Utopian dream but a psychic conflict between two strong men. (In the psychological, not supernatural sense.) There is no profanity, sex, or violence. The tension is subtle, with an unexpected twist at the end.This second part of the story illuminates the oft overlooked fact that sharpness of wit and tongue are not (or should not be) the true measure of a man. Yet there is no heavy-handed moral here. The characters are three-dimensional and compelling (for such a short tome).Though it is not a &quot;religious&quot; book, I always come away from it feeling spiritually refreshed and morally stabilized. I recommend it whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"The Master of The Inn","review":"I also have an old copy of this, and I also re-read it regularly and enjoy it every time. I'd recommend this to anybody who's willing to sit down and read it without distractions for a couple of hours.

From the description, it's exactly the place that Herrick was writing about, and in fact, the article ends, \\"Dr. Gehring and his 'inn' are the prototype and scene of Novelist Robert Herrick's The Master of the Inn, written during Writer Herrick's convalescence at Bethel.\\"Herrick's own introduction says the Inn is entirely fictional. Maybe he was just trying to keep Dr. Gehring from being inundated with patients. -- Charles Ott"},{"Title":"The Master of The Inn","review":"Written by Robert Herrick (the American novelist, not the British poet), this book describes a retreat to which men visit to recover from the harshness of life.

When I purchased this book I had little clue as to the synopsis however I was pleasantly surprised with this little gem. This is the second book by Herrick I've read and it has inspired me to read more of his novels. His ideas are quite original and he writes in a quirky manner, with some pages of much description here and there, as one finds in a classic novel.

This Penguin issue corrects a number of inaccuracies from previous editions, including Stevenson's own error in their departure date (!) It is the classic travel and observation book of the Pacific. The early descriptions of the Marquesas are unmatched, as are the accounts of the several islands they visited in Kiribati (Gilbert Islands). The account of Tem Binoka will give you a real eye opening into an absolute ruler and his ways in the late 19th century. Reading this could start a life long interest in Pacific literature."},{"Title":"In The South Seas","review":"In his book, In the South Seas, Stevenson gives an accurate and in depth look into the people and culture of the islands of the South Pacific. The book describes Stevenson's two year journey from the Marqueses Islands, to Tahiti, then Honolulu ,and finally Somoa. Stevenson uses the great adventures he experienced and his masterfully writing skills to paint a breath taking view of the islands and thier many beauties."},{"Title":"In The South Seas","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson started to write \\"In the South Seas\\" in 1889, sailing at the \\"Equator\\", during his second cruise on the Pacific. This trip was taken in the company of his wife, Fanny, his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, his mother, Margaret Stevenson (Maggie)and a French nurse on service with the Stevensons, since 1887, Valentine Roch; His purpose was to engage in a serious work about of the South Seas, based on his personal experience and on his collection of a lot of informations about the manners and habits os its native inhabitants. However, his wife is not glad. She tells him that his condition as a social scientist is not as good as a writer. Robert Louis Stevenson didn't attempt to Fanny's advice, and he decided to keep on doing his work. Many critics recognize \\"In the South Seas\\" as the best travel's book published in the 19th Century. However I believe it is not only a simple travel's book. I think it is like an autobiography, with numerous and reasonable reflections by the author about human life, the occidental cilization, and peoples who live in remote places, without frequent contact with tje white's world. RLS reveals in his book what he has analyzed and understood about these peoples, expressing his ideas about their religion, art and life style. The language the author uses does not have the common prejudiced traceq which is a characterist of European writers. As he mentions the missionaries's action in Pacific islands.he denounces it with strong words and considers this action a crime against these p&eacute;oples who are not sighted as human beings by Europeans and Americans, at that time, but simply savage men. The characters who appear in \\"In the South Seas\\" are represented by RLS with vivid details and we can perceive them as real people. I think \\"In the South Seas\\" is an essential book to study the Pacific Islands history and to understand its peoples; moreover, I consider Robert Louis Stevenson a pioneer in anthropological studies on this world's area. In his book, he really announces a new sight on Anthropology - on the Historical Anthropology as it was recently idealized by Marshall Sallins. Unfortunately , the historians of the Cultural Anthropology don't mention a single word about Robert Louis Stevenson's book; and I think is still time to redeem this great injustice."},{"Title":"In The South Seas","review":"Really, this book made me want to turn my back on old Norway and become a Pacific Wanderer for all future. Stevensons prose is magnificent, persnal, witty, earnest and serious, and what's more, he is a rare example of a Victorian gentleman who met people with plain friendliness and curiosity and respect, which makes you trust everything he says about the King of Apemama, everyday life on Butaritari or cannibalism in the Marquesas Islands.

Heart, Spirit, Way of Being...it is all of these things. Rather than attempt a direct translation, Lafcadio Hearn offers a selection of stories focusing on Japanese inner life, so that by the end you will understand kokoro.The stories follow Hearn's particular interests of Japanese folklore and the vanishing culture of which he found himself a part in post-Meji Japan. Each story is a slice of life focusing on Japanese character, morals and feelings. This is what the Japanese people care about, what they think is important, what is inside.The selected tales are non-judgmental and non-orientalist. This is no attempt to explain or highlight the &quot;strange&quot; Japanese, but merely a record and an illumination, in the best sense of the term.The collected stories:&quot;At a Railway Station&quot;&quot;The Genius of Japanese Civilization&quot;&quot;A Street Singer&quot;&quot;From a Traveling Diary&quot;&quot;The Nun of the Temple of Amida&quot;&quot;After the War&quot;&quot;Haru&quot;&quot;A Glimpse of Tendencies&quot;&quot;By Force of Karma&quot;&quot;A Conservative&quot;&quot;In the Twilight of the Gods&quot;&quot;The Idea of Pre-Exsistance&quot;&quot;In Cholera Time&quot;&quot;Some Thoughts about Ancestor Worship&quot;&quot;Kimiko&quot;"},{"Title":"Kokoro: Hints and echoes of Japanese inner life, (The Travellers' library)","review":"Not to be confused with Natsume Soseki's novel by the same title, Lafcadio Hearn's \\"Kokoro\\" is a magnificent collection of essays, vignettes, memoirs, and meditations on Japan in the 1890's. Very much a product of the mid-Meiji period, these masterfully-written little literary pieces are nonetheless timeless. Each piece is quite different from the rest, and yet almost all of them manage to start from everyday incidents or obvious observations and gradually spiral inwards to some deeply moving and startling insight into Japanese attitudes, values, and worldviews; more than once this seemingly methodless method allows Hearn to share with the reader certain common opinions and normal spiritual orientations held by average Japanese folks--the kinds of things usually taken for granted and so unarticulated, hence least amenable to documentation and scholarship (especially of the time, but even today). And Hearn does all this with an unpretentious erudition and an understated and balanced sympathy for his subject that, along with his literary flair for wonderfully clear and flowing prose, places his writings here in a category far above the rest. With him we can find none of the unintentional strains of condescension and orientalism so typical of folklore and religious anthropology, for while he's looking with the surprised gaze of the outsider with one eye, his other eye is that of the insider feeling very much at home where he is. The resulting view is visionary--but in subdued and shadowy tones.Appendix on an Appendix: in addition to the fifteen excellent essays forming the main body of \\"Kokoro\\", there's an extensive appendix featuring Hearn's translations of three popular folk ballads: \\"The Ballad of Shuntoku-Maru\\", \\"The Ballad of Oguri Hangwan\\" and \\"The Ballad of O-Shichi, the Daughter of the Yaoya\\". These are fascinating on a number of levels. They provide a tantalizingly fleeting glimpse of plebian drama, remarkable in its very lack of remarkableness. There's a certain sociological angle, as the versions of these oral ballads collected and translated by Hearn are those recited by mountain outcastes in the area of today's Shimane Prefecture. Religiously the first two ballads are key in understanding popular attitudes concerning pilgrimage in Japan--the first demonstrating a creepy (almost voodoo) edge in Kannon faith at Kiyomizudera Temple, the second delightfully exaggerating the rejuvenating benefits of Kumano and its sacred hot springs. Meanwhile, the third ballad is a straightforwardly melodramatic retelling of a true story better known to us today in a more refined and literary version as found in the novelist Saikaku's \\"Five Women Who Loved Love\\" of 1686."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it to be too much touchy feely and fluffy, and too little substance. Other than trying to compare setting up a CMM program to choreographing a ballet (which didn't do it for me), I found nothing insightful about this book.

Caputo won't help there either.If you get Paulk and Dymond you don't need this book. You cannot do CMM without Paulk (or TR24 and TR25 which Paulk is mostly a rehash of). Hence you don't need Caputo too.You will need the Framework by Olson (download from SEI) to supplement Paulk.

Additionally, this book also contains tactical level guidance for pursuing the fulfillment of the SEI's CMM Level 2 Key Process Areas (KPAs), which is greatly in demand.

I was disappointed. The book is divided into two parts - 8 chapters of descriptive text, and then a slew of appendices.The descriptive text was very high-concept pop psychology type of stuff. I really did not need to be reminded that different people learn and adopt things at different rates. Anyone who has dealt with people and change should know this. In addition the constant analogy of a dancer learning new dance steps was at times lame and forced. Right up front, the author demolishes the analogy by stating that dancers get to practice their steps before performing, but software engineers start right out with the performance.On the positive side, the appendices in the back contain useful worksheets, presentations, and ideas that can be used by practically any organization.I wish the author had spend less time on the pop psychology aspects, and provided more examples and checklists. Then it would have been a 5 star book for sure."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"This book beats anything by others on adopting the CMM. Others take the &quot;overkill&quot; approach of orienting one with massive technically oriented information (which is sometimes akin to &quot;sinking sampans with nukes versus 500 hundred pounders with fuse extenders&quot;). This book is a breath of fresh air in getting introduced to how to implement/adopt technology such as the CMM. I say this book beats anything by others because there is no &quot;techno-babble&quot; to deal with. Ms. Caputo's use of dance choreography is pertinent as it emphasized to me that the typical technology adoption approach of Level 1 organizations of MBSAUYBII (management by stumbling around until you bump into it) is truly &quot;chaotic&quot;. What we are really trying to achieve as we go from level to level is a fluid, organized approach that will truly support a smooth transition to a new corporate software engineering paradigm. An added bonus is the included CD which helps o! ne jumpstart the management briefings which are critical to initiating a continuous process improvement (CPI) program.

Her mission is not to provide CMM checklists or document formats. It is not a bound consultant. All the &quot;I did this..&quot; can be found on the web. A great deal of information can be found directly from the SEI (www.sei.cmu.edu).Kim provides views into the struggles of applying process frame work in an engineering environment. In fairness, she does a great job. The dancing analogyis a strech for me, but it can be viewed for what it is. This is, after all, part of her (minor in dance after her double technical major).Overall, this guide is very helpful after you have plowed through Watt Humphrey's writings."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"This book is OK at best. I was looking specifically for some guidance in process definition and had high expectations for this book, especially because it's published by Addison Wesley. Unfortunately, I really didn't get much out of it. There's one thing, however, that just about drove me batty -- Caputo spends a great deal of time developing &quot;striking analogies to dance.&quot; I found this rather useless. As a typical software professional, am I expected to gain insight into the items being presented with the help of a comparison to an unusual profession? Analogies can be used to aid understanding when the analogy maps the new concept onto one the audience is already familiar with. The space taken to make the constant comparisons could have been better used to provide additional annecdotal evidence."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"I have worked in the area of software process improvement for many years, and I have literally dozens of books on the subject. Some I've read once, most I've read two or three times... and then there are a very small group of books that are falling apart, held together by all the &quot;sticky notes&quot; and hilighting and paper clip bookmarks -- these three or four books are never found on the bookshelf, because they are always in use. And of those select books, only one was NOT written by Watts Humphrey; it is this book by Kim Caputo.Her use of the analogy of dance, from her own personal background, gives a refreshing and *different* perspective to a highly technical subject.After reading Watts Humphrey's books, *I* understand the CMM and SPI... after reading Kim Caputo's book, I can make *others* understand. And that, to me, has made this book worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"This book is not really about the technical aspects of implementing the key processes and attaining a specific level of maturity. It's about something much more difficult - overcoming organizational resistance to change.The path to achieving capability levels 2 through 5 are well defined in other books. Each process area and its requirements are well documented in Mark Paulk's authoritative book. From the technical perspective it may be cut and dried, and in a perfect world not populated by those illogical creatures called people Mr. Paulk's book is all you need.Unfortunately people are not logical and a clearly laid out roadmap is not enough. You quickly discover that the path to even CMM level 2 is fraught with perils that are strangely missing from the technical books on CMM. Overcoming these perils are what Ms. Caputo's book is all about. She describes techniques for overcoming the resistance to implementation. Instead of rehashing what you need to implement in order to get to a specific level, she tells you how to accomplish the implementation part - the part that is not cut and dried. She does this by relating her own experience, and I can assure you that if you're tasked with implementing CMM (or any other program or initiative for that matter) you can learn a lot about human and organizational nature from this book. You will also learn a lot about what works when effecting change and how to counter the inevitable resistance you'll run into.If you're looking for CMM technical and process-related information get The Capability Maturity Model: Guidelines for Improving the Software Process by Mark Paulk.

If you are looking for technical/practical assistance on keys to implementing the CMM then look elsewhere; the book will do nothing but frustrate you. If you are looking for organizational and managerial help then you *might* find this book useful, but your money is probably better spent elsewhere. The book is heavy on 'organization-speak' and light on real, practical instruction. There are some good war stories, but you probably have ones of your own that are just as good and relevant. The CD and associated forms aren't very useful and they are somewhat poorly organized. The book is not totally without merit, but I still can't find anything in it that even remotely justifies its price."},{"Title":"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement","review":"The book spends an overwhelming portion of its content focusing on a ballet and how it relates to CMM.

In my opinion, \\"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement\\" is well-written, easy to read, insightful, in-depth, and provides you with the basic knowledge and tools that will increase your chance for a successful implementation of CMM. If you want to improve your software development processes, reduce cost, deliver on-time, increase overall software quality, and increase customer satisfaction, then Kim Caputo's book, \\"CMM Implementation Guide: Choreographing Software Process Improvement,\\" is a must read for you and your team.This book provides a step-by-step guide on how to go from CMM level 1 to 5 in eight chapters with some diligence, hard work, and practice. The book also contains 15 appendices that provide more in-depth detail on the specific processes, documentation, and techniques, which I found very helpful and will be utilizing in the near future. I enjoyed Kim Caputo's ability to make the seemingly complicated task of implementing CMM more simplified with her \\"ready, aim, fire\\" approach that will ensure a successful CMM implementation. Kim Caputo brings her experience as a dancer and a software professional together to describe the CMM implementation approach, which makes for more interesting reading. She provides a realistic view and approach to implementing CMM and deals with some of the key issues that will keep you from being successful such as management's view of the value of CMM, the culture of the organization, and the basic human resistance to change. You can tell that Kim has \\"been there, done that\\" and has gone through the tedious process of and the lessons learned from implementing the CMM. The experiences that Kim describes matched many of my past experiences when trying to make process improvements. The book provides and describes the tools and techniques that were developed at the Unisys Corporation to help ensure success in implementing the CMM process.I really appreciate how Kim Caputo reinforces that there are no silver bullets or special pills that can make a CMM implementation easier. Kim reminds us that a CMM implementation is a constant, on-going process of improvement that requires choreographed teamwork and practice. The book comes with a CD-ROM that contains all of the basic documentation and forms needed to successfully implement CMM, as discussed in her book. The material on the CD-ROM is worth more than the price of the book.Chairman, Southern California Quality Assurance Association - Orange County Chapter (SCQAA-OC; [URL])"},{"Title":"Mary Baker Eddy fulfills prophecy","review":"This book addresses the profound need to see Mrs. Eddy in a spiritual light.

A high school student could easily follow this--which might be a good thing in certain cases--but the rigor is lacking. In fact, there is barely a hint of any rigor whatsoever. It is mostly intuitive arguments and the author often says things like &quot;but we won't bother worrying about mathematical technicalities&quot;. It does get you to be able to visualize certain things well, but the visualization techniques can be found in other books also. The book is very thin and a quick read--hardly worth the money they are trying to get for it. If you're really at the undergraduate level and want to learn some topology, try something like Mendelson's &quot;Introduction to Topology&quot; by Dover or one of the excellent topology books in the series &quot;Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics&quot; by Springer. Munkres is also a classic. If you're not an undergraduate in a math related field and just want to know about the ideas behind topology or perhaps see some visualization techniques, try something like &quot;The Shape of Space&quot; by Weeks. Overall I was very disappointed with this text. If you could purchase this book for under $20 it might be worth it, but even then I think the other books I quoted are better in both price and substance."},{"Title":"Topology of Surfaces, Knots, and Manifolds","review":"This book presents the topology of surfaces, manifolds and knots in a manner that is reachable for undergraduate students with only a knowledge of calculus. Some linear algebra might be helpful. The text is written in a style that is easy to follow and there are superfluous examples. The exercises in the text are well thought out and are not extremely difficult. The exercises complement the text very well. The text makes clear a lot of difficult concepts such as isotopic surfaces as opposed to homeomorphic surfaces. I particularly enjoyed the manner in which the topology of knots was explained. After reading this text, the reader should be able to better visualize the projective plain and even the Klein bottle as it exists in 4-dimensional space.

As it stands, this book is only 140 pages long, and does not develop any of its topics (manifolds, surfaces, graphs, knots) adequately. This book is far too weak to serve as a good text. Kinsey's TOPOLOGY OF SURFACES is much stronger, and costs less. Or look as something like Gamelin's INTRO TO TOPOLOGY.

After stowing away to America as an impoverished 22-year-old immigrant, this artist grew to become a leader in modern art, &quot;a defining member of the most influential art movement created in the United States.&quot;With the impact of his colors drawing gasps, he literally transformed the way many of us view our surroundings. Quite obviously, he had admiration for traditional Western art yet struck out on his own only to find the country floundering in the depths of a Depression.Despite his lack of funds de Kooning &quot;remembers the years of the Depression as nurturing, formative ones. A sense of shared community prevails, since everyone is poor and none of them is famous yet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Turn Back Your Bio Clock: Complete Anti-Aging Program","review":"Hello,This is without a doubt the most easy to follow, comprehensive, instructional health program for the mind, body and soul that my wife and I have come across.We just played it on our stereo and in our car and just listened. It teaches the why's and how's in easy to understand terms. It even came with a supplement guide for us.My wife and I have both lost weight and she's now down to the weight she was in high school. We both feel great and look way better too.After listening to the program, we understand why we were both gaining weight before. We just made simple and easy adjustments to our diet and exercise routines. This program makes it that simple.The program treats the mind, body and soul as a whole or complete being, we liked that.

The chapters are short and the book is a fairly light read. The writing style seems a bit repetitive, but some of that comes from the way the book is set up. For someone who knows little about the subject this would be a good introduction, personally I would have preferred it to be a bit more detailed and academic. However, the book is written for a mass audience and there are more detailed books available for those interested."},{"Title":"The Real Meaning of the Zodiac","review":"Well written & researched by Dr Kennedy.

Always regretted not getting the VHS/DVD recording of that sermon."},{"Title":"Called to Freedom: Liberation Theology and the Future of Christian Doctrine","review":"Migliore claims to be a Barthian of sorts, but Barth would be appalled. The irony is that in Dr. Migliore's anxiety to escape any received traditions that might be man-centered and deeply intertwined with our (oppresive) human social orders, he has so gutted his theology that there is nothing transcendant left of it either. He classifies all the classic, ecumenical attributes of God (absoluteness, immutability, omnipotence, etc., see the rant on p.78, for example) as human metaphysical constructs, so in the end there is nothing left of God, at least not as he is revealed in Scripture.Dr. Migliore knows his theology and has taught for over 30 years at (arguably) America's most prestigious mainline Protestant seminary (Princeton). You get the sense that the classic liberal/neo-orthodox models leave him wanting and empty, so he grasps for a political/social fad in hopes of finding something truly redemptive. Sort of pray he will try the timeless Gospel of grace instead, and find real, lasting 'liberation' there.A better critique of Liberation Theology is by Ronald Nash."},{"Title":"The Fluxus Reader","review":"From Umbrella, vol. 22, no. 1 (April 1999): The Fluxus Reader,edited by Ken Friedman (London, Academy Editions, 1998) is a mostwelcome addition to the growing Fluxus literature, one which puts Fluxus into the scholarly pursuits of present and future scholars. It took three decades to fulfill the request of George Maciunas to do a &quot;history&quot; of Fluxus. But this book is more than a history; it gives a theoretical basis for the study of Fluxus, amplifies the known sources and expands upon the ideas and theories of artists, scholars and theoreticians. The influx of new Fluxus scholars, the younger scholars, has given new insights into a movement that over the more than 30 years has become part of the history of art. The book is divided into History, Theory, Critical perspectives, a transcript of the videotaped Interview with George Maciunas, Two Fluxus theories: one by Ken Friedman and one by Dick Higgins, and a chronology, a list of selected Fluxus art works and related primary source materials, and a list of selected Fluxus sources and related secondary sources. There is much in this volume compacted so the lists are fine for my eyes, but might require a magnifying glass. But the book is indeed the first comprehensive overview on this challenging and controversial group.Judith A. Hoffberg, Editor &amp; Publisher, Umbrella"},{"Title":"The Fluxus Reader","review":"This is the first widely useable source on Fluxus, an experimental group of artists and composers whose work in the 1960s reshaped the art of our times. Experimental in the extreme, these artists were controversial and contemplative, sometimes contentious and often cooperative. Their number included many central figures in contemporary art. Nam June Paik, the founder of video art and the man who named the information superhighway, was one of the best known. So were Joseph Beuys, Emmett Williams, Dick Higgins, and La Monte Young. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the philosophy of an exciting but confusing moment in art history. A thorough documentary section supports the book. The chronologies and bibliographies are particularly valuable. They make this book a necessary companion to anyone who hopes to make sense of the exhibition catalogues and artist books that have been the only source of information on Fluxus until now. An exciting team of scholars wrote this book. They range from the distinguished senior scholars such as Stephen Foster and Estera Milman to articulate new voices such as Ina Blom and Craig Saper. The book is edited by Ken Friedman, once one of the central figures in Fluxus, and now a management professor. If you are interested in intermedia, video, performance art, or happenings, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Gatling gun,","review":"This book is a complete history of the Gatling gun and NO book published since has held a candle to it."},{"Title":"The Gatling gun,","review":"The book was received very quickly and in good shape.

This time the weapon is a missile full of anthrax and sarin, a neurotoxin. A miracle occurs and the missile crashes through a window in the United Nations Building traveling backwards. It fails to explode. The ensuing investigation reveals the missile was built in Russia during the Cold War. FBI Russian expert William Cowley is assigned to work closely with an old friend, Dimitri Danilov, one of Moscow's top men in the investigation of organized crime.Working first on opposite sides of the Atlantic, and then together, the two men unravel a crazy quilt plot of Russian gangsters and American ultra right wing hackers, which masks an even more obscure story of political maneuvering and infighting. Time after time, new evidence seems to obscure, rather than clarify, the case. It seems that the criminals ability to plan and execute is only marred by their occasional poor choices of weapons. In the meantime agents die and Cowley and Danilov seem powerless to make and progress.The third player on the investigation team is FBI agent Pamela Darnley. She works with Cowley and heads the U.S. investigation when he is in Russia. To say that Darnley is ambitious is an understatement, but she is intelligent and determined, and is responsible for many of the case's breakthroughs. Since Cowley and Danilov were originally introduced in \\"No Time For Heroes\\" most of the character development is lavished on Darnley. The reader will find her an intriguing and unusual character.I find I like novels in the spy genre best when they most resemble police procedurals, and that is what \\"The Watchmen\\" excels at. Plotting is tight as the story shifts back and forth from Russia to the States. There are countless puzzle pieces, but the solutions are logical rather than magical. And nobody has superpowers, either. Other than slight flaws due to minimalistic character development this is a very readable story that echoes and extremely uncomfortable reality.(\\"The Watchmen\\" was actually conceived and written before the events of 9/11. In the light of that tragedy, portions of the book had to be revised to reflect that harsh reality.)"},{"Title":"The Watchmen","review":"The rocket is fired from the nearby East River striking the UN Building in the China sector, killing a few workers by its impact though the explosion did not occurr. However, the bomb detonation experts realize that the warhead contains biological poisons and is leaking so that any person who has already come in contact will be dead shortly. Though the lettering on the warhead is Russian, the Kremlin denies that this warhead was part of its inventory.Still the two countries cooperate as FBI Moscow expert William Crowley and the Russian Organized Crime Bureau Chief Dimitri Danilov begin a joint investigation. Other attacks follow with credit for the assaults claimed by a previously unknown group, THE WATCHMEN. William and Dimitri wonder how to stop the watchmen who apparently consist of American finance and computer gurus with Russian criminals?THE WATCHMEN is an exciting espionage thriller that never slows down on the cat and mouse chase that spans two continents. The lead duo is engaging but morose, a pair who have seen too much in their respective lives; their gloomy personalities actually add dark tension to the dynamic story line. Brian Freemantle never quite slows down to provide the demands of THE WATCHMEN so that the audience is left with an exhilarating thrill ride that will please the action adventure reader, but also leave fans with a \\"huh\\" that asks why they committed the deeds?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Watchmen","review":"The blurbs on the cover praise the author and compare him to LeCarre. He is like LeCarre; they both have the ability to take an exciting premise and reduce it to dry dust with endless dialogue and irrelevant digression. A missle hits a building and fails to detonate; its lethal cargo of germs is contained. The rest of the book is devoted to finding the perps. It ends with the old cliche; most baddies captured but the real ringleader begins all over again to build a new evil gang.

I love that the authors don't take themselves or the subject matter too seriously, but still manage, with genius accuracy and eloquence, to capture the essence of each sign. There is a time and a place for detailed psychological analysis and awed reverence for the majesty of Astrology at work in the Universe. If that's what you're in the mood for right now, you might be better off at a Liz Greene lecture. But if you really just want to celebrate the pulse jumping, eye sparkling, breathless JOY of falling in love, or even just of finally getting off with the person who somehow always makes you feel tingly and alive with their mere presence, I can't think of any other astrological work better suited to the task. The astrology is entirely sound, but what really makes this book so irresistable is the humour, verve and panache with which it is delivered.

For example, in talking about Libras, they launch into a story about how one of the authors was horribly treated by their Libra girlfriend, except that instead of using this as an example, they implied that everyone else's Libra girlfriend would most probably act the same way. If you can take their specific examples with a grain of salt, on the whole the book gives some good advice. However, if you want to have a lasting relationship after seducing someone, this is not the book to buy. This book's advice is better for getting a one-night stand or short-lived fling. For example, this book says that to seduce an Aries, you should make a bold first move. This might get them into bed once or twice, but in the long run, according to nine out of ten astrology books that you picked up, this will bore them, as they need a challenge and prefer to make the first move themselves. All in all there are some good insights in this book, but I would browse it in the bookstore instead of paying for it."},{"Title":"Seduction by the Stars: An Astrological Guide To Love, Lust, And Intimate Relationships","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, my hopes sank after the first couple of chapters.\\"Seduction by the stars\\" is simply boring pop astrology. For one thing, I am a bit tired of hearing that Taurus is predictable in bed and prefers the missionary position. What a stupid generalization and superficial judgement. First of all, everyone who knows the slightest about astrology knows that the sun sign is only one aspect of the complexity of a whole human being. One must take into consideration ALL aspects in each individual's birth chart (planetary positions according to time of birth, location, etc). I am a Taurus, and I am not fat, nor glutonous, something the book really harps relentlessly on. Every Taurus person's heart is reached through their stomach, according to the book. I find that absurd and bordering on insulting. The author relies on outdated concepts, insipid anedoctes, and personal experience/preference rather than deep study and understanding. This book was put together in a hurry to lure the curious and make a ton of money - regretfully undeserved. Do not waste your money or time on this amateurish astrology book. Try instead the insightful and no-nonsense writings of Carol Allen."},{"Title":"Seduction by the Stars: An Astrological Guide To Love, Lust, And Intimate Relationships","review":"Unless your idea of great literature is a 12 question sex quiz in Cosmo magazine, you will obtain almost nothing of intellectual, emotional or spiritual value regarding either sex or astrology by reading this truly ridiculous book. It has a few (very few) funny or astrologically astute observations but the majority of the text is worthless. Psychological and humanistic astrology are wonderful fields for exploring the intricacies of sex and many interesting metaphysical books have been written on the subjects of relationships and intimacy, but, unfortunately, this is not one of them. Every tired old cliche about sun signs is trotted out and discussed in a sophomoric manner--there are even lists of \\"unsexy\\" members of each zodiacal sign.

I toned down the techniques a couple of notches, but I've always caught the guy I used it on.

He shows that the prophecy of Daniel 9 is concerned fully with Christ and has nothing to do with an anti-christ. If read with an open mind you will find that, even though he does not agree with most modern thinkers, Mauro accurately divides the truth of God's word. He clearly shows how the six promises (vs. 24) come to pass by the atonement of Christ. The cross is the main focus in this passage. He clearly shows that it is Christ's death that stops the Jewish sacrificial system (vs 27) and fulfills the prophecy.

Mauro points out the errors in Dispensationalism, as well as opening up the plain meaning of Daniel chapter 9 and Matthew Chapter 24.One helpful feature of the book is his making available extended passages from Josephus, which show how the destruction of the temple in AD 70 fulfilled a lot of what Jesus said in his Olivet discourse.I also recommend reading Mauro's The Hope of Israel.If you want something sane and balanced, put down your Left Behind books, and read this stuff."},{"Title":"The seventy weeks and the great tribulation;: A study of the last two visions of Daniel, and of the Olivet discourse of the Lord Jesus Christ","review":"Excellent book, thorough research and unlike what is common today, Philip did not have to insert gaps of time in order to get it all to fit.

It is rare to find books like this where someone compares scripture with scripture as extensively as Philip does."},{"Title":"The seventy weeks and the great tribulation;: A study of the last two visions of Daniel, and of the Olivet discourse of the Lord Jesus Christ","review":"This book has opened my eyes. It has given me a greater appreciation for biblical prophecy and and greater awareness of what not to use for end-times prophecy. Mauro goes through the last 3 prophecies of Daniel and shows how they are all related but specifically the 70 weeks prophecy. He explains what each verse is referring to and has a great understanding of biblical events that would take years to learn. He points out how Matthew 24 has been fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD. How Daniel's 70 week prophecy was specifically talking about the Messiah coming and the Jews crowning sin of putting him to death and the destruction and scattering of the Jewish nation being the punishment of that great sin. This review of these prophecies is hard to dispute because of all of the biblical evidence that Mauro uses. It is a must read for anyone interested in biblical prophecy. God Bless."},{"Title":"The seventy weeks and the great tribulation;: A study of the last two visions of Daniel, and of the Olivet discourse of the Lord Jesus Christ","review":"I should first mention that I am a Futurist because I feel it demonstrates the greatest hermeneutic consistency. A gap between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week doesn't bother me as much as inconsistent hermeneutics does.Mauro's book is more convincing and thorough than some others like Mills' \\"Daniel Fulfilled Prophecy\\" and Hailey's \\"A Commentary on Daniel\\". Mauro certainly should be commended for his reverence of scripture, but ultimately his exegesis fails to convince. For example, he switches focus from Herod the Great to Augustus Caesar in his exegesis of Daniel 11:40-43 without any real explanation as to why. He simply is picking and choosing history that might fit his prior eschatology. I found many examples of this sort of thing. (In fairness, futurists can also be guilty of this).I did not at all care for some of his scathing comments about futurists or those who disagree with him. Really, stick to the facts and make arguments that demonstrate the inconsistency of the other camp, but please don't get nasty. This really is unbecoming behavior among Christian authors. It also defeats any positive contributions that Mauro might otherwise make.I suggest Thomas Howe's exhaustive book, \\"Daniel in the Preterists' Den for a very thorough review of the myriad of Preterist opinions. I hope my Preterist friends would read this book. Even if they disagree, the value of Howe's insight and hermeneutical consistency takes things to a whole new level. Trust me, Howe has the most consistent hermeneutics. As a former Preterist, I can testify to the value of getting the whole picture from both sides. Preterists will discover the Futurists' best arguments that they need to prepare for in Howe's book.Likewise, I would recommend Mauro's book to any Futurist wanting to see the full picture. Futurists also need to know what the other side believes and why they believe it. \\"Examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good\\" (1 Th 5:21 NASB).I call Preterists \\"friends\\"!"},{"Title":"Advanced C/Book and Disk","review":"This book is an easy to read, advanced C programming book.

The author pinned her explanation of American influence in Europe on canny business practices. The service ethic. Big-branding. Supermarkets. These are some of the themes that are worked over to make the case. The book is delighfully stuffed with anecdotes, vignettes and odd facts and statistics to lend it the feel of visiting a large emporium of ideas. Personally, I liked this 'shelf browsing' feel to the chapters.The book has a few serious downsides which marr its central argument. First and foremost, the author takes little cognisance of the influence of WWII on shaping European attitudes towards American culture. Secondly, in the two generations after WWII more Europeans (percentage) speak English in order to accommodate their ambitions. The author attributes the creeping growth of English pre-WWII to business needs (strange to me that she singles out the Rotarians as particularly influential). However, that does not explain its widesprgead endorsement by the general citizenry after WWII. This brings me the third issue, the lack of attention paid to the rise of youth culture - largely driven by perceptions of American youth in the fifties. Music, rock'n'roll and the drug culture were directed to a large extent by American tastes. Consumerism is too broad a concept to explain the uptake of American habits.Despite these lacunae, the book is a a thought-provoking exercise and though the prose is bit attenuated at times, it is overall readable and stimualting."},{"Title":"Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe","review":"This is a deeply insightful work on how America \\"conquered\\" Western Europe with one of the most devastating and total weapons in its arsenal during the twentieth century: economics. De Grazia isolates the nine characteristics of American consumer culture (the service ethic, branding, corporate advertising, etc.) and how each of these overcame intense cultural opposition in Europe and eventually made the West a true \\"consumers paradise.\\" Here analysis is very keen on both how America's consumer-culture changed the European world in the interwar period (c. 1919-1939) and how those gains were solidified following World War II's end. However, there is one thing about this work that makes it seem distant both to me and to any possible general readers: de Grazia's prose is too cerebral. This is typified with her overuse of the words \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"bourgeoisie,\\" which I was able to understand having had those words drilled into my head in my high school European history class, but I doubt that the average history reader would get it. In fact, her prose is so erudite that, at times, it hides the main argument in each chapter. While America's cultural dominance of twentieth century Europe should be studied, I would recommend this book only to a true history buff with a high SAT verbal score."},{"Title":"Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe","review":"De Grazia shows that the triumph of American-style consumption in Europe -- from supermarkets to Hollywood movies -- wasn't automatic; there were alternatives, there was resistance, there was a history. The book is full of fascinating surprises: Woodrow Wilson's speech to the first World's Salesmanship Congress in 1916; the Duluth-Dresden connection; Hitler promising to protect Europe from American economic domination. This may be the best book we have on the history of consumption in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe","review":"The central theme of Irresistible Empire was that \`America's hegemony was built on European territory' and through the Marshall Plan, the Market Empire tried \`to bind western Europe to its own concept of consumer democracy.' The body of the composition examined the features of this Market Empire: \`other nations as having limited sovereignty over their public space'; \`exportation of its civil society meaning its voluntary associations, social scientific knowledge and civic spirit - in tandem with, if not ahead of, the country's economic exports'; \`the power of norms-making' governed by \`the rules of \`best practice' as spelled out by enterprising businessmen, civic leaders, and conscientious bureaucrats.'; \`vaunted democratic ethos, democracy in the realm of consumption coming down to espousing equality in the face of commonly known as standards'; and \`apparent peaceableness - obscuring the fact that the Market Empire advanced rapidly in times of war and that its many military victories - and occasional defeats - were always accompanied by significant breakthroughs to the benefit of its consumer industries and values.' De Grazia delineated the power and expansion of the Market Empire by three focuses: \`forces pushing out from the United States, which caused the consumer revolution in the first place and propelled its institutions and practices into Europe'; \`brings into focus Europe to reconstruct the commercial civilization that confronted American consumer culture with a rival vision of market institutions and values' and \`the new transatlantic dialectic fostered by America's consumer revolution. More than a pace-setter or the first to get there, American consumer culture catalyzed discontents, produced ruptures, and pushed aside obstacles.The Service EthicsDe Grazia used \`the spread of Rotary clubs to show how European elites began to accommodate to a new life that emphasized the material commonality of daily needs.' The club's promotion of \`a new spirit of service capitalism' epitomized \`how Bourgeois Men Made Peace with Babbittry' and de Grazia humorously stressed the use of \`babbitt and Babbittry not as pejoratives but as terms invented by a fast-changing social lexicon to characterize new ideal types of middle-class identity and social behavior.' Even though it appears to be egalitarian and transparent, \`the real power of decisionmaking rested with the imperturbable \`Men of Chicago.' Looking at Dresden, the club's \`service ideal was hard to imagine, much less to implement, in communities wracked by partisan, religious, and regional splits' yet, \`belonging to Rotary also promised to reestablish the business trust to support Germany's export economy' during the interwar years. In an example of pushing aside obstacles, \`Rotary was urging European Catholics too to believe that religion worked not by means of doctrinal persuasion, but by individually interpreting scripture as a guide to social conduct.. At Rotary's urging, Catholics were to become not less religious, but differently religious.'A Decent Standard of LivingThe American standard was marked by an American consumer culture that asserted \`the good life consists of a decent income for lots of people spent individually by purchasing goods that they believe enable them to live comfortably,' which could be defined by scientifically measuring \`the amount of wages, the expansion of purchasing power, the bountiful output of mass production, and the range of individual choices provided by private enterprise.' The standard conferred \`consumer sovereignty' - \`the power granted to consumers to exercise freedom of demand, champion the power citizens might exercise by means of their choices as consumers.' \`There were classes of goods, but no longer classes of people.' The breakthrough came in the US when Franklin Roosevelt's domestic and economic policies recognized Keynes' theories on demands and the relationship with the overall level of consumer expenditures. Roosevelt's \`government regarded the consumer not as a political force, but as an aggregate in economic growth' when it recognized \`collective rights to bargaining at the same time as setting up social security.' The European \`government responses to the Great Depression spelled the death knell of the political economy underpinnings of the old regime of consumption' and \`one remarkable outcome was that pumping up purchasing power began to be viewed as indispensable to the recovery of capitalism.' French sociologist Halbwachs found that \`new needs could cause people to jettison fixed hierarchies of wants' when hitherto, \`social classes lived in ways utterly segregated from each other even if they had similar incomes.'The Chain Store\`Fordism had made way for Fileneism,' named after Edward Albert Filene who coined the adage, \\"True mass production is not production of masses of goods but production for masses of people.\\" \`By concentrating managerial expertise, capital, and decisionmaking capacities in one headquarters, the chain store performed as a \`machine for selling.' The chain store concept developed in fertile American terrain because \`the small shop would never be sanctified as it was in contemporary Europe as a social institution valuable in itself. The net effect was to accustom business, state policy, and the public to never0ending, head-spinning newness in the retail trades.' The growing \`middleness was also a distinctive a feature of American consumer culture' - \`middle as in the \`middle millions' was also the social self-definition of the growing number of people occupied as employees, managers, and experts in all sorts of merchandising-related services.' In Europe, \`class behaviors, which weighed so heavily on consumers' standards of living, similarly shaped where and how consumers shopped. The plethora of people involved in small commerce regarded themselves not merely as economic units, but as the very pillars of a social order doomed to death if they failed to survive.' Again, the consequences of the Depression wrecked the old models. \`The European department stores operated in a far less mobile market than their U.S. counterparts, reducing their customer base and weakening their capacity to source goods' and during the \`interwar years, department store began to wobble as the standard-bearer of bourgeois consumption and, on the other, small commerce flagged in its claim to represent the sound alternative universe of the middle classes.' The twin developments paved way for the challenge of the Five-and-Dime, which showed that \`mass retailing could make as heady as profit as manufacturing.' The giant chain \`spelled a social revolution by attracting a socially mixed clientele. Thereby they lessened the gap in purchasing habits between the bourgeoisie and the middle classes broadly intended, and in some places between the lower-middle and working classes.' Furthermore, \`trust in the pricing system came from factors that were extrinsic to the item,' inculcating \`the feeling that customers were al being treated equally.' The outcome was that \`mass retailing was now available to the masses as it pressed into residential neighborhoods amid small shops that had not hitherto had to contend with major competition.'Big-Brand GoodsEven though European products dominated the Great Leipzig Fair, production strategy marked key trans-Atlantic divergences. \`As a result of diversification, German firms could not invest as much in research, design and marketing as the American firms did, and their line of models was more limited.' Furthermore, \`generally, many of the new U.S. inventions were labor-saving, whereas in Europe, they were resource-saving; the former were applied to household, the latter to manufacture.' \`U.S. manufacturing was becoming fabled for namely high-profile branded products. These were the consumer durables, the convenience items, the comfort goods.' \`Old World merchandising emphasized the character of the product, highlighting qualities that could be said to be intrinsic to it and closely related to the environment in which it was produced. The New World's marketing emphasized the product's personality, highlighting outward charms that compensated the consumer for not knowing its place of origin or its intrinsic qualities.' \`Marketing the brand thus became a way to neutralize the Europeans' monopolies over circuits of local knowledge.' \`The modern marketer's duty was to get bourgeois consumers to relinquish their paralyzing nostalgia for so-called authentic goods by creating brands that were useful, tasteful, and sensitive to preserving social hierarchy.'Corporate Advertising\`American advertisers posed their goal as promoting a science in the name of corporate profits; on the other hand, \`Europeans often claimed to be defending an art in the name of a community of feeling about the familiar brands, pastimes, and places of local material life.' As the \`prototype of the full-service agency, grouping under one roof all the personnel and equipment needed to carry out advertising on a scientific basis,' J Walter Thompson was even the \`leading consultant of Europe's makeover under the Marshall Plan.' \`Like European distribution generally, advertising pivoted around the major capitals of consumption and their mainly bourgeois clientele. Trendsetters could thus rely on what Edward Bernays called the \`innate social-fashion-taste planning' of European elites.' The American challenge pitted \`American mass-circulation press' against \`the design aesthetic associated with European postermaking traditions.' The American success created \`the most significant pressure to shift to American-style text advertising was also the most complicated, namely to enable the advertiser to communicate with his public': \`The pressure to incorporate, even sometimes to plagiarize, American text styles came from leading enterprises and showed up particularly vividly in the ever-more massive advertising for food, drink, and toiletries.' Ironically, \`Nazi Germany offered the most propitious environment for American-style advertising in all Europe.'The Star SystemIn de Grazia's words, \`How \`Hollywood' by which we mean the mass-produced, classically narrated feature film mainly fashioned in the giant studio systems of southern California - challenged European commercial civilization is the subject of this chapter.' The Great War broke the back of European dominance: \`the moment must have been mid-1916. For it was then that U.S. motion picture exports to Europe leaped, taking advantage of the slowing of local production.' \`By August 1918, when the Armistice ended the fighting, American releases could be found practically everywhere there was a moviehouse, the big exception being Germany.' The American \`Motion Picture Patents Company: shaped the future organization of the whole industry' and \`had barred foreign firms from its licensing cartels.' To oust the remaining French influences in domestic cinema, MPPC successfully pursued and applied \`the cultural defense' by engendering \`debate over style and content of movies' and formalizing \`new aesthetic categories' in order to \`distinguish healthy films from insalubrious ones.' \`With the US market thus permanently captured for national producers by a system of protectionism exercising power over both distribution and taste,' the exportation efforts muscled its way in Europe. The Herriot decree on film quota was overturned by the threat of American boycott and the unemployment of French film workers. The dominance was checked temporarily by the Nazis: \`German industrialists had long encouraged their potential partners, first and foremost in France, to establish a vertically organized lobby like their own SPIO in order to end their internal squabbles and exercise effective political power.' By the war's end, \`Hollywood made it clear that according to its agenda the \`war had been waged to win back the European film market.'The Consumer-Citizen\`The market could not be trusted to be egalitarian and that government had to intervene to equalize their citizens' purchasing power. Thereby European societies had come around to embracing the right to \`social citizenship'.' Nevertheless, \`starting in the 50s was the conflict between the European vision of the social citizen and the American notion of the sovereign consumer.' De Grazia identified the Marshall Plan's \`ultimate intention to promote a cross-Atlantic, western European wide alliance to grow consumption.' Therefore, \`as a condition for obtaining aid, American officials not only pressed for more or less legal ouster of the left from government coalitions... it sought to repress labor radicalism by splitting the trade union movements.' \`Because of its \`inability to resist militarily,' western Europe \`has to compensate economically.' \`To do this, the region had to keep pace with Soviet rates of growth. Thereby it could weaken if not destroy the appeal of communism to its workers and intellectuals.' In turn, \`its rising standard of living would give the lie to communist propaganda about the decadence of the West' and have \`a magnetic effect on the satellite peoples.' \`Sharply rising demand had the effect of reorienting the distribution system to the \`one class market' that had enabled American manufacturers to commit to mass production systems in the early 20th century.' \`By so doing, it broke the monopoly of manufacturers who in their domestic sales were too exclusively concerned with service to a limited, almost custom-tailored high quality market.' \`The figure of the consumer-citizen took a further step away from the past with the establishment of the Common Market in 1957.'Supermarketing\`The key to success was to make a speedy entry and offer stunningly effective services. The stores would open for business as quickly and perform so efficiently that public officials, starting with the mayor, would grant them the license to operate.' \`Supermarket Italiani showed European capitalists that investments in food retailing could harvest excellent profits. Second, it set a clear standard for procedure and equipment. And, third, it lent support to a new alliance, forged among big capital, new local entrepreneurship, government and consumers. This alliance was indispensable to revising laws and changing customs so as to establish the supermarket as the main reference point for making calculations about provisioning.'A Model Mrs. ConsumerThe last chapter detailed the culmination of the Market Empire in Europe and the new lifestyle it fashioned. \`The kitchen's manager was the modern homemaker, a Mrs. Consumer who worked solo or with her electric servants.' \`Her most important task was to balance the competing needs weighing on the family budget.' \`As women and men joined themselves in marriage to secure their future, they negotiated each other's functions with contractlike precision.' \`Good management of the family held out the promise that the American Standard of Living would continue to improve and American women were becoming more and more adept at converting wages into goods and services.' \`Economic women, in the figure of Mrs. Consumer, personified what economists came to call the \`family utility function': in making choices she behaved as if she knew the wants of her husband and children as well as she knew her own.' Overcoming inveterate feelings of disgrace and social faux pas attached to credit, the community of belief by the turn of the 1970s embraced \`the new standard of living that was based on the full stock of household equipment included not only all classes, but also regions formerly excluded from any national notion of norms of comfort.'Conclusion\`As mass consumer models became universalized, the grounds for American hegemony became less evident.' \`By the 1980s, the average western European enjoyed a higher standard of living than the average American.' De Grazia noted that curiously, \`the US no longer exercises a sufficient technological edge to monopolize innovations in either production or consumption' and \`the Market Empire has lost its impetus to other regions.' In the area of supermarket for example, the French-owned Carrefour out compete Walmart in China and \`has been the main innovator in Latin America.' Essentially, \`nothing now prevents the pioneers of multinationalism from themselves falling prey to global predators. In 1987, J. Walter Thompson was taken over in a hostile bid by the British based firm Wire & Plastic Products.' \`In the end, mass consumer culture is such an ephemeral form of material life that the great ruptures that formed it are easily lost to sight.' De Grazia's study revealed the pivotal role American social inventions played in Europe's regeneration and the broader global development today."},{"Title":"Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe","review":"What the other reviews fail to convey about this wonderful book is that the writing is exquisite.

Never in a million years! What we need is a little of the European culture to rub off on us crude Americans, especially those with all the money who flaunt their wealth and power. It is only temporary. Any disaster could wipe them out and they'd be as poor as some of us and have no power of persuasion to the king pins. Today, in America, money is all that matters. If you have none, then you are a nobody.I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but sometimes an unusual cover can grab a reader's attention when another more drab would not. The girl on the airplane engine dressed in a '60s outfit complete with flowered cowgirl hat looks like a young Jackie Kennedy, the closest thing we ever had to royalty in America. She was the style maven back then (with her Marilyn Monroe voice), but she was always a lady and, like Diana, loved the colorful hats. They could make or break the outfit!This was more like a romp through Europe than an \\"advance.\\" After all, we're not talking war here. How about the movies? The 'Brave New World of Manhattan\\" of the Twenties was the model for the super-modernistic film, METROPOLIS, which was filmed in Berlin in 1926.

'Metropolis' was a \\"technical marvel with feet of clay\\" -- three years in the making saw the end of illusions; no interface between European and American filmmaking.From the Dresden file: \\"Nobody was made to go it alone.Either they marry or a club they join...Club life is as old as mankind itselfClub life, the dance around the golden calf.The times have not changed.

It was quite a show.Now sex is a big deal in today's society. You don't have to fall in love and get married to be 'active' and have a family. It is not looked down on in today's society (except for church, perhaps) for this type of bad behavior to constantly be flaunted in today's world. It is the world of America. To be respected for a well-brought-up family is passe. Today, anything goes.Victoria is a professor of history at Columbia University in New York.

America will always be different from Europe as we have no royalty here, no special personage to admire and try to emulate. The Pope in in the Vatican. The Queen is in England. Jesus is at the right hand of God. What on earth can we aspire to in a country so full of sin and greed -- not much for the average folks. The rich enjoy their big houses and cars (and vans), vacations, cruises, trips overseas; while the rest of us are struggling just to get through one day at a time.

This book contains the instructions on how to build this ancient device, and it is a hoot for any combination electronics hobbyist/history buff.Don Lancaster was working on the design a high resolution video display at work when he realized that a cheap display, attached to a typewriter and a television, could be popular and economical for the masses. Don's first cut at the TV Typewriter was completed in 1973 and used TTL digital logic and 512 bits of shift register memory. There was a built-in RF modulator so you could connect it to any TV. Microprocessors were brand-new technology and RAM was very expensive per memory location, so they were not part of the design. Professional terminals cost over one thousand dollars, so 120 dollars was not considered to be expensive to electronics enthusiasts in comparison. Don's design was a video terminal that could display 2 pages of 16 lines of 32 upper case characters on a standard television. This seems primitive now, but it was the first real step forward in home computing. This book was not based on that original design, but was the result of some improvements Don made on it, and was printed in 1976. It was more than just a guide on building the simple typewriter/TV interface, though.

He writes of what he sees and what affects him. He also is reflective about how he effects the local residents or native Machiguenga guides. I have some sadness that the tribes he encountered (1960's) may no longer be there. He writes honestly, not claiming superiority, for example he takes pistol shots at crocodiles. His adventure down the Urubamba was particularly compelling ... would he find the giant crocodile bones, would he find the lost city ruins? Along the way he manages to accomplish something remarkable (the traverse of the Pongo), and as any proud adventurer, tries to understand if his adventure was historically unique.

They have no creature comforts, tend llamas, alpacas, and spin wool at the tender age of three or four, yet have the most beautiful smiles and natures! Peter Matthiesen is obviously a expert, dedicated birdwatcher, and naturalist, detailing many of his sightings. Matthiesen's encounters with Peruvian \\"artful dodgers\\" are well told and his many travails, particularly on the Urabamba river are exciting."},{"Title":"The cloud forest;: A chronicle of the South American wilderness","review":"Matthiessen's account is an honest travelogue of South America, dedicating much of its time to the Peruvian jungle. His narrative portrays a paradoxical mix of racial insensitivity, ignorance, enlightenment and progressive views. He refers to some cultures as almost subhuman, at one point proclaiming that one tribe would be better off killed at birth than living their miserable lives while at other times sympathizing with and even trying to interact with the indigenous peoples he encounters. He dislikes both Evangelical and Catholic attempts at \\"civilizing\\" the Indians thinking them more dignified when left alone and away from outside influences but he abhores the Quechua and Aymar&aacute; ascribing them all manner of derogatory traits which teach the reader more about his own prejudice than about these cultures. Matthiessen refers to numerous prior works on South America and the Amazon and it seems that many of these colonial 19th century views on race have influenced his own. As someone who has lived in Bolivia for many years, I find his adventures fascinating, his accuracy and prose commendable but must also strongly caution readers that many of his derogatory descriptions of entire cultures are both wrong and offensive."},{"Title":"The cloud forest;: A chronicle of the South American wilderness","review":"With the exception of the last chapter, which comprises one hundred plus pages, this is basically a mental travelogue.I was hoodwinked by the back cover where it mentions the author traveled 20,000 miles through South America. It does not inform the reader that the majority of his movements were by plane, train, bus and auto for half the book. Misleading.The final chapter does deserve its place in adventurous undertakings though. Rafting down the menacing Peruvian Urubamba River and through the unforgiving Pongo Rapids does have its rank in historical accomplishments. Searching for primitive mandible bones and lost ruins in such a merciless environment is good arm-chair exploring.I could have done without the other chapters, comparable to watching a mind-numbing documentary."},{"Title":"The cloud forest;: A chronicle of the South American wilderness","review":"What I like about Matthiessen's account is that he has no clear destination (e.g, through &quot;some remarkably bad planning, I crossed the Andes nine times in five months&quot;)., and hence open to adventure and experience. He writes of what he sees and what affects him. He also is reflective about how he effects the local residents or native Machiguenga guides. I have some sadness that the tribes he encountered (1960's) may no longer be there. He writes honestly, not claiming superiority, for example he takes pistol shots at crocodiles. His adventure down the Urubamba was particularly compelling ... would he find the giant crocodile bones, would he find the lost city ruins? Along the way he manages to accomplish something remarkable (the traverse of the Pongo), and as any proud adventurer, tries to understand if his adventure was historically unique. For bird watchers, there is an added enjoyment of trying to identify some of the birds he describes along the way. This travel journal sets a standard for other adventurers and for my own daily journals."},{"Title":"The cloud forest;: A chronicle of the South American wilderness","review":"Well, once again, a tonic and delight; I have borrowed this book from the library and am getting it for my niece as gift.

I tell people there are just no better descriptions always of flowers and birds. I must say, even more than usual by a writer who is needless to say and obviously a great wit, I was laughing hilariously at his accounts of his adventures in this book. I'll say the same thing about Peter Matthiessen as I say about Wallace Stegner (and Phillip Fradkin, too, I decided, a new fav) - he is BELOVED.

I'm sorry I waited so long.I think her chief ability as a novelist is to develop realistic, well-rounded characters. I felt as if I'd known these people and shared hardship and triumph with them. The list of 19th and 20th century authors who thought she was the best is very long. Now I see why her contemporaries thought so highly of her. She is awesome.I noticed some young readers' reviews had a hard time \\"getting her\\". I'm not too surprised. This story follows its characters from youth to in their mature years. A teenager may have trouble identifying with a 40+ spinster reluctant to follow her heart. And apparently when the story leaps forward 16 years many seem angered. One of the purposes of fiction is to explore human emotion and experience impossible to craft in a work of non-fiction. An essential element in the contract between author and reader is a willing suspension of disbelief by the writer's audience. Without this empathy prose is merely a collection of words on paper whose usefulness is limited.In O Pioneers!

So begins one of the greatest love stories of all time. I don't use the term love story loosely; this book contains love in its many intricate, shifting, and enduring forms: the love of the land, the love of a dream, love within families, love of the past, love of tradition, love of new opportunities, love between friends, the love between men and women, and the love of living.

Her main character, Alexandra Bergson, is a Swedish immigrant. Cather creates a marvelous portrait of the community and its rich mix of European ethnic groups: Norwegian, Swedish, French, etc. It is especially fascinating to see the multicultural, multiethnic world they created in the United States. Cather also depicts the cultural and linguistic &quot;shift&quot; that takes place along generational lines.Cather's story deals with issues of economics, gender roles, and sexuality. In addition to the formidable Alexandra, she creates a cast of compelling characters. And her luminous prose style evokes all of the sensations of Alexandra's world: the smell of ripe wheat, the chirping of insects in the long grass, the golden play of light in an apple orchard.But this is Alexandra's book. She is a great American heroine who reminds me of such beloved characters as Zora Neale Hurston's Janie (from &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;) or Alice Walker's Celie (from &quot;The Color Purple&quot;). Like those great characters, Alexandra will break your heart, deeply touch your soul, and ultimately leave you feeling richer for having known her.Finally, as an interesting companion text to &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; try &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; the 1922 play by U.S. writer Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill's life and career were contemporary with Cather's, and &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; like &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, deals with a Swedish immigrant woman in the United States."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Some writers are identified with a particular country or region, others with a specific period in history. Willa Cather is known for both. When I think of her, I think of the prairie states, especially Nebraska, and I think of the days of the intrepid pioneers of the prairies, struggling to make a life for themselves that was tenuous, at best.Although Cather spent only a few years of her childhood on the vast prairie lands of Nebraska, she returned to those memories again and again in her most powerful and famous fiction, such as My Antonia and The Song of the Lark.The title of one of her celebrated novels, O Pioneers! is rather unique in that it has an exclamation point at the end of it. Think about it: how many other book titles do you know that have exclamation points? That sense of breathlessness, excitement, and fierce determination which is conveyed in the very look of the title O Pioneers! comes across from the very first pages of this novel.This is the story of Alexandra Bergson and her family who risk everything they have to carve out a home in the unforgiving Nebraska landscape. Alexandra is forced at a very young age to take on the responsibility for her mother and brothers after her father dies. Before he dies, her father makes Alexandra, his most trusted child, promise to keep the farm and to make it thrive. This she does, although at a high personal cost.The novel is a short one and moves quickly from decade to decade. It begins with a touching scene involving Alexandra's youngest brother Emil, whose stray kitten is rescued by Alexandra's best friend, Carl. The moment is a sweet one, and all ends well; but this is perhaps the only time in the book that we see problems so easily and satisfactorily resolved.The land is harsh and brings out both the best and the worst in people. Those with weak wills and weak values often stumble and are sometimes destroyed. The Nebraska prairie is not a place where love and gentle dreams can flourish without interference; young people particularly often find their fondest dreams tossed aside the way the blade of a plow uproots the tender prairie grasses.There is heartbreak and loneliness in O Pioneers!,but there are also moments of pure exhilaration and veneration for the savage beauty of the land. Alexandra suffers as she tries to keep her vision of what the land can mean for her and her family. Like many of the women in the novels of Willa Cather, Alexandra rises above the ordinary, and continues with dogged determination along the path she has set for herself. The price she pays is high, but we know it is not too high, despite what has been lost. And, appropriately, the last sentence in O Pioneers! ends with this exclamatory sentence:\\"Fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth!\\"Fortunate, indeed!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Before I review the novel, I want to point out that most of the reviews that have given it one star seem to be coming from, perhaps, immature audiences...&quot;it was totally uncoool!&quot; Now, this book is not the best thing you'll ever read, but it IS very worthy of reading. Don't be discouraged by the title, as I once was. Basically, the story talks about Alexandra, a Swedish woman who has to take care of the family once her father dies at the beginning of the book. I didn't really admire her character or was interested too much in it, but that's okay because a lot of the plot involves her brother Emil and her neighbor Marie and their clandestine type of love...it's a heartwarming novel and a very entertaining read. I read the book in one night. The setting was very well depicted and had a sense of magic, evethough there's nothing of a supernatural nature in the book. The characters were very lively and realistic. I wasn't really too satisfied with the ending, but I enjoyed it greatly nonetheless. It is an excellent work ; I recommend it."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather is fantastic and this book is absolutely classic, but this edition is missing small bits of text throughout. It's only a couple lines here and there and not really something that most would consider &#34;essential&#34; to the story - the text of Carl's telegram and verses that Alexandra thinks on - but it is certainly an omission."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"What if Cather wrote the great American Novel and no one noticed? Upon repeated reading of O Pioneers, I sometimes wonder if that isn't just what happened.In the character of Alexandra, Cather has created, not a stereotype or carbon copy of heroines in earlier novels, but something entirely new to American Literature. Alexandra is no wispy, fainting Victorian heroine but instead strong, capable and (obviously) heroic. I don't know how other reviewers missed this obvious point. Perhaps strong female characters are common in todays writing, but not in 1913. Only Chopin's Awakening (1899) even comes close. And Alexandra seems transcendent compared to such earlier characters. Cather changed American Literature with this unconventional construct.And then there is the prose: \\"When the road began to climb the first long swells of the Divide, Alexandra hummed an old Swedish hymn, and Emil wondered why his sister looked so happy. Her face was so radiant that he felt shy about asking her. For the first time, perhaps, since that land emerged from the waters of geologic ages, a human face was set toward it with love and yearning. It seemed beautiful to her, rich and strong and glorious. Her eyes drank in the breadth of it, until her tears blinded her. Then the Genius of the Divide, the great, free spirit which breathes across it, must have bent lower than it ever bent to a human will before. The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman.\\"This well known quote from the book is perhaps the best example of Cather's lyric and thoughtful prose.Finally, Cather engages the reader with the significant themes of struggle and truimph, and people v the land. Again, these may seem commonplace today but Cather is the author that brought them to our attention and branded them into our national identity nearly a century ago.While I reccommend this book, you might also try My Antonia, The Song of the Lark, or One of Ours (for which Cather won the Pulitzer)."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"One of the finest examples of American writing ruined by the omission of the crucial lines of the telegram in this edition."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"As the story opens, we meet 16-year-old Alexandra Bergson. She and her family had immigrated from Sweden years before, and are now settlers on the wind-swept Nebraska prairie. As her father was dying, he told the children that Alexandra, as the oldest, was to be in charge of the land. A land he wanted to keep in the family, no matter what the cost. He didn't trust the boys to do what was right, and he knew that Alexandra would.Many people at that time were cutting and running, selling the land for so much less than it was really worth. And the boys wanted to do this as well. But Alexandra knew better. She knew that the land would be worth a lot some day, and talked the boys into mortgaging the land to buy more. She traveled to different counties and universities to find the newest farming techniques and crops -- much to the dismay of her brothers, who were always so worried their neighbors would be \\"laughing\\" at them. And yet, as time went on, the Bergson farm flourished and grew. Lou and Oscar, the two older boys, each found a wife and moved out on their own. But Emil, the youngest, was Alexandra's heart. He was sent to the university to become more than just a farmer. She wanted him to have a life beyond just the land.And just as Alexandra is starting to really feel the lonliness of her life, an old family friend, Carl, reappears to visit. She has some decisions to make about her life, her family and her land.This tale spans a space of 25-years in the life of Alexandra. She is an incredibly smart business woman and a wonderful strong character. She is not given to do things based on appearnces, which is an attribute that I love about her character. But she is lacking a lot of the social awareness that most women have. Especially since the character was written by a woman! But through all the hard times and the good times, Alexandra is there to hold this family of pioneers together. This is truly a fantastic book, well deserved of the title \\"Classic\\"! If you haven't read anything by Cather, I strongly urge you to read this one!!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This is probably Cather's best book--and the easiest to read. It's not too long, moves pretty quickly, and doesn't bog down in any places. If you're new to this author, this book is the place to start."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The first half of this novel is curiously disjointed. Months, sometimes years elapse between each chapter, making it rather like reading fragments of a long family saga. The effect is to distance the reader from the characters. The second half is a more continuous and involving narrative, developing into a conventional social drama with a surprisingly melodramatic climax.The writing is fine, with an especially strong visual sense, sometimes reading almost like a treatment for a screenplay. The author manages a simple and elegant style that suits her theme perfectly.Cather's sympathies are firmly with the strong central female character Alexandra. The male characters are mostly insipid and unstable, and an affection, tinged with contempt, is shown toward the more submissive female characters. Apart from Alexandra, the author's deepest affection is reserved for the country itself. Cather writes of the Nebraska that she knew in her youth and of the immigrant men and women who tamed a hostile landscape.The title is taken from a very poor and overblown poem by Walt Whitman, appropriate only in that the poem is as hard going for the reader as the land was for the pioneer. But, title apart, the novel remains a solid rendition of Western pioneer life, a vital strand of American cultural history."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"It's difficult for me to give this book four stars, as opposed to three. I've just finished it, and thinking back on how deeply moving it was, especially in the scenes between the two sets of lovers (the point when Carl leaves Alexandra for Alaska, the moment in the fortune telling tent between Marie and Emil, and others). I won't give away the ending of the novel, or at least I'll do my best not to, but I was struck more swiftly than I've ever been in a novel, at the end by the mixture of sorrow and blame in Alexandra. How in hell could this character, though perhaps not quite as in tune with her emotional center as others in the book - how could she place the blame where she does? Her blaming of the two came closer to breaking my heart than the event itself. Carl does what he can to bring her around, letting her know what he had seen and that what was between the two was as pure as can be, and as beautiful as love should be. One even gets the sense that Carl believes the two young lovers would have been wrong to not love each other. But, by the final line of the book, I, as a reader, was not convinced that Alexandra was swayed by Carl's words as she should have been. I kept wondering whether or not Cather had read Hardy's 'Jude the Obscure' before writing this. Though love may end in tragedy, that love cannot be blamed for the tragedy. In the Hardy novel, it was not the love between Jude and Sue that brought them to ruination, but rather societal mores and Sue's lack of resiliency. She didn't realize that it was only her love for Jude that could save her. Love doesn't lead to tragedy - it is the responses to love that oftentimes lead to tragedy. A simple idea. I think Cather would have been well to illustrate this more completely in the end. Up through the last thirty or so pages, I would've given this book five stars without a second thought. I've maybe never read of love more tender than the love between Marie and Emil. And to know that the protagonist might blame such horror on such tenderness - it seems almost unbelievable that Cather would have written such reaction."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Action? Not much. Plot? Not much. Story? You bet! I am surprised that I have enjoyed reading Cather as much as I have considering that the novels of hers that I have read (O Pioneers, My Antonia, Death Comes for the Archbishop) do not contain much action or deep plots. They are simply stories of people's ordinary day to day lives and their interactions with their family members and neighbors while living and growing up in rural Nebraska (O Pioneers), a harsh and rather boring country to live in at the time, particularly for young kids and teenagers growing up and looking for excitement. Yet, Cather has a way of making you feel like you know these people and that they might knock on your door at any time. I was never bored and I look forward to reading more of her works. I urge others to do the same."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I read Willa Cather's \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" back in my high school days because it was on a long list of required summer reading I dutifully read the book, wrote my report, checked off the assignment and moved on. Now, many years down the path towards maturity, I have rediscovered the brilliance of Cather's writing. In the heroine, Alexandra Bergson, Cather offered up a woman who conquered not only the untamed hardscrabble Nebraska landscape but also the rock-strewn acreage of her family and her own long-deferred longings. The tale of one of heart-breaking inspiration - stubbornness bumping up against a more enlightened determination. Alexandra proved to be more solid and capable than any of her male relatives.Cather draws from the deep well of her own experience growing up on the Nebraska prairie, painting a nuanced portrait of the interplay among the ethnic groups that came seeking their fortunes- the Swedes, Norwegians, Bohemians and French. The interplay of triumph and tragedy makes for a powerful dramatic arc, and kept me reading far into the night to find out the fate of characters I had come to care about.

Only 17% of Americans now live in rural areas, and some urban kids don't even know that produce comes from somewhere before the grocery store. So what does a Nebraska-set farm novel have to say to the internet generation? Plenty.Has your family ever struggled with poverty? Had a parent die and shouldered their responsibilities? Siblings who doubted your plans and ideas? Been unhappy in a marriage--or fallen in love with someone already married? Pondered the benefits of putting down roots versus the freedom of travel? These are some of the major themes of the novel, and they will be just as relevant in 2013 as they were in 1913 when the book was written.And in addition to the timelessness of the key topics, Cather covers a wide range of human emotion, which she captures in numerous memorable phrases. About the protagonist, Alexandra, she writes \\"There is often a good deal of the child left in people who have had to grow up too soon.\\" About a second marriage late in life, she observes \\"this marriage was an infatuation, the despairing folly of a powerful man who cannot bear to grow old.\\" And finally, about life, she says \\"People have to snatch at happiness when they can in this world. It is always easier to lose than to find.\\" And a final sample, an observation that will be familiar to anyone who has moved to California or overseas to start something new: \\"There are always dreamers on the frontier.\\"So in summary, a powerful story of work, family, love, and hate--and unlike the last novel I read with substantial farm setting (Anna Karenina), tightly edited and quick reading.

She goes through so much to keep and preserve the land. she makes it dependable, workable, and profitable, while keeping in the family, like her father had wished. Along the path of childhood to adulthood, with this goal in mind, Alexandra faces many challanges. She almost gets married twice. Two of her brothers refuse to speak to her.

The 1st chapter is about a girl going to the doctor and then a little boy getting his kitten down from a pole before they go home. It picks up after that though. Overall, it was a really good read.Willa Cather wrote this book in 1913. Cather is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, for her book &quot;My Antonia&quot;, and has written more than 15 books. Cather was one of the most distinguished American writers of the late Ninetieth and early Twentieth century."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"O Pioneers by Willa Cather is a descent read. It is an interesting story about how a women survives because of her love of the land. I liked the characters pretty well, and I really do enjoy Willa Cather's style of writing. I just do not think that this was her best novel or that it reached its potential. This novel was supposed to be about how the land held Alexandra and how she survived for and with it. Cather seemed to get off of her thesis, though. She tells page after page of the love affair between Marie and Emil and gets of topic. She could have developed Alexandra's relationships more thoroughly. Some technical aspects or the novel become bothersome, also. Some of the dialogue seems false and the verb tense Cather writes in switches at places in the novel. Overall, the novel is worth reading, but it would be better to read her other works like My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop.p.s. I did like that Cather acknowledged Sarah Orne Jewett with the dedication."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"\\"O Pioneers!\\" has a very angelic and unceremonious feel to it when read. The matters were of dire importance, but the tone in which Willa Cather wrote was very effortless and straightforward. Alexandra Bergson is a somewhat stereotypical character, when speaking in terms of feminine headstrong roles, and her brothers are the stereotypical side characters who do not agree with their older sister and her role in making \\"manly\\" decisions. I admired Alexandra for her capabilities and proficiency, but after the climax, I lost respect for her as a female protagonist. Her complete forgiveness of Frank Shabata, and her blaming of Marie and Emil were irrational, atypical, and inconceivable. Her friendly relationship with Carl was underdeveloped and undistinguished. My last complaint concerning Cather's writing style is her disorganization of chapters and time frames. I had no idea what time and place the next chapter would bring, and I felt very disoriented because of it. Cather wrote the era wonderfully, and the splendor of the land came through well enough. The era is what kept my attention, after my disgust with Alexandra. I \\"sorta\\" recommend."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I can't believe that I have to read through these reviews only to have some complete FOOL ruin a section of the book for me. Please exercise a bit more caution when displaying your reviews! I recommend that you REMOVE the review that discusses another character killing &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;. Completely bogus! Considering details of the book have been blown, I won't be purchasing it from here now. You might as well print the last page of every book you sell..."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Sorry to beat up on what is supposed to be a classic novel, but &quot;O Pioneers&quot; has to be one of the most terribly dull books I've ever had the misfortune of reading. The characters never came to life for me... they, and the plot, never seemed to be more than flat words printed on chalky paper. Some may think that Cather's style is pleasantly simple and moving, but it only moves me to read another book by another author."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"O Pioneers! is talky, talky, talky and boring, boring, boring. No wonder high school students hate it. I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I agree with Bay Area-don't allow bad nettiquette on your site!

How'd you like to know what happens to all of the characters in The Phantom Menace...? Get the picture?"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The book starts off great, with a warmth and vividness that makes one care about the characters. Unfortunately, that brief spark of brilliance fades all too quickly. We soon find ourselves mired in a muck of endless drivel. Early on, a time leap propels us 16 years forward where we lose a sense for who the characters are. From that point on, the author gives us no more than a two-dimensional portrait of our heroine and her family. In depth descriptions are reserved for the landscapes and boring events, instead of for the emotions that motive the main characters. Inexplicably, some of the characters turn into brooding morons with (seemingly) no redeeming qualities. This work left much to be desired. Read &quot;O Pioneers&quot; only if you want to see how a great start means...absolutely nothing! For more enjoyable reading try authors like Lucy Maud Montgomery, Henry James, or Jane Austen...you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I thought that the book would of been about some Pioners but It ended up totally different!!!!!!

Willa Cather paints a very realistic picture of prairie life, an exciting part of our nation's history. Pioneering was obviously challenging but it also must have been a very exhilirating adventure whether it resulted in success or not. A beautifully described story about courage and survival."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I originally purchased this book to read for a Women and American Literature course in school. I have fallen in love with Willa Cather and recently purchased My Antonia to read as well -- this time, for pleasure.The book is very well-written and Cather knows how to make a story come alive on the pages of her books. The way in which Cather takes this story about a young woman and her life on the prairie is exceptional and provides the reader with an accurate, imaginative, telling look at life as it was at that time. The characters jump off the page and are built in such a way as to make them seem real-life, and their interactions with each other are incredibly realistic. It is also lovely to find a tale that does not have a perfect fairy-tale ending but yet looks at life as it truly happens -- and still ends up turning out in a beautiful way.I sat down to read this book with little enthusiasm... and less than two hours later, I found myself turning the last page with a sense of disappointment that it was over. It truly drew me in and captured my imagination in a way that only happens when the tale is exceptionally well-written. Could not be more pleased with the book.Additionally, the book came in pristine shape and was delivered in a timely, secure manner. Paper was of nice quality, and the cover is relatively thick cardboard that holds up to transportation well. Excellent purchase, and a full five stars."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I remember reading My &Aacute;ntonia by Willa Cather years ago, for a high school English class. I can't really remember the book or what I thought about it, but for some reason I always think of it with distaste. Consequently, I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading O Pioneers!, but because it was short and available online, I decided to give it a try. And now I really need to reread My &Aacute;ntonia because I think that for years I may have been dismissing a gem.O Pioneers! is an enchanting account of a Swedish immigrant pioneer family struggling to make a living on the Nebraska plains. Recognizing good sense and business talent in his oldest child, a daughter named Alexandra, a father instructs his sons to follow Alexandra's counsel in running the land and, above all, to keep the land. Alexandra is an intelligent, independent woman whose risk-taking and innovation causes the family to prosper. However, her willingness to break with convention is not favored in the rigid Swedish immigrant community, and her two oldest brothers grow resentful of her independence and her desire to give their younger brother opportunities, like college, that the three older children never had.Willa Cather manages to bring the prairie alive, and, briefly, conveys their beauty and a love of the land. Even though the novel is only around 130 pages (depending on the version), it is long enough to make a reader sympathize with the struggles of the characters and sense their lost loves and dreams before they fully realize the losses themselves. Some themes could be explored in more detail, but the novel is a joy to read and its brevity may be, in part, what makes it so sweet.For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"If you have not had the pleasure of reading this book, please do. It's an easy read and a good approach to Willa Cather."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather offers many insights as she informs us of the lives of the Swedish immigrant family the Bergsons in rural Nebraska in the early 20th century. Central to this story is the strength and resourcefulness of Alexandra Bergson, who we first meet in her teens, the de facto leader of her family--much to the consternation of her less able brothers Lou and Oscar. The ever observant author enriches her novel with insightful details that makes her imagined world startlingly real--as the reader thinks to himself \\"yeah, come to think of it--things are like that!\\" I think of the ironic observation that the wives of Alexandra's brother loved their husbands with a love tinged with fear. Her description of the dangerous cold of the Midwestern winter at the opining of the novel reminds me of the first Midwestern winters that I endured--and the realization that one could die of exposure much more easily than in Eastern winters. Alexandra's success in business--going way beyond her brothers--reminds me of my own realization that a business once owned by my family would have fared much better if it had been run by my own very clever grandmother instead of her less able brother who had inherited the business."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Clarity, economy of words which are filled with emotion. The classics remain so for a reason. Loved this book!!!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Her home is just a few parcels of land situated on the quaint Nebraskan plains. And Alexandra Bergman would die for it. Her father actually did--and it's up to her to pick up the pieces and maintain this homestead through all seasons: the most buoyant of summers, the most desolate of winters. Some friends and family members walk with her as others dash off into the horizon to try their luck elsewhere. If this were just a dissertation on how to grow a literal harvest or a simple atmospheric sketch with little plot or relevance, Cather might have floundered. But it's much more than that. This is a rich tapestry filled with how people can rediscover who they are and where they belong in the world, finding their identities not just in the soil but in those who help till it. The tragic climax is breathtaking as Alexandra learns that even some things can't be replanted--only the seeds of heartache, grief, forgiveness, and rebirth can be scattered in their place.Cather was surprised when this book became popular because she claimed that she wrote it mostly for herself. But her enthusiasm for the places so dear to her is infectious in this novel. We have the privilege of experiencing joy and sorrow alongside Alexandra, fierce and resolute even when she's teetering over from exhaustion, waiting for something in her sacred fields to breathe life into her again. This is an undeniably moving tribute to the heartland of America and to one woman who isn't afraid to firmly cultivate her own sense of purpose, even if all the crops around her would wither away, never to bear fruit again."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"CD was in good shape but seemed to skip around chapters .. It is an MP3 so couldn't decide if it was the player we used or the CD ... used in several different players."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I read this book which is recommended by a homeschooling consultant for high-school and adults. What a surprise - the library book was rather worn, old, and not the least bit inviting. However when I met Alexandra Bergstrom and her family, I kept reaching for the book at every opportunity. In a culture where it's all about immediate gratification and \\"me, me, me\\" it was refreshing to read about a woman who had a much bigger picture and found joy in things so foreign to many of us living today. You will want to be the kind of person you meet in Alexandra ... with a passion for her land, a love for her family and tremendous dedication to her friends and community.I will find more of Cather to read for sure!

Oh Pioneers is a book that will touch your heart and soul."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I had no preconceived notions about this book, apart from the reviews here on Amazon, and I was most pleasantly surprised. Willa Cather did such a wonderful job in storytelling, in depicting the time and situation, in descriptions, and above all, in communicating the overall feeling of such a transitional period in history. It was a wonderful intro to a wonderful author, had a great flow; I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I read this book as a class assignment and I must admit that it was an okay book. There isn't a lot of action going on; it's more of a study on the behavior of the friends and members of a particular Nebraskan family who had to tame the wild land.This one really ought to appeal to women because its one of the only books whose strongest character is the female.To me, it wasn't a great read nor anything really memoriable, but it is still a worthwhile book!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I have tried more than once to order this title on my Kindle.

But Rip didn't really fall asleep, you see, because this book has the ability to actually stop time with respect to its reader. A sort of creeping death steals over the reader and every molecule in his body becomes frozen in time. I started reading this book one night before bed, and awoke covered in cobwebs next to [my wife]in a room so dim and dusty it was unrecognizable.If, however, you are fortunate enough to avoid the creeping death through the first three-quarters of the book, it picks up at the end. I would not mind that this book is the dullest and most uninteresting piece of fiction since Madame Bovary if I had gained an important message or insight from the read. Unfortunately, Cather seems to misunderstand love and liveliness, and although her presentation of man's connectedness to the land is fairly good, it has been better expressed elsewhere.It is probably worth the read because it is not too long, but be wary of the creeping death."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This book was extremely boring.

They roll along ever changing with time, gently upturning the elements from beneth the surface until they are staring you right in the face. You never can know exactly what you have without giving it time. This book is full of deeper meaning and personalized messeges. You are the one that makes the book what it is. You are the one that draws a meaning closely tied to your own life from the book. I feel books are supposed to enlighten oneself.

It is a deeply moving story, written in a simple but elegant style. Read it, savor its brilliance, and be ready to wipe a tear. The poem at the start of the book is absolutley amazing."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"A captivating tale of frontier life, Willa Cather's novel provides an intriguing look into the American spirit on the vast prairies of the late 19th century through the eyes of recent immigrants. \\"O Pioneers!\\" tells the tale of one such family, the Bergsoms, and their struggles as they attempt to conquer the vast Nebraska prairie. The toils and struggles of the Bergsoms, along with their neighbors, is chronicled as they attempt to turn the unforgiving prairie into a prosperous breadbasket.Alexandra Bergsom, the female protagonist, is portrayed as a stoic, intelligent, and independent woman, who is a testament to the American spirit. It is she, and not her brothers, that her dying father trusts to run their farm and realize his dream. The land, itself, is an important protagonist, as Cather gives it human qualities and depicts it as the ultimate factor in determining a farmer's success, for the land will not be cultivated if it does not desire to be. Even Alexandra, after establishing a successful farm and growing modestly wealthy, gives the credit to the land.The conflict between the individual and community recurs throughout this novel. Alexandra, as an independent thinker, is continually criticized by her brothers and her farming brethren when she partakes of new farming methods and crops. Her brothers, which epitomize the other farmers, want no part of these \\"radical\\" ideas and try to conform with each other. However, Alexandra's non-conventional methods eventually become mainstream, as she proves again and again that a pioneer must also have new ideas and a free-thinking mind to enable success.Romance and romantic relationships are viewed as an undesirable complication. Indeed, the marriages in their community are generally unhappy, as the energy and vigor of farming and frontier life will sap all the energy out of a relationship. In fact, some of the marriages are doomed from the onset. Even the jovial and energetic Marie cannot avoid the pitfalls of marriage, even though she entered her union with the utmost love and energy. Indeed, it is Marie's energy and friendliness that is eventually her downfall, as she looks for love elsewhere. In Cather's frontier world, it appears that the only marriage that will succeed would be one for convenience and companionship, instead of romantic love.On the negative side, there is a textual error, an inconsistency in the timeline, that prevented me from giving \\"O Pioneers!\\" five stars. At the start of the novel, just before the death of John Bergsom, Emil is 5 years old and Carl 15. Then, \\"sixteen years\\" after John's death, Emil is 21 (16 years older), but Carl is 35 (19-20 years older)? Also, Lou was married after the Linstrums left, 3 years after John's death. This would mean that Lou would have been married for 13 years, yet he has a daughter who is 15? It seems as if an editor, not to mention Cather herself, should have picked up on this.The nitpicking aside, though, this is a superb novel. Cather's real-life experience as a girl in Nebraska surely helped the realism. This is an easy read, but is both entertaining and thought-provoking and a good depiction of the embodiment of the pioneer spirit."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This book is amazing! I love everything about it--the characters, setting, descriptions, plot, etc. Willa Cather is able to keep the reader's intrest with usual everyday happenings in a plain, dull, but peaceful setting of life on the prairie. I definitely reccomend this."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I vaguely remembered the name Willa Cather from my high school days, but I don't think I ever read anything by her. Maybe a poem. However, I decided to get one of her books after reading a recommendation in a recent National Geographic Magazine article on the Great Plains. It stated that she was known for writing books on the Plains and of the hardships the farmers faced there especially during the dust storms. But not in this book. Cather stresses that hardwork and scientific farming will lead to prosperity, and in fact most of the farmers we meet are prosperous. The book begins as we meet Alexandra, the next to youngest and only daughter of four offspring of an immigrant Swedish farming couple in Nebraska. Alexandra is in town to bring back the doctor to treat her ailing father. He refuses to come, because her father is hopelessly dying. Her father, knowing his fate is sealed, calls the family together and beliving that his daughter is the only one with intelligence and grit, installs her as the head of the family and orders his three sons to follow her advice on all matters. This is a unique situation, especially since the boys readily agree. Beyond the situation, the subject of the book is totally different from what is expected from a female author at the turn of the 20th Century. At that time, women wrote of well-to-do ladies whose lives revolved around parlors and social teas, not a common farmer. The father's wisdom proves sound as the family amasses the largest acreage in the area and the respect of their Swede and Bohemian neighbors. There is enough local color and description of daily activites included in the book to give a good flavor of the time and place. The story continues as Alexandra's best friend and neighbor, Carl, finds farming unsatisfactory and leaves to earn his fortune elsewhere. This leaves Alexandra facing spinsterhood. She sells Carl's farm to a young hard-working couple. The farmer's wife and Emil, Alexandra's youngest brother, form a fast friendship whose passion is headed out of bounds. Realizing this, Emil plans to move away for good. But, before he can leave, a shocking incident disrupts all of their lives. The event is made even more astounding because of the simple telling of the story to that point. The incident comes out of nowhere and, to me, was totally unexpected although believable. It's even more astounding when you realize it was created by a woman more than 90 years ago. Although the book didn't deliver what I expected, it did deliver the goods, and I will seek out more books by this ground-breaker author."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"In her second novel, published at age forty, Cather deals with themes and settings which would preoccupy her for the rest of her career. Foremost in the book stands The Land, the Nebraska prairie, as palpable a character as the indomintable Alexander Bergson, determined not only to live on The Land but to conquer it and make something of it and leave it as a legacy for those to follow her. She resists the blandishments of big city, industrialized life (to which her more materialistic brothers are anxious to submit)to remain in the place she knows best.O PIONEERS is not a farming manual, however, or pictuaresque portrait of happy Swedish farmers. It is a tragedy of the sacrfices Alexander must make to remain true to her (and her father's) dream. She gives up (until the happy ending) marriage, love, and family of her own. It is the tragedy of giving up dreams and of thwarted young love whose passion can be extinguished only by violent death.Cather handles it all in a style best described as poetic realism. This book nearly matches (though not quite) MY ANTONIA in impact and resonance."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather certainly celebrates the country/simple life. This is a slow and sweet novel with lots of discription. It really paints a vivid scene for readers. Plus, it celebrates what it is to be American, farm, and commune with nature. It is a story about Swedish, German, etc, immigrants who work the land and farm, but I was quite taken by her imagery and insites. The one that I found particularly profound was a comparison of people to corn seeds (how some thrive and some rot). Great novel."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Though this is not a book for people who favor mystery, science fiction or action, it is ideal for people like me, who appreciate a book with real characters. Alexandra is a very sympathetic character: very practical and hard-working, dealing with the prejudices of her brothers and community in an admirable, graceful way. If you like reading about real people, I recommend this book. Willa Cather, as usual, does an amazing job of getting into people's minds and lives, while keeping her language simple and understandable. As other reviewers have indicated, this is a far more accurate, understandable way to learn about the history of the American pioneers."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"There seems to be a lot of reader criticism of Cather as a product of her time...well, she WAS a product of her time! How can you escape that, writer or not? But what is so special about Cather is the vividness of her imagery; the details she captures, both from the landscape and in conversation, are amazing. There are very few authors, alive or dead, with such style, control, and mastery of nuance."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This is one of my favorite novels of all time!!!

We of the \\"sound bite\\" world could be lost by such description, but in the hands of Willa Cather, each word builds on the next to paint the picture with literature. Like an oil painting with layers of paint used to create the scene, Cather layers her words to draw you into the time period, the characters, and the situations. Reading her work was a joy.

The novel has many themes including isolation, love and feminism.The Bergsons immigrated from Switzerland to Hanover, Nebraska at the turn of the 20th Century. When the patriarch of the family dies, his daughter Alexandra, inherits the farm and devotes her life to making it a viable enterprise at a time when others give up and leave.I've only been recently introduced to the writing of Willa Cather. I believe it was on some \\"top 100\\" list (who said they're lame?) and figured I'll give it a try.O Pioneers! by Willa Cather is considered a classic and I can certainly understand why. The writing is outstanding and it has all the makings of the great American novel. The story tells of hard work, wide eyed innocence towards the future and opportunities abound as seen through the eyes of the immigrant class.The scenery plays a major part in the novel, the lyrical episodes about the pastoral land are sprawling and majestic. As is with many other novels, the setting of the harsh and beautiful land is playing out as another character in the book. The Midwestern prairie which the pioneers labor over is an essential part of character development and profound understanding of themselves, the land and life.On the contrary, the parts which deal with people are concise and sparring much like the personalities of those that worked the acrid land. Cather manages to convey the sense of community despite the vastness of the land, a testament to her writing skills and ability to personalize a storyline.While I loved the descriptions and prose, the dialog seemed a bit stilted, it just didn't seem as if that's how the characters wouldspeak, especially when among friends and relatives. However the storyline is exemplary and the characterization - amazing; I found myself caring about the people in the story and breathlessly waiting to find out what will happen to them."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The print is small in this edition.. Would have preferred to pay more for a hardback book and have larger print."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The most outstanding part of this book is its description of the land in rural south central Nebraska. This book is very handy in that regard. Cather makes the land and its harsh realities a vital part of the novel. The characters of Alexandra and Frank Shabata are really the only others to impress.Carl Lindstrom is a moocher who only wants something for nothing.Lou and Oscar are basically backwards thinking stubborn farmers.Emil is a moocher and a lecher and wants his sister to always pay his way.Marie is a sex-kitten who ends up getting killed.Essentially, Alexandra is the only real complex character in the book, with the land. It is not a bad story, but My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop are much better novels.As an entry to Cather this book is fine, but the other two above are better novels by far."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather's novel, O Pioneers! is true to the tough times the American Westerners had to endure day after day. Alexandra, Carl, and Marie's love triangle will keep you pondering what will happen in the end? This novel is truely realistic and kept my attention throughout it's Five Parts. A short read. I definitely recommend it to the many strong-minded women, who will easily relate to Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"As an avid reader of Victorian novels, from time to time I will explore more modern writers such as Cather. I have read many of her books, including my all-time favorite, Death Comes for the Archbishop. What really struck me about Oh Pioneers was its dark depiction of realism. I fell in love with the love story and imagined in vain a happy ending. The fact that the lovers died together, reminscent of Romeo and Juliet, was tragedy in itself. But Cather removes any hope a united after-life for these two young people (as we find for Heathcliff and Catherine in E. Bonte's WH). &quot;They were not in heaven,&quot; Cather writes. Life and death for these pioneers, like the land, is unforgiving and harsh.Willa Cather is wonderful author to read if one wants to get a history of European immigrants in the West at the turn of the century. We often focus on the immigrants coming into Ellis Island in NY, but they were also very much a presence in America's western frontier"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"this is a great novel.

Alexandra, who is in charge of the Bergson family, really seems to imply that she is only doing all the things for her family, but yet I see it as an escape for herself.

Alexandra does not want to be alone, therefore she tells her family about buying more land in other towns to make money, when really I believe she is looking for someone to compress her loneliness and satisfy her desires."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Good correspondence,Responded to my email about being slow in coming, (that happens when shipping to Alaska)."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1995, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs, as the area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I have always been fascinated with the pioneer time period. So anything I pick up that reflects those days is always gripping for me. As far as the story itself, I must admit it took me awhile to get into it.

I had heard awful things about it much like written above, so i was basically assuming the worst. I was wrong. The book grabbed me immediately. I am NOT the kind of person who likes nature, or lengthy descriptions about it, but that's not the meat of this book. The characters are the meat of this book and make it the great book that it is. I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"In the hulking box of textbooks that I hauled to my dorm on the day before classes began last semester, there was a small, out-of-place, [...] copy of O Pioneers by Willa Cather. Apparently, my English Composition instructor thought it best our class read \\"a good piece of English writing\\" before we embarked on our journal entries and research papers. I was not overly eager to read O Pioneers. It appeared to be one of those literary standards I saw while perusing Barnes and Noble, unattractive, unoriginally decorated little books with a quaint painting of older time on the cover and obligatory stamping of the publishers name followed by the word, \\"classic;\\" as if the publishers themselves were too unenthusiastic about them for any serious sales pitch. I always headed for the William S. Burroughs or Robert A. Heinlein sections, rarely paying attention to the drab dinosaurs.Well, as the old clich&eacute; goes, don't judge a book by its cover. O Pioneers is an excellent tale of the trials and hardships of the gritty immigrants and pheasants who staked a claim and worked under a dream in the unsettled regions of this country so long ago. The realistic, headstrong, engaging characters live lives of poignant dedication, labor and loneliness as they swim around in the authoress' exquisite imagery (\\"The pasture was flooded with light; every clump of ironweed or snow-on-the mountain threw a long shadow and the golden light seemed to be rippling through the curly grass like the tide racing in\\"). Ms. Cather obviously tested every sentence for its weight, impact and flavor. The cold, dusty fields of Nebraska are vibrantly brought to life by this blatant perfectionist.I was extremely impressed with this novel. Not impressed enough to change my usual literary diet from cult classics and science fiction masterpieces, but I certainly enjoyed it enough to save my unpretentious edition of O Pioneers from being carted back to the bookstore when they began buying books to sell used for the next semester."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The year after the Whartonesque (and unexceptional) \\"Alexander's Bridge,\\" Cather published \\"O Pioneers!\\"--the book the she was in later years to call her second first novel. Although relatively brief, it unfolds like a frontier epic, and reading it now, it's hard to believe that Cather, living in Greenwich Village at the time, doubted whether anyone would be interested in the story of struggling Nebraskan farmers. As she wrote to a friend, with \\"this one I hit the home pasture and found that I was Yance Sorgeson [a rich farmer] and not Henry James.\\"\\"O Pioneers,\\" for all its understated countrified charm, is not without the ingredients of a torrid drama: familial dispute, an adulterous affair, a double murder. The novel began its life as two stories, which Cather brilliantly melded into an ambitious whole. The first features Alexandra Bergson, who assumes proprietorship of her family's farm when her father dies, leaving her with three brothers. After several lean years, she nurtures the family estate, holding on to the land when many of her neighbors give up and return East. To insure the prosperity of her three siblings, Alexandra sacrifices her own comforts and passions--but never her independence. Yet the two older brothers first respect and then resent Alexandra's astute management--and they especially begrudge the favoritism she shows to their college-educated younger brother, Emil, whom she indulges with the goal of advancing him in the world beyond.The second narrative concerns Emil and Marie Tovesky, who are childhood friends whose companionship flowers into romance after Marie marries the ornery, bitter, and somewhat mad Frank Shabata. If Alexandra's story provides the novel with its atmosphere and theme, the Emil-Marie story supplies the action and tension. Intermingled with these two storylines are depictions of rustic events and folksy characters (especially memorable is Ivar, a shaggy-haired, barefooted, back-to-nature eccentric).Even a century later, \\"O Pioneers!\\" packs a wallop. But, more powerfully, it's an ode to the early settlers and to their struggle to survive. \\"The land belongs to the future,\\" Alexandra remarks at the end. \\"We come and go, but the land is always there.\\""},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Although not stated in the description, this is a rewritten version of the original classic. Save your time and money, and go with the original version."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This novel revolves around Alexandra Bergson, a Swedish immigrant tilling land in Nebraska. Few female characters in American literature have her feminine strength. Maybe Dagny Taggart of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged?\\" Or Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara of \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" Scarlett and Alexandra are the adhesive, business-minded, matronly women who run things in an otherwise man's world.Having lived in the midwest for numerous years, albeit in the 1970's, I met people who mirrored the mannerisms and had the backgrounds of Alexandra. Like Alexandra, their parents left continental or scandinavian Europe for Nebraska's farmland. These people are as pure as the black loess within which the corn and wheat survive.Like many novels of this generation, this tale involves tragedy. A great tragedy. And, like Rand, many conversations about the seemingly obvious include contrarian statements which loudly ring otherwise unobserved truths. For instance, Alexandra seeks to pardon the murderer of those closest to her - she seeks to pardon someone whose single act clouded and depressed her soul forever. But, when you read this novel, you will agree with her decision. One hundred percent.Agrarian life, sometimes subjected to nature's entropy, is more than a seemingly simple venture. The character of Alexandra also is more complex than her appearance. She was a genius at farming. Today's farmers rotate to keep the land's fertility alive - grow alfalfa (to put nitrogen in the soil) to replenish what corn depletes. Alexandra speaks about rotating her soil because she heard about the concept from a \\"college boy.\\" They laughed at her. She grew wheat as the revenue stream from the land would increase. They laughed at her. Like Taggart and O'Hara, she was right while the dumb men around her were not. Unlike Taggart or O'Hara, Alexandra moves without confrontation, without eddy, without notice.She writes without wasting words, many details are delivered with few words. Her style reminds me of J.M. Coetzee or V.S. Naipaul. She is in very good company. She is a novelist I will read again."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Growing up in Red Cloud, Nebraska, Willa Cather's individuality and great intellect flourised rapidly. Her childhood experiences and surroundings aided her transformation into an independent and determined woman who was both willing and capable of meeting a challenge. Many of these characteristics are prevalent in her novel, O Pioneers!. Cather explores both the intimidating and rewarding aspects of the wild land as her main heroine, Alexandra Bergson, battles difficulty after difficulty, eventually triumphing over her struggles. Through the utilization of powerful, intense diction, personification, and references to the heroic woman theme, Willa Cather is clearly trying to move the reader toward her belief that human beings are closely connected to the land, and must come to the realization that nothing valuable in life comes easy. From the very beginning of her story, to the very end, Cather delivers a message that captures the true essence of the pioneer experience, and depicts the myriad of moods and emotions that accompany struggle and success. The color gray is woven throughout chapter one of section one. This technique creates a feeling of gloom and associates the land with depression and despair. Carl, a close friend of Alexandra's, is a &quot;thin, frail boy,&quot; which hints at the scarcity of food and the presence of hard times. Feelings of isolation and loneliness fill the pages as Alexandra claims &quot;Carl is the only friend I have ever had.&quot; However, the &quot;three years of drought and failure&quot; cannot keep the heroine from eventually overcoming her struggles, and finally reaching the point where she is able to enjoy the reward of &quot;rich soil&quot; and &quot;heavy harvests&quot; bestowed upon her by the land. Through Alexandra's determination and willingness to toil in concert with the land instead of in opposition to it, prosperity now surrounds her. The land, through personification, becomes a significant character as the story progresses. Nature comes to life as the &quot;sun leaped over the prairie, and all the small creatures...began to tune their tiny instruments.&quot; The land &quot;had its little joke. It pretended to be poor because nobody knew how to work it right.&quot; When Alexandra learns to work with the land and not against it, the land &quot;worked itself.&quot; This illustrates the trust and faith that Alexandra has in the fields. She seems to feel the connection that exists between her and the ground into which she has poured her heart and soul, and she prospers from that relatioship. Throughout the novel, Cather coninues to personify the land, closely associating it with human failure and human success. Lastly, the heroic woman theme creates an environment where strength and courage come together to overcome criticism and prejudice. The fact that Alexadra's father leaves her with the land, instead of her two brothers, relates to this particular theme. Her &quot;glance of Amazonian fierceness&quot; reveals a strong, bold side of Alexandra that becomes essential in overcoming the everyday prejudice that haunts her. As on witnesses the hardships encountered by Alexandra, feelings of doubt can surface. However, Alexandra proves that &quot;it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.&quot; Throughout her novel, Willa Cather seems to be telling the reader that the true essence of the pioneer experience involves an acceptance of the absence of prosperity, and knowing that through faith and hard work, &quot;Oh, it would come again!&quot;"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Since Willa Cather is indesputabley on of the best authors in American fiction, it didn't surprise me that she writes again with the poignant outlook that is prominent in her other great novels. (i.e, My Antonia, Song of the Lark)An exellent short read, O! Pioneers is satisfiyingly and prodigiously written.The only thing you could ask for would be a little more between Carl and Alexandra... but hey, ya can't have it all, right? I think it was great as is was. Definately 5 stars."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"The Great Plains may be the most overlooked of American landscapes, with the result that we have very few first hand accounts of what it was like to live in a sea of grass. Lacking the &quot;in your face&quot; drama of the mountains or the seashore, it takes a writer of Cather's ability to capture the subtle drama of the prairie. Both O Pioneers! and My Antonia, capture that drama.I think that an argument can be made that Cather was one of our first environmental writers since her prairie is, in a sense, Thoreau's forest. That is, she raised people's consciousness to its importance even as it was disappearing. The fact that she did it in the context of first rate novels, undoubtably makes her one of our most readable enviromental writers.It's Cather's love of the Great Plains and the way they shaped the people who tried to tame them, that gets her my vote for patron saint of the American prairie. And nowhere is that love more evident than O Pioneers! and My Antonia."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Swedes homesteading on the short grass prairie! How come I'd never read this book?Actually, this comes close to being the true story of my mother's immigrant farmer family, who were Germans of a sort. Alexandra, the powerful woman at the heart of Cather's story, the one pictured on the cover of this edition, reminds me powerfully of my great-grandmother, who was just a generation younger than Willa Cather. Alexandra's two selfish and small-minded brothers, Lou and Oscar, are spitting-images of my grandfather and his brother. Frank Shabata, the sorry husband, is 'awful close' to a portrayal of my father. The verisimilitude of Cather's characters, so fair and square in depicting both their strength and their frailty, is her best accomplishment as a writer. You won't need family photos of these characters to recognize them as real people.The part that's not true to the history of my family as pioneers and sod-busters is also what's not true about the novel. The real people were more ordinary, lived more one-day-at-a-time, didn't have the luxury to leaping across a flat and commonplace decade from one chapter to the next. They had to get up in the morning, drudge through the day, cut their toe nails and scrape their corns, go to bed too worried about chores and bills to dream big dreams. But who would want to read about them?\\"O Pioneers!\\" is a triple love story, starring three handsome men and two beautiful women. One couple ends up happy... as happy as they're able to be, anyway. There's plenty of passion, frustration, jealousy, misunderstanding to make a Hollywood blockbuster on the scale of \\"Giant\\". For all I know, there have been ten films of this novel already. That's weakness of the book, one way it falls short of really deserving to be called a \\"world's classic\\", that it was ripe for Hollywood when it was published in 1913, even before Hollywood was ripe for it.\\"O Pioneers!\\" is also a love song to the Land, to the beauty and bounty of the short grass prairie. It begins with a description of the hard-scrabble homestead and it ends with a paean to the \\"...fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again in the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth!\\" Now that's a 'right pretty' sentiment, but it's not terribly accurate. Teachers, don't assign this book as a depiction of the history of the Midwest. Some few sodbusters may have felt ennobled by their land, but a lot more of them were plenty ready to sell to greenhorns and move farther west or south. That's the true story of the agricultural frontier in America, from colonial days through the Ohio Valley and onward to the Dakotas; those who got rich did so more by selling than by clinging to the soil. Cather herself may have loved the western skies but she wrote under the skies of eastern and European cities. Those shining-eyed Young have been fleeing to either coast since the first pioneers gave birth to them. The prosperity that Cather portrayed among the Swedes and Bohemians of Nebraska in the years before WW1 was an artifact of the world economy. It was a bubble. It collapsed soon enough. Nebraska and the Dakotas haven't thrived in the way \\"O Pioneers!\\" envisioned. Declining populations, stagnant and dying towns, narrow-minded reactionary social and political grudges against the very sort of people that Willa Cather became! The story of Alexandra and Carl ends at the brink of their future; I can almost promise you that if they'd lived as long as my great-grandmother, they'd have retired in Arizona.But there is a resonant grandeur to \\"O Pioneers!\\" It's worth reading, in order to sense the courage and hardihood of the farmer-immigrants who built the heartland of America. It's not as colorful or touching as the work of Ole Rolvaag; \\"Giants in the Earth\\" and its sequels are the greatest 'world's classics' of the American West. It's not as honest and accurate as Hamlin Garland's \\"Main-Traveled Roads\\". It's nowhere near the epic adventure, the magniloquent sweep, of the four Emigrant novels of the Swedish writer Vilhelm Moberg. But once you pick it up, you won't be tempted to read anything else until you finish it, and once you finish it, the woman Alexandra will stick in the family-photo album of your mind."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl.

I have never read a better depiction of the feeling youthful love and vigor than in this work. I feel strange writing this, but after I read it, I had a sense of peace, as if I had lived through the story.side note: I understand this book is often assigned for fiction in High School (it wasn't with me) its a shame to think of students trudging through such a beautiful book because its an 'assignment'."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

If you have a sentimental side but still want intelligent writing, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"If you enjoy Meg Hutchinson's novels, you will also enjoy classic novelist Willa Cather. They both have unique, yet simpatico literary voices, and are worth the investment of your time moreso than many of today's contemporary writers.O Pioneers is rich in detail, making the descriptions of the land and the people so tangible and believable, you will come to believe you know everything about them. Our protagonist, swedish immigrant Alexandra Bergson, is a marvelous pillar of strength, ambition, and determination as she takes over her father's farm following his death. Unlike her brothers, she is willful and able enough to take the Bergson land and make a success of it while shrewdly dealing with other farmers who couldn't cut it, building a successful, progressive little cultural mecca for herself and those who know and come to love her. Fighting against closed-mindedness and scoffing, denied love, and the tragic loss of her beloved younger brother Emil, she comes to gain the respect of all others around her. Beautifully written, personable, and proving there is nothing new under the sun when it comes to human relations, Alexandra is the truest of all pioneers: kindness, selflessness, compassion, and loyalty on top of being tough, determined, and stubborn, Willa Cather has truly created one of the first great early feminists in classic American literature."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I have to give this classic a mixed review. The tone, for the most part, was sweet and wistful, but the action was almost painfully slow. It moved, in fact, something like the seasons of the year, which along with the land, were characters in this play. The story of immigrant Nebraskan farmers of the early 20th century is mostly about how they lived rather than things that happened, and it takes about about three-quarters of the book before the action finally picks up a little.I liked Willa Cather's eloquent and flowing style and the coloring of the land and its people. It reminded me a bit of an old, tinted, softly glowing, romantic movie of maybe 50 years ago. I also liked her animation of the land and weather, although I was bothered a little by its pantheistic flavor; the land, in fact, was the most animated character of the book.In short, if you like a journey better than its destination, this is not a bad book. For myself, I need both journey and destination."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This book represents the pinnacle of American literature. From its beautiful descriptions of the various characters to its concise, yet not quite Hemingway-like writing style. To its deftly crafted plot. This book is an outstanding classic by its own right. What makes this book great is that it is based on character depiction instead of simply writing a book with simple plots. It focuses on people, coping with their strggles and joy, love and hate.The book centers around Alexandra Bergson, a strong-willed, hard-working pioneer woman who has struck rich farming in Nebreska. Yet most of the action are not centered on her but rather on the people around her. She has three brothers, one of whom, Emil, who is 18 years younger than Alexandra, is Alexandra's favorite. He has gone to university and received an education. However, not everyone around Alexandra was okay with Emil. From the 2 other jealous brothers that Alexandra has to the fanatic Ivar, and to Frank, the wife of Marie, who Emil loves with all his heart. Soon, as we find out, things went diastrous for Emil as one finds that love can carry its havoc with a person.As stated from the introduction of this book. \\"O Pioneers\\" had created a new kind of fiction with a new kind of hero in American literature. As seen from Alexandra in the book. With her outstanding qualities as a strong-willed woman capable of caring and love, and at the same time be a true pioneer for this country. Making her the most marked heroine in American literature.Loosely a historic novel. This book has some historical preferences in it. The early days of Nebreska was indeed a time for the brave and the adventurous. The time setting of this novel was probably in the 1880's. Yet, despite many claims as to what kind of book this is. It is no doubt, a classic that will live on for the ages."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"O Pioneers is a very fine tale. Willa Cather's descriptions of the farm lands and countryside are wonderful. This story centers on a very strong woman , Alexandra who loved her land. The only part of the story that I found disturbing was Alexandra's view that the tragedy that took place at the end was Marie's fault. Willa Cather was a head of her time in her portrayl of women characters but, in Marie's case her views appear to be those of her time.

The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell.

Anything that Willa Cather has written is great and you without a doubt want to add this one to your library."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"After having read &quot;My Antonia&quot;, I wanted to read more Cather, so I read this book. I was not disappointed. The writing is beautiful and the characters memorable. Alexandra is a great yet flawed protagonist and her struggles throughout her life reflect the universal struggles that occupy us all. Some reviewer called this book &quot;dated&quot; and I strongly disagree. There is something here for all human beings living in 2004."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This is a wonderful story based in the midwestern prarie of the late nineteenth century. I genuinely enjoyed it, more so than My Antonia (which is a great book too). The characters are very appealing. It is a story of human endurance, compassion, lonliness, rage and ultimately love, with a strong feeling of reality."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"O Pioneers!, by Willa Cather, is set in Hanover, Nebraska, where:\\"The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts. There are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country, where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length, and the brown earth, with such a strong, clean smell, and such a power of growth and fertility in it, yields itself eagerly to the plow; rolls away from the shear, not even dimming the brightness of the metal, with a soft, deep sigh of happiness.\\"But it was not always this way: a generation earlier, a few pioneers had to struggle mightily to establish their farms, and some perished.The protagonist of O Pioneers! is Alexandra, a woman who possesses some common virtues, like industry and kindness, and some less common ones, like foresight. In this novel, virtues have predictable results: Alexandra has the best farm in Hanover and can count on the friendship of many neighbors. Most importantly, with Carl, a friend from her childhood, she maintains a lifelong friendship that develops into a romance when Carl returns after a long absence. If virtues have predictable results in this novel, so do character flaws: those who yield to temptation suffer the consequences quickly and surely.Some readers may find that the themes in this novel are a bit too simple for their tastes, but I found it to be beautifully written and uplifting. Those who are new to Cather's work might better start with My Antonia or Death Comes to the Archbishop, but her established fans will certainly want to read O Pioneers! as well."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Cather published her second novel, O Pioneers, in 1913 at the age of 40. Together with My Antonia it is the novel for which she is best known. Years after writing the book, Cather wrote of it \\" Since I wrote this book for myself, I ignored all the situations and accents that were then thought to be necessary.\\"The book takes place on the plains of Nebraska in the late 19th Century as the Prairie is settled be Swedish, Bohemian, and French immigrants trying to eke out a living from what appears to be a harsh, inhospitable land. The heroine of the book is Alexandra Bergson who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer.The books speaks of being wedded to the land and to place. In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home. It also speaks of a strong woman, not in cliched, late 20th Century terms but with a sense of ambiguity, difficulty and loss.This is a story as well of thwarted love, of the difficult nature of sexualtiy, and of human passion. There is also the beginning of what in Cather's works will become an increased sense of religion, Catholicism in particular, as a haven and a solace for the sorrow she finds at the heart of human endeavor. Above all it is a picuure of stark life in the midwest.There is almost as much blood-letting in this short book as in an Elizabethan tragedy. Cather's picture of American life on the plains, even in her earliest books, is not an easy or simple one. Some readers may quarrel with the seemingly happy ending of the book. I don't think any will deny that Alexandra's happiness is dearly bought or that it is bittersweet.I tendend to shy away from this book in favor of Cather's later novels. I feared that it would be conventional and trite. The stereotyping was mine,however. This is a thoughtful, well written story of immigrant life on the plains and of the sorrow pain, and strength of the American experience.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This novel revolves around Alexandra Bergson, a Swedish immigrant tilling land in Nebraska. Few female characters in American literature have her feminine strength. Maybe Dagny Taggart of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged?\\" Or Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara of \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" Scarlett and Alexandra are the adhesive, business-minded, matronly women who run things in an otherwise man's world.Having lived in the midwest for numerous years, albeit in the 1970's, I met people who mirrored the mannerisms and had the backgrounds of Alexandra. Like Alexandra, their parents left continental or scandinavian Europe for Nebraska's farmland. These people are as pure as the black loess within which the corn and wheat survive.Like many novels of this generation, this tale involves tragedy. A great tragedy. And, like Rand, many conversations about the seemingly obvious include contrarian statements which loudly ring otherwise unobserved truths. For instance, Alexandra seeks to pardon the murderer of those closest to her - she seeks to pardon someone whose single act clouded and depressed her soul forever. But, when you read this novel, you will agree with her decision. One hundred percent.Agrarian life, sometimes subjected to nature's entropy, is more than a seemingly simple venture. The character of Alexandra also is more complex than her appearance. She was a genius at farming. Today's farmers rotate to keep the land's fertility alive - grow alfalfa (to put nitrogen in the soil) to replenish what corn depletes. Alexandra speaks about rotating her soil because she heard about the concept from a \\"college boy.\\" They laughed at her. She grew wheat as the revenue stream from the land would increase. They laughed at her. Like Taggart and O'Hara, she was right while the dumb men around her were not. Unlike Taggart or O'Hara, Alexandra moves without confrontation, without eddy, without notice.She writes without wasting words, many details are delivered with few words. Her style reminds me of J.M. Coetzee or V.S. Naipaul. She is in very good company. She is a novelist I will read again."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"O Pioneers! does not equal My Antonia, but even getting halfway there means you're writing at Pulitzer Prize level. Cather takes a lot of liberty here, skipping ahead by sixteen years at one point and waffling on the main character--is it the land itself or Alexandra Bergson, so passionately and excellently taming it? To use an extremely lowbrow comparison, one wonders every Thursday why Meredith Grey, one of the least likable characters on ABC's wonder child Grey's Anatomy, both titles the show and gets to narrate the beginning and end. The show doesn't always center around her, just as this novel doesn't always center around Alexandra. It elicits an uneven and shortchanged feeling, a desire to see the author shift focus to the peripheral characters. But Cather ultimately catches up with us and makes all of her characters in to full and breathing people."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"i personally think that willa cather wrote rings around both hemmingway and f scott fitzgerald. her books are more about the art of fiction than about the ego of the author, as in the case of the two fellas i just mentioned. o pioneers! is the first of cather's masterpieces. a simple tale of a woman (alexandra bergson) coming of age on the nebraska prairie in the 19th century, confronting the hardships and realities of the harsh and impersonal landscape, and learning to navigate her way to success in a world socially and politically controlled by men. the land itself stands out like a character here, as cather sculpts a poetic vision of all the openess and sheer size of a place capable of swallowing the individual whole. simply the work of a great novelist. an american masterpiece, for sure."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1895, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer, John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs. The area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This early Cather novel introduces readers to the majesty and the fury of the untamed prairie, when the mid west was yet Americca's frontier. It obliquely asks the question: How did the Land shape its people--mainly immigrants from Scandinavia, Bohemia and France--and how did the hopeful settlers, true Pioneers, shape and share the land? Who ultimately can ever own the prairie; can mere mortals seriously hold the undulating waves of grain in trust for future generations?Spanning some 17 years this gripping novel depicts the struggle to tame the midwest by a Swedish family, whose lives intertwine with those of their neighbors. Against hostile and unforgiving naturethe simple tale is spun out: a wise teenage girl inherits control of the family farm from her dying fathr, since she alone of his offspring understands the importance of retaining the land at all costs. Despite interferance by her resentful, short-sighted brothers, Alexandra does just that, revealing vison anddetermination beyond her years. For it is thus that she honors the memory of their father, keeping his faith in the ultimateproductivity o the savage land, when many neighbors sell out.Creating strong female characters--of which the land itself or Mother Nature may be considered a shadowy one--Cather glowingly describes the rugged beauty of the mid west: rolling grasses,powerful sunsets, intoxicating spring blossoms, with fluctuating, unpredictable weather. A farmer's life is an annual gamble, but then so is any pilgrimmage of the heart. Totally absorbed in running her successful farm, Alexandra does not look beneath the surface; she does not Notice things. Like the illicit love which blooms unbidden between her young brother, Emil, and Marie, the restless married woman next door. Add a wild, jealous husband into the equation and a volatile situation is inevitable.Cather's style draws the reader directly into the mindset of her main characters. Recognizing the danger signs before Alexandra does, we tremble with the realization of future emotional turbulence.The author' use of color to help us visualize her beloved landscape is remarkable, but most of all we marvel that she depicts the countryside itself as a non-verbal player in the repetitive tale of human stories. In the end readers must decide for themselves who is most to blame for the tragedy--if guilt must be parceled out. Her grim theme, that Happiness is easier to lose than to find, taints the backdrop of timid hope. The furrows of her novel are plowed and scored with attempts of her characters to &quot;possess a personality apart from the soil. &quot; This seemingly agrarian novel is less about the effect so grains of seed in the ground, than about the grains of love sown in a desperate search for joy in the hearts of the pioneers. How can Love survive in a barren wilderness? A true classic of human striving and passion."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather is coming into vogue once again in no small part due to First Lady Laura Bush. Mrs. Bush hosted a symposium dedicated to \\"Women Authors of the American West.\\" One of these authors was Willa Cather.I remember reading Cather in high school in the early 1960's and realizing she had a classical sytle. What a pleasure it was to pick up this book and rediscover her again.\\"Oh Pioneers\\" has the simplicity and beauty of the Nebraska plains it so well describes. The herione, Alexandra Bergon is as wholesome, strong, and simple as Nebraska wheat.Written in the days before television, video games, and the many corrupting factors of modern culture, this book is a hymn to the virtues of the pioneers who built our country.\\"Oh Pioneers is not a sanguine novel.

She faces life with courage, dignity, and compassion.\\"Oh Pioneers\\" speaks to the heart.

It reaches into your heart and urges you to become part of the story when she says \\" a pioneer should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves\\" you feel like your right there with Alexandra dreaming and willing the land to yield it's bountiful harvest. In O Pioneers, the land plays a cruel but enticing seductress, teasing with warm breezes and the next minuet lashing out with unremitting blizzards and droughts. Alexandra by patient coaxing and uncompromising determination manages to turn her dreams into reality but not before paying a high price.The book is primarily a love story with the Divide playing the willful lover everyone is trying to tame. Sparing no one, it leaves its mark shaping and molding the characters of its inhabitants for better or worse. The immigrant settlers who call the Divide home are as intriguing as the land they dwell on, being capable of despair, loneliness, happiness and yielding the fruits of their love as the land gives up it's corn and wheat. Cather ties this all together in the phrase\\"...and in the long grass, by the fence the last wild roses of the year opened their pink hearts to die\\" speaking at the same time of young lovers and the inevitable cycle of the land."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I thought the book was great.

And her brothers annoyed me through out the whole book. I realy enjoyed reading it though."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This wonderful book provides insight into the lives of those living in 1870's Nebraska.

In regards to the other less enthusiastic reviews, there is more to the book than what meets the eye.

Granted, they are few and far between, but none the less critical to the plot development and storyline.

Now, before anyone berates me for obviously making this choice by purchasing a kindle, let me simply say that I had come to terms with the fact that I would have no physical book, but thought that the product would at least be of similar quality.

I try to save as much as possible, College is getting to be so much money Thanks"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I came to this book expecting to hear a sermon about the value and merit of forging a hard-working life as a pioneer. While the difficulties of taming the wild land are always present in any book about pioneers, much of this story takes place after Alexandra has already achieved success, so the homage to work ethic that I expected was quite subdued.But the tale does some heavy moralizing nonetheless. Extramarital affairs are obviously condemned--even if the marriage in peril is very unhealthy for all involved. Emil and Marie understand that their love is sinful and forbidden, and Alexandra does not condemn Frank for his crime because, in a way, the lovers deserved retribution and Frank vengeance.Marie, as some have pointed out, is a symbol of the wild land around her. She encompasses all of the temperamental beauty, the exigent passion, the far-off and forbidden dreams of success in face of the hardship pioneers face. Emil's attraction to her parallels other stories of immigrants wanting to make their mark (and livelihoods) on an impossibly wild and beautiful land.Alexandra's love life is confusing at best. Though she never shows much interest in members of the opposite sex--to the point that I assumed she was gay or asexual--by the end she marries a childhood friend who has been far less successful in life, simply because life seems too hard alone. The point seems clear: no matter how intelligent a woman is or how hard she works, she needs a man in order to be complete.I can see why this little book is not as widely read as \\"My &Aacute;ntonia.\\" But I'm a sucker for a halfway decent pioneer story, so I enjoyed it.For a complete review, visit my site, Melody & Words!"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Needed to read it for my American Literature class.

It has been that long since I read it, but now, after having earned an advanced degree in English, I have grown to appreciate Cather's brilliance at a much deeper level. The edition offers very informative secondary information, and I have learned that Cather visited some of the locations in the American southwest that are familiar to me. Cather has drawn a moving portrait of the central character of the novel, a woman whose love of the initially forbidding land and its mixed Northern European families is vivid. This novel of the struggles of the pioneer families and the destinies of their offspring is one I would highly recommend to teachers of the upcoming generation."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"I liked this book.

I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Good points:1. The prose in this book was very nice. It is easy to forget that the book is only just 100 years old-- but it seems even older than that. For example: The use of the word \\"country\\" to describe \\"countryside\\" instead of \\"nation\\" was something that took a few references for me to catch.Bad points:1. The book was overwrought with detail/ drama. It was just under 200 pages, but it read more like 300.2. I can see that the point of the author's jumps in time was to show a characters development over some number of decades. But what I thought the book would show was the logistics of building a farm from the ground up. Instead, we went something like .....Intro........Three years later........Sixteen years later.3. The environment seems a bit.......tribal. Was America ever this way?4. The development of the characters was a bit lacking. Some characters were there (Old Ivar) and they seemed to act as just filler. There seems to have been a lot of foreshadowing about how something *might* happen to Ivar at the hands of the two slimy brothers, but nothing did happen. So, that brought up the question of why was he there. As far as character development, I always learned that, at a minimum, one should discuss the Speech, Actions, Appearance, Thoughts, Opinions of Others as a way of developing that character. Either that method had not been invented or if it had Cather just never got around to studying it.In summary, this book is highly overrated (1) and I'm glad that I got it for free (2), because if I had to come off of my own money for it, it might have been worth about $2 plus the cost of shipping."},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"Willa Cather's second novel draws on Cather's own experiences on the Nebraska plains, where she knew, first-hand, the harsh beauty of the land, the resilience of the farmers who tried to tame it, and the accidents of nature that could, overnight, destroy years of dreams. Here Alexandra Bergson, the bright and hard-working daughter of a farmer, inherits the responsibilities of running the family farm upon the death of her father. With two older, less business-like brothers to work the land, she turns what had been a marginally successful farm into a business profitable enough that she is able to buy land other farmers have abandoned.Beginning in the late 1800s, when Alexandra is a teenager, and continuing until Alexandra is in her forties, the novel celebrates Alexandra's strength and dedication to her land, at the same time that it emphasizes how isolating farm life can be. Though Alexandra's farm becomes the most successful farm in the area, she has few friends and no lovers, and there is little opportunity for social life. When her earliest friend, Carl Linstrum, whose family long ago gave up their farm, suddenly returns for a visit, Alexandra and Carl find themselves \\"keeping company,\\" despite the opposition of her brothers. The love of her youngest brother Emil for Marie Shabata, an unhappily married woman, is a parallel love story with additional complications. In both love stories, the accidents of fate, so common in farm life, play a key role in characters' personal lives.Filled with gorgeous descriptions of the changing seasons, from the brutal harshness of winter to the rebirth in spring and the flourishing of summer, the novel also shows how fickle nature can be. Those who survive, physically and emotionally, are those like Alexandra who can accept and adapt to whatever life offers, instead of fighting against unpredictable disasters. To be successful, one must sublimate the desire for adventure, the urge to explore, and the human tendency to ask oneself, \\"What if...?\\" Day-to-day activities, minutely explored here, keep farmers like Alexandra rooted in the real world--imagination is a \\"luxury\\" few can afford.One of the first realistic novels about the pioneer experience, O Pioneers conveys the values and the personal qualities needed for success on the plains, at the same time that it also reveals how quickly and unpredictably nature can change outcomes. Even love is not a haven here--sudden, unpredictable changes occur in love, too. Dramatic and powerful in its depiction of pioneer life, the novel is a paean to the resilient spirit of the early pioneers and the enduring power of nature. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"O pioneers!","review":"This book is about a girl named Alexandra's struggle to support her family and take care of her deceased father's farm.

When everyone else sold their land and advised her to, she had faith that her farm would prosper and that faith paid off. Willa Cather did a great job with the writing in this book.

Although this book is a novel, there is still a lot text book examples in it. I liked O'Pioneers, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in women issues of the past.

The sixteen year jump in the middle of the book lost me. I lost all view of the characters and the situations in which they were involved. I was surprised to see Cather stoop to such a level. I highly recommend her other works, but O Pioneers, one of her first novels, didn't inspire as did the others. Some will find this story very enjoyable with a great descriptions of the Nebraskan plains, but for me, the vivid descriptions didn't overcome the lack of plot and storyline.

One day he recieves a very strange American man as a customer and through a series of psychotic events, he slowly discovered just what this man is. Its a thrilling if slightly macabre story with an intimate depiction of the jaded youth in Tokyo's bad parts. Really draws you in. I really loved the book. Read it summer of 10th grade. Not for everyone, though."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"In the Miso Soup by Ryu Murakami is on the surface a gritty hard boiled thriller set in the Kabuki-cho red-light district of Tokyo as the approaching New Year leaves near empty except for the human wreckage of the city. Jimji a young illegal sex tourist guide makes a good but shady living from taking westerners around the girlie bars, peep shows, hookers that allow foreigners.He meets up with Frank who hires him for three days but from the start Jimji feels something is wrong and he starts to be sucked into an ever deepening nightmare that threatens his and his girl friend existence.The story is told in the 1st person from Jimji perspective and is based on clear fluid writing equal if not better then Haruki Murakami, which evokes the place and time so that you have a movie in your head. Not necessarily a good thing given some of things that happen.Beneath the surface is a very different story which leads to conclusions and beginnings that can be misunderstood if psycho thriller is the readers' sole expectation. We are instead being lead into mediation through the events affecting two desperate characters on what the Western and Japanese experience of loneliness is. The key passage for me is this one.I remember the American making this particular confession, and the way his voice caught when he said \\"accept it\\". Americans don't talk about just grinning and bearing it, which is the Japanese approach to so many things. After listening to a lot of these stories, I began to think that American loneliness is a completely different creature from anything we experience in this country, and it made me glad I was born Japanese. The type of loneliness where you need to keep struggling to accept a situation is fundamentally different from the sort you know you will get through if you just hang in there. I don't think I could stand the sort of loneliness Americans feel.Reflect on what is being said here and you will enjoy a taut psychological thriller whose outcome makes perfect sense. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"In the Miso Soup is Ryu Murakami, that's for sure. You've got about 10 pages of hardcore gore, and 10 more that are creepy without the core. But it's almost as if he were inserting the severed body parts to get at some deeper topics.In this book, Murakami's VERY critical about current Japanese society. Both with the loss of traditional culture, and rise of super-materialism. He's one of the most critical novelists I've read when it comes to his own culture and society. In many ways, he reminds me of Phillip Wylie, an underrated American writer from the 50s-60s who used novels to criticize the conformist society.I asked one of my Japanese students about the 2 Murakamis (Haruki-- more popular in the US, and Ryo.) 'Haruki is for women and girls,' he said. 'Ryu is for men and boys.'Yeah the book is gory, gross. But there's a lot more to it than that. If you're at all familiar with Japanese society... especially if you LIKE Japanese society as I do... read this book for a completely other point of view. --Mykel Board (aka Michael)"},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"What a stupid book. I'd wanted to read a Murakami Ryu book for a while now, having heard about him numerous times, but, based on this book, I won't be reading anything else of his. Dubbed a \\"Renaissance-man\\" from all the different things he does - writer, filmaker, and drummer for a rock band - he's won a number of literary awards, including Japan's highest award, the Akutagawa Prize, for his first book, Almost Transparent Blue, and the Yomiuri Literature Prize for this one. He's probably considered one of Japan's top contemporary writers but I didn't find him to be anywhere near as good as the other Murakami (Murakami Haruki), and just not very good writer in general.In the Miso Soup is a book about a tour guide named Kenji who takes foreigners on \\"sex-tours\\" of Tokyo's red-light districts. It's a couple nights before New Year's Eve and Kenji taking this guy named Frank on a tour of Shinjuku's Kabuki-cho. The night before Kenji meets Frank there is a gruesome murder where somebody had cut off the arms, legs, and head of a high-school girl that was prostituting herself. Frank is super creepy and Kenji begins to wonder if Frank may be the killer, and it goes on from there. The story is extremely violent (though you don't see any of this till halfway through the book) and basically turns into a horror film.... err, book. It's really gross at a number of points and, based on what I read about Murakami's other books, this seems to be the author's main selling point.The reason I didn't like the book isn't because it goes all Texas Chain Saw Massacre (which, as you can tell, I didn't care for), it's because the book is just a mess. First off, the killer has this ability to hypnotize people before he kills them, which made the book much less scary because it lost touch with reality. Next, most of the book is about as interesting as watching a slideshow of your aunt Betty's trip to Pocatello. The book is filled with soliloquy, followed by internal monologue, followed by soliloquy; it's basically a vehicle for the author to spit off rhetoric about his own personal observations on society, all in a not-so-subtle way. This brings me to my next gripe: while some of the observations on society are interesting, most are juvenile, whiny, and lacking any sort of depth beyond what a high-school kid could come up with. I guess my main problem with the book, apart from the boring monologues, is that the characters seem contrived. Just witnessed a half-dozen people being massacred? Forget running to the police, seems like a perfect time to daydream about what's wrong with today's youth!I picked up this book mainly because I wanted something fun and easy to read, and, even though it was a very easy read, I didn't have much fun with it. I'm sure a younger reader with a taste for horror films and an interest in Japan will enjoy it (though it's definitely not for kids!), but for everyone else don't bother. Not recommended."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"A note to the careless: there are two famous Japanese novelists with the last name Murakami. Both are acclaimed at home, but Haruki is the better known of the two in translation and is beloved for his quirky use of the tools of magical realism. This book is by Ryu, the \\"other\\" Murakami, and his books are an altogether different proposition. Written in 1997, this is only the fourth of his ten novels to be translated into English (after Almost Transparent Blue, Coin Locker Babies, and 69), but the themes of alienation and ultraviolence are right in keeping with his oeuvre, which includes the script for the highly overrated shock sexploitation film \\"Tokyo Decadence\\" and the novel which was the basis for the even worse film \\"Audition.\\" Although there's little sex to speak of in this book, be forewarned that there is some very graphic violence that may well upset the faint-hearted.The plot is relatively straightforward: 20-year-old Kenji works as a guide for Western tourists looking for action in Tokyo's sex districts. A few days before the end of the year, he meets up with a new American client named Frank. Right off the bat there is the sense that something is not right with Frank, and within the first ten pages Kenji irrationally suspects that Frank may have been responsible for the brutal dismembering of a teenager that's been in the news. The rest of the book vividly chronicles their journey through the grim nightlife as Frank drags Kenji around seedy bars, ostensibly in search of sex, but seemingly more in search of companionship. All the while, Kenji nurses growing suspicions that Frank may actually be a psychopath, until 2/3 of the way through there is a major incident which seems to confirm his worst fears.I say \\"seems\\" because there are a number of ways one might interpret this incident and the entire story. Certainly, at the core, as in Murakami's other work, there is a heavy dose of social commentary regarding the prevalence of alienation in modern Japanese society and a critique of materialism. There are repeated references to the \\"compensated dating\\" phenomenon among teenage girls, as well as the varying shades of amateur prostitutes, and ruminations as to what kind of society leads to people seeking such desperate connections. In a sense, this is very reminiscent of the themes of Bret Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho.\\" And like that book, one has to wonder about the reliability of the narrator, and ultimately question just to what extent the atrocities that are detailed actually occurred. One could make a case that \\"Frank\\" does not actually exist, and that Kenji is losing his marbles. On the other hand, one could take all the events at their face value and come up with a reading of the book in which the two protagonists are stand-ins for their countries and their relationship is a mirror of the U.S.-Japanese relationship (the American is rich and randomly violent, while the naive Japanese shadows him, bewildered and passive, wishing to intervene but never daring to). Either of these is more interesting than taking it all at face value, since despite the cover blurb, this isn't really a thriller.The first 2/3 of the book do manage to provoke a fair amount of tension and anxiety as the reader wonders with Kenji about Frank's true nature. However, this is eventually subsumed by an annoyance with Kenji for being so passive and getting swept along so easily in whatever scheme Frank has planned. After the major incident, the book kind of meanders to an inconclusive ending. Murakami does a great job of painting a vivid picture and creating an oppressive mood, but it ends up feeling like all style and very little substance. This may actually be a case where the movie will end up being better than the book."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"This might have been a decent read if it hadn't been for such an unrealistic story in the middle of a realistic (and actually interesting)setting. The American tourist character is very childishly developed into a kind of monster who can hypnotize, read minds, remain unaffected by exposure to the elements and lack of sleep, and exhibit superhuman strength. The very short murder scene, which was far and wide the best part, happens right in the middle of the book and is just crowded by a ton of meaningless drivel on both ends. Trying to give a very detailed account of Japan's nightlife while meshing in this weird story of psychotic violence and control just didn't work well. Out of 200+ pages, there were only 3 chapters so it felt very long winded. It just droned on and on, and then came to a very abrupt and unsatisfying end. There is absolutely nothing special or different about this book. I find myself wishing I could get back the seventy-five cents I spent buying it from the thrift store."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"Now, when I say that I'm a big fan, that relates mainly to movies. Whether Murakami directed them himself or was just writing screenplay, it doesn't really matter. From my experience of Japanese movies, I found ones influenced with Murakami interesting, though strangely weird, but without a doubt worth my time. \\"In the miso-soup\\" was first book of his that I read, and I will give much thought on reading of another. Maybe I'm wrong to pose thing like this, but when it comes to literature, and concept of good book (which doesn't necessarily corespond to concepts of good writing or storytelling), I expect something other than blockbuster wraped in paper. My reading of \\"In the misou-sopu\\" follows this pattern. Take any psycological/horror triller out there, take a moment to study it's characters and narative and what will you find? There's going to be an enemy, almost invincible oponent wichi stands for everything negative, destructive element that cannot be stopped whose motives vary indefinitely and which presents a ontological challenge to main character. You'll find sense of dread, of dark anticipation, of psychosis and paranoia enveloping all characters, driving them towards uncertian future and causing their reactions to change of circumstances. You'll find a comment on humanity, humane and human behavior, and finally, in the battle of characters you'll find one ideology triumphing over the other making the whole story more or less plausible. Now, Ryu Murakami's novel has everything mentioned, so it shouldn't be that bad for genre entuisast out there, right? Problem is, as ever, in premise itself.Murakami is holding himself close to the genre, highly aware of concepts and methods he must use to produce desired effect. Problem with genre itself is that it does not produce satisfying comment on human behavior or life in itself. Sure, it's flashy, it's brutal, there is murder everywhere and all is somehow related to sex, but all of it can be surmised under a few generic notions of \\"common wisdom\\". Murakami doesn't develop his thoughts, doesn't explain himself or his characters nor does he try to dig deeper into human relations. Somehow, it all stayed on the surface - presenting to reader disturbing pictures of monostrosity (Western, American, character) and descent to paranoia of average person (Kenji, Japanese, domestic factor). But, under the closer scrutiny of details, sentences uttered, and background idea, I find that Murakami's prose is strangely lacking and cannot really satisfy me. I have wathced to many movies with simillar stories, read to many-comics, and I could stand this shallowness there, but when it comes to prose, and writing of fiction, something in me rebels and says this cannot or shouldn't be done so.For those of you who have wathced Tkyo decadence, let it be known the \\"In the miso-soup\\" isn't story about sex industry and prostituiton in Japan. On some level it is, in a way of random comment, but the main topic here is growth of xenophobia, and meeting of one and the Other. Meeting of East and West presented in eyes of the young one and impossibility of their coming togehter. Now, when Rushide writes about this, you get excellent multi-layered prose that can stand against time and be read on many leves. When Murakami does this, you'll get flashy show and tell but, sadly, nothing more. Anyway, this has been nice introduction into Japanese prose for me, and I'm looking forward to more experience. Maybe I'll just avoid Murakami from now on."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"Kenji meets a serial killer through his work and spends a couple days with him. There's some slaughter, of course, which Kenji passively observes (maybe he's hypnotized by a Visa card. It's complicated.). Anyway, the serial killer is philosophical (uh-oh) and his monologues (and Kenji's reactions) provide some astonishing psychological and sociological critiques: maybe there is no &quot;real&quot; self! Oh yeah, and a lot of people are lonely and others care only about material goods!This is a cut above (pun intended) lots of slasher trash, but it's not nearly as profound as it thinks it is.

Not that anyone but an aficionado would know what I was getting at without an explanation anyway, but I just can't resist the urge sometimes. And In the Miso Soup is a perfect analogue to a Davodiff Double R; ease of ignition, smooth draw, slow, even burn, and above all, an excellent finish, the thing for which Davidoff cigars are noted. There are a whole lot of people who can write very good books. But those books just kind of end, a lot of the time. I've begun to think, in the past few years, that what separates a good writer (let's take Koji Suzuki as an example) from a great writer (such as Murakami) is the finish. Suzuki is more a Montecristo or a Moore and Bode-- a good, solid workingman's cigar, the kind of thing you smoke after a meatloaf dinner, beer in hand, watching NASCAR. Murakami demands sixteen-year-old scotch, steak so rare it could heal on its own if left to its own devices, and, well, championship table tennis or something.Kenji is a young, enterprising Japanese guy who's gone into business for himself. He acts as a tourguide for foreigners who want a quick trip through Tokyo's sex industry. It's two days before New Years', and things are a little dead, but an eager American named Frank has hired Kenji for three days. There's something not quite right about Frank, and Kenji starts to wonder if he's not the serial killer presently at work in the area.While on its surface In the Miso Soup is a thriller, it's a low-key one, keeping with Murakami's seeming tradition of writing in a completely new genre for each book he produces; this reads almost like a sociopolitical critique of the Japanese sex industry with a thriller sitting overtop it. What is most surprising about this is that Murakami actually manages to make this sort of thing work; the \\"message\\" novel, by default, is trite, boring, and not at all satisfying or readable. In the Miso Soup is none of those things, because Murakami has gifted it with strong characters, a story that is usually compelling (though it does sometimes waver, as if Murakami were not quite sure where he wanted to go with it), and above all his inimitable style-- the reason one can read this and the light compedy 69 and realize they're by the same guy, and the reason that one cannot help but be slightly shocked at the book's final sentence, and yet completely satisfied with the journey.A pretty solid choice for this year's ten-best list. ****"},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"I read this straight through, it is very good.

In \\"Soup\\" there is a prurience about the scene that offended me. Each to his own.Michael H. Margolin"},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"Ryu Murakami has never written about violence, but about the causes of violence - and not direct, ordinary causes, but the underlying psychological tensions in human beings which lead to violence. The psycopath in the novel, Frank, describes violent tendencies in children as the product of anxiety, an attempt to prove that the world will not collapse when some horrible act is perpetrated. 'Anxiety' is certainly a good term to describe the book, or any of Murakami's - every scene vibrates with an eerie strangeness, and human relations take unexpected turns. In the end, the product is somewhat mystifying, but provides a good read and ample food for thought. What it does best is pair images of extreme innocence and extreme violence, produce alternate reactions of sympathy and disgust, and force a reader to suspend all kinds of belief and judgement until the page-turner narrative is over. Still, what it isn't is a thriller, a character study, or a book with any clear message. The character of Frank could be taken to represent many things - the destructive effect of confused intentions on an insular culture, or a human loneliness common to both this American and the Japanese protagonist, or any misfit lashing out against a restrictive society. In any case, it's one of the most fascinating contemporary novels I've discovered."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"I think that too many reviewers are expecting this book to be too much like American novels, and this is where the above reviewers are mistaken. Fans of Murakami or not, the above reviews take in none of the fact that Murakami is NOT American. This is a short 180-novella by a master of his art. Having lived in Japan for the past 7 years (and still living here), I can without a doubt in my mind say, that this book is dead on in its characterization of both American and Japanese characters, its vivid scenery, its execution, and its portrayal of the Japanese society at this current point in time. And why shouldn't it be? It was written by a Japanese author who is in the midst of it. If you are expecting Steven King, move on. If you are expecting Hollywood, move on. If you are expecting something to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, read! This book is as realistic as it gets. After all... what would you do if you were confronted with a serial killer? Go to the police? Are you sure?"},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"With all of the sex and violence in In the Miso Soup, it would be easy to miss or dismiss Murakami's central purpose in writing this book - to highlight the severe problems and harshly criticize modern Japanese society. America lies within Murakami's cross-hairs as well, but Frank's function is as much to personify America's problems as it is to serve as the \\"outsider's eye\\" on Japan's issues.Much like Coin Locker Babies, In the Miso Soup builds up to a single act of violence, and allows the reader to draw his conclusions from the aftermath. Like most other Murakami stories, violence is both destructive and cathartic, and it is in the scene at the club that the reader fully comprehends Murakami's message. Japan, like Kenji, is empty, lost, materialistic, detached, and passively voyeuristic. America, like Frank, is brutal, naive, judgmental, and schizophrenic. Both have a mutual attraction toward the other as Kenji has always wanted to go to America, and Frank is happy to finally be \\"in the miso soup\\". Both have a mutual distaste and distrust for the other as well. There is a fundamental gap between the two as well, one that surpasses language and culture, rooted perhaps in the fact that both cultures are both paradoxically fearful and ambivalent toward strangers and outsiders. It is only after the act of violence that both achieve a kind of understanding and peace, and seek the ideal that is represented by the New Year's bells.In the Miso Soup is full of the annoying blanket statements and conclusions along the lines of \\"We Japanese are like this\\" \\"You foreigners/Americans are like this\\" that will probably vex most readers (and especially those of us who lived in Japan and confronted these superficial stereotypes daily) but the points Murakami makes are well taken. Agree with them or not, Murakami has created a chilling parable where he lays bare his thoughts on the pressing social problems of Japan and the US. Whether one looks upon Frank as a mere \\"virus\\" or an agent of change also depends on the reader's viewpoint. The scenes of violence will offend many (if not most) readers, but it is my hope that people can and will read past the violence and sex to see the social commentary that lies at the core of Murakami's story.Frank asks Kenji, \\"Did that scare you?\\" but the question stands for the reader as well. If your answer is yes, then Murakami's mission has been accomplished."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"This book was so good and so creepy at the same time. It would make a good movie.

His first book, \\"Almost Transparent Blue\\" was first published in 1976 and won that year's Akutagawa Prize. \\"In the Miso Soup\\" - his eleventh book - was first published in 1997, with the English translation following in 2003.The story is told by Kenji, a twenty year old nightlife guide based in Tokyo. He specialises in guiding foreigner tourists around the city's sex districts - which wouldn't have pleased his mother too much as she thought he was enrolled on a college preparation course. However, he earns a decent living and hopes - one day - to earn his passage to America. \\"In the Miso Soup\\" sees Kenji looking back to the previous December, when he was hired for three days by an overweight American called Frank.Right from the moment they met, Kenji thought there was something odd about Frank. His initial story about being in Japan on Tokyo is full of holes, and - as time goes on - Kenji's becomes more and more suspicious. (There's no one major lie that rings an alarm bell - it's more a steady stream of little lies that gradually start to add up...Frank mentions two older sisters at one point, but later claims there'd only been boys his family. He also tells Kenji he's a massive baseball fan, but doesn't even know how to hold a bat). More than that, there's something not quite right about how Frank's looks - and it's more than just the extra weight or dressing sloppily. After being ignored by a tout, there's a very worrying change in his expression - even \\"his eyes lost any recognisable human quality.\\" His wrists are heavily scarred, his skin looks slightly \\"off\\" - like it's almost artificial - and, for some reason, he doesn't seem to notice the cold. Frank's weirdness rattles Kenji to the point that he believes the rotund American could actually be responsible for a couple of recent murders...Despite the one gruesome scene, I'd have described \\"In the Miso Soup\\" as more of a puzzle than a mystery / thriller. Somehow, there was something a little unconvincing about Frank and I wasn't left entirely convinced by the book's ending. Having said that, it was an easily read book overall with some nice writing - and it was an awful lot better than some other big sellers I've read. I'd certainly be willing to try a few more by Murakami based on this."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"I borrowed \\"In the Miso Soup\\" from the library because I was under the Haruki Murakami spell and mistakenly thought this was one of his books. Only later did I realize the author of the book is Ryu Hurakami - another Japanese novelist. Wikipedia further revealed that Ryu Hurakami is also known as Maradona of Japanese literature so I decided to read the book anyway.Unlike other books In the Miso Soup does not give you a chapter wise overview of what to expect. Instead the book is divided into three parts. The first part is an introduction of sorts, introduction of the American tourist Frank who is visiting Japan for a few days before New Year because he is fascinated by the sex industry Kenji, who is hired by Frank to show him the sleazy nightlife. Lastly, introduction to the initial skepticism of Frank that Kenji begins to build.The second part unravels the character of Frank, whose inquisitive humorous self begins to transform into an incredulous being. This was where I started interacting with the story- by giving my own imagination to the characters. Was Kenji's growing skepticism justified? Was Frank as infernal as Kenji thought he was? These were some of the question which kept me interested in the story line. The author lets the indecisiveness guide the reader to the end of the story. However be warned that there are various instances where the violence can get gory.The third part of the story delves into the psychology of behavior and was to me a bit incomprehensible. Given that the author beautifully manages to convey the most convoluted situations with ease it was taxing to decipher the metaphors towards the end.I reading the book and with 180 pages it was a quick read. If the characterization does not interest you read it just to satisfy the exploration streak."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"Ryu Murakami's Sixty-Nine is one of my favorite books ever, so when I found out about In the Miso Soup I had to jump all over it. If you are looking for a book in the vein of Sixty-Nine, however, you're not going to find it here. The only similar thread is that of the influence of Americans in Japan, a topic of long and careful (and genuinely satisfying!) conversation between Kenji and his extremely creepy client. If you like chills, In the Miso Soup has them in spades. The ending is almost anti-climatic compared the the events that lead up to it, but Murakami makes you care for Kenji in a way that many authors don't. This is a quality book."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"\\"In the Miso Soup\\" is my own first try of \\"the other Murakami\\", who is also famous for his work. I have to say that \\"In the Miso Soup\\" was a pleasant, fast paced read and one that had a lot to say.The main characters are Kenji, a nightlife tour guide in Tokyo's seedy sex-spots such as Kabuki-cho, and Frank, a modestly dressed American tourist that sets off Kenji's alarms. Set over a 3 day period, the story follows Kenji's decent into Frank's world of violence.Written in the first person, the book is flooded with Kenji's observations about Japan's culture, society and what he sees as the blatant woes of it all. Kenji is not one to mince words, and deals out a fair amount of criticism on everything from materialism to \\"compensated- dating\\". The wry observations often have their catalyst in Frank, or his activities. The observations and even Frank's monologues are quite insightful at times, and give one plenty of food for thought. However, Kenji offers no real solutions to the woes he observes.While there is no mystery regarding who the killer is, there is some mystery as to what the ending will be and how Kenji and Frank will resolve things, if they do. This sense of unknown was what kept me hooked to the very end.I thoroughly enjoyed Ryu Murakami's journey into the dark side of life, and I was not easily able to put it down to sleep. For those craving something a little different, this is nice book. And at only a couple of hundred pages, it won't consume so much time. I, for one, will be hunting for more of this Murakami."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"While not usually a fan of the &quot;slash and trash&quot; genre, Murakami's newest gives a reason to explore the subject of the serial killer.

The book moves quickly and was over way before I was ready for it to end. While not his best work, this was worth waiting for. In many ways I can see this as &quot;American Psycho&quot; done correctly. The violence is a little over the top in some sections, but in a kind of quirky style, so not really offensive. Nice translation, no real issues there."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"This book will not please everyone.

This odd, unsatisfying novel was described to me by a friend as \\"Japanese noir.\\" Well, that sounded promising enough. I expected a certain dark sensibility as well as mystery, suspense, plot twists, surprises... but this book seems perversely to avoid such things.On the first page, the young narrator, who guides tourists around Tokyo's nighttime sex district, meets his latest client, Frank, an odd, somewhat creepy American tourist. On the second page, the narrator casually mentions that a schoolgirl has recently been murdered, and within a few pages he and we are wondering if Frank could possibly be the murderer. (Nah, I told myself, that would be too easy; there MUST be more to it than that.) Alas, we meet virtually no other characters, no other suspects, in the course of this short book, and midway through it Frank DOES turn out to be the murderer, in fact a motiveless serial killer -- because out of the blue, without provocation, he proceeds to slice and dice a bunch of strangers in a bar.Afterward -- after what turns out to be the book's single scene of violence -- he and the young narrator continue to tour the town together... because, you see, the young man, while alarmed at the bloodbath he's just witnessed, somehow can't bring himself to inform the police (or to summon up any emotion for the people he's just seen butchered). I guess you'd say he's, um, alienated or something... In the end, he and Frank part as the New Year is rung in; and that's it for this very slight, disappointing book, most of which is padded out with elliptical conversation between the narrator and Frank, travel-mag-type filler as the narrator drones on about Tokyo night life, his relationship with his girlfriend and various people he runs into, and his growing sense that Frank is kind of weird and sinister and android-like. The whole thing feels sort of dashed-off, written too quickly and without conviction; I'm puzzled as to why it's attracted readers, and my suspicion is that it just seems sort of unclassifiable (is it a mystery, is it a thriller, is it horror, is it sci-fi, is it a travelogue?) and that, perversely, it's being praised for the way it disappoints our expectations."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"Hoping to expand my experience with oriental fiction in a story by a Japanese writer I ordered this impressively recommended novel. It was more than novel. It was wierd, with a story line that wasn't believable even pushing the limits in accepting the supernatural. The amateurish development of the &quot;monster&quot; character coupled with detailed episodes of grisley gore and violence might attract Japanese Godzilla fantasy fans. Not me. It didn't end. It just stopped, which turned out to be one of the better elements of the book."},{"Title":"In the Miso Soup","review":"A pretentious and self-important exercise. Far too cute for it's own good and a meditation that keeps pounding the head of the reader... ok already; we get it!Not half as good as it thinks it is and despite some sizzling reviews from the UK, it's made for angst ridden teens and kids with a gothic sense of the world."},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"Anyone who is into UFOlogy will recognize the 1970s disinformation program that was the inspiration for this book, but I won't spoil it for those who aren't in the know.In the near-future (twenty, twenty-five years), Virtual Reality news is all the new \\"sensation\\" - reporters are \\"observers,\\" fitted with emotional sensor jacks that relay their feelings to the Internet as well as what they see and hear. The protagonist of the story witnesses the brutal slaying of Zapatista farmers, in full view of a military base which does nothing to stop it, and is initiated into the realm of the rebel when NewsReal refuses to transmit his recordings of the event.Hooking-up with a disenfranchised debutante, the two become lovers and underground resistance members. Without a compass to guide them in the murky waters of illegal movements, they swiftly become compromised without knowing it. A powerful agenda is afoot, and the former reporter and subversive socialite inadvertently find themselves serving instead of fighting it.But the fun still isn't over: no sooner do our heroes have a grasp on the situation, than an even more alarming development occurs.Wonderful intrigue, likeable characters, and a complex and ever-changing plot keep this book moving steadily along. Its only real problem is a slow middle that delves too much on a not-very-believable future Texas, which is the only area of the book that suffers from excess science-fiction-itis. The \\"virtual reality\\" angle mercifully is never hit so hard over the head that it overpowers the drama of the piece, and the examination of artificial intelligence is quite interesting and well-done.For the record, I'm still betting - author picture in the back of the book notwithstanding - that Dennis Danvers is really Dean Koontz."},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"In 2013, Mexico serves as a source of unskilled labor willing to do the chores that Americans feel are beneath them. As the Mexican leadership becomes wealthier, more corrupt, and deadlier, the United States ignores human rights violations in favor of free trade, defined as Mexico freely giving up its raw materials to the Americans in exchange for nothing returned to the people.Santee St. John works for NewsReal reporting events around the world so that wired Americans can watch the real world from the safety net of the worldwide web. He captures the massacre of Native American farmers in Chiapas, Mexico, but learns that his company has no plans to air the footage. Instead, they use it to blackmail the already corrupt Mexican government into allowing NewsReal to take over the lucrative south of the border trade. A disillusioned Santee meets and bands with Zapatista supporter Margaret Mayfield as they join the Indians in their revolution for freedom.THE FOURTH WORLD is an unabashed bashing of right wing politics especially the political spouting that what's good for big business is good for the world. The story line is exciting as Dennis Danvers paints a less than heavenly view of the future. Though filled with non-stop action, the plot appears too simplistic when dealing with complex issues. This entertaining cyberthriller will be enjoyed by most readers except those to the right of Attilla the Hun. They might want to pass on this novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"The twists and surprises of this engrossingpageturner allow us to penetrate deeper anddeeper into some of the most horrificrealities of our epoch--while having lots offun.When I assigned it as a required text in my \\"Science Fiction,Technology, and Society\\" course, most of the students loved it."},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"After finishing END OF DAYS, Dennis Danvers' brilliant, thought-provoking fourth novel, I could hardly wait for the arrival of his fifth.It's here now, I've read it, and THE FOURTH WORLD didn't disappoint.Danvers takes the New Year's Day 1994 Zapatista uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas, moves it forward twenty, then twenty-five years, makes it the center of a plot by the rich and powerful that surprises us and not, then gives us a cast of underdogs and misfits that works against all odds to subvert that plot.Those characters-and despite the book's overt leftist politics, character remains its heart-include an employee of NewsReal, a media giant that in the virtual-web dominated first world uses people as cameras to capture the sights, sounds, and emotions of the sensational; a couple of American expatriates, one a young woman who has made the Zapatista cause her own, the other an aging pothead who wants only not to become involved; a teenaged boy who as a \\"webkicker\\" unwittingly but not unwillingly comes to work for the Zapatista cause; and others too numerous to mention, not the least of whom are the Zapatistas themselves, the Mexican men and women who have seen their families murdered and their land stolen.This is sci-fi with a heart, and with a conscience. Not with some gratuitous politically correct-type conscience, but with a very clear sense that the rich and powerful in the world do indeed rule it, and they rule it with utter disregard for the lives of the people they willingly brutalize and then sacrifice for their own self-serving ends: The \\"global village\\" in THE FOURTH WORLD is revealed to have \\"dirt floors and dysentery and children slowly starving.\\"Perfectly plotted and masterfully narrated, this latest novel by Dennis Danvers should continue to establish him as one of the pre-eminent science fiction writers of our time, one whose work moves from the level of genre to that of genuine literature, with stories and with insights that will remain on our bookshelves and in our hearts and minds long after our first encounter with them."},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"Danvers departs from his virtual reality Bin world to provide a political thriller set in South America and revolving around a plot to send Latinos to Mars. Romance entwines with an investigation of the plot which exposes many to danger and reveals the use of subliminal manipulation unprecedented in human activity. The focus on politics and social issues of Third World countries is realistic and involving."},{"Title":"The Fourth World","review":"This book raises many issues of web, identity, class etc and how from each perspective they get reported on (if at all - Is news moral ?to what values?, or a profit issue ?, would you willingly change\\\\supress the news to appease the chinese leadership to get the contract ?, or prefer to be poor but independent).I thought that this book was in the wrong section this is no guns thinking sf.Being honest the issues seem more important than the story to the author and i thought that it lost the the plot (to connect the issues some additional bods turn up) in the middle of the book.

Of course, it's even more indispensible for those who hope one day to make a film but aren't currently involved in the business. I emphasize \\"business\\" here because this isn't really a guide to the art of making films; you could imagine a similar book called \\"The Entrepeneur's Handbook: A comprehensive guide to establishing your own business in the age of the internet\\" and it would cover the same types of topics. For a guide to the art of filmmaking/directing, my favorite book is \\"Film Directing Fundamentals\\" by Nicholas Proferes. But for the practical and day to day and big picture of the business of filmmaking, \\"The Filmmaker's Handbook\\" is Indispensible: an excellent and thorough introduction and guide to the processes, the people, the arrangements, the contracts, the details that go into making films, especially independent films.I required this book as one of the textbooks for my film history course on \\"American Independent Film\\" because it seemed to me there was no better way to indicate to students how much is involved in getting films made. It's a very helpful piece of the course and gives students a perspective that they wouldn't get from my own emphasis on film theory and criticism."},{"Title":"The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age","review":"As an aspiring young filmmaker, the first thing I was told to do was go out and get a copy of the Filmmaker's Handbook. Imagine my surprise when I found out that the book had been updated in March of 1999, and that now it included all kinds of information about the digital age. I have learned so much from this book. The book goes over the entire film process, and does it in a straight-forward manner. It is a great start for beginners, yet it includes a rich amount of information for the professional. Anyone who has ever thought about a career in film really needs to get a copy of this book. Written in a manner that neither patronizes nor confuses the reader, the Filmmaker's Handbook is the best book I have skimmed or read on film, and believe me, I've looked at a lot."},{"Title":"The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age","review":"This book doesn't need 1,000 words - it speaks for itself. We recommend it to all our students as the best value text book to have. An excellent primer before moving on to specialist books. I don't want to be responsible for our students spending a fortune on books, so I tell them that if they can't afford much, then this is the one to get. The problem with many film books is that you can spend a fortune on getting the wrong ones.

If you want to know what a line producer does, how light meters work and the ratio of film stock to projection, this is the book for you.It's thick but easy to read with nice B&amp;W illustrations. As a novice and somebody who wants to know how a movie is made this book is perfect. I was really impressed by how simple and to the point this book was on the mechanics and made it an easy read.

This is definitely an invaluabe resource for anyone who's interested in making narrative, documentary, experimental, or corporate movies with a video or film camera(s).The book explains the differences between the multitude of film systems from super 8 to 35mm, it goes into detail about how the camera works, discusses how to take care of your equipment and why, and goes all the way up to funding and distributing your movie. There are nine appendices which includes charts and calculations on how to adjust certain aspects of the camera/lens/etc. to get the certain look you want. So if you're on a set and need to adjust something on (or inside) the camera but are unsure of the calculations, it's just quick flip of the book to the appendix to find what you need.The book also deals with the scientific features of filmmaking so anyone can get a better idea of how the various aspects of filmmaking work and which way of doing things is best for the filmmakers particular needs.A few problems arise however. The technical jargon can be overwhelming sometimes and may require you to reread a paragraph several times in order to get a clear understanding of what the author is talking about. The fact that there's no glossary doesn't help that problem either. My biggest gripe however is the lack of coverage on digital filmmaking. The book is outdated and lacks the information needed for people wishing to make movies with DV cameras. Despite those problems, I still HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone wishing to make films."},{"Title":"The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age","review":"I am currently taking beggining film & video classes and one of the requirements is this book. It is a book with tremendous insightful help but unfortunetly some information is getting outdated.

The film part is fine and it truly does teach the basics of cinema production (the technical aspect)"},{"Title":"The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age","review":"This book serves as a wonderful technical manual on how you 'should' make a film; usually, that means the most expensive way that independent and underground filmmakers (the target audience) cannot afford. When editing a film on video, you don't 'have' to complete an online edit, spending about $40 per hour at pro editing facilities. You can easily do a quick offline and release it much cheaper with almost the same results.The book would be a whole lot better if it shared methods and tricks on cutting production and post-production costs down, enabling young filmmakers (with little or no money) to actually finish their films. That is the bottom line, really. The technical side of filmmaking is learned very quickly on your own. Making people think that they have to go the expensive way is counter-productive.Still, an extremely helpful read.-N.

Stackpole's characters are, as always, human (even those that aren't biologically). This book informs readers of what happened after DGW, specifically related to Crow and to Leigh Norrington. Will's character shift is welcome; Alexia becomes a character with more depth and her love interest (while not surprising) is sincere. Kerrigan.... well let's just say that Stackpole does a masterful job of showing his power and naivete all in the same scenes. Again, very consistent character work.*spoilers below*As has been noted, there are very few all out melee battles in this book. The main characters have plausible political and social problems as well as battle strategies to devise. The hit and fade attacks by Resolute, Crow, and Will are nicely done as added action scenes and further story development. Stackpole's plotline flows naturally and logically from point to point; nothing in this novel seems contrived or forced; the end of the book is well thought out, although there's an easy clause out of Will's death. I'm torn between wanting Stackpole to bring such an intereseting character back with said clause or leave him dead because its use might cheapen the plot. But besides that, it's nice to know that Rym Ramoch and Bok are more than they seem.This book is consistenly engaging (to be read: will keep you up late to finish it) and is highly recommended. But read Dark Glory War and Fortress Draconis first so you understand what you're reading."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"There's a lot of truth in a number of the other reviews here, in as much as that the title may be a tad misleading (dragons only become a focus later in the story, and they are a lot more political-minded than enraged) and that this book is better than Fortress Draconis but still not as good as DGW. It's better than FD because you already know the characters, are ready to learn about yet more new players, feel better at home in the &quot;universe&quot; Stackpole's created, and get to see further development on all fronts (Human, Elven, Aurolani, urZrethi, etc).It's still not fully up to par with the &quot;prequel&quot; (this sort of thing makes it hard to talk about &quot;first&quot; or &quot;middle&quot; parts, get it ?) because the development is spread over four characters that relate the story as it evolves (Alexia, Will, Kerrigan, and Adrogans ... okay maybe one more, but she has only a few chapters) whereas DGW gave you that much more debt on the psyche of one character, Tarrant Hawkins.Knowing just a tad about the author from reading nearly all of his books, frequently checking his own website, and especially his replies to reader-reactions ... I don't think he'll even consider changing his preset plans because of what the reader thinks, but I agree it would be nice to regain a stronger focus on Crow/hawkins in the next book (whether it's first of third person narrative): there are tons of threads waiting to be taken care off ... especially confrontations with Nefrai Kesh &amp; Nefrai Laysh, and of course Myrall'Mara."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"I think this book is awesome and even better than Fortress Draconis. The reason is because there is a lot more action and a lot more development into the story. Both are great books, but now people have matured and now become 'badasses' =)Definitely get this book, well I probably don't have to tell anyone.I bet anyone who read Dark Glory War and Fortress Draconis have already purchased this one. Have fun!"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"To that Mike guy and his one star rating: what? Did you even finish the book? The ending is quite interesting, to say the least.While i do agree Stackpole's style can be somewhat dry at times, he does slowly input detail that brings the world, and most importantly the plot to life. There are a good handful of suprises in the book to keep it lively.His battle descriptions are very interesting from a military standpoint but lack much of the emotion that would draw me deeper into them. Stackpole presents the battle tactics in a clean, logical way that makes it easy to draw parrallels to modern warfare.For the most part it is a step above the usual fantasy series released these days and a worthy read. Definitely better than Fortress, and almost as good as Dark Glory War."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"The evil sorceress Chytrine rules the frozen lands of the North with a cruelty that rivals nothing the world has ever seen before, but also lusts after more as she obsesses with becoming the Empress of the South. To accomplish her quest, Chytrine searches for the seven broken parts of the Dragon Crow's because that artifact will enable her to control dragons and subsequently the world. Quite formidable without the dragons, Chytrine's army is conquering the southern nations.Her opponents seem less menacing to the Sorceress than they did when they defeated her a quarter of a century ago. Backed by the heroic but battle veteran Crow and rookie sorcerer Kerrigan, Princess Alexia of Orkennell leads an army struggling to defeat Chytrine. While her foes organize and southern kings plan on a conference to stop her, Chytrine hunts Will Norrington of the Prophecy, because she believes he, or one of his bloodline, is the only individual who could destroy her. Life seems bleakest for Alexia and her allies for Chytrine's forces appear invincible even without the dragons.Michael A. Stackpole's latest epic fantasy is a classic good vs. evil tale that will thrill genre fans due to an action-packed story line and strong heroes risking their lives to stop an ostensibly insurmountable malfeasance. Though they hurt and love, each one knows the stakes if they lose. They make mistakes, suffer setbacks, and know pain yet keep rising up as if they are the greatest generation through courage, cunning, camaraderie, and caring that hooks the reader to learn what happens WHEN DRAGONS RAGE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"What a great 2nd book in a series. Puts many new facets of the story into play and solves a few questions. A bit choppy in the writing style as it switches main characters in each chapter and you have to read through two or three chapters to get back to the story line you were interested in. But that is mostly how Stackpole writes. If you liked his style before it will not bother you too much."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"&quot;When Dragons Rage&quot; picks up right after Stackopol's last cliffhanger ending in &quot;Fortress Draconis&quot; and continues the saga of Will, Kerrigan, Alexia, Crow, and Resolute. (Not to mention quite a few other interesting characters including Erlestoke, Sebcia, the princess of Muroso, and Dranae, whose identity we finally discover.)For those who might not remember, the last book ended with Crow's arrest. He was charged with being the treasonous Tarrant Hawkins; something that I hope didn't take too many readers by surprise. This ending of &quot;When Dragons Rage&quot;, however, is not predictable at all. Stackpol manages not, one, not two, but THREE surprising twists to the story, ending in a way you would never expect. It is this kind of thing that makes me like Stackpol so much as a writer, but I hope that these sorts of cliffhanger endings are not becoming a habit. (Please tell me they aren't, Mr. Stackpol! *plaintive voice*)Anyhow, I won't spoil any of the action for those of you who haven't read the book, except to say that its packed with as much adventure and romance as you could hope for, and well worth your time and your money.For those of you who haven't read this series yet, I highly recommend it. Start with &quot;The Dark Glory War&quot; and prepare for an experience you will never forget!"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"&quot;When Dragons Rage&quot; is another spectacular effort from the most underrated fantasy author of today. Michael Stackpole turns up the heat in this second book of his Dragoncrown War Cycle. There is more action, more intrigue, more romance, just plain more of everything than the two previous books in the series(counting the prequel), and in this case quantity does equal quality.There are few authors who can match Stackpole at anything, let alone surpass him, he truly is a gem. These(as well as all of his other works)books should be in hardcover. I am honestly shocked that his publisher has not given him hardcovers, and even more so that they hardly promote him.To anyone who loves epic fantasy, these books are for you."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"Here we are, at the end of the year, and yet I fear, this book may again bring a tear.I have finally realized why I was so dissappointed from the last novel, Fortress Draconis (read my review for the last book), and it is because of the way the story is presented; as with this novel. More on this later. If your looking for a synopsis read the editorial reviews or another review.First off this novel begins exactly where the last one left off, and since it's been a year you might feel a little confused when you start reading. Due to the amount of characters, races, and magic I'm suprised there wasn't a glossary or hierarchy to help out. (I was too frustrated with the last novel to refresh my memory) This book is definitely what I'd recommend to Stackpole's Battletech and Starwars fan since it's told in such grand fashion. But if you are a fan of his fantasy novels (i.e. Once a Hero, Talion:Revenant) you might want to read a chapter or two before buying. The reason being that it is told in a totally different style. The main reason why I was so disappointed is that his writing style has changed in these last two novels.He has switched from his brilliant first person narratives to third person narratives that are reminiscent of his Battletech novels. With so many main characters his last novel jumps back and forth losing focus.I would agree that this novel was a cut above Fortress Draconis and did develop the characters more. With characters being fleshed out readers will start enjoying the banter and character interactions. The only character that didn't get much if any limelight was Crow (Hawkings). Although the novel did discuss what happened to him since The Dark Glory War novel, it barely has him staring in a chapter or two. Being a huge Tarrant Hawkings fan I'm very much crushed that Stackpole is doing him such disservice (as you can tell this review might be biased :) ...I enjoyed Dark Glory War much more due to the fact that it was in Stackpole's grade A first person style, which helped readers identify and care for the characters. This is evident in almost all of his fantasy novels. With his third person narrative it just isn't the same, which can be seen in his recent \\"cliff-hanger\\" endings. Both Dragoncrown War novel's ending don't have the same hair-raising effect like Dark Glory War, which I would credit to his classic first narrative style.Since Fortress Draconis and When Dragons Rage lacks Stackpole's old pizazz, I still feel cheated and abused since the end of Dark Glory War. Hopefully Stackpole might give a tribute to Crow in the next novel and write a couple of chapters in his good'o first narrative style.Overall When Dragons Rage is a definitive improvement over Fortress Draconis and should be bought so Stackpole can start working on some more first person narratives ;)"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"What an incredilble book! The action doesn't pick up until after the first 1/3rd, however, the ending is such a shocker!

I don't want to give anything away...I know it's not much of a review, but too much info would spoil it..."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"When Dragons Rage is a very enjoyably read, it does suffer from a few minor problems that take it out of the realm of \\"great\\" and into \\"good but flawed.\\" Unfortunately, its biggest flaw is almost unforgivable: it's dreadfully boring at times. And that's not like Stackpole.It suffers from an acute case of middle-book syndrome. It seems at times that the characters, introduced and developed in the first book, just move around the board in preparation for their final use in the last book of the series. They go through some more development in this one, and they are for the most part interesting. But I can't help feeling that this is a place-holder book rather than a continuation. Even Stackpole seems to feel that way, as it lacks in large part his characteristic military action. Oh, don't get me wrong. It is there, and when it is, Stackpole excels as he usually does. However, Stackpole goes on for long passages about things that aren't really that interesting. He gives great gory detail about the magic system in this world, telling us the whys and wherefores of many of Kerrigan's spells as he works out exactly what his abilities are. The spell descriptions get tedious after a while, and he spends pages on them. Dullness is not a good thing when we're talking about an action book.The characters are usually just as interesting as the first book, and Kerrigan actually gets less annoying (which I didn't think was possible). In fact, when Stackpole isn't boring us with the explanation of how magic works, Kerrigan is actually a pretty interesting character as he comes under a new tutor who isn't all that he seems. The revelation about this tutor actually comes as a shock. Will continues his fine progress on the road to being a good man. He's still nave at times, but he's growing into a strong young man and it's not as unlikely as it was before that he would be the man to finally beat Chytrine.Princess Alexia and Crow also remain interesting characters, but there are aspects that I found a little suspect, or at least unsupported and coming out of nowhere. As part of a plan to help Crow get out of his mess, Alexia offers to marry him in order to make him a non-citizen of the Southlands and thus make him harder to try as a criminal. But they develop a love for each other that makes them wish for the end of all this conflict so they can get on with their lives. While I understand how a love can grow when you're in constant proximity to another person, there is no development of this other than a scene where Alexia thinks back to the their time together and realizes that she wants his touch. We don't see any of this time, unfortunately. It's all in Alexia's thoughts. It wasn't a surprise that this happened, but it would have been nice to see some of it before Stackpole just presents it to us.Even Chytrine is characterized in this book. Not only that, but Stackpole gives her another dimension which makes her less a caricature. Unfortunately, that other dimension is given by interacting with a \\"daughter\\" that she has taken earlier from the South. The reason this is unfortunate is because Isaura is a very dull character. She must have been introduced to set up her role in the third book. I can't think of any other reason why Stackpole would include her. She does do a couple of important things, but overall she's useless. She's yet another innocent character who goes on and on about how innocent they are. She has never seen the Southlands before, so Chytrine sends her on one of the expeditions to the South. She observes, she does some things in the main city that don't really have much of an explanation, and then she goes home. Innocent does not have to mean boring, but unfortunately Stackpole doesn't seem to realize that. Kerrigan suffered from this in the first book. There seems to be a quota of boring innocent characters in this series, and when one moves beyond it, another one must take its place.The plot of the book is pretty good overall, though as I said, there are long passages of tedium. Crow's problem stretches on for the first 100 pages or so, and not all of them are needed. There are long chapters of Kerrigan trying to work out spells. Some of the other character exposition is interesting, though. The ending, however, is magnificent and really does leave you longing for the last book so you can see how it ends. We finally get to see some more information about the dragons in the world (instead of being a small plot device) and some startling events happen that take your breath away if you've been following these characters. Most of the action takes place in the last half of the book (in fact, at times Adrogans' invasion seems like an attempt to get some action in the first part of the book, though I know his story is more important than that). There are still plenty of heads flying and limbs being chopped off, but there is much less than previous books.It's a shame, because Stackpole is a wonderful action writer. He seems to be working on his characters, though, and I have to admit that he does a much better job overall with them. While this is not a wonderful book, it does its work well. Try to get through the boring parts for the meat at the end. There are some things at the beginning to hold your interest as well, so take heart. And get ready for a rollicking conclusion. I'm sure it's coming. Don't you dare disappoint me, Michael.David Roy"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"First off, the disclaimer: If you're biased about Michael's non-Star Wars or non-Battletech books, don't branch out with this one. It picks up in the middle of a three book (so far) series and you'd miss out on a lot.Onwards. When Dragons Rage does a fantastic job of not only continuing an intense, high fantasy saga, but you get to see characters from Fortress Draconis grow, develop and learn. Nobody really hogs the limelight, with the possible exception of Will, but as THE Norrington, what else would one expect? (What'd I say? Read the first book first)So if you don't like story lines where many things happen at once, you might want to pass on this. There's a lot happening, even though Michael does a magnificent job of working us back into a scene we left behind a chapter or two ago.The action picks up in this book, taking us from battle to battle, confrontation to mystery and back into battle, very smoothly. Nothing feels forced, and the characterizations are very well done. Nobody speaks with somebody else's voice.Final note: By the end of the book, I was reading and turning pages as quickly as I could, anxious to find out what happened next... and dreading that final page. When I got to it... well, Michael warned us with his Author's Bio. &quot;...has gone into hiding for fear of being lynched because of the ending of this book.&quot;I don't blame him a bit. &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; is a good word for it.When Dragons Rage is definitely a page-turner, and the characters are all compelling. The writing style is solid and the plot line... overwhelming at times. Truly a grand saga, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"First, I think that the title is a bit misleading, given that there are no actual dragon appearances until the latter 20% or so of the book, and considering the length of the book, this makes for little dragon rage.Picking up nearly immediately after the end of Fortress Draconis (FD), Stackpole spends the first few chapters refreshing the reader's memory of what transpired in the previous book. As with FD, the story is told via focusing on a different character each chapter. As with FD, we see things from the viewpoint of Will the thief and prophesied savior, Alexia the warrior princess, Kerrigan the wizard and Adrogans the general. We also are introduced to several new players, including Isaura, the adopted daughter of the southlands' scourge, Chytrine, and one of the two sons of the despicable King Scrainwood. Hawkins, the narrator of Dark Glory War (DGW) and the pariah of the South, and Resolute are again relegated to supporting roles.This novel comprises another fantastic effort of prose. The classic Stackpole action and suspense and political maneuvering is a major factor. Some of the history and philosophy of the world is also addressed, which I found rewarding. There is also a pair of love stories that crop up, and they are very well done without seeming to be tacked on as in some other fantasy novels. Will, in particular, is VERY well written, especially as regards his acceptance of his foretold path and, basically, his growth as a person and a leader of men.Again in this series, the ending leaves something of a foul taste in the mouth. While neither FD nor this book are as stunning as the end of DGW, the lack of closure is frustrating in light of needing to wait a year for any resolution. Many of the things that in other reviews are listed as surprises really should not be considering the foreshadowing throughout both FD and this book. And I think that the seemingly tragic occurrence near the end might be easily resolved when one considers the Norrington Prophecy (in the front of the book). So, while I have a few complaints, this book is a must-read, not only for those who have started the series, but for any readers of the highest quality epic fantasy available."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"\\"When Dragons Rage\\" is the second novel in The DragonCrown War Cycle series approximately one generation following \\"The Dark Glory War\\" prelude novel. It is an impressive book filled with creative battles, detailed descriptions, and interesting characters.The progressions of Kerrigan and Wilburforce throughout the book are remarkable, especially the combat improvements by the two youngsters. The camaraderie between Resolute and Kedyn's Crow isn't as dominate as in the prior volume but is complimented with a romantic relationship delivering less fighting, which I find slightly disappointing. Given the audacious origin of General Androgans, he is one of my favorite characters, implementing impressive strategies and tactics.Characters and countries overwhelmed me by the end of the novel and a glossary would have been worthwhile along with a more detailed map of the significant terrains.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre and look forward to reading the final novel.Thank you."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"I purchased it for my Husband, and he loved it!

The characters are so filled out and vividly drawn that I was mourning thefact that I did not have another wonderful series to follow this one. If you getthe chance, reward yourself, settle back and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"When Dragons Rage by Michael Stackpole is the second book in the Dragoncrown War Cycle. The first book is titledFortress Draconis (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 1). However, there is also a prelude to this trilogy, that novel is titledThe Dark Glory War (A Prelude to the DragonCrown War Cycle). I was fortunate enough to start with the prelude before starting with the trilogy. I would highly suggest, if you are a new reader to this series, starting hat way as well. I will caution though, the prelude is a first person perspective. Usually, I do not like first person books; however, that one was an exception. I quite enjoyed it. At any rate, if you have not read the first book in this trilogy you really need to do that before embarking on this novel. There are events that occur in this book that would simply make no sense if you do not have that previous book under your belt.The plot of this one carries over right where the first book ended. There is a large scale war as people are fighting for the shards from the dragon crown. On the surface, this seems like a rather straight forward plot line, with little imagination. However, what seems shallow and linear, quickly becomes deep and engaging. Throughout the novel, the reader begins to understand that there is more to the war than the dragon crown fragments. Also during the course of the story there are political sub plots, several actually. As well as the expansion of certain characters pasts and their development. I can't say more on that because it would be a spoiler, sorry for being vague. There are also large scale battles that are described with just enough detail to give the reader a picture of what's going on, but not enough so that the reader can not apply their own imagination to it. The plot is solid and well thought out, however, there was a point during the middle of the book where it was obvious that Mr. Stackpole was setting things up for the end. The book came to a slow plodding, almost forced, pace. This lasted for approximately seventy five pages. It reminded me of an intermission at a play actually. Once that intermission was over, it was full steam ahead again and the story flowed wonderfully. All the events in this book, and the previous one, set up for what promises to be a great conclusion to this trilogy.The characters in this book are mostly the same ones from the previous book which allows Mr. Stackpole to skip many explanations about them and just go right onto the story and character development. Favorites characters make a return, Will, Kerrigan, Resolute, Alyx etc they are all here. One complaint I have about the characters is that while the ones from the first book are here and largely remain the same, there is also the addition of quite a few characters. While it's nice to have diversity in the characters, I felt, at times, that there were simply too many characters to follow in this book. This is especially true when the group splits up into multiple parts. As a reader it was often difficult for me to know who was where, and just what they were doing. There is, however, a great deal of character development crammed into this novel. One thing I liked is that Mr. Stackpole did not wait until the last one hundred to two hundred pages to use for character development. He spread it out very nicely throughout the entire book. This allows for the reader to comprehend what is going on instead of being left wondering what just happened. Kerrigan certainly showed a great deal of character development. Will did as well, although I am not completely sure I like the development of his character. The character I really enjoyed reading about in the first book has almost completely changed. It just felt odd to me. Crow's development is quite good as are several of the other characters, but I won't go into them all as I simply don't want to bore you. If you are a fan of solid characters and good character development I am reasonably sure you will enjoy this novel.The only criticisms I can offer this novel were mentioned above. I felt there were too many characters for me to really follow. When there are that many characters the author is forced to write about each of them, thereby taking away from the rest of the characters. I had a hard time \`getting into' the characters because I was constantly reading about a different one. Secondly, the slow plodding nature of the middle section of the book. It seemed to me that some of it was mere filler. That is just my opinion though.I do enjoy Mr. Stackpole's prose and descriptive nature. He gives just enough to start the picture and lets the reader finish it off. I also like his explanation of magic and the thought processes he uses with Kerrigan. It makes the magic feel much more alive. Also, the plot is well thought out and I am thinking the plot of the third book should be fantastic.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It's definitely a solid addition to the trilogy, but more importantly a solid addition to the fantasy genre. I believe most fantasy fans will find this book, and trilogy, entertaining. There seems to be something for everyone here, large scale battles, political subterfuge, magic battles, monsters, etc. The list goes on and on. I can easily see myself recommending this series to many people. I am looking forward to reading the conclusion t this story."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"If you are looking for Raging Dragons, this isn't the book for you. While dragons do make a cameo appearance at the end of the novel, they do not rage. However, don't let that stop you from reading this wonderful book, the second in the series. If you have not read, &quot;Fortress Draconis&quot;, please do so before reading this book or you'll be totally lost. There is a &quot;prequel&quot; to this story call &quot;Dark, Glory War&quot;, which I have not read, and have not felt that I'm missing anything by not reading it. Start with Fortress Draconis and move on from there.The author is clearly improving as a writer with this novel. His story moves along at great pace and there's hardly a dull moment. He is obviously not writing a Jordanesque series that will last for all time without coming to an end, so that is very good. What would take Jordan four books to write, Stackpole takes care of in four chapters. It's a fun read, goes by quick and is a perfect light read if you are interested in a good fantasy story full of swords, sorcery and those omnipresent bad &quot;orc&quot; like characters that are so easy to kill but seem to be endless in numbers!! The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, all the women are beautiful and the action doesn't stop.While I enjoyed the novel, I was a little annoyed at some frequently used plot contrivances, such as the &quot;Innocent, Ignorant, Beautiful Girl who Lives with the Bad People but Doesn't Know They Are Bad&quot;, as well as what will prove to be a trick ending designed to annoy some people. There's also a rather awkward and unnecessary &quot;May-December&quot; romance, which does not make a whole lot of sense except that the girl may be looking for a father figure. Outside of that, great book, enjoy it."},{"Title":"When Dragons Rage (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 2)","review":"Michael Stackpole has done a splendid job of not writing a filler in a trilogy.

It doesn't have a catchy title. There aren't get rich quick schemes. You won't find a way to buy houses with no money down. You won't find a way to make money without lifting a finger. If you want a book lie that, read &quot;rich dad, poor dad.&quot; However, that book will leave you frustrated because of it's endless babble about how some other guy got rich. It's basically a long pep talk.In contrast, the Unofficial Guide gives you a realistic example of how and why this type of investing works. It goes into a great deal of detail about the benefits and drawbacks. It gives a pretty picture of the real estate business in an understandable manner and shows several different ways that profits can be made. It seems to be slightly geared towards investors who are interested in rental housing - especially buildings with 4+ units - but there is still more than enough information to justify any investor's purchase. Experienced investors would be helped if they aren't seeing very good profits or if they just want to renew their education and get some helpful points.The only drawbacks to this book would be the way taxes are presented. There are several points that are a spread out over several chapters and I was left a little confused.

Duh.The text is light on brass tacks and long on windy prose. And it talks down to the reader.

At one point, the book warns about IRS penalties for not using &quot;approved methods&quot; for determining the depreciation cost basis of improvements (versus non-depreciable land), a longstanding mystery for me (and the IRS, too, based on the vague guidance they offer). Despite the stern warning, the book moves on without offering a single suggestion as to what might be deemed an acceptable method! The book is filled with this kind of uninformative fluff.

It is purposely written in easy to follow language and there is even a glossary of those terms that with which the reader might be unfamiliar. In general I'm not a big fan of glossaries as it seems that many authors use the glossary as filler for the book. That is not the case here. In the margins are helpful tips, watch outs and money saver tips. This is a good beginner or intermediate text, but experienced real estate investors will find this to be too elementary reading. The text is comprehensive and can be used for further reference, as it does have an index. The price is also right for this book at retail of $16.99 and is well worth the money spent. At $11.89 on AMAZON.COM its a great bargain. Besides the purchase of real estate, which many other books cover this book also gets into being a landlord, how to fix and upgrade a property and even whether you should rent to pet owners. They say yes! They recommend charhing extar security and extra rent to qualified pet owning tenants. I would recommend that anyone contemplating real estate investing either as a part time avocation or a full time career to start with this book. This is not the only book you'll want or need to read, but its a good first step. this book doesn't have everything that you'll need but will start you on the right road."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"as to whether you will find this book helpful or not.When I first entered the real estate market, I was a novice investor. I found this book to be very helpful and insightful and gave me a good solid vocabulary enabling me to converse intelligently with the Real Estate agents I was working with. I am now a full time Real Estate Agent specialing in commercial real estate and I continue to recommend this book to my customers with little background in Real Estate investing and purchasing.If you are a seasoned investor with many purchases in your background and portfolio, then this book may not be for you. While you may or may not be aware of the many calculations and insights this book offers, I believe it is still a worth while addition to an investors library.If you are new to Real Estate investing I highly recommend this book. It contains many helpful calculations and insights to give you a good solid background of what you need to know to invest in real estate.The calculations are real world examples used in practice by both Residential and Commercial Real Estate Agents. It offers topics on Creative Financing, Property management as well as an overview of the various types of Investment properties."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"Before buying this book, I was under the impression that in order to buy a $350,000 property, I'd have to come up with 20% down (A nearly impossible task). So I spoke with my friend's dad who already owns rental properties. To my shock, he said I only needed 3% down with an FHA loan. Skeptical, I decided to do my own research and bought this book. I just finished reading this book last night. I was very impressed by the sound advice given within. It echoed exactly what my friend's dad had told me. I have yet to buy my first four-unit rental building, but this book has given me the necessary practical guide for the rest of my life. This same time, next year, I will own a four-unit apartment with no fear. I'm 29 years old and have always wondered how do people get wealthy. Now, I know how. If you want motivation to get into real estate investing, I would suggest buying Russ Whitney's book first. If you need meat for your motivation, then the Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing is the one for you. It is very comforting to know the authors are from Southern California as well. It gives greater validity that their advice will work for me. I have no doubt that I will be re-reading this book as my wealth grows as planned."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I'm a beginner and I just acquired my RE license in South Florida for my own personal investment goals. This book is great. It provided a solid foundation for R.E. It is not a get-rich quick guide, and it is not for the &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;seasoned&quot; investor.This book is fabulous. I disagree with the reviewer saying that it's cookie-cutter from this company. The information is quite valuable and would even come in handy for first time home buyers. The knowledge is solid and it speaks very plain. If you want high-brow, go somewhere else. This is the everyday, everyguy/gal book! I purchased it at the store here, and I love it. I've underlined so much in it and it truly explains REAL ESTATE."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I really like that the author said that real estate investing is not a get-rich-quick investment vehicle. For me, it puts this book in a good category versus the garbage books that promise the sky. I think that the authors provide very good real estate advice.The only criticism I have of this book and other real estate books is that they do not warn readers of the dangers of leverage. They only talk about how great leverage is. For example, the author of this book says that a modest 2 percent growth in value translates to a 20 percent return on a property with just a 10 percent down payment. However, it also works the same going down, meaning that a 2 percent decline in prices results in a 20 percent loss. In addition, a 10 percent decline in real estate values results in a 100 percent loss. Many investors thought that real estate values could never go down. Unfortunately, they are paying a huge price now as real estate values have declined significantly. With that being said, I believe that real estate prices are either close to a bottom or already at a bottom, which means that if you invest right now, you are very likely to make a lot of money in the future.Besides this, I think this is a really good book.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

I would recommend this book for first time investors in real estate or even for people who may have done some investment in the past but want to become serious in real estate investment.Book is dividied into 7 major sections - Understanding Real Estate as an investment, Secrets of real estate investing, Mastering the Market, Setting your investment goals, Putting your money on the line, property management essentials, Facing your fears.I think most initial investors (prime target audience for this book) will find section 1, 2 and 6 useful and something they should read as part of their preparation for starting a real estate investment career.

It is not a no down, get rich quick guide, nor does it lead you to investing in risky situations. It does however lay out in plain simple language, the benefits of investing in residential real estate and how to evaluate what a specific property is returning as to cash flow, appreciation etc. Definite formulas are provided and explained. Best of all, after I read the book and realized that the two authors were located in the Southern California area, I picked up the telephone and spoke with them. They were more than happy to meet with me to discuss my real estate situation. After having met with them, I am looking forward to improving my situation.

The notes given in the margins of the book are extremely helpful with explaining an idea more in detail. The ideas are well-explained and offers good resources for further exploration into any specific area. The book is also divided into many chapters, so you don't have to drum through long chapters and feel drained by the end.This is an excellent book to start out with if you are trying to get into the business or even if you already own one or two properties already.

In addition, I belong to several real estate clubs, and suscribe to several real estate news letters.If I saw this book in a book store I would have been able to read enough to see it was useless. However, I bought it online.This book is a cookie cutter by a company who writes the \\"Unofficial Guide...\\" books on any subject they think will sell--which I have no problem with if they write good books.This book is written like a high school book report where meaningless fluff is added at every possible point. The writer they selected tries to touch on anything related to real estate, but fails to show the reader how money is made in real estate. There are many great books on real estate, even some not so good books will have a few valuable pieces of information. This book would rate in the bottom 3 of the over 100 real estate books I've read. Spend your $ on a different real estate book; this one stinks."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"Typically, I shy away from liking books that speak to the huge landlord and real estate investing businesses. They don't need books like this and the books only tempt small-timers to spend money that won't help them.This book is different. It does talk about the big-timers but it also shows the small investor real ways to become big and to reduce headaches.If you own one or two rent houses and perhaps want to add a 4-plex or more homes to your portfolio, slowly but wisely, you would be wise to read this book. Unlike some, I generally like the &quot;Unofficial Guides&quot; and this was no exception.Although this won't solve your real-world every DAY problems that you face as a landlord or landlady, it does help solve a few larger problems that come up (finances are well covered) and it will encourage you to keep on doing what you do to build your empire.Many have read (or will read) my &quot;Managing Rental Properties for Maximum Profit&quot; (ISBN: 0761525319) and there they get the nuts and bolts of getting in and overcoming early problems the small-time rental owner sees daily. Then, it's definitely time once you've overcome many of those problems to move up to this Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing. It's more of a reference book than a hands-on book in many places, but when you're ready for this book, you will be ready for that reference material."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing (Unofficial Guides)","review":"First,I am a sophisticated PAPER investor,not real estate tycoon.

If you're even REMOTELY thinking of investing in real estate,even buying your first house, get this book. Couple this with The Roaring 2000's by Harry Dent to key in on potential boom real estate markets. Mine is considered mid-growth phase.

I was not disappointed. In fact I was very surprised at just how good it was. There is NOTHING that could happen to a real estate purchaser that is not covered in great detail in this book.

You get a broad overview of the language with bilingual translations and a phonetic guide to pronunciation under each line of text. The content is entertaining and will even help with your speaking skills, provided you follow the instructions by reading each line out loud. No one book can make you fluent in a language, as that requires lots of reading and conversational practice, but by the time you finish this book, you should be able to read news articles and other everyday materials in Spanish, such as content on BBC Mundo.This would make an ideal introduction to the language, which you could follow up with Assimil's \\"Spanish With Ease\\", one of FSI's courses, or Pimsleuer.

Interspersed are short descriptions of grammar or other useful information.It's sometimes hard to figure out which word means what. This book was written as if people could just memorize a bunch of sentences and put them together to say whatever they want. But it's much better to teach us words and teach us how to put them together in order to say what we want. The book is written as if long discussions of grammar are too boring. But I think we need about twice as much explanation in order to really know what we're saying.It's great to have the transliteration there in case we get confused, but it's too easy to ignore the Spanish and just read the transliteration aloud. Certainly, at some point we should have a clue and no longer need this crutch. (The book does actually explain how to pronounce each letter at the beginning, so transliterations through the entire book should not be necessary.)Too much mindless memorization is required to learn from this book, and when you're done, you don't really know that much.If you're trying to get one of the famous Berlitz books, this probably isn't it. On the cover, it says &quot;Charles Berlitz [the author] . . . is the grandson of the founder of the Berlitz Schools.

Aside from the United States Army, the freighting firm of Russell, Majors and Waddell (RMW) was just possibly the dominant economic powerhouse of the antebellum American West. Stretching from Independence, Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico, Sacramento, California and Ft Vancouver (Portland) Oregon, it dominated freight movement on the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Trail. In addition to its massive freighting operations, it owned the Overland Stage Line and the Pony Express!For the six years of its existence, this company did far more than any other private concern to organize and systematize the great wagon trains upon these roads. Their trains were efficient, ran on time, completed deliveries on schedule and satisfied contracts all across the West. But what amazes even more than the clock work precision with which this business was managed, was the size, the shear scope of the assets managed and their economic impact throughout the United States. Billing over $2.0 million per year, an astronomical figure for the late 1850s, RMW promoted the banking business in Western Missouri, St. Louis and New York. Its purchase of wagons stimulated markets in St. Louis, Pittsburg and Philadelphia while the vast number of oxen, horses and mules it bought underwrote the stock raising and agricultural industry of western and central Missouri. In May of 1857 alone, RMW had dispatched 48 wagon trains, 645 wagons carrying 3,870,797 pounds of freight. To draw the wagons 7,740 oxen driven by 770 teamsters and assistants were required. At its height, newspaperman Horace Greely estimated the firm employed 6,000 men and owned 75,000 oxen.The end came when US government failed to settle its debts that the firm had incurred on the Army's behalf during the Mormon War. But before it went under, Russell, Majors and Waddell contributed significantly to the development of the West, linking new frontiers such as El Paso, Denver, Salt Lake, Sacramento and Portland to the rest of the Nation.You will be amazed by this book."},{"Title":"Telecommunications (Modern Media Series)","review":"Purchased this book for my youngest son and ended up reading through it!

If you plan on reading this book, it is wise to know that, before hand, it is based in Young Life and Jesus as Saviour. This is fine if you are of the Christian faith but clearly is a dissapointment for those who are not. A good text to learn the insights she found living with Trich., but it is only fair to let future readers know that it is beased in Christian Fundamentalism."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"This is the first book I read on the subject of trichotillomania, and I felt as if Cheryn were talking to me personally. I cried tears of relief to know that others had this disorder, and that they shared so much in common with me. Trichotillomania is a disorder of isoaltion and secrecy. That is almost worst than the hair pulling itself. This book truly helped me to understand that I was not alone, and to know that others felt the same way and had gone through many of the same things. Cheryn is personable, sincere, compassionate and loving, and this book will reach out and touch any body who reads it."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"I bought this book a couple of years ago and it immediately gave me hope and success with my lash/brow pulling; Cheryn and I talked via email many times and she is a wonderful, caring person and it helps to have someone to talk with about this disorder. The book is a MUST for anyone suffering from trichotillomania. I cannot understand why anyone would give the book less than five stars. Buy it, read it, and read it again and again when you pull again and again."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"This book was a good reflection of trichotillomania. Cheryl was able to honestly discuss the fears and realities of trich. It has helped me see that there are others who feel the same way that I do. I would recommend this book not only to fellow hair pullers, but to their loved ones as well."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"I too, am a hairpuller. I have suffered for 27-1/2 years ALONE. After reading this book ,I was given the courage to face trichotillomania. I find that Cheryn's book is comforting to READ and Re-Read. I also realized that I am NOT ALONE, and that there are others out there, who feel the same way. Cheryn was able to put into words her feelings that have helped me greatly in my struggle with hair-pulling. Cheryn has a compassion and genuine love for all hair-pullers and is an inspiration. I HIGHLY recommend this book to any hair-puller and/or parent/loved one of a hair-puller."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"If you or someone you know suffers with trichotillomania, this book offers very helpful insights from a personal sufferer. I know this firsthand as I also have trich. While reading Cheryn's accounts of her struggles with this condition, I felt like I had found a long-lost friend, as I shared so many of the same emotional and social snags associated with it. But more than a simple account of growing up with a very trying and persistant handicap, Cheryn invites the reader to accept the condition for what it can bring sufferers in a positive light. As she explains, for those who have trich, the challenge of continually learning to accept oneself as a whole person is magnified, but this can lead to some wonderful opportunities to grow in ways that only other sufferers can know. And this leads to the most rewarding aspect -- that of being able to share your feelings and experiences with others like you. Because as Cheryn succinctly puts it, &quot;You are not alone.&quot;"},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"I only found out a couple of years ago that trichotillomania is not really a rare disorder.....I have had it for 34 years. I read Cheryn's book and I have to admit that upon reading the poem on the first page, I cried so much I couldn't read the rest of the book until the next day. It was so incredible to find out others shared my secret and Cheryn did a wonderful job of putting it into words, which must have been really hard, since none of us want to talk about it. I also think it's a great book for anyone to read because Cheryn is an inspiration!"},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"I was so anxious to receive Cheryn's book in the mail. The day I got it, I immediately started reading. I could not put it down. I felt so close to the author as I read her story. This book is great. It is sure to help many on the road to recovery and healing. I have not felt the same since I read Cheryn's story, and have to thank her and her family again for sharing their experience in dealing with Trichotillomania."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"Thanks to Cheryn's bravery to reveal her own struggle with trich and to her ability to communicate what has worked for her, many of us out there that were too scared to surface can now look at life a little less fearful.Thank you Cheryn for doing whatever it takes to help others in their struggle."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"I read Cheryn's book when I first discovered I was not the only one (about 2 years ago). It was so comforting to hear her personal struggle with trichotillomania, and I was amazed by how much of it paralleled my own life. I experienced the full range of emotions while reading-- from laughing out loud to sobbing. Knowing that I was not alone gave me the courage to go seek (and find!) the help I needed. Cheryn truly helped me to change my life. I recently had the honor of meeting her in person; she's absolutely one of the most amazing women ever!"},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"Cheryn did a fine job expressing her pain and soul searching. There have been many breakthroughs on this condition she did not mention. It is sad that her daughter suffers as well. I am a sufferer, however not with the eyelash or eyebrow symptoms. I have been pulling my hair for nearly 25 years. Off and on. More on I would have to say. I did get a new perspective on this illness. I certainly understand the shame attached to it. Her acceptance was remarkable. I felt like God was inappropriately introduced however, this is her life and her illness to battle. Whatever works."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"A must read for anyone afflicted with Trich, or for their loved ones. Cheryn Salazar's sensitive, and personal, insight into this issue offers hope and inspires towards physical and emotional recovery. She is right, you are not alone. Thanks, Cheryn, for reaching out to others with compassion regarding a topic that's been kept in the dark far too long."},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Compulsive Hair Pulling, the Enemy Within","review":"This book is geared toward the parent, relative of a trichototillomania (TTM) sufferer. It offers no greater insight than what the sufferer already knows. But for the relative/friend of a sufferer then this book is a child-like insight of what one person's experience with TTM was. I would rank this book very low due to the non-information regarding TTM that is in it."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Fussell's work is searingly honest and forthright. He treats war as the unrelieved hell it is, not from the position of those who favor war, or those who are opposed to it, but from those who are on the ground doing the fighting and the dying.And more than this, his book also addresses the corrosive influences of money, advertising, and authoritarianism that has replaced critical thought and learning in this country. We have become the Faustian culture that we were warned about half a century ago---the culture that replaces all its values of honesty, integrity, achievement, learning, for material gain that eats away at the foundations of culture. And yet we will survive; for like the lonely priests who in the year 1100 kept the ancient world alive in remote places like Ireland and Spain, thinkers and writers like Fussell are preserving culture and ideals against the onslaught of modern day Visigoths who have decamped in the courtyard. A singular achievement that is moving and provocative. Only ninnies at the Kirkus Review would be bothered by such blatant honesty."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"I'm not a literary person, I can't spell well, and I am not an infantryman. I was in the Army during the Viet Nam war, and I have a broad range on interests. I didn't choose this book, it was a gift. But it is one of the most moving books I have ever read.Fussell is a critic, and he indirectly claims that his experiences in WWII were &quot;the making of a skeptic&quot; - and maybe it was. It is fantastic to see him skewer all forms of phoneyness and cover-up - including his own. You also get the impression that he is an uncompromising and very interesting character - but not fun or easy to get along with.A real career combat infantryman I know had glanced at the book and claimed that Fussell just didn't understand Sherman's quote, &quot;War is hell&quot; and whined too much. I agreed that there was some truth to the criticism, but I got him to read the whole thing. His opinion changed dramatically for the better.O.K., it is pretty much negative, but you can see underneath all that, he loves life, infantrymen, and people who try their very best and have honor. One of the few heros in the book is Gen. Eisenhower - but he is critical of President Eisenhower. It's a complex book, and he's a complex man. Get a glimpse inside him by reading this book."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Doing Battle is an excellent book for these troubling times. Though obviously a prickly sort, Fussell his kept his critical faculties intact and properly skewers ineptitude, careerists, rationalizers, martinets, and soft-headedness. The center-piece of this autobiography is Fussell's experience as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army in France and Germany in WWII. Fussell takes aim at the military - recounting the caprices and cruel arbitrariness of his own service with a scalpel-like pen.Fussell also has little use for the beer-fueled sports culture that now dominates the American cultural landscape. He is first and foremost a defender of elitism - not an elitism based on social or economic class, but based on what and how one thinks and comports oneself in doing the tasks of daily life. Doing Battle is about honor and integrity, with Fussell having been lucky enough, or bright enough, to have had a series of teaching jobs that allowed his convictions and sense of honor and self to survive largely intact.Fussell writes beautifully and movingly. He also lays himself bare in Doing Battle. It is a rare book in that it is scholarly as well as a good, quick read. The influence of Mencken is clearly felt. You put the book down at the end regretfully. You then begin the processs of recommending it to your special friends - the ones that you think will &quot;understand.&quot;I recommend the book highly."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Since &quot;Class&quot; and &quot;The Dumbing of America&quot; are the only two of Fussell's books I've ever read, I was expecting more cranky musings of the &quot;Catch-22&quot; variety. This book both delighted and surprised me. It takes to task the revisionist history that American soldiers in WWII were intrinsically noble and motivated only by ideals. While this is a comforting notion, it is also an unlikely one. It may cause discomfort that Fussell refuses to deify the American vet of the second world war, since the &quot;goodness&quot; of that conflict is an idea embraced by our culture. The fact that incompetence and cowardice were also part of the story may not be palatable, but I'm impressed by the author's honesty in presenting his own experience. To those who take exception to some of the &quot;facts&quot; in this book, it is important to point out that this is a memoir not a history. In whatever way the author chooses to remember &quot;his&quot; war is entirely legitimate.My only objection to &quot;Doing Battle&quot; is that it seemed to be two books. I would have preferred that it end with his release from the army. While the last chapters were engaging, they were to me somewhat gratuitous. The author's adventures in academia could be a book in itself.I read it in one sitting and was sad to finish it."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"for anyone who ever experienced ground combat,regardless of conflict,this memoir by one of our most highly respected literary scholars,stands as the ultimate tribute.more than a book,it is an instructional text on how a sane and rational man who has experienced the absolute horror of armed conflict from the viewpoint of the infantry soldier,may maintain some semblance of sanity in an insane world. those of us who share that part of his backround,owe an unpayable debt to him. in a way,he has become what one of his subjects was in his earlier'the great war and modern memory'. it was wilfred owen,poet/soldier who gave us our warnings,paul fussel has done the same and we still don't quite get it."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"This is Fussell's life memoir rather than one focused solely on war-time experiences but his time in the army had a marked impact on everything that came after and the exploration of this is engrossing.Fussell served, very reluctantly, as a junior officer in F Co, 410th Infantry Regt, 103rd Infantry Division. He first sees the front in the Vosges and is stunned to find German dead who are clearly children. He is not impressed with his unit in general (it was \`lazy' and rarely dug foxholes) and more specifically with the mediocre officers who issued unimaginative orders safely far from the front line. He wasn't so fortunate himself and he very much participates in battle, being attacked by 6th SS Mountain at one point. He does succeed in inflicting loss on the enemy before in turn becoming, in his view, an almost pre-ordained casualty himself. This episode is used to commence his narrative as well as introduce his ongoing theme that war was an utterly irredeemable tragedy. It also left him with considerable guilt regarding his personal conduct on the day.To put Fussell's military element in perspective, Pearl Harbor happens on page 65. There is then the business of basic and then officer training, much of it sharply and deliciously ridiculed, with the irreverencies of soldiers highlighted. And he notes the irony that the hard training he despised, trimmed his considerable flab and made him feel physically fantastic. He is wounded on page 143 and is discharged on page 171, but with a hatred of the army so intense that he readily assisted later youths to avoid service in Vietnam. He reflects that there were many ways to be guilty in this period.With his themes established, Fussell indulges himself by flashing-back to his childhood. It is quite a privileged one too, his family is not affected by The Depression and he receives a full and extensive education. Then follows adolescence and junior college, where he recounts his enthusiasms, ROTC, dating and so on. There are a few startling things to be found here, it is a book very much for adults. There are also some extremely funny passages too and this continues throughout. Fussell is adept at identifying the ironies in life and satirises them mercilessly. Some of this is confronting though and Fussell has viewpoints that some will find awkward.Principally, Fussell loathed the army. He detested the way it treated human beings and as an extremely intelligent individual he saw ever so clearly that he himself was totally expendable. Regardless of his education, his background, his potential as a person, he was now simply fated to fight and statistically be a casualty in a war that no longer made sense. As time went on this savage cynicism develops and spreads. His politics are influenced accordingly and he grows to see other injustices and hypocrisies in American society. He was on many fronts a very angry young man.He stays angry too. When he becomes a professor of English Literature, working in a number of esteemed institutions, he finds much to be critical of. He feels confronted by the same \`institutional fraud' he encountered in the army and he rails against it. He is sometimes scorning of colleagues but he also goes on to describe himself as \\"impudent, insolent, sarcastic, and ostentatiously clever and supercilious\\". No arguments there (and it is intriguing to think what sort of person he might have been without his military service). He could easily be written off as a snob but the self depreciating humour mollifies this sufficiently for me (on the outbreak of war, \\"the Fussell family deplored having to black out the windows of the beach house.\\") His professional qualifications shine through with his prose. His vocabulary is formidable and he quotes extensively and while some points were over my head, it is a densely considered, powerfully delivered summation of his life's journey. But it is a journey that is always shadowed by the dread days of 1944-5. Fussell utterly refuses to let the \`Good War' view gentle his rage. But when he can quote its impacts on innocents, like the horrendously burned little British boy (a story that haunts me) his point is powerfully made. It is war and the damage it does to people that he hates. The way he explores this is fascinating. Fussell sees similarities between the infantry and Labor in a Socialist sense but Nazi Germany forced the war on to the world and he was one of many who just had to \`suck it up'. Yes the army and the society that produced it was imperfect. Yet people sometimes have to deal with the circumstances that confront them, not the circumstances they would prefer. He seems to ignore this and fails to sheet the responsibility to where it really belongs. Rather he rails against the organization that he participated through. It is a absorbing perspective. Perhaps he sees the first as making excuses and he sticks to his truth unflinchingly. This honesty is evident elsewhere, he is also quite hard on himself for various failings and mistakes.Interestingly, he strongly approved of the dropping of the atomic bombs (as a young officer , now with 45th Division, on his way to the Pacific for the invasion of Japan), noting caustically that those who decried this action, \`while certainly demonstrating the fineness of their moral weave' also exposed their considerable personal distance from the infantry in the front line.This is a remarkable book. It is insightful, extensive, exceedingly literate yet deliciously profane at times and as a memoir, approaches WW2 with a very different focus. Fussell has a clear point that he wants to make and he does so powerfully and relentlessly. He reveals with great clarity how the war impacted on his life and it is very valuable. As for his personal revelations of combat, these are sufficient to establish his credentials but they are less extensive than in the memoirs at the top of my list, so only three stars in that sense. Even so, his contribution to this topic is extraordinary and it is a five star book in all other respects. War can be hell in many ways and many days. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"I read DOING BATTLE over a year ago while doing research for a WWII era biography I was writing. I was looking for memoirs of wartime that would reflect the times. Fussell's book did that and more. He wrote of his early life in California and college in Pomona, then of his military experience, including the serious wounds he received as a twenty year-old infantry lieutenant. And then of his recovery in military hospitals where \\"in my loneliness I enacted a version of Frederic Henry's obsession with Catherine Barkley. I fell in love with a nurse ...\\" This went nowhere, as Fussell never even learned her name. He also talked of his distaste for another junior officer's task, that of censoring the letters of his men. He realized intuitively how insulting it was to the enlisted men, many of whom were years older than he. His account of the circumstances of his own injuries are matter-of-fact. An incoming German shell exploded right above Fussell and two other GIs.\\"Its intolerably loud metallic CLANG! did more than deafen me. It sent red-hot metal tearing into my body. One piece went into my right thigh. Another entered my back. When I got my hearing and my senses back, the first thing I did was take a deep breath to see if my lung had been penetrated. When I found it had not, I felt less panicky and, despite the indescribable pain, able to look about me.\\"The two men flanking Fussell when the shell burst were both killed, a quirky coincidence he never forgot. Besides his account of the war, Fussell continues his story through grad school at Harvard and several teaching jobs thereafter. Given my own military experiences and subsequent return to college and grad school, I found it all most interesting, including the academic intrigue and competition. Paul Fussell has examined his life carefully, and despite numerous books published and other prestigious accomplishments, he still manages to take himself with a grain of salt. His style reminds me just a bit of Andy Rooney, that old 60 Minutes guy, who, incidentally, wrote his own fine WWII memoir, MY WAR (see my review of that). Just last year, Fussell was one of the featured principals, along with his friend Sam Hynes, interviewed extensively by Ken Burns for his PBS documentary, THE WAR. Fussell has been \\"doing battle\\" in one important cause or another his whole life, for which I salute him. I enjoyed his book tremendously and recommend it highly. - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Paul Fussell is one of the more ascerbic commentators on American life today. Nowhere is he more heartfelt than in Doing Battle, his own personal memoir. Fussell concentrates on his World War II experiences, when he was wounded both physically and emotionally. The story of his journey from a rather pampered Southern California youth to a war veteran recuperating in a field hospital is a contrarian view of the experiences of at least one member of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; His life afterwards, when he served on the faculties of a number of universities and made a name for himself as a scholar and social commentator, also makes for enjoyable reading. Witty, urbane, and honest, Doing Battle is one of the great autobiographies"},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Professor Fussell's book appears to have been heavily influenced by Robert Graves' &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; - and it doesn't suffer much by comparison.

The writing is agile and apt. It is also the tale of how a young innocent becomes aware of and critical of his world. Readers should know that despite the title, more than half of the book is about the author's mental development as he seeks to become a professor of English. Some readers may enjoy the second half of the book as much as the first half."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"\\"Doing Battle: The Making Of A Skeptic\\" By Paul FussellLittle Brown And Company, Boston. 1996.An exceedingly well written biography of an intellectual of the last half of the 20th Century. Well written, as to be expected of a person with so many degrees in English. I do not think that he likes \\"vocational\\" degrees, such as engineering degrees, but I suspect that he enjoys using modern word processors that engineers have developed. However, this well written book presents the life story of person, who appears, sometimes, as an anarchist, or perhaps a nihilist, and sometimes a hypocrite, and sometimes as a loner.For example, on page 97, he describes the members of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) as very angry young men \\"...who had been luxuriating in colleges.\\" Of course, Paul Fussell had not been \\"luxuriating\\" in Pasadena where his father was building a new house while the rest of the nation was selling apples on corners during the Great Depression. While at Pasadena, he attended Pomona College, (of the Claremont Group of five colleges ... one of my daughters graduated from Scripps College), snuggled in a New England look-alike green belt in brown California. Because Paul Fussell was privileged to attend such a fancy college when most Americans did not go on to \\"Higher\\" education, the author had the opportunity to become an officer in the United States Army. From this seat of wisdom, he was able to judge the combat performance of the 29th Infantry Division, a National Guard Unit...which, in turn, prompted a reply in Joseph Balkoski's book \\"Beyond The Beachhead\\".Most of Fussell's book, \\"Doing Battle\\", deals with his career in academia. I do not think that the author was ever happy. At the beginning of his career, the author was \\"...condemned to an atmosphere of insignificance and ineffectiveness...\\" at a mere girls' school. (page 213). Interestingly enough, the comments of that famous (infamous) Senator from Wisconsin are confirmed in Fussell's book. Universities were godless places. Fussell reports that a Catholic professor was surprised to find so many atheists.Page 203: \\"...what a pederastic paradise for some graduate students Harvard had been.\\" Heidelberg was more efficient than American universities. After I finished his book, I could only think of the comment I learned in the United States Navy, \\"My heart pumps purple panther piss for him.\\""},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Based on the title, I expected this book to be completely about Fussell's WWII experiences. In fact, it's a biography. I expected to read about all sorts of horrible things, including U.S. atrocities, as a counter-point to the victory culture propaganda that I was deluged with, and believed in, as a child. That book has some of that. But Fussell is a curious fellow. He's very selective in his outrage about this and a lot more. He basically doesn't want to look at the whole picture. I think he knows he'd become a misanthrope if he did.The book has a large section on life in Pasadena, CA, in the 20's and 30's. One can tell that the cultural rot had set in well before the Baby-Boom generation came a long. We're always led to believe that the Boomers are scum and all that came before were saints. I never quite believed that, and Fussell helps here. After all, who raised the Boomers ?Fussell has peppered the book with small sexual references. The Boomers also believe they invented sex. It's clear they didn't.The net result of the book is that Fussell comes across as a complex fellow, who enjoys his dark brooding hatreds, but enjoys life as well. He seems an establishment liberal when he needs to be, but harbors substantial doubts. I don't dislike him, and I don't like him. In the end, he just seems human. That's enough."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Paul Fussell has already written two excellent books debunking the myths, selling, and romanticizing of war. This book presumably is anaccount of Fussell's experience in war (really the Army), which is good - but only about a third of the book - and how it made the man. Behind the &quot;chicken-shit&quot; does Fussell really think the war ought not to have been fought or that there was a nice way of fighting it - the whole history of war suggests not. And for those who have read his earlier books it is an unrevealing account of Fussell the person. For example he barely mentions his son - who's crazy experience as a bodybuilder were the material of the son's own book and must have touched the father is some way. His first wife appears to have had a career as a writer on food; she passes in barely a couple of pages. How much more of Fussell the person is hidden?"},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"His name must rhyme with tussle else the students he had at Connecticut College were not very good at poetry.Very important point: his own description of his book \\"Class\\" (see especially p. 280 in \\"Doing Battle\\") describes it as straight irony. \\"Except for a page or two the book is unrelentingly facetious, packed with exaggerations and palpably irresponsible assertions, and I was astonished to find how many readers took it seriously.\\" Beware of taking \\"Class\\" seriously!I have to thank Paul for a very interesting autobiography. It continues to amaze me that biography makes so much clearer than does an author's straight forward critical work. You certainly need both. But a sense of the person who writes makes what they write so much more sensible. This book is more enjoyable than some other autobiographies. Still, it leaves me in a quandary. Much that PF says strikes home but there is always a sense that PF lives within a particular narrative (by the way, he critiques those that talk in terms of narratology on pp. 212-213 \\"The all-but-universal worship of science, social science, and analytic philosophy would soon encourage the half-educated to pepper their discourse with terms like narratology, disciplinarity, engendering, and interface.\\" \\"Half-educated\\"? I have a t-shirt that says, \\"The truly educated never graduate.\\" (Of course this places me in a class.) Today there are books with titles like these and I would hardly refer to the authors as half-educated. It feels almost like C.S. Lewis in \\"Words\\" critiquing their misuse. But new words are invented all the time and come to mean things by their use. I wonder if someplace PF critiques the concept of \\"meme\\". Clearly, PF's classical education is way superior to mine. He would certainly join the defense in the war against grammar. I have a programmable thermostat that I can't figure out how to work.But I am partial myself to the narrative I suspect he follows. I was never in battle though I am retired Army. Should I try a book called \\"Doing Peace\\"? Imagine having a full career in the military without ever being in battle? Assuming I could talk about the experience would annoy PF far worse than Glenn Gray. At least Gray was within miles of such action.As an update years after reading this book and leaving the above as my review I have to point out that I appreciated Paul's participation in the special \\"The War\\" and found his experiences especially profound. It certainly made my appreciation of \\"The War\\" the greater having read his book years before and seeing the images in \\"The War\\" brings home the descriptions from his book. Thanks again Paul."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Somewhat by chance, I read this book immediately after reading Robert Graves' &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; which I had read immediately after Samuel Hynes' &quot;The Soldiers' Tale&quot;. I knew that Fussell would take inspiration from Graves but it wasn't until the end of this book that I discovered that he knows Samuel Hynes professionally.Readers looking for a contrarian view of World War II should read Fussell's Wartime, one of my favorite books. This is more of a personal autobiography which I enjoyed for what it is. As it happens I enjoy reading about blood and guts but also about Poetics, so this is (also) my cup of tea. He doesn't really get in gear until he gets into the war. He could have added a lot more detail about growing up; he has a tendency to tell what his childhood was like rather than showing us, but the stuff about the poor training of the American infantry in World War II is really informative. I also find it interesting to read what it was like to get a PhD in English at Harvard after the War, and I wish he had actually gone into more detail about this, but that's just me.I am a little surprised that he didn't add some ghost stories here and there and more references to famous people, like Prime Ministers and famous poets."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Fussell's hatred of war and the United States Army makes him state falsehoods about the Army and the men who served in the infantry. He quotes British Field Marshal Alexander on the poor quality of American infantry. Surely he knows that Allenbrooke, Montgomery and Alexander all were extremely prejudiced against their American allies. Fussell gives no dates, but Alexander was almost certainly saying that during the North Africa campaign, which was the first time Americans were in battle. The truth is that we had a lot to learn. We learned it quickly and rapidly became able to fight the Germans successfully.He states that the 28th Infantry Division was so poor that the Germans specifically chose to attack it in the Battle of the Bulge. Half truths and slander. The Ardennes was heavily forested and considered the area where Hitler was least likely to attack--which is why he chose it--and also the area were an attack was least likely to be successful because of hills forests and a poor road net, which is why Eisenhower did not worry overmuch about an attack there. Eisenhower was resting the 28th there and reinforcements to the division were getting acclimatized in a quite area. The division had fought bitter battles in the earlier advances. On the first day of the Battle of the Bulge the 28th was attacked by General der Panzertruppen Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army. What did this lousy division do when attacked by a whole friggen panzer army? It stopped them cold. The 28th took 24% casualties that first day. On the second day, the attacks were just as fierce and the 28th, weakened and low on ammunition, began to give ground. After the war Manteuffel said that he was never able to make up for that first lost day.Fussell states that all of his training was useless, (which makes it difficult to explain how we ever beat the best trained soldiers in the world, the Germans) including rifle marksmanship. It is true that area fire was more common, but many men owed their life (Including him! He once encountered three Germans and won the shootout.) to being able to shoot straight and true. There is no doubt that he (more justly) would have been just as critical of an Army that did not train infantry to shoot straight. He states that the Germans were better infantry, which is largely correct, although our best units were at least as good. The Germans had a four year head start on us and we were improving rapidly. Most historians agree that in the Battle of the Bulge, our infantry fought very well, slowing the Germans if they could not stop them. If they were as bad as Fussell makes out, we never would have gotten off the Normandy beaches. Incidentally, he states his own men were too lazy to dig foxholes. I doubt this--since the Civil War infantry has known the value of being underground. But if true, it is a terrible indictment of him as a commander who did not care enough about the lives of the men committed to his care to make them take the most elementary of battlefield safety precautions. (I can provide cites for my positive assertions, if anyone is interested.)Since writing this review I have come across two books, Closing with the Enemy by Michael D. Doubler, and The GI offensive in Europe by Peter R. Mansoor. These books describe the training of infantry, the tactical lessons learned in battle, particularly the early fighting in North Africa and Italy, and how US infantry improved quickly. I no longer think I was right to concede as I did that German troops were usually better. By the end of North Africa, US troops were just as good and much better than the British. If you have a real interest in the history of W.W. II, these are important books. I am not aware of similar coverage of tactics in any of the standard histories."},{"Title":"Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic","review":"Recently deceased Fussell is someone you would not want on your department faculty or at an academic cocktail party. Although more talented than most leftist professors he here reveals himself as anti-American, snobbish, leftist. elitist, and a thoroughly disreputable excuse for an academic.

Fortunately, the book is an excellent publication written by people who know their subject very well. As a seasoned Oracle developer, Technical Consultant with Cap Gemini, I believe this book should be compulsory reading material for novice and senior developers involved in Forms, Reports, Server and MS Help Generation. Aside from the extent of coverage to Forms generation, over 700 pages, the content was thorough, extremely practical and easy to read. I cannot comment on the reporting generation section as this is not my forte, however, with approximately 200 pages, this is more in-depth than any other publication I have encountered. The only down side is that the authors do not provide a discussion of the Web and VB Generators."},{"Title":"Oracle Designer Generation","review":"This is one of the best organized and most clearly written technical books that I have ever read. The authors clearly put a lot of effort into making a quality book. This is refreshing to find with so many IT books that are obviously written in a rush to &quot;scoop&quot; other authors.Be sure that you know what you are buying. This book spends the first few chapters laying the groundwork and describing the application generation process in general. Then they get into the details of generating Oracle applications using designer with the goal being 100% generation. If CASE methods for application generation using Oracle Designer is not what you are looking for then keep looking, that is exactly and and only what you will find in this book."},{"Title":"Oracle Designer Generation","review":"I'm 3/4 through the book and still impress with the quality of the contents.

Deadly and incredibly cunning...they were invincible. The German U-Boats of WWII were the most feared arm of Hitler's navy reaching out into the Atlantic to wreak havoc and destruction on the Allied convoys. Now a U-Boat captain who survived it all tells what it was like from the German side; the below-zero watches on the ice-encrusted bridge, the daring attacks on whole Allied convoys, the incredible escapes. Heinz Schaeffer rose from midshipman in the all powerful U-Boat fleet to captain of one lone grey wolf trying to escape the Allied Navy."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"The intro by Monsarrat contains the statement &quot;No one save a power maniac, a sadist, or a nautical romantic can hold any brief for submarine warfare. It is a repellent form of human behavior&quot;.How true. In recent years it has become popular to idolise the role of a U-Boat Captain. Whilst taking nothing from them from life within the confines of an 'iron coffin', it was one thing to match wits with a surface warship and a very definite other, to sink defenseless merchant ships without warning. That did not take courage or bravery to accomplish. This is from one who was on the receiving end of a tin fish."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"Don't miss out on this one.You have action packed history:the Gibraltar passage,underwater fuelling,snorkelling,the southern cross,three boat passages of the Biscay,command intricacies and combat,a Nicholas Monsarrat (The Cruel Sea ) introduction and a fantastic tale of escape and surrender to Argentina 3 months after the end of the war,leading to suspicion of a possible Hitler escape.A must read if you can find it.Mind you I have read many many books on U Boat war,including the 2 volumes of Hitler's U Boat war and Operation Drumbeat.Contrary to those history books this one gets you down in the sub.Hold your breath and dive."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"I have finished it few days ago.I respect the point of view of the other readers, but without try to idolize the U-boat's captains, they were an incredible self control, strong and courage fullfilled persons.This book reveals some scenes that will be hard to find in other books. The attack with deph charges and the feeling that the writer reflects in the book it's very real, as if you would have been there.The chapter of the trip to Cape Verde islan's and the fun that they found there tells you that they were persons like probably you and me are, but under a very unpleasant and very demanding circumstances.The last part about days and the personal events of the captain after the war need, as someone says above, more paragraphs.Well friends, try to get a copy and read it. To me it's one of the best in this subject."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"I must admit that I have never heard of this story before. I heard about a U-boat leaving the Baltic Sea at about the time Hitler killed himself, but the story about the U-977 is amazing. Not only did she break the blockade, but surrendered to the Argentines in August of 1945. This boat had little fuel, but some provisions, and an understrenght crew. The author relates his own training in this book and then details this amazing journey.This is a nice little true story about World War II. It reads like a novel, but the author relates this is all true. It is a different story than one usually finds about WWII."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"I read the 1957 reprint of 1952 edition. Paperback. No translator is mentioned and this gives the impression that the book might have been written in English by Schaeffer himself. But reader remains in doubt.Monsarrat's introduction (is he also the translator??) is out of place and unprofessional. We are trying to look at things from German point of view and this guy finds it an occasion to give us another dose of the victor's usual ramblings.The book finishes leaving the reader in want of a few more paragraphs of information on author's life after war, but all that's given a couple of sentences. I wished there were later books by Schaeffer one could read but as far as I know this is the only one he wrote.Like a true soldier, he stays silent about hisNazi feelings instead of lying about it. But the affairabout the Brazilian ship is still doubtful. He reallycould have sunk it."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"The book starts out with Heinz's years in early Nazi Germany. And then he is off to the Germnan Kreigsmarine and then the Grey Wolves. After a few years as a watch keeper he is given the command of a Type VIIC on May 2nd 1945. After the surrender of Germany he takes his boat from Norway all the way to Argentina all for the price of freedom."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"This gripping narrative by U-boat crewman and later commander lets readers feel as if they are aboard the ship. Heinz Shaeffer (1921-1979) describes the intensive training he endured in the war's early days. We learn about squeezing into a U-boat's close quarters, breathing fumes, wearing oil-soaked clothing, and eating canned provisions. We follow the sub as it hunts Allied merchant and war ships in the North Atlantic, learning about combat and tactics - most attacks were done on the surface at night. We also experience the terror of sitting trapped 100 fathoms (600 feet) under the surface as British and American destroyers drop depth charges exploding ever closer. As the war progressed, Allied planes became the U-boats' most deadly peril - Shaeffer admits losing many comrades (U-boat crews suffered enormous casualty rates). The author participated in many actions, avoiding blockades, sailing thru the North Sea, Bay of Biscay, and Gibraltar (where they barely escaped destruction). Later, he commanded a U-boat equipped with a snorkel that allowed it to remain underwater for much longer. When Nazi Germany surrendered in May, 1945, commander Shaeffer and his crew fled in their U-boat to Argentina (where they were interned anyway), spurring rumors that Hitler had been aboard.This book is a gripping wartime narrative told from the Nazi side, by a prideful sailor who felt no remorse about having served a horrid, murderous cause. Such an attitude is hardly unexpected, but still rather disgusting."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"This book, unlike so many others on U-Boats, does not discuss overall strategy or numbers or technology or any other the history of the u-boats in terms of their overall impact on the second world war. Instead it provides the history of one single individual, Heinz Schaeffer (the author of the book), aboard u-boats, from the beginning of the war until almost three months after its end and from the perspective of his many roles, from seaman and leitenut through captain of his own boat.The author starts out his autobiography from his childhood and what influenced his decision to enter the Kreigsmarine, his love of the sea and sailing the small boat that his father gave him as a gift while a teenager. Then he discusses how he went through cadet training, served on a small surface craft in 1940 and then went on to U-Boat school and then served as an officer early in the war. Eventually he went on to take command of his own boat towards the end of the war.As stated earlier, the author does not discuss, except in a very ancillory manner, technologies, tactics, strategy and equipment. Instead he provides a very personal view of the war from his own individual eyes but eyes that, neverthelss, capture what every u-boat man must have seen, heard and felt. He provides an overview of not only the moments of death defying fear and how it felt (i.e., while being depth charged with lights breaking all about him) but also the monotony of daily life aboard u-boats (i.e., the constant dampness and mold, the taste of crusty bread, the grueling mechanical work that had to be done replacing engine parts). This picture is well done and provides the reader of an excellent picture that brings one down into the boat with the author. He provides a picture of war not, in his word's \\"of marching bands and blaring music\\" and glory but of the day to day struggle to survive (and a struggle it was as about three quarters of the boats commisioned and their crews were sunk). With respect to the struggle he provides numerous stories how, by sheer luck alone and against overwhelming odds, the boats he served on survived. He provides stories of how, one time as the craft was being attacked by two aircraft its captain manages to shoot down both attackers. He describes how, another time, a hatch could not close as a destroyer was bearing down on them but how, again against overwhelming odds, they managed to destroy it before it destroyed them. He discusses how he, like nearly all his colleagues, was not driven by ideological zeal but, instead, only by a sense of duty to one's country and to his fellow crewmen.This book is a must read for anyone interested in knowing what life aboard these crafts was like. It provides a far more complete picture than Hollywood films such as \\"Das Boot\\"."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"This was first published in English in 1952 amid great controversy. Nicholas Monsarrat, author of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" and veteran of service in anti-submarine corvettes wrote a double-edged sword of an introduction - rubbishing the claims of the recently beaten Germans that \\"they didn't know what was going on in Nazi Germany\\" but acknowledging that Schaeffer had written an excellent, and at that point unique account of the training, missions and lives of the U-boot crews.The book is fascinating, far from politically correct in the modern sense, and a window into the lives of the young German sailors who took on the Atlantic and the allied navies and air forces. Their efforts to strangle the economy of Britain and later to stop the supply of materiel to American and Russian forces were doomed to failure. They were overwhelmed by the superior economy and production skills of America, and rapidly lost out in the technological battles of radar, underwater ordnance and communications security.At the end of the war Schaeffer was in command of U-977 and rather than surrender to the Americans or British, he and what was left of his crew decided to make for Argentina. The trip included an astonishing period of sixty-six days under water, evading allied navies by means of using the newly fitted schnorkel - at the time a very uncomfortable and unpleasant experience for the crew as the submarine was frequently filled with diesel fumes and there was constantly changing air pressure in the boat as the snort valves opened and shut. They finally sailed into Mar del Plata on the 17th August 1945, more than three months after the end of the war in Europe.It was this voyage that prompted many tabloid media to claim Hitler, Eva Brown and Bormann had escaped from Germany on U-977. Schaeffer and his crew were interrogated by the Argentineans, Americans and British until even the most paranoid investigator was convinced that there was no basis for the story. Not quite four stars."},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"This is the personal account of Lieutenant-Commander Heinz Schaefer, commander of U-977. He begins his recollection of his years in the German Kriegsmarine (Navy) before his enlistment and eventual commissioning, describing his apprenticeship aboard a cadet schooner in his youth. He gives an interesting account of the training he recieved as an officer-candidate, with much time spent in rigorous drill aboard a Navy clipper-ship in the Baltic Sea...in winter! Mr. Schaefer tells us of his selection into the elite submarine service, and subsequent missions in the north Atlantic.However, he and his crew would gain far more fame for his notorious escape from allied internment, being one of 2 Submarine crews who crossed the Atlantic Ocean to seek asylum in Argentina. His submarine travelled submerged for a record 104 days, unheard of endurance for any submarine in that era, even the well-crafted Type 7 and Type 9 U-Boats. Upon arrival in Argentina, a full 3 months after the war in Europe was ended, his crew was extradited to the United States and interrogated, having been suspected of smuggling [...]This is one of the best accounts from an insider's point of view in the Wehrmacht. Schaefer gives us insight into the naval aspects of the war, such as the attempts to make submarines less vulnerable to air-attack, and even mentions the advent of the Type 21 U-Boat, which was the mother of all modern submarine technology. The German submarine service very nearly won the war for their side, using the vessels they had at hand. If the Type 21 had been built in large numbers from the beginning (as well as many other high-technology weapons that Germany produced), history would have been altered!"},{"Title":"U-boat 977","review":"I read the 1957 reprint of 1952 edition.

I NEEDED it to be ~~ and it wasn't. I eagerly read every single piece and there was not one monologue appropriate for or worthy of a serious adult actor or actress, no matter what his or her level of experience. These might be &quot;okay&quot; for introducing high school students to drama. But with all due respect to Pierce and Onorato, as an acting teacher as well as performer, writer, and director, I just couldn't justify asking a student of ANY age to chose to commit to any of this material over the works of some of our great - and even not-so-great - playwrites."},{"Title":"Killer Monologues","review":"This book has some good monologues in it, but its mainly a technique training book.

He doesn't know the first thing about acting, monologues, or the auditioning process. First of all, take a monologue from a PLAY, not something some hack wrote. ANd if you do take a stand-alone monologue that someone wrote, make sure it's good. These are HORRIBLE! They're cheesy, hackneyed, uninteresting, melodramatic and general. Also, you CANNOT use stand-up comedy routines as a monologue!!! No, no no no no! Acting teachers across the world--the universe--would cringe at the things he tells you.I've seen the video, too. Here are some additional tips:1. a \\"prop\\" is not a person, especially not a person lying down on the stage. You shouldn't really use props in a monologue unless it's really simple, but even then. You also can't do a monologue to someone when you audition, though it's a good way to practice.2. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE WORDS! While it's helpful to paraphrase a monologue in the rehearsal process, you cannot--absolutely CANNOT--change the words of the playwright. You can cut them, yes, but you can't just make it up.3. \\"Just making 'em laugh\\" is NOT an acceptable strategy!Okay, I could go on, but basically, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

His thesis is that all knowledge is either tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge. One important corollary of his ideas is that there is room for God in a scientific world. In a way, I think a 2.5 hour program of interviews and features about Polanyi's thoughts and life seems a little dragged out, especially to develope an idea that is innate to many. But, it's an interesting kaleidoscope that challenges the conventional view of the world in which many leave no room for the supernatural."},{"Title":"The wrong set,: And other stories","review":"I recently read in the TLS that Angus Wilson had been forgotten; well not by me.

Snobbery is rampant in these stories, and he is able to detect it in the nuances of the slightest exchanges. It is perilous to be a character to be a character in a Wilson story.

This story, however, seems quite far fetched and a little too romanticized.I was thrilled to find this book at first because I thought it would be a perfect supplement to the other books I've read on the Mongol empire and Ghenghis Khan. But I found it to have very little to do with the other stories I've read nor any other historical accounts. I eventually lost interest as I was reading.It is, however, a very good story, if you care nothing about actual historical events."},{"Title":"The Snow Warrior","review":"\\"Snow Warrior\\" is the story of Subotai an orphaned Mongol that rises up to be the right hand of the great Ghengis Khan. Tomes have been written about Tumajin (Ghengis Khan) but almost nothing about the mysterious Subotai; the man that lead much of the Khan's armies into incredible victories.Subotai's story begins with the young orphan surviving the harsh plains and the even harsher treatment that an orphan might face in a fiercely nomadic society. As a teen, the Mongol sees a young blond haired girl that becomes his lifetime quest to meet and marry. The quest leads him to become a trapper of birds, a trader, a guardsman, a father and husband, a student of Indian Martial arts and philosphy and finally the Right hand of great Khan.Few books have it all. But \\"snow Warrior\\" comes very close. It has action and humor but more importantly it shows the great Spiritual quest that all true humans must undertake.IF yo can find a copy of this book get it...you won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Snow Warrior","review":"This book about Subotai Bahadur, greatest general of Genghis Khan, is absolutely stunning. I was lucky to find a copy of it and read it several times. I loaned it to someone a few years ago and am desperately searching for another one. That should tell you how much I liked it. A great book of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"Well crafted girl detective novel with a unique twist. Beautiful, sexy, former parapsychologist with extrasensory gifts and a private investigator's license is hired by, of all improbable people, a hunk of a California cop. Tom McGowan has a gut feeling that the death of a bright, young law student is not the tragic, but routine traffic accident it seems. PI Elizabeth Chase combines detective work with psychic insights to find out whodunit. Author Lawrence's talent is to make you care about her characters while holding your interest with plot twists. Certainly hope this is just the first of many Dr. Elizabeth Chase mysteries.P.S. If you find a first hardcover edition of this first Dr. Elizabeth Chase novel, hold on to it. It'll be worth big bucks soon."},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"Martha C. Lawrence's &quot;Murder in Scorpio&quot; is the best first novel I've read in years. The novel's heroine, Dr. Elizabeth Chase, Investigator/Parapsycholgist, is not only strong-willed and intelligent, but made vulnerable by having (legitimate) psychic abilities which allow her to sense and feel the sensations, emotions and motivation of both victims and perpetrators of crime. &quot;Murder in Scorpio&quot; is a very interesting read. (I stayed up all night and read the whole book without putting it down!) Since, I've really taken Ms. Lawrence's sleuth to heart and have read her next book:&quot; Cold Heart of Capricorn&quot; (chillingly good!). I'm now waiting for her third Elizabeth Chase tale to make its way to the printed page. Martha C. Lawrence (a Sister in Crime author) was nominated for the Agatha, Anthony Bouchercon and Edgar literary awards for &quot;Murder in Scorpio&quot; - winning the Edgar for Best First novel. Well deserved! For a cozy night in front of the fireplace curled up with a great book, &quot;Murder in Scorpio&quot; is a winner. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"Enter Elixabeth Chase a sort of Physic Detective, hired by Cop Tom McGowan to investigate the death of Janice Freeman a one time crush of Tom's.

Was her death an accident or was it premeditated? this is what Elizabeth is hired to find out. We are introduced to quite a range of characters from Alan Katz Janice's Ex boyfriend to Pia who runs a bikini shop.

Her characters are believable and the plot winds and twists to a memorable conclusion. But don't start this one until you have plenty of free time, you don't be able to put it down! She has handled the primary character, Dr. Elizabeth Chase, who has psychic premonitions, very well. It is done within a realistic and plausible plot. Well done, Martha!"},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I am new to mysteries and found this one to be compelling, but I was turned off somewhat by her writing styled. It seemed more like a teen-age romance novel in some ways, especially in some of the description. However, I am anxious to read her second attempt to see if the writing has improved. I think she has great potential."},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"Martha Lawrence has introduced a fascinating new female private detective in Elizabeth Chase, parapsychologist. Elizabeth is fresh, funny, and psychic. Although I was afraid, before starting the &quot;Murder in Scorpio,&quot; that it would focus too heavily on New Age themes, the novel actually focused on good old-fashioned detective work, with parapsychology just one of the tools Elizabeth Chase uses to catch the bad guys. The book is witty and romantic without being cloying. As soon as I finished &quot;Murder in Scorpio,&quot; I wanted to immediately start on the next book featuring Elizabeth Chase, &quot;The Cold Heart of Capricorn.&quot"},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","review":"Easy to see why this book has multiple award nominations. Here you have rollercoaster pacing and a protagonist to warm to. Don't be put off by the astrology and the auras. Parapsychologist Elizabeth Chase has visions, sees auras, gets hunches and feelings. But she's practical enough to know she doesn't get it right all the time. Chase is willing to use any talent and capability she had to solve the mystery brought to her by Tom McGowan, an experienced cop. Stymied, he's looking for any help he can get to put to rest his unease over the accidental death of a friend. Turns out the accident isn't. This one is taut, well-written, carefully edited, a fine first effort, whether you care about such phenomena or not. And the developing relationship between Chase and McGowan forms effective counterpoint to the screaming menace. Intricately plotted, this one will keep you guessing to the end. And the final scene is absolutely and perfectly right on"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I must preface by saying that this is the firs of Ms. Kenyon's works I've read; I picked up a free copy at a convention for kicks, and it turned out to be just about what I expected: the literary equivalent of a Twinkie with sprinkles; good fun, but not much quality.The characters and plot are predictable, even for someone who's not read any of her other works--will the fiery redhead manage to melt the icy, wounded heart of the uptight nobleman and introduce him to his wild side (or at least hers)? Will he struggle with great confustion over his attraction to her? Will her family hating him cause friction, but eventually be resolved so they can be together? Anyone familiar with books and stock plots in general and a high school education could have written this. The style gave me a headache; I believe it has been described elsewhere as \\"choppy,\\" and that's accurate. The characters just seem to jump around from one action and thought to another without much apparent prompting, leaving \\"meaningful\\" moments feeling flat. It seemed, to me, like the kind of thing you might get from a high-schooler writing vampire fanfiction.However, this was clearly not intended to be a great work of literature; it was intended to be a fun-filled, action-packed romp through an erotic fantasy world, with more throbbing cocks than a chicken coop sitting on a subwoofer. And that it is. It's a light, quick read that does entertain. In short, even though the crafting made me cringe, I did enjoy it. And while I won't be rushing out to buy the next one, I'd consider picking it up second-hand, or borrowing it."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"To all those fallowing the Dark Hunter series, I would have to say that this is by far one of the most rivoting books yet. I sat up until three in the morning to finish this one book and could hardly hold back the tears as I finished it. Once again Ms. Kenyon does her books justic. \\"Sieze the Night\\" dulves even deeper into the lives of not only her Dark Hunter characters but also shares more about Acheron, Artemis and a few others.Taken from the views of Tabitha and Valerius, this book shows just how important families and friendship really are. And while Ms. Kenyon dazzels us with more sexy DH scense, she also shows a man who, through time tried to help those in need and could never quite succeed. Valerius is a strong character, and while at first my dislike of his character in the other books made me cautious about this one, Kenyon shows just how any one person can really be good. Ms. Kenyon is truely a spectacular writer as she shows just how everyone can be blinded by the truth of events. Acheron, whos knowledge and wisdom knows no bonds proclaims in her novel, \\"There are always three sides to every memory __. Yours, theirs and the truth which is somewhere in between the two.\\" I believe that that one statement will stay with me throughout the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Can't miss with Sherrilyn Kenyon, she's the best!

I was looking forward to reading the story of my favorite wacky Deveraux girl but feel cheated, namely because of the characters from former books who can't leave the past alone and the horrible tragedy that befalls one of my beloved men.The story goes: Tabitha Deveraux, twin of Amanda from 'Night Pleasures,' is a self-made vampire hunter, delightfully eccentric but still tough. She stabs Valerius-- a Roman DH whom everyone hates because, well, he's Roman-- takes him back to her house to heal... and they fight, they misunderstand each other, yet they find one another appealing. I do like the relationship between Val and Tab, but there are so many mundane details that fill up the story that I begin to forget that this is supposed to be a kick-butt romance and start putting the book down to clear my head. Then some former threat from the past sneaks up, but all the while Tab and Val make out and fight with other Hunters because they hate Val's guts for something he didn't even do. I GET IT ALREADY! THEY HATE HIM! CAN WE PLEASE MOVE ON?!?!And Nick... WHY?!?!? I was so heartbroken for him, and then what happens to him later on is so darn evil that I cry. I must admit that Ms. Kenyon did a good job with that part, even if it was infuriating.

More than one beloved character will parish before the end, however, there is hope for the future and in someone who hasn't fully realized their own powers who might eventually be the key to unlocking the secret of everything.

Valerius \\"Val\\" Magnus isn't a popular Dark-Hunter, he's a Roman, which means that the largely Greek Hunters have a major grudge hatred against him. He is also very conscious of his \\"background and breeding\\" making him even harder to stand as he acts as if he is above everyone else.Tabitha \\"Tabby\\" Devereaux is a self taught vampire hunter. She hunts at night and runs an adult store in New Orleans during the day. She is sexy, sassy, takes no **** from anyone and immediately attracted to Valarius. This leads to conflicts in her family as her twin sister is married to a former Greek Dark-Hunter.As Tabby and Val's love grows so does the danger they are in. One of the vampires that has a powerful grudge against Tabby and those around her resurfaces with the object to destroy Tabby's extended family as well as her.In this story you will also see the death of 2 Dark-Hunters as well as the birth on one.I was thoroughly blown away by this book. Kenyon continues to write better and better as the storyline goes on. Usually in a series I start to get a bit bored or can easily figure out what will happen next. These stories are so well put together I never even foresaw who the new Dark-Hunter would be until it happened. I was shocked. It is not all books that make me laugh out loud as well as cry. I read it in one setting and this one is going on my shelf of keepers. They best in the series to date!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I really thought it would be hard for Ms Kenyon to write a better DH novel than DANCE WITH THE DEVIL, however I was wrong. This is a delight to read. Still a Dark Hunter novel it also has a great story of humanity and compassion.Tabitha Devereaux is the twin sister of Amanda, who saved and married Kyrian, in the book PLEASURES OF THE NIGHT. Tabitha is an empath, her psychic abilities attract the daimons. She was attacked at the age of 13, when Talon saved her she found out about the Dark Hunters and has become friends with many of them including Ash and Simi.Valerius Magnus is the brother of Zarak from DANCE WITH THE DEVIL he is hated not only by Zarak but all of the other Dark Hunters and squires. Because of the brutality of the Romans none of them are liked. The Greeks esspecially hate them.While Valerius has held to his cold harsh facade for the last 2000 years, he can't fool Tabitha. She can feel his emotions and the lonely emptyness he carries within him. Rather than being cold and unfeeling he is sensitive and caring. However, nobody else seems to care about him. And now Desiderious is searching for a body for his spirit to occupy. He will not be happy until he has his revenge on Kyrian and his whole family which now includes Tabitha's family.Kyrian has always hated that the grandson of the man who crucified him was also a DH. Tabitha encounters Valerius Magnus while on her hunt for daimons. Unfortunately she stabs him thinking he is a daimon during a heated battle in a dark alley. Helping Valerius leads Tabitha into deep waters with her family. And falling in love with him is the very last thing she needs to do, now that the bloody battle has begun. Sometimes forgiveness is the only way to go, when daimons call hopefully Dark Hunters will answer."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Valerius Magnus was the son of an Ancient Roman Senator and a successful General until he traded his soul to become a Dark-Hunter. Centuries later he still hunts vampires, but remains alone as his peers are Greeks who hold a bias that has led to an unfriendly rivalry just because he is a Roman.In New Orleans, mortal Tabitha Devereaux represents a new breed of vampire hunter who has proven her worth without bartering her soul. Val meets her while she battles the undead. She stabs him during the melee so afterward she takes him home. Tabitha realizes that his haughty aloofness is a front to hide his hurt and fear of rejection; she plans to peel away his armor. However, as she sets in motion her plan a dangerous vampire surfaces with a powerful grudge from his previous life; his objective is to destroy Tabitha's extended family, which forces two Dark Hunters to either end their feud or watch their loved ones die.The latest Dark Hunter tale is one of the best tales this terrific series has to offer as the exciting story line contains plenty of action, deep characterizations (including the return of the stars of NIGHT PLEASURES) that provide additional light on the origins of the good guys, and a strong romance. Val is an interesting protagonist because though almost two thousand years have passed since his change over he remains an aristocrat deep into his soul, which makes the earthly Tabitha his total opposite except when it comes to hunting vampires. Readers will embrace the darkness of the Kenyon night seeking other works in this pleasurable series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I couldn't decide as I read the first half; \\"do I love it or am I slightly disappointed?\\"I couldn't decide as I read the last if I should laugh or cry.The hero is a man we've been made to dislike in previous novels but in this we find Valerius is a lonely man desperate for love and comfort, the most touching of the Dhs actually. The heroine is a wacky background character who becomes so fleshed out I'd swear Tabitha is real, and I probably know her.The other DHs come back and there's a touching moment when Kyrian, the only now mortal DH explains to Ash the horrid reality of having high cholestoral and knowing he is mortal.Ms. Kenyon could be the first romance novelist to ever make her previous heroes have moments of childish stupidity that make them all the more endearing for not being perfect.I was at first disappointed because the villain of the first novel, who's now dead, comes back to be the villain of this novel, but Ms. Kenyon is so creative with it I bought into it completely. She introduces new twist in the world of SPathi warriors.This novel is her best to date in the series. Past characters become more solid and realistic, things happen you won't believe. Reading this on the train the last 1/3rd kept me gasping until the lady in the seat next to me thought I was having a heart attack.The end peters out but has interested me more than any generic \\"happily ever after\\" ending. We see two people dealing with immortality and mortality much more realistically than ever before. You want to weep for them it's so grabbing.All in all, the best part is we see much more insight into Acheron which only makes me desperately need to know when his novel is coming out!DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon has really taken the world by storm with her Dark Hunter series. Continually, she manages to inject a new dose of humor and intrigue.Seize the Night is just another example of great, humourous writing from an author who is fast becoming one of the best.This latest contribution to the DH saga is about Valerius, the Dark Hunter who you may remember from previous books. If you thought you wouldn't want to read about the pompous, former Roman general...then you better think again. Kenyon really introduces this tragic hero in a great fashion. His pysche and character pull you in right from the start.While out on patrol, Valerius runs afoul of Tabitha Devereaux, the cheeky, human Daimon hunter. At first, he doesn't know what to make of this totally unconventional woman. She is wierd, has strange friends, and is the sister-in-law to his mortal enemy. So, why in the world is he falling in love with her?Kenyon makes this story very appealing with the addition of some new characters, the creation of a new Dark Hunter and...best of all...some very revealing tid bits about Ash, the leader of the Dark Hunters.I read the entire book in one sitting, and I just cracked it open for the second time. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.Buy Seize the Night! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Valerius is a one-man-Dark Hunter, an Immortal who works to make this world a better place by killing daimons. Nobody likes him, not even the man who is assigned to be his squire. He was executed by his family back in Rome and tends to believe anyone he helps is cursed by him. He's reserved--snobbish, for someone who's lived in this world since the Roman Empire. And still in love with a woman he couldn't have before he died.Tabitha owns a sex shop named Pandora's Box on Bourbon Street in New Orleans which caters to transvestites. Though she's not a Dark Hunter by blood, she 'moonlights' kicking daimon [...]. She's part of a large family in more than one sense of the word: she has seven sisters and she's also part of gay 'family.' Just about everyone knows her on the street and despite her eccentricity, she's well liked.They met by accident when daimons attacked Tabitha and Valerius tried to save her life---only to get stabbed by Tabitha as an accidental fate. They're definitely not likely partners, but they have a strong attraction. When Valerius realizes Tabitha and her twin sister who's married to his enemy, are in danger, he has to help.The book is witty, interesting. Kenyon's characters are well-realized and her world is one I would want to visit again.\\"Seize the Night\\" would have gotten 5 stars from me save for two flaws. First, the threat to Tablitha and her sister was not apparent until page 127. True, I was enjoying myself seeing Valerius and Tabitha's relationship unfold, but the novel is billed as a romantic thriller and the thriller part was getting neglected.Second, Kenyon switches point of view so quickly sometimes it's tough to catch whether it's Tabitha or Valerius thinking. You get used to the switches after a few pages, but the style is distracting if you are not used to it."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have read every book in the Dark-Hunter series and prior to reading \\"Seize the Night\\", my favorite story was Zarek's in \\"Dance With The Devil\\". I thought no one could be more tortured than poor Zarek. Wrong!I was captivated by Valerius almost immediately! Gone were the black leather pants and the gothic/punk attire replaced by turtlenecks, slacks and style. Wow! What a breath of fresh air! Not saying I mind a hot bod clad in tight leather but...it was a nice change. *grinThis man was sooo sensitive. Sensitive without being wimpy, mind you. I just wanted to cuddle him. And he was such a gentleman, in my opinion. I was pissed at how he was treated by everyone around him, including his fellow Dark-Hunters. However, I was very impressed by the fact that Artemis didn't bestow any extra powers on her Roman Dark-Hunters. That pretty much told me that Valerius was one bad mo-fo to have fought off Daimons for centuries using only his strength and skill. What a man!What infuriated me, yet managed to touch me was the fact that Valerius never stood up for himself. He silently took all that was dished out to him without raising his voice or a hand in his own defense. And when I read about his upbringing at the hands of his cruel father...man, I broke down and cried like a baby. *sniffleTabitha was also a very likeable heroine. In fact, she is my favorite so far. Very down-to-earth with quite a few eccentricites, she was my kinda gal.Darker than most of the other books in this series, I'd have to say hands-down, this was by far the best!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have enjoyed the other books in this series so much that I bought this book the day it came out and then stayed up all night reading it. I loved it! Val and Tabitha are excellent characters and the themes running through their developing relationship are universal and well developed. I also applaud Ms. Kenyon's development of Ash. With every book he becomes more three dimensional and we better understand the staggering burden he carries. How bold of the author to show that actions have consequences that not even a \\"god\\" can undo and that things said/done in anger can not be taken back.The author is getting better and better with each book in the series. She takes real chances with her characters, resists the urge to vear into \\"preciousness\\" with the dialoge and with every book deepens the Dark-Hunter world and the rules governing it."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Tabitha Devereaux is a self-taught Daimon hunter. Valerius Magnus was a Roman general, whose soul now belongs to the goddess Artemis - he is a Dark-Hunter, an undead who patrols the Earth to protect its inhabitants from the Daimons. He is also an incurable stick-in-the-mud!And to make matters worse, there's also bad blood between Valerius's family and that of Tabitha's brother-in-law - bad blood that goes back some 2,000 years! So, when Tabitha and Valerius suddenly find themselves thrown together, sparks are bound to fly. But, before you know it, each finds in the other a certain something, a certain something that they have needed for a long time.This is an excellent book. I liked the story of the book, which was exciting, and kept me on the edge of my seat. Personally, I thought it read quite well. Even better than the exciting story of gods and demons and vampires is the chemistry between Val and Tabby. I really liked the way their love unfolded and grew as the story progressed. Plus, the sex was hot, Hot, HOT!!I loved this book, and think that you will too!(Review of Seize the Night by Sherrilyn Kenyon)"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"For those of you who have been living in the Dark Ages, or perhaps under a rock, and haven't a clue of Ms. Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, there are a few vocabulary terms you must become familiar with before reading this review.Dark-Hunter: Dark-Hunters are created from ancient warriors-but not just any warrior-only those who have been wronged and are dying, due to an act of treachery and betrayal. At this time, Artemis approaches the dying warrior and offers them a pact-a one-time Act of Vengeance against the party who has wronged them. These soulless beings, neither Apollites, Daimons, nor humans, are the only thing that stands between humanity and the creatures who seek to destroy them.Apollites & Daimons: Apollites are direct descendants of the god Apollo, who has the unfortunate luck of being cursed when they killed his twenty-seven year old mistress, Ryssa, and child. Even worse, Apollites are forced to die a horrible, painful death over a twenty-four hour period when they are twenty-seven themselvs. Daimons, of course, are the unearthly creatures that Apollites transform into during their twenty-seventh birthday celebration.Now that you have the basic downs, you can fully enjoy SEIZE THE NIGHT. The latest in Ms. Kenyon's series, this book centers around Valerius Magnus, the good-looking, quick-tempered Dark-Hunter who had the good fortune of being born to a Roman Senator, serving as a Roman General, and conquering cities throughout the countries, too numerous to name. He's also the poor, unfortunate soul who has the bad misfortune of being betrayed, losing the woman he loves, and becomes a soulless Dark-Hunter.I could say that Valerius doesn't play well with others, but that would be an understatement! He refuses to embrace those who once rejected him, and he's not quite sure how he ended up in New Orleans, staked by one Tabitha Devereaux, a woman who somehow happens to be almost as proficient at hunting and destroying Daimons as he is. But, alas, the gods aren't happy enough just to force Val into working with the Dark-Hunters he has tried to avoid at all costs-instead, fate has decided that his mortal enemy should be married to Tabitha's twin sister. He'd probably laugh, but he lost that ability sometime around 160 BC.I love this series. Actually, I love every book that Ms. Kenyon writes. But with SEIZE THE NIGHT, she's managed to capture the true emotion of Valerius's pain, his betrayal, and his resolve to stay emotionally uninvolved with Tabitha. Tabitha herself is no humble society debutante-she's worked for years to put her psychic talents to good use, by protecting those she loves, and her city from the destruction of the inhuman beings who wish to destroy it.However, this time, an evil force is determined to destroy everything that Tabitha holds dear, and if it can take Valerius down in the process, so much the better. The storyline is non-stop action, the heat and emotion between Val and Tabitha is kept at a perfect pitch. Once again, the Dark-Hunters reign supreme-or do they? There's only one way to find out, and that's by picking up your very own copy of SEIZE THE NIGHT."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Hello,I personally love Sherrilyn Kenyon and will read most anything with her name on it. However, this novel gets bogged down with setups for future novels and loses focus (or me) in the last fourth of the book. I like that Tabitha was more of a \\"real\\" person instead of the caricature she was in Night Pleasures. At first I didn't want to read Valerius' novel due to the animosity the other characters felt with him. Good read. Couldn't put it down. Still love Night Pleasures and Fantasy Lover the best of all."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have read all the dark hunter novels and my only complaint is that it takes SOOOOOOOOO long in between publication of the books. I need more sooner then every six months.Well, all the DH books are awesome. This one is too. This story blew me away. See, you never really know what to expect because of all the ways these stories can branch off and who is in them and what elements the book is going to have depending on the characters. Weather they are Dark Hunters, Were Hunters or Dream Hunters. What they were back in their time, you just never know. Apolite or animal, the possibilities are endless.In this book we have Valerius, the Roman mortal enemy of Kyran, and Tabitha who's twin is married to Kyran. We have met both these characters in past books, but we really get to know them in this book. There was such a deep look into these two that I almost could not stand it. It goes down into you and does unbelievable things. Valerius is a great hero. One of the best from this series. Maybe because you hear about him and his family through the whole series and then this book knocks everything you thought out the window and you understand so much to the point that it almost hurts. It changes everything that the characters opinions made you think. Valerius's story touched me deeply. Only Zarek came close in his story. I really enjoyed this book. It was one ringer after another. Nick, Tia, Then Desi coming back to finish what he started in Talons story, and then some. What the daimons did was sure a surprise. I cried more then once. This book has twists and turn that you never see coming. It is an unbelievable story and this series is one of the best that I have EVER read. This book was moving, funny, deep and a great addition to the series. Sieze the Night also opens more doors in the dark hunter world and tells more of its secrets. You learn alot in this book this is definetly a surprise. I had chills the whole time I was reading this book. There is not enough to say and not enough words to explain it. It falls into its own unexplainable category where its so good, only there are no words to say how good. I hope the series goes and goes. Its got a while in it, you can tell, with how many options the author has because of all the different elements. I cant wait for the next book and will probally go over this one one more time. I read it in a day and want to make sure I did not miss even ONE thing. This book is one of the best in the series, definetly shocked the **** out of me. One thing, the very end could have been better, it was almost anit-climatic, but after what just happened in the story, I might not have been able to handle it. Yep, its that good people. Better then you could ever imagine."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn did it again. This book was read in 4 hrs.

Amanda's twin sister, Tabitha, is the heroine in this story and a sassy character she is! She meets Dark-hunter, Valerius while out fighting Daimons and from that point forward they are nearly inseparable. The hero and heroine truly show that opposites attract. There is a good romance, but the action and suspense parts of this book are even better. There is a lot of new information about Ash and some resolution of past conflict. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I read this in one sitting. I was grateful I got it on a day off.

But what happend to Kenyon's newest book 'Seize the Night'? Akward syntactics stopped the flow of the novel, and the story line also has akward connectiions between the characters. This book gives me the feeling that it is someone else's work and not Kenyon's. I gave 'Seize the Night' only 2 stars because it just does not have the same quality that is found in the earlier Dark Hunter novels.

This book seems less rushed than the last few stories, though it still feels like the writer is just mailing it in. Perhaps she's simply created too complex a universe, with too many characters to fully explain or do justice to. I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers who mention that these books feel hurried. Please Ms Kenyon, S L O W down with this series. I'd love to read everything in this series (especially Acheron's story) but not if it feels this half-hearted. I'd love to see the same quality of writing that I enjoyed in Night Pleasures. Not the same stereotypes, predictability and repetition rehashed over and over."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I admit to being partial to 'Fantasy Lover' and 'Night Pleasures'. It just went downhill from there.I was hoping with all my heart 'Seize the Night' will have the bite back, and it looked promissing... for the first few chapters.Afterwards... it lost the charm, the frivolty, the romance, and the action. It made me wanna cry with frustration.MILD SPOILER:What was that Acheron thing, anyway? Hello? Twilight Zone to the max!And passing around immortality like candy. Just plain nasty!No, ms. Kenyon has definitelly lost what she had at the beginning of this series. I suggest she finds it and pronto!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Dark Hunter series and am a huge Sherrilyn Kenyon/Kinley MacGregor fan but this novel did not quite live up to my expectations. The beginning was very good but by the time i had read about 2/3 of the way through the book, I began to feel like Ms. Kenyon had not quite figured out how to resolve the story but was being urged to finish the book by her publisher. Relationships were not resolved with her usual thoroughness, parts were left unexplained and the whole \\"birth of a new Dark Hunter\\" part was so rushed that it seemed a bit ridiculous. I expected the same quality as I have read in her previous books and this one did not deliver. I know that Ms. Kenyon was setting us up for things to come in this series but too many new concepts were introduced and not explained. Sorry to say because I do indeed love this series. Here's hoping the next one is better!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This book has so many \\"twists and turns,\\" I couldn't put it down. I literally read it overnight.

Still, it was a great read!!!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"She almost pulls it together. I was glad to see Valerius and TAbitha hook up, but he was just another wounded soldier. I really dislike Otto and how could she do that to Nick?I think it was just thrown together.

The more I read about Ash (& there was alot in this book) the more I want his story. I hope it will be coming soon. The main characters Valerius and Tabitha were great.

She uses the same story line and can make each book better than the last. I too thought it would be hard for her to beat the wonderful story of Zarek, but she did very well in writing and keeping up the suspense in this story of Valerius.Valerius is hated by just about everyone for something that his ancestors did hundreds of years ago. Talk about holding a grudge! Tabitha Devereaux, whom we met earlier in previous books sees Valerius for the sensitive being he is and helps him come out of his shell, all the while helping other people forgive the past.If you haven't read any of the Dark Hunter series then your missing out.

And with Tabitha, love is SO not in the cards. She's entirely too busy kicking Daemon butt. Nevertheless, when she manages to stab a dark-hunter instead of a soul-sucker she's left with the challenge of nursing him back to health. Unfortunately, the unconscious DH happens to be her brother-in-law's biggest enemy and as handsome as they come.Valerius is a regal and proud Roman General and completely unprepared for a woman like Tabby. She is ill-mannered, improper, and human--therefore totally off limits. But her stunningly sexy and courageous defiance makes his blood heat and his body stand at attention.It's true that when opposites attract things can get wickedly hot!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I was surpised to discover just how much I enjoyed this latest installment of the Dark-Hunter series. I am so use to authors losing their touch as they continue a series, but after reading Kiss of the Night (featuring the shapeshifters) and now this one, I'm practically on my edge of the seat waiting for the next.Kenyon managed to keep the action coming throughout the novel and the romance (mostly sex) followed as a second. I'm so tired of reading paranormal romances that are almost all sex and no plot. Kenyon is a refreshing alternative.In this enstallment, Tabatha, a real human vampire slayer, encounters Valerius, a Dark-Hunter, while defeating a band of Daimons. During the fight she mistakes him for a Daimon and stabs him. When he doesn't go up in a poof of smoke, she realizes her mistake and calls her friend Nick to help transport the Night Hunter to saftey. Being an empath allows Tabatha to feel Valerius true emotions below his stuffy, condicending(spelling?) facade. Valerius is taken aback by her outspoking, carefree, and sexy ways.Meanwhile, Amanda, Tabatha's twin sister, is having nightmares of her and Kyrians death (bloody death). Ash practically puts New Orleans under lock-down because of the dreams and the Damions are attacking full force.It was difficult putting this one down. Kyrian threw me. I liked him in the book when he and Amanda fell in love, but his character was a real prick in this one. Maybe I just felt really sorry for Valerius. Goes to show how well Kenyon got the reader to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"tis is the best book in the series...their love story is dark yet so sweettis is one ball kicking heroineiwas surprisingly hooked onto it from start to finishi read the whole book in jus 6 hrspls read tis book...its definirely worth yr money"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Being a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter paranormal romance series, I couldn't wait to read the seventh book in the series, SEIZE THE NIGHT, which is about former Roman general Valerius and vampire hunter, Tabitha Devereaux. Unfortunately, SIZE THE NIGHT was not as satisfying as past Dark-Hunter novels, mostly because the writing was rushed and the end anti-climactic.First, let me just say that I loved the first half of the book, which concentrated on Valerius and Tabitha getting to know each other. Valerius was fascinating because, unlike previous Dark-Hunter heroes, he is a starchy, conservative aristocrat who would NOT be caught dead wearing leather or riding a motorcycle. Rather, he wears Armani, has impeccable manners, and is an elitist snob. He is also hated by everybody for crimes he did not commit. His exact opposite is Tabitha, a quirky, whimsical gothic chick who owns a sex shop and is rather temperamental. But she is also kind and compassionate, and knows exactly how to melt Valerius' cold exterior. You can easily see why they are such a good couple: Valerius doesn't think Tabitha's various passions in life are crazy or lost causes, while Tabitha gives him the love and companionship he's always craved but never had.The second-half of the book was a letdown. Here's why:1) The story became rushed and convoluted, throwing in tons of secondary characters at nonstop speed and involving too many unresolved subplots, many of which relied on issues brought up in past Dark-Hunter novels (but without the benefit of reminding us what happened with one or two lines of clarifying back-story). I for one had no idea why the bad guy felt the need to attack two particular women in the story, for no explanation was ever given. Also, the explanation as to why the goddess needed her victim was too vague. I'm sure the author was being secretive for the sake of the next book(s) in the series; for me, however, I thought it was annoying because it didn't make any logical sense.2) Although I love Acheron, I thought it was a little silly that he started bestowing \\"immortality\\" status to characters whenever he wanted. It seemed too much of a cop-out. As if the author couldn't think of a better resolution.3) The ending was anti-climatic for a couple reasons. First, the author told us what was happening, rather than showed us. Second, the final confrontation was more like a footnote in the story than a real ending. Third, the prologue was ridiculously short and didn't make much sense, mostly because the author didn't explain what had happened between Val and Tabby to set them off. I honestly didn't know why she bothered to include a prologue.So, my overall thoughts on SEIZE THE NIGHT is this: I'd read it, but only because it is part of the series and hints at events to come. I wouldn't read it without reading the first six books, which include FANTASY LOVER, NIGHT PLEASURES, NIGHT EMBRACE, DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (my favorite), KISS OF THE NIGHT, and NIGHT PLAY. It's not one of the better books, plot-wise, but I liked both Valerius and Tabitha as characters, and they alone make the book worth reading."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Personally, I prefer \\"Dance with The Devil\\", Zarek's book, but this novel is also quite good. This story is basicallyabout Zarek's brother, Valerius Magnus and Tabitha Devereaux. This series follows a typical storyline that goeslike this: 1) Bad Dark Hunter meets trouble 2) Meets pretty girl 3) Dark Hunter actually has a haunted past. Heturns 'good' after falling in love with heroine. 4) Happy ever after~ It's best if readers read the book inchronological order [unless you're good at piecing bits of a story together-like me :) ] 'cause several/all thesidekicks appear in other books. the villains tend to be recycled a bit in the later book though... seems that theclimax of the series is at hand. Undoubtly, Ash will stand at the heart of the puzzle (I have several suspicionsabout his true identity at the moment... Seems he's somehow related to Apollymi) Anyway,Val and Tabitha metplenty of opposition from her family ('cause he's a Roman and her brother-in-law's a Greek!) and there's a Daimonhot on the Devereaux family's heel. (Unfortunately, this is linked to Marissa-daughter of Amanda and Kyrian, andtherefore linked to Ash) This is one major impt book in this series and has plenty of action and the romance herehas been somewhat tamed down (still~This IS a romance book)."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Valerius. In life, a Roman general, part of a hated breed and member of a family despised and feared. In immortality, a Dark-Hunter hated by the rest of his kind. His family murdered Julian and Kyrian, first betraying Kyrian sickeningly. His father brutalised and murdered Zarek, Valerius's own brother. Valerius himself is cold, imperious and disapproving of others. Is it any wonder he's hated?Tabitha, a human vampire-hunter, has more reasons than most to loathe Valerius on sight. After all, her twin sister Amanda is married to Kyrian of Thrace. And, indeed, two seconds after meeting Valerius she stabs him through the heart. But he is a Dark-Hunter and, regardless of her personal feelings, that makes him an ally, even if one she'd rather not have. So she takes him home to bandage him up and see him back on his feet... his very attractive feet. For, even as she knows she should cut him dead, she thinks he's the sexiest, most attractive man she's ever met. Even as they argue, even as he shows her how much he disapproves of her, the two of them realise that they find each other irresistible.But it's not as simple as that. How can it be? There's Tabitha's family to think about, plus over two thousand years of conditioning on Valerius's part, training him never to care about anyone, never to get involved. After all, nobody has ever cared about him, so why risk rejection? Plus, any time he did try to help someone - Zarek, his family's slave Agrippina, others - he ended up hurting them. Sometimes killing them. He can't possibly take that risk with Tabitha, even if she does seem to be the only person he's ever known who actually *likes* him.But they don't have a choice about getting involved with each other. For Daimons are on the march, more dangerous than ever. One in particular wants revenge on Tabitha and her sister and is determined to kill them all. Acheron is worried and instructs Valerius to protect Tabitha, while he himself protects Kyrian, Amanda and their daughter - after all, Kyrian is mortal now. However, some evils appear to be too great for even Ash to handle... or are they?Yet another tortured hero in this book, which I adore. What's even better, though, is that we get to find out more about Ash. In particular, we learn what I'd been guessing at: he's no simple Dark-Hunter, even if he was once a mortal. I won't spoil the exact nature of that revelation; read it for yourself. There's also a fascinating development regarding Nick the Squire, which again you'll have to read for yourself. In all, a gripping, exciting and very satisfying Dark-Hunter novel, and Kenyon is still keeping me hooked on the series. Can't wait for Acheron's own story, coming when, Kenyon??wmr-uk"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"All the other reviews give you the run down of the story so I won't go into that again. But what I will say is that this one is another keeper. The more SK writes the better she gets.I love that we saw all our beloved friends from past books and that it felt like it was natural, not like she was forcing the meeting to allow us a glimpse of our favorites. But because of this new reader to SK might get confussed by the every growing list of Characters that spring up.I do believe that you can read this book on its own but personally I would read them in order. Reading Kyrian's book first NIGHT PLEASURES is a must to understand the animosity between Kyrian and Valerius without feeling like Kyrian is just a jerk. (Whom I love of course)Not to mention the fact that our Herione and Kyrian are in-laws because Tabitha's twin sister is married to Kyrian.Tabitha and Valerius might be opposites but they definately attract. Tabitha is proably the strongest of the heroines to date and she would need to be for the battles that SK had instore for her and Valerius.I was interested to see how SK would make a Dark Hunter that had been portrayed in such a way that the reader would hate him in the precious books into a hero we would love. LET ME TELL YOU SHE SUCCEEDED.In this book there is also a lot of set up for up coming novels.

It's not something you can really help since you're existing in the perspective of the other characters. Since they hate him, it rubs off on you. That's why i wasn't too thrilled about reading his story. But as soon as I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I love \\"Val\\"! He's nothing that I expected him to be. Ms. Kenyon is a genius.

I'm not quite up to the \\"I'd read her even if she published a phonebook\\" level, but somewhat close to that. When I picked this book up I was estatic that I was going to get to read about Valerius. I was happy with the book yet there was just one part of it that made me sort of roll my eyes. It's sorta spoilerish, so non-spoiler wanting people beware.This volume of the DH saga surrounds the beautiful and chilly Valerius, a character that was despised by most of the other DH out there (especially Kyrian & Zarek). Enter the spunky Tabby- a daimon hunter with a sarcastic bent & a fiery temper to match. It doesn't take long for these two to knock heads, even as a greater fight & tragedy is unfolding in the background...I really enjoyed this book even though one part of it did make me a little sad. (No spoilers about this. You just have to read it to discover what it is.) In fact, I enjoyed all of the book with one exception. At the end Valerius becomes more powerful than he was before & is still immortal. It was a nice touch, but I have to say that every book seems to end with the main characters becoming immortal or powerful. Whatever happened to just having the characters become human & live out a life where they grow old & die? It's a little hackneyed, but I enjoy Kenyon's work so much that I'm willing to put up with it.

Waiting impatiently for her next book."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This book was a very short, but a delicious Dark Hunter book. Val is uptight and doesn't know how to relax and Tabitha can't wait to get him out of his element. And does she! With that aspect only being part of the story, the other part is her family dealing with Val, this is truly one of the better Dark Hunter stories. Oh, and a very dark turn for Squire Nick in this book, I can't believe it! One book closer to Acheron."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Seize the Night is the epitome of what an action/romance book should be about. For a female writer, Mrs. Kenyon does a wonderful job writing out detailed, dramatic, and exciting fighting scenes which would entertain even the most diehard martial arts flick fan. The romance between Tabitha and Val does a nice job of blending aspects of real relationships with those magical serendipitous moments in a fairy tale story. Each and every major character in the novel is either a physical male or female version of Adonis or Eve; despite this they all have a unique and fleshed out personalities which happen to combine well with each other to form a story that makes it hard for someone to put down the popcorn and walk away from. One of the strongest aspects of Seize the Night is that even though the book is part seven in the series, it is a great jumping point into the world of the Dark Hunters. There are many characters in the novel, but as reader who has never picked up any of the other stories in the series, I was able to jump right into the story without missing a beat. This book was thoroughly entertaining and hard to put down. Seize the Night along with 1984, The Picture of Dorian Grey, and the Dresden File series (I know weird list) are the books that brought me back to reading.I had the privilege of meeting and being introduced to Sherrilyn Kenyon and her Dark Hunter novel series at the 2008 NYC Comic Con. Mrs. Kenyon was kind enough to provide fans a free copy of Seize the Night and personally sign it as well. She is a woman with a charming southern accent and uses a vernacular which is quiet refreshing to the Yankees who reside in the Northeast. I have yet to read any of her other books but secretly wished her well when her latest book Acheron hit the shelves this past summer. Thank you Sherrilyn for helping to re-introduce the joys of reading books back to someone."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Tumultous and tempting, this book is an adventure in action and passion. Our beloved characters are forced into one of the most dangerous encounters in this series. Some hard decisions are made and the overall plot of the series is well developed. This is also a wonderful stand-alone book. Tabitha and Valerius are complex, well-developed characters that draw you into their lives and the story. From laughter to tears this is an excellent book for exciting reading."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Another nice addition to the Dark-Hunter series, with a very intriguing hero in Valerius. We have been conditioned to dislike him throughout the other DH books, so it was neat to see the good side of him and understand why Tabitha could fall for him. This one gets 4 stars instead of 5 because they fell into bed a bit faster than I like, but it is still a worthwhile read. \\"Dance With the Devil\\" is still my favorite of the bunch, so if you haven't read that one yet, check it out next."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Just when you think Sherrilyn can't surprise you anymore, she pulls something else out of her hat for us to reel over!!! All I can say is 'WOW' another winner!! I love all of her books, so I am slightly biased, but this one was a real page turner, especially towards the end. I was pretty intrigued by the idea of a story about Tabbitha since she has been such a huge presence in past books. There is no way to forget that girl and her Vampire slaying ways. I recomend this book highly, as usual!!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"These books would be better if the author actually remembered what she had previously written and therefore did not contradict herself.For example: on page 339 of \\"Dance with the Devil\\" she described Archeron thus: \\"His long blonde hair flowed around his shoulders\\".On page 8 of \\"Seize the Night\\" however she says that Archeron \\"......wore his long black hair loose and flowing around his shoulders\\".On page 242 of \\"Dance with the Devil\\" the author says \\"Zarek stripped his own clothes off\\" and yet just one page later on 243 she says: \\"Zarek moved away from her only long enough to remove his clothes\\".This kind of sloppy writing detracts and distracts from some rather unusual ideas that deserve either a) a writer of more discipline or b) proof-readers who knows what they are doing.The other thing that detracts from what would be interesting stories is the insistance that all her primary male and female characters seem to suffer from a severe sex addiction and the inability to control it to the point where it interferes with the flow of the story.On top of that the sex scenes are so repetitve that having read a couple of them, the reader is free skip forward a couple of pages in any and all of the books to pass over the \\"seeing stars\\" and \\"hissing\\" with passion bits.It's a shame because the basic themes are interesting....the above instances are distractions from what should be good stories."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I loved the book. I know it is kind of dark, but then most of her books are and of course her heroes are all extremely tortured. I've learned to live with this. However, this book did have a particularly large number of characters die. I just love HEA's for all my characters as well. No dying, dying is bad!Her newest Dark Hunter, Valerius (Val), is so misunderstood. He's really a great man with lots of compassion for others, but he just gets so abused by his own relatives who are such evil people and get wrongly judged by his family's actions. Of course his brothers does the ultimate betrayal oneday, rapes & kills the woman he loves and then eventually tortures & kills him. Good thing, Tabby the vampire slayer meets up with him oneday and becomes the love of his life. They are really one hot couple and the author's love scenes are getting better & better with each new Dark Hunter book.What made this book really good for me was what Arch did for Kyrian. It always bothered me every Dark Hunter got a big bonus except for Kyrian and the bonus being immortal. I hope Sherrilyn makes every hero/heroine immortal from now on! And what a surprise Arch turned out to be huh! A god! I guess I should have known, since he zips up & down from the heavens so much whenever he wants.His brother Zarak is such a bad boy? He's even worst now that he is a god. But I thought is was great what he did for Val at the end during the wedding banquet (gave him immortality as a wedding present). What a great ending!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"The ending did seem somewhat thrown together (SPOILER HERE) what with Acheron deciding to grant immortal status to a couple of his friends (what he never had friends in the last 11,000 years?) which was mighty convenient, and then the whole thing with the \\"new\\" Dark Hunter and Acheron not realizing that even with his god status, he had cursed him. That said I liked the twist with Valerius and Tabby's empathic ability to see his pain. It's also always nice to see familiar faces too. I'm really hoping that the series can continue to be fun, without resorting to the pointless sex (as opposed to really great, plot driven sex) and lack of tension (sudden abilities to overcome anything by last minute \\"I didn't know I could do that!\\" powers) that is occurring with other formerly great series."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"There are few things more exciting than a Dark-Hunter novel. I figured Kenyon owes me big for the complete disaster that was Night Play, which many fans loved for having an overweight heroine (completely ignoring the fact that the only thing that keeps Bride from conforming completely to the ugly stereotype of overwight people as unhappy, socially inept losers is her lack of intreset in Star Trek). I will admit that when the couple from Night Play made a cameo I blanched, but fortunately Tabitha is a complete 180 from Bride and a very fun and refreshing character.I really enjoyed the relationship between Tabitha Deveraux, the vampire hunting twin sister of Amanda, and Dark-Hunter Valerius Magnus. I think the evolution of the relationship is probably the most skillfully done one that has appeared in this series. There is actually that getting-to-know-you thing going on before they start lusting after each other like there is no tomorrow. Tabitha was a real surprise. She maybe a bit flighty and eccentric, but she is very loyal and surprisingly well-read. The thing I like best about her is that even though she has a scar on her face from a past scurmish with a daimon, she doesn't spend the entire novel obsessing over it. Valerius is equally entertaing. A bit stuffy and snobbish, Valerius is Tabitha's exact opposite and its very fun to watch how their personalities play off one another.While I absolutely loved the main romance, I found the plot a bit of a mess. Apparently, Desiderius, the evil super-daimon from the first novel, is kinda back from the dead and looking for a body. The Spathi Daimons want to kidnap Kyrian and Amanda's psychic uber-baby, and Apollymi the Destroyer wants out of her prison. Somehow it all ties in together, but I just could not follow it. Not to mention I thought bringing back an old Big Nasty back from the dead was rather cheap as well as deus ex machina-ing immortality on all the main characters past and present in the story. However, Kenyon really shows that the war against the daimons is escalating into something big as bad things (including death) are allowed to happen to some of the characters we've gotten to know. I also thought that Zerek acted really out of character at the end of this novel. When he last appeared in Kiss of the Night and in earlier parts of this book, love hadn't mellowed Zerek out that much as he was still bad-tempered and surly. I can't believe that he would just give up his grudge against Valerius so easily and suddenly start acting like everything was hugs and kisses.I also wish that Kenyon hadn't made everyone so over-the-top nasty to Valerius. I guess I can understand why the Greek Dark-Hunters and their friends and family would have such a deep prejudice towards him and Romans in general, but I find it hard to believe that they could make all the others, many of whom were born a long time after Rome callapsed, hate him too. The way Kyrian (who isn't presented in a flattering light in this book) talks you'd think that Valerius was a cruel butcher, completely ignoring the fact he himself was a conqueror and is most certainly not innocent of the very same things he accuses Valerius of. Kenyon also needs to learn how to make her characters deliver barbs and insults better, because (and this is something I noticed in all of her novels) the person making the insult always sounds really immature, like a elementary schooler on the playground.It might seem like I've picked apart of the flaws of this novel, but even though I think they are some really big ones, the good points are strong enough to make this an exceptional read. As this book seems almost like a prelude to bigger things, I'm sure the plot will settle down and be fleshed out better in later novels. Seize the Night fully redeems Sherrilyn Kenyon in my eyes from the awful Night Play and has restored my excitement and hope of the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I am just a little embarrassed to like the Dark-Hunter series. It's incredibly derivative (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Anne Rice). Some of the \\"breezy\\" dialogue is awkward and unconvincing. And the story lines are fairly similar in each one: you have a gorgeous tormented hero with a tormented past (and I mean *really* tormented...crucifixions, starvation, pretty much any horrible thing imaginable)and the heroine who saves him. Not to mention fairly arbitrary, \\"deus ex machina\\" plot twists.But, I love the books. I like the magical elements, the sex scenes are plentiful and couldn't be better, but most of all, you know, I just really FEEL for those heroes.Valerius is as tormented as they get. Even the other tormented heroes of books past don't like him! Luckily, he meets up with Tabitha, who may be Kenyon's best heroine to date. She's unconventional, kind, brave, sometimes blundering, tacky, and unabashedly sexy. For Valerius, who is a former Roman general with a rigid and formal exterior, she's absolutely perfect.**MILD SPOILER**The plot twist with Nick was kind of a shocker, but I thought it was satisfyingly dramatic. Some elements of the ending were verrrry sloppy, but hey. Seize the Night, like all the Dark-Hunter novels, was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"And Valarius is the small woodland creature she bowls over. Ugghh! The story started out with promise, but I really didn't like the way Val kept caving in to Tabby's psycho whims. I hated what the author did to Kyrian in this book! He was cold and harsh where Val is the compassionate Dark-Hunter. Not if you read Night Pleasures! The author also changes the rules a bit. Artimis grants each Dark-Hunter one single act of vengance in return for his/her soul, but lo and behold, Kyrian apparantly recieved two! SK- please don't change the game on us part way through!The best part was the advancment of Ash's story."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon is one of the best... Love her Dark-Hunter books. I really like that the characters keep coming back so you see how their relationships progress past their story. In this one Tabitha and Valerius are just great together. The interaction with Amanda, Kyrian and Julian and how their relationships with Valerius evolve. And the way Zarek keeps getting back at Valerius is funny, and the way Ash fixes is is just as great... The one big shocker is Nick (and I'm not spoiling that, you have to read the book)."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I didn't much like the first book I tried, Night Play, by Kenyon, but everyone raved about this one being the best ever, so I gave it a shot. Nope.Too much deux et machina. All problems are far too easily and magically resolved, making it impossible for this reader to become seriously captured by the unfolding story. Life and death mean little in this book.Romantic development is...sorta nonexistent. No slowly developing intimacy and trust here. Tabby falls for Val fast -- not sure why the sudden attraction -- and begins to seduce him in her kitchen within the first 24 hours. Val falls for Tabby when he first meets her, during a street fight against daemons.Bottom line: I liked it enough to finish it. I chuckled at some of Simi's antics. The sex was hot. Instant relationship development, contrived at times, a silly plot. Story reads like a comic book. This series is wildly popular, so I'm in the minority.------- SPOILERS BELOW ------Too much deux et machina. Example: Everyone dies, murder and mayhem, etc. We're sad, bawling buckets. Oh, no, wait!! Have no fear, Ash is here to wave his magic around and make it all right. Another example: One character is immortal. Then mortal. Oops, we don't want him to die! Oh, heck, let's feed him ambrosia -- instant god!Valerius is a dark-hunter, a \\"good\\" vampire 2000 years dead. Because of the vile atrocities his grandfather visited upon Kieryan, an immortal Greek general who also became a dark-hunter, everyone in the New Orleans paranormal community thoroughly hates him. Even those who have never met him. They gang up on him, bully him, mock him publicly, throw dirty water on his head, etc. Cruel. Petty. As if they are in middle school. So, I could not admire these characters (Otto and Nick, especially).Furthermore, their hatred made no logical sense, and thus seemed contrived, since it happened 2000 years ago and Valerius DIDN'T DO IT, as they all knew. Kenyon created all this improbable conflict -- all this immature and unaccountable hostility -- just so Tabitha could be the first one to love poor pitiful Val, the first to fully accept him, and stand up for him. Spare me.But still, some parts were good."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I know I usually have positive things to say about the books I order and I sound repetitive, but I can't help but stress how happy I am with my purchases! I am a librarian and so receiving books that arrive promptly and in mint condition is the greatest thing ever. Happy with my purchase!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this novel. I loved Tabitha and Valerius as a couple, but the romance between them started out a bit silly: Tabitha stabs a hot vampire, so she drags him home then jumps in his lap and starts making out with him the first night... Okay, I would have done that in a heartbeat, but in this novel it seemed to come out of nowhere -particularly since Tabitha spent most of chapter 1 fantasizing about another guy (Archeron). It made Tabitha seem merely horny, rather than falling in love.The way the other characters treated Valerius didn't make any sense. He was not a part of the bad things his family did 2 thousand years ago, and even proved himself to be a kind and benevolent general in Britain, yet everyone still hated him because of something his grandfather did when Valerius was 5 years old. Only one character was actually affected by the incident, but everyone else decided to hate him too and have been harassing him like school bullies ever since.Finally, after losing family members and dozens of innocent citizens, Archeron appears out of nowhere and makes his best friends immortal. Seriously? If he knew they were targets since page 1, why didn't he make them immortal back then?I understand people LOVE this series. It was a fun and exciting read with beloved characters recycled from Sherrilyn Kenyon's other novels, but there were too many obvious plot holes to give this novel 5 stars."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogValerius Magnus is the most hated Dark Hunter. He holds the fact that he is Roman very close to his heart, yet that is the very reason why most of the Dark Hunters hate him. Kyrian, Julian, Nick and even Otto, Valerius' squire openly ostracizes Valerius because of his father's actions. It seems that every good deed that Val commits, it is thrown back into his face. Kyrian especially has a reason to hate the ground that Valerius walks on, but Valerius is still a man of noble blood. He doesn't let this extreme revulsion to him set him apart from the Dark Hunters or keep him from killing Daimons. I loved how misunderstood he was. I wondered how Kenyon would redeem such a character, but she does a stellar job of it.Tabitha Devereaux, kickass vampire slayer and sex shop owner has her life in check. Everything seems to be going well for her until one mistake with a slip of her hand leaves one of the strongest Dark Hunters seriously injured. Talk about a big oopsie!With the help of Nick, Tabitha gets Valerius to her home where she is able to care for him until he is better. But she needs to keep his presence a secret because if her sister found out that she was caring for and harboring her husband's archenemy in her home, trouble will surely arise. As she cares for Valerius, she sees him at his most vulnerable and suddenly realizes that the face of an arrogant Roman he prances around with is simply a facade that hides a vulnerable and tortured man.I loved - and I mean LOVED - Valerius and Tabitha together. The funny thing about them is that they don't seem like they would mesh well together. Tabitha is feisty, a thrill to be around while Valerius is contained and a bit of a prude. But when they are together, it's as if they were made for each other. Every moment is fun and romantic. I absolutely adored them together. I also loved the fact that Tabitha stands up to those who hate Valerius. You don't often see this on romance. It's usually the hero who is doing this, so it was refreshing to see a woman who is strong enough to stand up for her man.Towards the end, Kenyon really plays with your emotions. Major events happen and it really made an already great book into a fantastic one! I got really sucked into the world that Kenyon has built and I don't think there are any signs of me leaving."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon rules!So much happens in this extremely excellent and entertaining book, \\"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7\\".

The world that Sherrilyn Kenyon creates is amazingly rich in detail and totally enthralling.This story about Valerius Magnus is heart wrenching and totally wonderful.

There are many hints throughout this book that set us up for interesting story lines to come. The pacing is excellent and the descriptions are exciting, steamy and fun. I love this book and recommend it to anyone who loves an exciting Paranormal world that is so fascinatingly different from our own. This book and all the \\"Dark Hunter\\" books can take you on a journey in the mind that is simply breathtaking!Read \\"Seize the Night\\", and all the \\"Dark Hunter\\" and \\"Dream Hunter\\" books and have a great time!I did and still do every time I pick one up to re-enter the world of the \\"Dark Hunter's\\"!

Also, the \\"Dream Hunter\\" books are great. I haven't read all of her books, but I must say she is a great writer."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Gosh darn it I just love these books. Sure they may be super cheesy at times and most of the time the endings are completely unbelievable. But even so, Sherrilyn Kenyon just knows how to write a fantastic paranormal romance. She just does. Heroes (and heroines) you can easily love, lots of action, a conflict that's actually interesting, and steaminess too hot to hold. It's all there.In this one we have Valerius and Tabitha. Poor sweet, unwanted and shunned Valerius. Like his brother Zarek, he's definitely not very popular among the Dark-Hunters. I don't know what it is about the tortured reject bad boys. But I love them the mostest. When we first meet Val in the previous books he seems pretty cold and stand-offish. But as we get to know him through Tabitha's eyes he just makes your heart melt. He's such a sweetheart and he's never had a chance to really embrace that side of himself. This is what awesome PNRs are made of people. Tortured heroes who are gradually expelled from their shell by a worthy woman. Does it get any better? I think not.As for Tabitha. Loved this chick. She's awesome. Strong, kind, funny, and teasingly adorable. Poor Val didn't stand a chance against her. He was bound to fall fast and hard. Hell, even I did. Although I have surprisingly liked most of the Dark-Hunter females thus far, Tabitha is probably my favorite. Of course, I'm sure that'll change with every new book I read in this series. But even so. That's what I love about these books too. Sometimes heroines can be hit or miss in PNRs. Sometimes they're too whiny and insecure or on the opposite end of the spectrum, too full of themselves. But Kenyon knows just the right mixture and she does it perfectly.But what made this book more special from the other Dark-Hunter novels so far is the action. To me this one just seemed more fast-paced than the others were. Don't get me wrong, once we get down to the conflict in any of these novels, it's pretty good. But in this one I just felt more on the edge of my seat. Some of the things that happened in this one...Wowzers. Can't wait to see what comes of some of it. Of course a few pretty unbelievable eye-roll-worthy things happened at the end. But I was still happy for them anyways.Overall, this is just a fun series and I'm having so much fun reading it. I'm actually kind of glad that I've been pacing myself with this series too because I still have so much more to look forward to. Also whenever I read another new PNR that I'm not a big fan of, this one reminds me that I'm still a PNR fan, but not all writers have the good stuff when it comes to this genre. I don't think the really good PNR authors get enough credit sometimes. It takes a special blend to get it just right, and the Dark-Hunter series by the lovely Sherrilyn Kenyon definitely has the recipe down pat."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Valerious is one of the most hated Dark Hunters in New Orleans. He's from a high born Roman family, one of which was the man who crucified Kyrian Thrace. Kyrian has been holding a serious grudge against Valerious for over 2000 years. Tabitha Devereaux, the twin of Kyrian's wife, comes to the aid of Valerious after a Daimon fight where Tabitha does some damage of her own. Tabitha has been hunting Daimons, the soul sucking vampires, since she was 13 years old so she is very familiar with the dark hunters and their leader, Acheron. As Valerious is forced to stay at Tabitha's after their night with the Daimons, he is surprised to find himself rather intrigued with her. With his aristocratic background he knows he should find everything about Tabitha appalling, from her language to the way she acts, but he finds himself truly mesmerized by her. She's sexy, gutsy, sassy, wisecracking and has a huge heart. When they find out that Desiderious is back and attacking Tabitha and her family, she looks to Valerious for someone to lean on. He is forced to help the man that despises him and at the same time put his life in the hands of another. Will Valerious finally be able to warm that steely heart of his and let someone in?It's no wonder Sherrilyn Kenyon has come out with so many Dark Hunter books, they are a great read. I was hesitant to start this series initially with over 20 books in it but I'm glad I did. There's so much going on in this series and I love that she gives us little teasers about Acheron and some of the other characters through out each of the books as well.There's so much going on in this book in addition to the romance between Val and Tabitha. Desidirious, who we thought was dead, is back. There are several deaths and the birth of a new Dark Hunter as well. The main storyline going on through out the series is getting better and better as we get to know everyone better. I'm so intrigued with Acheron and I'm glad that we are finally getting some more insight into his background. I was rather worried about him in this book. I didn't have any idea where this story was going, definitely full of action and suspense. The new Dark Hunter... wow, didn't see that coming. There was also a lot of humor with Seize the Night as well between Val and Tabitha. They have totally opposite personalities and it made for an interesting dynamic between them. All of the dark hunters from the previous books were back in this one. This was one of my favorites in the series. I've loved all of the dark hunters but this story just had a lot going on and we found out so much about all of the characters in this one. Sherrilyn Kenyon continues to amaze me with her suspenseful storyline and great romance.[...]"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Every time I read her books I can't believe how gifted she is. She's wonderful, my favorite writer. The book is delightful"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"In the Greco-Roman era, there lived a man of regal birth, supreme Roman general who led his army into several victories. And bearing the same name as that of his grandfather's, his name struck fear and hate. Yet their name was the only common thing they shared; for while his grandfather was one of the cruelest men who ever lived in that era, Valerius Marcus possessed a kind heart, something that no one really knew. And it was that kindness that led to the murder of the only woman he ever loved, and ultimately his own in the hands of his own family who thought him weak and unworthy. And with that act of betrayal came the birth of another Dark-Hunter, a league of soldiers sent out by the goddess Artemis to save the world.Two thousand years later and we see Valerius in New Orleans, still alone and guilt-ridden for the death of Agrippina. But if he thought that the Fates have completely abandoned him, he's in for a big shock, one in the form of a vampire-slaying woman - Tabitha Deveraux. And if there were two people who couldn't be more different than night and day, they are they.When Valerius stumbles into a fight between Tabitha and several Daimons, he tries to help her but ends up hurt. And although Tabitha knows that Valerius is her brother-in-law Kyrian's mortal enemy, she feels honor-bound to save him. And there starts the problem for them. Unused to kindness from anyone including his fellow Dark-Hunters, Valerius couldn't come to grips with Tabitha's kindness. He is also surprised to find himself fascinated with what he considers as the strangest woman ever born, what with her tackiness, brazenness and seeming lack of fear. As for Tabitha, she is shocked to find that Valerius seems totally different from what she's heard about him. And being an empath, she knows and feels that there is something more to him, and it does show in his tenderness towards her. But with her growing attraction to him comes the guilt that she's betraying her family. Well, as they say, love conquers all. And what a delicious way to conquer everything!SEIZE THE NIGHT is another exciting read from the highly imaginative Dark-Hunter series. It was good to finally read Valerius's story and find out the truth about him. When I first read of him in NIGHT EMBRACE, I absolutely hated him because of what I thought he did to Kyrian, so I was glad to find out that he was innocent of everything he was accused of, and sad to read the agony he went through as a human and also as a Dark-Hunter. The betrayal by his own family and the rejection from his fellow hunters who all had the wrong notion about him are clearly felt as we read of his inner sadness. Then while one would think that Tabitha's prim and proper twin would be more suited to him, it is what makes this story delightful seeing how they get on, for while Valerius is the epitome of sophistication and noble breeding, Tabitha is just plain tacky and uncouth in comparison. What a joy it was to see them together!With its usual fast-paced and action-packed storyline, not to mention Kenyon's wry humor, SEIZE THE NIGHT continues to whet my appetite for more. And by telling us a bit more about Acheron's identity, it's almost like the author is teasing us and leaves us wanting more and hanging on for Acheron's own story.Ms Kenyon, please keep them coming."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Tabitha Devereaux, raised in a large family of girls, has always been somewhat different and has done whatever it takes to stand out.

Though they both fight their attraction for each other, they begin to fall in love. But who said love is easy? Tabitha's brother-in-law is Valerius's arch enemy. Can love tear a family apart? Will the Daimons one day get the best of the brave Tabitha? Will their love survive?SEIZE THE NIGHT by Sherrilyn Kenyon is an intense, suspenseful romance with vampirism thrown into the mix. I loved the two main characters in the story. Tabitha is a great example of what strong women should be like. She is a fearless woman but love still made her weak in the knees. And Valerius, for all of his toughness, was just screaming out for compassion. Ms. Kenyon is a wonderful storyteller who pulls readers in and doesn't release them until the last page is turned. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more books in the Dark-Hunter series.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawksof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"First off let me say that I've been reading this series in order from the very first book and each story gets better and better. Why do you ask? Simple this is a complex world that Ms. Kenyon has created and as a result each book is a small \\"episode\\" in the big picture. We learn a little more about the characters (both new and past characters), learn a little more about the legend, and of course there is always the romance!!! *SIGH*In this story we are treated to Valerius Magnus. We have been introduced to him in several of Ms. Kenyon's other DH stories...a more unlikable charcter I never thought to read about (okay I thought the same about Zarek and was wrong) so because I'm a loyal fan I picked up her latest. Silly me...I had nothing to worry about. We truly get to know Valerius and what makes him tick. His story (without getting into details that would spoil it for other readers) is fast paced and...well, great. Tabitha is a very strong character (again we met her in earlier DH stories and she is the twin of Amanda) but at the same time amazingly sweet and understanding. Just the kind of person Valerius needs in his cynical life. Of course the path to true love is never smooth and this is the case for these two lovers.I highly look forward to the next in the series and know that it will be as good if perhaps not better than the previous titles. A warning to new readers...this really is a series that builds on it's self. In order to understand all of the little twist and turns it's helpful to have read all of the previous titles. Still this is not a book you want to avoid if have not already read the first six books. This story is still a good stand alone read. If anything it will have readers looking for Ms. Kenyon's backlist.For a fun and entertaining paranormal/vampire read I highly recommend Ms. Kenyon and her Dark-Hunter series!Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon also writes as Kinley MacGregor. Had I known this, I would have sought out Kenyon's novels earlier, being a fan of MacGregor.If you haven't ever read a Kenyon/MacGregor novel you need to know that her writing style isn't polished and proper. She has a choppy, \\"get it done\\" style of writing which doesn't bother me all that much but it is different from the style I usually enjoy (exemplified by Julia Quinn). It's most evident in her dialog. In this novel, an argument between the heroine and her sister ends so abruptly it's jarring.This is the first of Kenyon's novels I've read, and one in a series about Dark-Hunters, an army of undead vampire hunters. Although Kenyon's writing style has problems, her plots and backstory do not. She has created a complex world with a vast mythology and interesting character stories. I'm now eager to explore the rest of the novels to learn more.This particular book focuses on the hero Valerius and the heroine Tabitha. Tabitha struck me initially as a little too flighty in her attractions (just about every male introduced in the book is described by her as being edible they're so sexy).Valerius is no exception, and you'll get tired of hearing about how he is perfectly handsome and alluring. But the chemistry between them is good and made me more forgiving toward her.Valerius is a stick in the mud, albeit a handsome, well dressed one. He remains reserved throughout the novel and even though I liked him, I never really fell in love with him.I was more intrigued by a secondary character, Acheron, whose story I'll be on the lookout for.I can't help but wonder if reading the series in order would have been better than starting with a novel in the middle. I'm sure at the very least I wouldn't have spent so much time trying to figure out the mythos of the universe and been better able to focus on the story of the two main characters."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This is the first (and most likely only) Sherrilyn Kenyon book I've read. The premise sounded interesting, given that I'm an Anne Rice fan (mostly her early Lestat and Lasher books).This is book 7 of a series on immortal Dark-Hunters who hunt vampires. This book centers on Tabitha and Valerius. Tabitha is a human who hunts vampires and it's during one of her hunts that she meets Valerius, a Dark-Hunter disliked by everyone else.I haven't been able to finish the book, not so much the plot, but SK's writing style. She is constantly going on about how this guy is so sexy and all about their sexuality and deliciousness and then doing the same for the next guy. It gets old after a few lines. And her sex scenes seem to go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sex scene in a book, but when its pages and pages of it...After reading half the book, I haven't learned anything but what I've written above."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon continues her popular Dark-Hunter series with Seize the Night and true to form, she provides another thrilling, sexy read in our favorite sultry city. Valerius Magnus is an outsider amongst his fellow Dark-Hunters. His Roman background gives many of the Greek Hunters a reason to sneer at him, his own squire disrespects him and to top it all off, Artemis has reassigned him from DC to New Orleans, where Kyrian of Thrace and Julian of Macedon live and could be the President and Vice-President of the \`we hate Valerius\\" club. To make matters worse, Valerius is haughty and cold to those around him and nobody has ever gotten past his aristocratic walls...until Tabitha Devereaux.Tabitha doesn't understand why the Dark-Hunters all snub Valerius. Sure he walks like he has a stick someplace uncomfortable and he has an irritating habit of looking down his aristocratic nose at most people and things, but surely that's not a good reason to hate him. Tabitha knows one thing, Val is an incredible Daimon killer and to her that's important. She patrols nightly to try and help keep the Daimon population to a minimum. One thing is for sure. It's going to be a messy situation when her sister, Amanda and her husband, Kyrian find out Val is her new hunting partner. Kyrian has never gotten over the fact that it was Valerius' grandfather who tortured and crucified him. But maybe it's time for bygones to be bygones, especially when Desiderius is back and he won't stop until he has destroyed all that Tabitha holds dear.Kenyon has written another masterful story that completely immerses you in the Dark-Hunter mythos. The Dark-Hunter world is fascinating and her characters are so real they could easily walk right out of the story. Valerius is beautiful, cold, lonely and wounded. He makes a wonderful hero, as he has always been punished for trying to help others and Tabitha is an outrageous and flawed heroine that is just the right balance for him. As usual, Kenyon weaves extremely erotic and emotional scenes into her story and is able to evoke laughter and tears within pages of each other. For me, turning the last page is sad, as I know it will be several more months before I can engross myself in the DH world again...of course there is always her wonderful Dark-Hunter website for an occasional fix. Seize the Night is a must have for your next book shopping list and while you are at it, pre-order Sins of the Night!! --Shelly Tavenner for www.allromancewriters.com--"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I liked this book which paired Tabitha (twin sister of Amanda from Book 2) with Valerius (the descendent of the man who killed Kyrian, Amanda's husband from Book 2). If you are reading them in order, I wont go into the back story that got us here to book 7 and simply state that I liked this book! People died in this book and unlike some of the others, no big red bow at the end. One of the characters said in the aftermath of the climax of the story, \\"I'm not so sure we're the ones that won this time around.\\" You felt that in this book. People died while others lives were altered forever. Acheron was shown to be flawed. I felt this book moved past just an erotic romance novel and delved deeper into the Dark Hunter mythology. It was a longer read them some of the other books but I found it hard to put it down. Good job!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I was so suprised to find this book better then I expected it to be. I could not put it down, it made cry, laugh, and it was filled with tons of passion that you wouldn't believe. Sherrilyn Kenyon does a wonderful job of developing her character and setting the mood. I never imagined myself reading these types of books, but thanks to Kenyon I have now read all her Dark-Hunter Novels. I suggest you read one of her books, you might be suprised how hard it will be to put down!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This was a great story, delving into the history of Valerius, enemy to Kyrian of Thrace and Zarek the slave. What a sincere expression of how someone can be so hated by so many people and loved by the most unlikely hero in the form of a woman. Tabitha, the vampire slayer, the great personality, the confident, and the comic relief meets her match in a man she should hate but falls hopelessly in love with. There's nothing mooshy about it. She's still a butt kicking, vampire smacking, tough chick. Some of the scenes in here had me rolling because she is so \\"real\\" in her personality, truly an engaging character and the only match to save Valerius from himself."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"What a sensational reading experience. I didn't want it to end.I loved the man Valerius was and I ached for all that he experienced in his human life which overflowed into his dark hunter existence. I always knew there was more this dark hunter than was previously mentioned in the earlier novels.It's pretty obvious he met his match when it ran into Tabitha. Talk about two people who deserved each, my mind is still sizzling from their interactions.Ms. Kenyon just keeps better with each novel she releases. I don't know how she keeps surpassing the previous novels she written but she does. I hate when I finish her novels so quickly as the wait for the next one is excruciating.I also loved getting a glimpse into Ash's other life and I can't wait to see what's next. Ms. Kenyon keep on doing what you do so well!!!I can admit it; I'm addicted to Ms. Kenyon's novels."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"~Dark Hunter Series~~Seize the Night~~book 7~Steely Dark-Hunter Valerius Magnus and gutsy, wisecracking Tabitha Deveraux are two of Kenyon's most appealing creations. Brought together by a humorous twist of fate--Tabitha stabs Valerius, mistaking him for a Daemon--they light up every scene in which they're together. Unfortunately, their romance seems doomed. The husband of Tabitha's twin has a 2,000-year-old grudge against Valerius, many of Tabitha's friends hate him for atrocities he supposedly committed many years ago and a group of unusually powerful Daemons are intent on annihilating Tabitha, her sisters and anyone who stands in their way. Tabitha and Valerius are aided by Kenyon's familiar crew of Dark-Hunters and Dark-Hunter friends, including their enigmatic ringleader, Acheron, who is explored in more depth here than in the author's earlier novels. Though Kenyon doesn't skirt melodrama entirely with this tale--evidenced by the flashbacks to Valerius's unbelievably tortured past--she succeeds in offering a lively read containing her signature blend of brisk action, sensual thrills and light humor.~Valerius \\"Val\\" Magnus The son of a Roman Senator, Valerius became a Roman general by age 22. He led conquests throughout Greece, Gaul and Britannia. For a most obvious reason, he doesn't play well with most Dark-Hunters and it is imperative we keep him far away from Kyrian, Kell, Zarek and Zoe.he was hated by many people and Dark-Hunters, becuz his Roman and for the Sins of the Father!!he's a Roman, which means that the largely Greek Hunters have a major grudge and hatred against him. He is also very conscious of his \\"background and breeding\\" making him even harder to stand as he acts as if he is above everyone else. (his Arrogance) and him being cold and unfeeling came from the way he was treated by his own Father and brothers he was treated worst than a slave in their time So you can't blame him for being the way he was...Until he meets Tabby when she Shows him that there a people that are kind,Caring, that can Show tenderness and love to others which he Never had any of!!Tabitha \\"Tabby\\" Devereaux is a self taught vampire hunter. She hunts at night and runs an adult store in New Orleans during the day. She is sexy, sassy, takes no guff from anyone and immediately attracted to Valarius. This leads to conflicts in her family as her twin sister is married to a former Greek Dark-Hunter.As Tabby and Val's love grows so does the danger they are in. One of the vampires that has a powerful grudge against Tabby and those around her resurfaces with the object to destroy Tabby's extended family as well as her.I was \\"Shocked\\" at Val & tabby's wedding at Zarek's Toast to him! I loved it when astrid gave Val Ambrosia for their wedding gift told him (that he can throw lighting bolts back at Zarek when he's being playful with him LOL) I thought You Go Girl...!!

This is my FAVORITE book of the series thus far Waiting to get to Acheron's book (not patiently) its driving me nuts to read in the EXACT order, but i don't want to miss out on anything important. Now I thought I loved Vane and Bride book (Night Play) and I wouldn't really care for Val because Kyrian was my fave DH previous to this and Kyrian hated Valerius's exsistence, but Boy was I wrong. Tabby is AWESOME the best Heroine and Valerius makes you fall in love with him over and over (or maybe just me). My emotions I felt while reading this book were all over the place... I laughed, I cried, I was angry, hurt, Happy but most of all sad cause I did not want it to end.

Since I read Acheron's story as the first DH novel, I wasn't sure if I would really like any of the other books, but I did.I was most interested in Kyrian (bk 2), Talon (bk3), Zarek (bk4)and Valerius (bk5) to see how their stories tied together and related to Ash. Tabitha and Valerius' story definitely gets \\"points\\" for the \\"more about Ash factor\\" as well as the additional information about Zarek from book 4. Books 2, 3, 4 and 7 paint a different picture of Ash, than how Ash is presented in his book, Acheron. Since I use reader numbers and votes to help me decide which books to read and/or purchase, I thought I would vote even though everyone before me has really \\"said it all.\\"The only regret I have is that after reading books 5 and 6 I thought the series was going downhill and so bought a used copy instead of a new copy. How I wish I had a new copy as it is one of my 3 favorite books in the series.

He jumps into the melee only to be accidentally stabbed by Tabitha. She can't call her sister, Amanda because her husband Kyrian was brutally killed by Valerius' grandfather. So she takes him home. Valerius is instantly intrigued by this unique, vivid full of life woman. Meanwhile in Alantis, Apollymi- the great destroyer- is plotting with Stryker, the head of the Daimons. They are hunting for something and destroying anyone who gets in their way. They are tearing up New Orleans. Tabitha and Valerius work together to help Ash as much as possible.ThoughtsThis is quite a memorable book in this series, definitely a CANNOT MISS! There are major happenings going on that will forever impact the DH's. I don't want to give it away so I'll be vague =)I'm re-reading this series, I had forgotten the love story - but the other stuff has always stuck since the first run through the series. Major finding outs about Acheron. I love Tabitha and Valerius together, they are complete opposites, but absolutely perfect for each other. Quite the unlikely couple. Tabitha brings out a side of Valerius even he didn't know existed. The tragedy that Zarek went through, it quite similar to the same tragic events in his brother, Valerius', life. Both were out casted, liked by no one, completely isolated, never touched, never loved, and never understood until they met their mates. Zarek is now a God and picks on Valerius relentlessly, amusing and sad all at once. Tabitha single handedly brings together Valerius and his mortal enemies for 2000 years, Kyrian and Julian.This is a fast paced book filled with love, action, discovery and life. I love this story, not my favorite, but pretty high up on the scale! For fans of Kenyon and the DH series, cannot miss this book."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This book blew me away. This may have been the one I read the fastest. I am always surprised by how much back story you read in the Dark-Hunter novels. Zarek's held a lot, as well as Talon's but this one, Seize the Night held so much back story on so many character's, any more and I wouldn't have been able to keep it all straight. I love it when Kenyon does this. Her ability to write an exciting and twisting plot really shines through in this installment of the Dark-Hunter novels.The love between Valerius and Tabitha grew, and it grew before your eyes. I really enjoyed that, and the real tension between Valerius and Kenyon was well written. There is one scene with Tabitha and Amanda that brought tears to my eyes, actually there were many scenes in this book that brought tears to my eyes. Kenyon's writing is effectively drawing me further and further in to this world, when I thought that I was already fully engulfed.Two things that bothered me: There were some editing mishaps in the beginning, but they smoothed out towards the end. Also, the epilogue was seriously disappointing and flippant after the seriousness of the book. I was...let down by it, truly. The epilogue, only two pages of the entire story, was really what brought the rating from an A+ to an A for me.Other than two problems, this book was wonderful and I have the next one ready right beside me. I'm ready."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Well, this is why I like this series so much. Perfect heroes, great story, suspense, secondary characters, growing love, steamy love scenes. I just loved it!Valerius is such a perfect hero. Trying to be tough, but suffering because of his past, his loneliness and disdain others have for him. Then came Tabitha. She was a perfect 'other half' for Val. She was funny, spunky, confident, full of fire. She was really amazing. And I loved seeing them together. Val opened himself to her more and more. It was so sweet. I absolutely adored him. And he was gorgeous. Yummy :)Then we have Nick and Simi. That was a surprise. As well as what happened to Nick in the end. I was absolutely shocked.And Zarek. In his book he didn't seem like a vengeful idiot. I would have thought he would have more compassion for Val, since they were in fact very similar and he found happiness. But no, he had to torture Val just for the fun of it. I didn't like that.I think we see a bit too much of Kyrian, Amanda and Ash in this book. I think Ash should be a bit more distanced from everything that goes on in New Orleans. It's kinda funny that he is supposed to be the leader of all the Dark Hunters when he seems to spend all the time in NO. Don't get me wrong, I really like him, but such things just keep me a bit... confused?Well, what matters most is the romance, and the romance in this book is really great. I looooved Val and I adored Tabby. This is most certainly a keeper. I might even read it again right away. Over and over.

He was taught that kindness was a weakness and his brothers delivered the final blow to him, when they killed him. There was no one in his human life that cared for him and he found he had even less friends and loved ones in his dark hunter life. For years he tried to avoid those who his family had hurt, wail he was human, but now in the same city with the man his grandfather crucified and the brother he who endured unimaginable torture by their father for his acts of kindness toward his brother; whom at the time he only knew as a slave, only learn he is his brother. All of this made him a bit stand offish, and he was hated by almost all the dark hunters and their squires. He never pictured anything good to come of his life, till he met Tabitha.Tabitha was wild, unrefined, stubborn, and sassy to boot all wrapped up in a warriors body. None had ever drawn him as she did everything that annoyed him about her only drew him closer to her. She was like no woman he even met. He knew he couldn't keep her, but he couldn't let her go. He met her family and was astonished with the love and devotion her sister had for each other. Then he learns that Tabitha was the twin sister to Amanda the wife of Kyrian. Kyrain was a great warrior; his grandfather saw as a challenge; then slept with Kyrians wife and turned her against him. Then after he had taken his wife in from of him Valerius's grandfather crucified Kyrian in front of everyone. If this was not a large enough blow to Kyrian, Valerius was the spitting image of his grandfather. He knew right away this was trouble; he could be the cause of her family hardships but again he couldn't let her go.All petty differences aside everyone is going to have to work together there is a war on new Orleans and the Daimons were winning. There are so many deaths the council is having trouble hiding them all. The target of all the madness is Tabitha, Amanda and Kyrian. Somehow they need to all work together and save everyone wail keeping each other safe.I liked this book I think Tabitha had a lot of fire. I really liked her personality. Valerius is sexy in his own way , but really it was Tabby who made this story happen . Val was very funny to tease and I loved how he just didn't get it sometimes. But the best was when Tabby stuck up for him, she knew she seen a good person and he needed protecting, maybe even from himself. I am very much enjoying this series. Stephanie had me read this first one a while back and I have gotten a bit busy but I'm focused now I want to finish this series I have get to read one I didn't like. This one is not my favorite but I did enjoy it and I loved how almost all the dark hunters were in it for at least a few minutes, I miss them after I'm done with their books.

Valerius is, of course, gorgeous. However he is vehemently hated by many and has been for many years.Tabitha will be familiar to series readers - if you loved her before you are going to go ape over her now. Valerius and Tabitha together are one of my favorite romantic couples. Giving as good as they take it is seldom I read about a better matched pair.There's action, romance, and family drama. Great pacing keeps you invested the whole way through. Another winner for the DARK HUNTER series - in my opinion one of the two best books of it (the other is Zarek's mentioned above).If you are reading this series you will pick this up and enjoy it as much as I did I am sure. I go back and re read this quite often - and I'm not a re reader (usually donate books after reading them). This is one of few to make the cut for my permanent library and is only ever leant out to family. Sorry friends - you'll have to get your own copy!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This novel focuses on Zarek's half brother Valerius. Zarek, now an Olympian, despises his legitimate aristocratic half brother and blames him for the horrors he endured as a Roman slave. Valerius seems to be the only decent one aside from Zarek in the entire family. Valerius witnessed Kyrian's execution at age five by his father and grandfather. There are some definitely bad feelings all over. On top of all that, Valerius is a Roman and the majority of the Dark Hunters are Greeks so they hate him and give him a really hard time.Tabitha, Amanda's twin who is married to Kyrian, gets involved with Valerius. Tabitha is the \\"wild one\\". She's very outspoken and unconventional. The demon Desiderius is back in town or sort of...I think he was a vengeful ghost that his son sought to resurrect.There are losses on both sides, literally.The mystery thickens as to what/who Acheron really is. I won't spoil it for you, as the details would give the rest of the story away.I recommend this book, but be prepared for some definite moments of sadness. It's not as painful as Zarek's story, but there are flashbacks to that as well. There is a happy ending though!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have been hooked on Kenyon's Dark-Hunters since book one. And after a dozen or so books, this entry is still my all-time favorite. Each of the hunters is something of an outcast/rebel. Valerius stands out because he's an outcast even among Dark Hunters - he's a Roman and the mostly ancient-Greek hunters hate him. In particular Kyrian, who was betrayed and murdered by Valerius' own father, and Zarek, who was abused by the same man. Further, \\"Val\\" comes off as a sanctimonious prick. Yet, Tabitha will discover a man of honor, compassion and deep feelings beneath that mask. But, their romance faces obstacles beyond daemons and reclaiming his soul - her sister and family.This story sucked me in even more than all the others. I could not put it down and have re-read it many times. The entire series is wonderful, with rich mythology and complex characters. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I was slightly disappointed with this book. Maybe my expections were too high. I had been waiting to read this story since Kyrian's book (Night Pleasures) and thought this would be a great story.First I liked the hero, Valerius and heroine, Tabitha. Valerius is not like other Dark-Hunter heroes. He is a conservative aristocrat who would not be caught wearing leather or riding a motorcycle. Instead he wears Armani and has impeccable manners. He is a snob and is hated by everybody because of crimes his grandfather & father commited. Tabitha is the exact opposite: a quirky gothic chick who owns a sex shop. She hunts vampires and accidently stabs Valerius. The two are a good couple. Valerius doesn't mind Tabitha's crazy life while Tabitha gives him the love and companionship he never had. Val & Tabi was the best part of the book. Also towards the end of the book, Zarek gives a speech to Val & Tabi on their wedding day that just makes you feel all warm, fuzy and happy. Especially because it's coming from Zarek.However, I was letdown with some of the other stuff going on with the book. There was no explanation as to why the goddess, Apollymi needed the child, Marissa. We know the child has powers and probably will play some key role in a future book when she gets older. Maybe after reading so many DH books, I've grown frushrated with all the secrets. Especially with Acheron. I really love the guy and in each book we learn more about him but his secrets got give already. Plus he keeps erasing people's memory if they find out too much about him. That bugs me. This book pretty much confirms that Ash is somekind of God. He brings back to life, Kyrian and Amanda. Then hands out immortaility to both of them as well as to Tabitha too. It just seemed a little bit too much wow factor. Which now brings me to Nick. Basically, because Ash kept Simi as a secret from Nick, he dies. I had a problem with the why and how he died. I don't care for Aretims but I give here credit for saving Nick. Otherwise he would have been a Shade.In general the book was still worth the read. However, I believe to fully enjoy and understand the book, first time readers should read the 6 books before this one."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I am late in writing a review of this novel in the Dark Hunter Series. However, I purchased this book when it was first published and read it in one setting. This book is definitely one of the best in the series of the hunter novels. It tells the story and picks up on the story of Valerius Magnus. Stunning and awe inspiring are the best words to describe my feelings for this story. I have re-read this book at least three times, and it still has an effect that brings out the sensitivity and sympathy in me for the main character. The writer has projected this characters' personality so intensely that you will feel each hurtful, hateful, and downwrite nasty thing ever done to him. Val's stoic baring is what is so outstanding in this novel. He never gives the impression that what people think, or do, or say, can break his spirit. He still refuses to bend, he goes on. If anything, he draws strength from their abuses (no he is not into s and m) he has developed a thick skin or shell that is his armour against what will be thown at him. This armour begins to crack once he meets Tabitha. As an empath (Tabitha) is able to see beyond the stoicism. She knows he is and has been hurt by what has been done to him (he keeps things inside). She is drawn to him and he to her; which will cause problems all around for her family relations and friends. This continuing story is one of unbelievable strength and fortitude. No matter what, you will gain some sense of man's ability to overcome animosity, prejudice, and hatred. Everyone walks a different path, but how many know, really know, what one has endured to reach where they are on that path. This is the lasting effect I get from this story. and I would and have recommended the series to anyone with a love of reading. Enjoy this series, I will."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"This was a great book. Why? Because at the start of Chapter 1. You want Valerius to get his. After the first half of the book, you want everyone that ever caused him any grief to get their's instead. I also had a much better love for Tabitha.

I couldn't put this book down. My heart went out to Valerius so strong so upright, till Tabitha enters his domain, and shakes it up a bit. You can feel the sparks immediately from these too. This book as well as all other Dark Hunter books just grabs you and keeps you reading till the very last page, which is hard to come too cause you want it to go on and on."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"don't get me wrong--the characters were brilliantly portrayed. val is sinfully sexy and his staid principles can even be described as adorable when pitted against tabitha's. their clash from the beginning was certainly intriguing. and the sex...well... i think it's a given that sex with paranormals is bound to be sizzling.the secondary characters were fine, too. having incredible abilities, they certainly are interesting to read (Ash is really too perfect to be anything but a god).i guess what i found a little shaky about this story was how the \\"scenes\\" were orchestrated.certain parts of the story simply left me confused and even annoyed. case in point: too many mortals involved in supernatural matters (the slayers, the relatives of the slayers, the squires, and, come to think of it, almost half of New Orleans, it seems) and everything is still kept hush-hush. i know this is supposed to be a paranormal story, but a certain logic is also needed. too many characters has also led to some awkward scene shifts or insufficient character development.then there's the olympian matter--the whole thing about the gods and goddesses--i think it was given too much emphasis that the story sometimes appears to be simply a clash between dark hunters and the egotism of gods, rather than a romantic story. and is it only me, but, after reading descriptions of dark hunters--how they are supposedly powerful and all that stuff--when it comes to actual battles they appear quite slow and even weak. hey, but that's just an observation.redeeming facets of the novel for me were val's traumatic past (that was certainly heart-wrenching), and the not-so-happy-ending-for-all element. a lot of protagonists died, but it made the story look more believable at least and not one-sided.this isn't one of kenyon's best. even some of the subsequent installments just lost that magical touch (except for Night Play which is my favorite). but i'm pinning all my hopes to Acheron's story. that should be a treat ^_^"},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"I have read all of the dark hunter novels, and have loved them all. However, this was my favorite. Poor Valerius had a rough life as a human and even suffered terribly as a dark hunter. So many were against him, until he met Tabitha. Valerius and Tabitha were completely different, but they had great chemistry together. Even though Valerius had a reputation of looking down on others, he really was not like that at all. Tabitha was definitely cut from a different cloth, but Valerius worshiped the ground she walked on. Tabitha also came across a bit flaky, but Valerius loved her very much. I recommend reading this book if you like paranomal romance novels."},{"Title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"When I was reading Sieze the Night, I was immediately wrapped in a tale that was so intriguing, I couldn't put it down.

I find that I not interested in what is happening between the hero and heroine and more interested in information from past characters. And that is not even entertaining. Kenyon needs to focus more on her story instead of promoting her series. Lately, her books seem to be rushed out. Perhaps that is the fault of the publisher but I find that I am willing to wait 2 weeks for the library to get it to me instead of purchasing. Certainly that is not good for the Publisher.Wait and get it from your library.

I'm not cool with any main characters inflicting mortal wounds on other protagonists, even and especially accidentally. If the Hero weren't a DH than he'd have been dead and when she noticed she'd stabbed a man who was not a daemon, she didn't seem particularly perturbed. I've liked Tabitha in the other books, but she didn't seem as smart-alecky in the beginning of this one. Also there was nothing really unique about Valerius. I was just bored with it and I decided this one would SO not be a good use of my evening.

First of all, I am very, VERY glad that I did not pay money for it. As it is, I may use the copy I have for kindling some cold winter day if I do not foist it off on someone else first. It is, by far, the worst piece of published fiction I have ever read and holds number two spot on my \\"worst stories ever\\" list.I had all the charcters figured out within 10 pages of their appearance, so cilche they were. The female lead has a thoroughly rampant case of Mary-Sue-itis, so rampant that I doubt any recovery would have been possible with the aid of a competent editor. The words \\"characterization black hole\\" seem somehow inadequate to describe the soul sucking vortex that she left in her wake among the other characters.As soon as it became apparent that some characters couldn't die, all possible sense of danger and worry evaporated and left me with the mary-sue and her boy toy. Why authors think that immortality is great, I'll never know. It only robs the reader of any sort of tension and worry for the characters' continued existence (not there was any to begin with, but I would have liked to look forwards to some ugly splatter deaths for most of the characters).And then there's the villain who can't seem to find his butt with both hands. I thought I was reading some demonic version of a Power Rangers bad guy, so inept he and his cronies were.I suppose this is a book for fans only, because it certainly did not intrigue me to want to read any more of Kenyon's work in any genre whatsoever."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"This book was full of beautiful potential, but the characters where completely without true richness. The main character was so whiney and and annoying. She complained about a childhood and parents that were typically flawed. The author gave a vague and rediculous episode that was suppose to fuel her deep hatred for an ex husband. 9/11 was just thrown in as if it had to be, bringing up much deeper and more exciting topics that the rest of the book then ending abruptly."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I love Divakaruni's writing. She has once again proved herself to be a master storyteller. She writes such fascinating stories with such wonderful characters and prose. This is the third book that I've read by her and loved.Rakhi is the central character here along with her mother. To be honest I didn't really like Rakhi's character at first. I felt that she never took responsibility for the way her life was going and she chose instead to blame everything on her ex-husband Sonny or her mother. Rakhi wants to be close to her mother but is unable to because of her mother's refusal to discuss her work and her previous life in India.After her mother is tragically killed Rakhi opens her journals and discovers the truth behind her mother and for the first time in her life, notices her father.It was interesting to see Rakhi grow within herself and her ability to become open and honest with the people in her life. The developing relationship with her dad was one of the best points in the novel.Divakaruni has created believable characters here. It was so sad to see that these people had these lives within themselves that they couldn't or didn't share with their loved ones. Only after terrible loss and tragedy did Rakhi and her father both come to truly discover themselves and their relationship with one another.I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I have enjoyed several of Chitra Divakaruni's books, \\"Mistress of Spices\\" perhaps the most. \\"Queen of Dreams\\" was an interesting portrayal of an Indian family's relationship and how they adapted to American society.

QUEEN OF DREAMS is the fourth novel by Divakaruni that I've read and it did not disappoint. For those who have read her books, this one resembles VINE OF DESIRE the most, with both taking place in the Bay Area of Northern California, but at the same time has references that lead back to India. Both books relate to the immigrant's life in California, and how their life has changed since leaving their homeland.But that is where the resemblance stops. In QUEEN OF DREAMS, the focus is on relationships, mostly between a mother, Mrs. Gupta, and her adult daughter Rahki. While VINE OF DESIRE was rooted in the physical world, QUEEN OF DREAMS flows into the world of dreams, as Mrs. Gupta has the ability to decipher them, be it her own or others. She has the ability to help others through their dreams, and this is what drives her. While mother and daughter are close, this is one area that Rahki is not allowed to trespass. She desires her mother's talent, but it was not passed on to her. It leaves Rahki bitter and resentful that she cannot share in this part of her mother's life.The book follows Rahki's attempts to understand her mother better, and at the same time the reader, and later Rahki, are allowed to see what Mrs. Gupta's dream journal confesses. The journal tells Mrs. Gupta's story, from her days in India to her dreams that foretell her death.Rahki, in the meantime, is newly divorced and living with her young daughter Jona. She is trying to survive by running a coffeehouse and selling her paintings, hoping to be \\"discovered\\" one day. She also has to deal with her ex-husband Sonny, who is in her life almost every day because of their daughter. She has not forgiven Sonny for something that happened during their marriage, and she has never told her family about this incident, which led to their divorce.I enjoyed QUEEN OF DREAMS as much as I have enjoyed her other novels. I love how she blends in the culture of India, the Old World, with life in California. She does a good job describing what it feels like to be an immigrant in the United States, as well as being the children of immigrants, not quite belonging to the new country and certainly not belonging to the homeland. The segments on dreams were done well enough that Divakaruni had me believing in them.She also did a good job showing how the characters related and reacted to September 11, which was the climax of the book. It brought back memories for me, showing how those of Middle Eastern descent and Indian descent, living in America, were treated due to the color of their skin, shortly after this horrific event. It again displayed the immigrant experience in America, one of the themes in QUEEN OF DREAMS.For those who enjoy reading about other cultures living in America, or those who enjoy stories of mothers and daughters, this book is for you. I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"From the domestic to the mystical, Divakaruni has a unique talent for blending the daily lives of Indian-Americans with the myths of a distant homeland.In a story that examines the relationship of a troubled young mother, in the middle of a divorce, with her own mother, a dream teller, we learn of the indecision and self-doubt that haunts Rakhi. Fascinated by her mother's past, the years spent in India training to counsel clients by reading their dreams, Rakhi is obsessed more with the known than the unknown, convinced that if she can solve the riddle of a distant mother, she will locate her own missing pieces.When Rakhi's mother dies in an accident, the daughter is left with a failing tea shop, her mother's Dream Journals and unresolved questions about her failed marriage. When even her painting hits a brick wall and inspiration disappears, Rakhi is bereft. But as Rakhi's father translates the dream journals, painful truths are revealed to father and daughter, bringing them closer in grief and understanding. The journals are an unexpected parting gift, an opportunity for Rakhi and her father to reawaken their long-dormant relationship and heal past misunderstandings.Through the journals, we learn of the despair of an intuitive Indian girl, forced to choose between her talent for dream telling and the love of the man she marries. The seemingly complacent wife, who has helped so many through difficulties, is a multi-layered, complex woman beset by her own inner challenges, searching for peace and contentment, faced with untenable choices. This mother is warm and accessible, her deep conflicts and passions revealed.While the attacks on 9/11 throw the Indian-American community into the same confusion as other American citizens, they are later attacked because they look like terrorists, outcast in their own neighborhoods.All of these things create the impetus that forces Rakhi into the necessary changes to get her life back on track. Questioning her most basic assumptions and motives, the true nature of love and the capacity to forgive, Rakhi makes an extraordinary journey, guided by the constant presence of her mother's loving spirit. Steeped in the ramifications of diversity, cultural identity and the importance of family, Divakaruni once more proves herself an inspiring and master storyteller. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I have now read 4 of Ms. Divakaruni's books, and hope she writes another novel soon. She has a tremendous gift to make her images come to life in your head as you are reading. I also felt again that I was being given a privileged tour of a culture different than my own, and could see my own culture through different eyes. So in addition to being entertained, I was being educated. Along with a great story comes a little magic--in that way her work reminds me of Alice Hoffman--the magic seems like a completely natural and believeable part of the world. Read this book, and then read the rest of her work!"},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"When I open the first pages of a novel by Chitra Divakaruni, I know I'm in good hands. There will be a fascinating, exciting story, interesting and compelling characters, and every event will be told in rich, poetic prose. Queen of Dreams is no exception. I read it very quickly because the story kept pulling me forward; one climax after another made for a very exciting read. I reread it more slowly, then, to enjoy details I might have missed. I was never disappointed. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is interested in relationships between family members and between friends. The events of 9/11/01 are also an important part of this story, with ramifications that are powerful and ring with truth.Don't let the inclusion of Dream Journals throw you off. This thread running through the novel is more real than anything else in it; it's vivid and moving and an important part of the journey. It is not my idea of \\"magic realism.\\" It is my idea of great story telling that makes me want to keep the pages turning in order to find out what happens next. When it's over, I have a lot to think about. I will certainly recommend it to my book group.I envy those of you who have not yet read Queen of Dreams. You have a treat in store for you. I hope Divakaruni will gift us with another novel soon."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's latest novel QUEEN OF DREAMS is another tale of East meets West. She writes what she knows best, about the world of the Indian immigrant living in America. In this novel, as in THE VINES OF DESIRE, Divakaruni takes the reader to northern California. Rakhi, a divorced mother of one, is trying to deal with life as a single mother and understand her own mother, who is able to interpret dreams.Divakaruni blends both the metaphysical with the tangible physical world. Mrs. Gupta, Rakhi's mother, had kept a journal throughout her life. The chapters of QUEEN OF DREAMS are interspersed with these journal entries that describe her dreams and her everyday waking thoughts. One gets a glimpse of her life, from her days in India where she learned to be a dream interpreter to the day she met her husband, Rakhi's father. Mrs. Gupta continues her journal after she settles in America with her new husband and child, revealing a different perspective from what Rakhi sees as reality. The dreams themselves take on a poetic feel, filled with symbolism and folklore that reveal to the reader an image of India; not the physical aspects, but the cultural beliefs, the myths, and the legends. It's a contrast between Western Civilization and the Old World of the East.The story opens with Mrs. Gupta's dream of a snake, the foreseer of change. She tries to guess what the snake is telling her, whether he is foretelling a birth or a death. She senses a bad omen and finally understands that it is her own death the snake is warning her about. The snake reassures her that, although death means an end to life, it can also mean a new beginning. It is snippets of dreams like this that help shape the mood of the book and prepares the reader for what is yet to come.Unlike her mother, Rakhi is totally rooted in the physical world of Northern California. She knows very little about her parents' lives in India and wishes she knew more. She makes her living by running a coffeehouse called The Chai House with her best friend Belle, but Rakhi's real goal is to become an artist. She paints when she can, and her latest obsession is a painting that involves a man dressed in white. She doesn't know who he is, but he hovers just beyond her reach. She searches in vain for this man that she instinctively feels may have the key to some of the unknowns in her life.One of the main themes is that of the relationship between mother and daughter, and it is done very well through the characters of Rakhi and her mother, as well as through Rhaki's six-year-old daughter Jona. Rakhi feels close to her mother, but there is a wall that prevents them from ever becoming truly close. Her mother refuses to discuss the dreams or her life in India, and Rakhi is bitter, unhappy that she does not understand this part of her mother's life, a life that is so guarded that it causes a rift in their relationship. Her divorce is another sore point between them. Her parents still love Sonny, but she can never explain to them why she had to leave him. Her daughter Jona loves both her parents, and as the novel progresses, Rakhi encounters problems with her own daughter because of her muddled relationship with Sonny.Things change when Mrs. Gupta dies in a tragic automobile accident, and the dynamics of some of Rakhi's important relationships are changed forever. She notices her father for the first time, and he's not the same indifferent man she thought she knew. Together they read her mother's journal, an act that will change both of them forever. She also finds herself in a maturing relationship with Sonny, while she herself is changing and growing too.QUEEN OF DREAMS is ultimately a story of how one woman touches those around her during her life and into death. Divakaruni's talent is not only good storytelling, but also creating characters that are dynamic and real in one way or another. One may not truly believe in the power of dreams, but that isn't the point of this book. The focus is on family, relationships, pride in one's heritage, and how one may not truly understand another as well as they think. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org)"},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"Queen of Dreams is a beautifully written gem of a novel. Full of provocative insights, and timely observations on marriage, family, racism, and the immigrant experience, the novel effectively chronicles the lives of a Bengali immigrant family living in California on the eve of September 11th 2001. Elegant is style and tone, the story centers around a woman caught between the real world that is crumbling around her and her mother's infectious and mysterious dream world.The narrative alternates between Rakhi, who was born in the United States and her mother, Mrs. Gupta, who emigrated from India. Mrs. Gupta has a unique talent - she's a dream teller; she has the ability to translate dreams - be it her own or others. She is driven by the ability to help others through their dreams, having learned the technique from her childhood in India. Without a doubt Rakhi is American but a feeling of belonging to her birth land constantly haunts her. She is married and newly separated from Sonny, a young, carefree disc jockey, and she cares for Jona, their young daughter. One night Sonny left her to fend for herself at a dance party, and she has never forgiven him; she never told her family about it and the incident contributed to their separation.Rakhi owns The Chai House, a small caf&eacute;, and Belle, her spunky girlfriend helps her run it. Rakhi is also a painter and hopes, one day to be discovered. But when a rival caf&eacute; opens on the opposite side of the street, and her mother dies in a fatal crash, she has to use all the resources at her disposal to save her flailing business, and repair the strained relationship with her daughter. Rakhi's father, who drinks on the weekend, comes to her aid and tries to help her rebuild her life, while also helping her translate her mother's dream journal from Bengali to English.Much of the narrative centers on the relationship between mother and daughter, and Rakhi's often frustrated attempts to try to understand her mother better. Rakhi is prone to give in to life's dramas too easily - at one stage she angrily wants to close the caf&eacute; after the kitchen accidentally catches fire. She's also frustrated in her quest for her roots, and while she was always close to her mother, she feels angry and resentful that her mother's talent of dream interpretation was never passed on to her. Rakhi becomes obsessed with ancient history, rather than tackling the problem at hand, \\"this has always been my short coming. My mother dreams and I paint - because dreams look to the future, and paintings try to preserve the past.\\"Packed with absolutely gorgeous prose poetry, Divakaruni effectively weaves the colourful, mysterious dream world through Rakhi's life. And much of the narrative reads like a rich, sumptuous painting with phrases such as: \\"his plated green skin shone like rainwater on banana plants in the garden plot,\\" and \\"A clear, full light tinged with coastal purples.\\"All the characters register the shock and horror of September 11th, but nothing prepares them for the actions of a few racists and bigots who are fuelled with hatred and anger. How Rakhi and her family and friends handle this incident is a testament to their fortitude and inner strength. The immigrant experience resonates throughout this work: Mrs. Gupta doesn't talk about the past like so many immigrants do, she didn't want to be like those other mothers, \\"splitting Rakhi between here and there, between her life right now and that which can never be.\\" Mike Leonard February 05."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I come across the work of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni through a radio interview in April. Her reading excerpt on the Queen of Dreams was so charming that I checked out the title in the nearby local library. Unforunately, that radio program ceased to pose her audio interview on line.Time is well-spent reading this title as the many reviews of the title cover comment on the effect 'spiritually therapeutic'. Her narrative prose in first person account is so poetic that even a tormented main character, a single mother who struggles to paint, a La Boheme artist, sounds like a saint. What strikes me as universally humane is how Chitra describes the 'redemptive' process, sexual frustration with her ex-husband, friendship with her girlfriend, Freudian connection with her son Jonas (yes, the Biblical character), ambiguous reconciliation with her gifted mother after she died in an accident, and with her father who lent a cooking hand to support her 'faltering adventure in coffee shop business'. The father figure is fairly clear-cut.For those who are new-age seekers, the self-discovery of identity in the post-modern Berkeley era does not sacrifice the quest of authentic intellectual curiosity. Rather it affirms a woman's struggling for her independence while longing her interdependence with those who care for her. Only a protagonist (here a woman) can write such moving novel.If you enjoy poetry for the namesake of beauty, try the journal passge on how one interpretes the modality of 'thorn'. How many ways can one assign meanings to the dream about 'thorn'? That depends on who has the dream and in what context.The author maintains a website for her other works."},{"Title":"Queen of Dreams","review":"I loved reading this book, at first it was boring, but that only lasted a few pages, later I was so engrossed by it that I could not stay away from it.

But almost nothing happens in the first 280 pages! The last 80 pages are typical of both Lambdin and Lewrie, and were fun and exciting.

The factions are happy to accept the arms but use them against all enemies, not just those intended. Perhaps those who want to involve us into the Balkans need to read this book. The ethnic/religious hatred/atrocities have been going on for centuries, and, as described in this story, is an underlying problem that good intentions will not make go away. It is a very graphic story, but very well written. On a personal note, I hope the author allows Lewrie to remain a bit of a rogue. He's becoming downright dignified!"},{"Title":"Jester's Fortune: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure","review":"Being a big fan of DL and Alan Lewrie, I rushed out and got this book the minute it was released. But, after wading through the first 50 pages or so, I put it down _ nothing was happening, and my old friend Alan was a bit boring. Now, many months later, I've picked the book up again. I don't enjoy it as much as the first couple of Lewrie books and, I'm sorry to say, the Balkans just don't interest me _ pirates or no pirates. Still, I'm finding Lewrie better company with my second attempt. I just wish Lambdin would tone down the &quot;accents&quot; he has his characters speak in. His attempts at pidgin English with a foreign accent are virtually incomprehensible. That said, I am looking forward to getting my hands on &quot;King's Captain&quot;."},{"Title":"Jester's Fortune: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure","review":"This is the eighth novel in the &quot;Alan Lewrie&quot; Royal Navy series set during the Napoleonic wars, and we're up to 1796 and the beginnings of Bonaparte's conquest of most of Western Europe. The dashing and rakehell Lewie is in his early 30s now, has attained the rank of commander, and is beginning to mellow just a little as he gains experience and responsibility -- and children. Admiral Sir John Jervis, one of the most cold-blooded disciplinarians the Royal Navy ever produced but an excellent theatre commander, has been given the responsibility of cutting the French off at the knees in the Mediterranean. But the Coalition is falling apart and Great Britain is becoming isolated, the Austrian army -- supposedly \\"the greatest army in Europe\\" -- has turned out a paper tiger, and the Venetian Republic just can't be bothered to save itself. Jervis has created a small squadron to work the Adriatic, led by Capt. Thomas Charlton and including a second frigate under Capt. Benjamin Rodgers (whom Lewrie knew in the Bahamas). And there's another sloop under an aristocratic little pissant named Fillebrowne who is likely to be a burr under Lewrie's saddle for some time to come. The author takes the opportunity to display the nature of Venetian and Austro-Hungarian decadence (compared to the English Way, at any rate) and to let the reader share his intense, dramatically demonstrated disdain for anything to do with the Balkans and the region's long, long history of ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance, and tendency to torture as a tool of revenge. (Kossovo's prominence in the news didn't begin in the 1990s.) My favorite character in the book, though, is the Hungarian Lieut. Kolodzcy, seconded to the squadron as a translator and political advisor, and who turns out to be quite different from Lewrie's and Rodgers's first impression. This one is talkier than most, except for the horrific scene at the pirate encampment near the end, but I enjoyed the Brits' attempts to deal with the original of Byzantine politics."},{"Title":"Jester's Fortune: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure","review":"Well done, sir.

Jester is part of a tiny squadron of four ships and they are forced to ally secretly with pirates, against Lewrie's wishes as he's had bad experiences with pirates several times in the past.I continue to enjoy following Lewrie's exploits as the Napoleonic Wars heat up in this eighth book in the series. Lewrie continues to be a personable and delightfully flawed hero and the historical details are convincing, forming a strong background for the adventures."},{"Title":"Jester's Fortune: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure","review":"This is a strange, strange book. Or perhaps it's a very bad one. I felt mystified by it, but, on balance, I'm leaning toward \\"bad\\".Lambdin appears to be a stylistic and grammatical \\"wolf-child\\". He breaks every rule with apparent innocence. Literally ungrammatical sentences wander, going nowhere. Exclamation points pepper the text. Dialogue is phrased in spelled-out dialect, occasionally vivid but far more often twee. Anything that can possibly be seen as jargon gets capitalized and hyphenated in the best tradition of bad military fiction.Characterization here seems shallow. Alan Lewrie, the hero, is presented as \\"different\\": a sort of a renegade womanizing rogue-cop kind of guy. Really, though, he comes across as a rather shallow individual. The constant locker-room banter between the characters seems highly improbable for the late 18th century setting, and while the promiscuity of all characters may be period, at least for the men, the coldness with which they pursue it is off-putting. Even more off-putting is the fact that no female character here is more than a bit of fluff, of significance only for her attractiveness to men.The setting, the Balkan Adriatic and Venice, is fascinating. The plot seems exciting, but upon reflection, represents a rather obvious attempt to be timely. Trying to raid French shipping, Lewrie and the squadron he's part of enlist the help of Serbian pirates. The pirates proceed to establish a death camp and begin torturing and killing their enemies. The parallel to recent Balkan events is heavy-handed, and the Serbs are presented as rather subhuman. There are enjoyable moments in the plot, such as when the Hungarian aide whom Lewrie has dismissed as effeminate turns out to be a fantastic swordsman, but overall, I'd give this a miss."},{"Title":"Jester's Fortune: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure","review":"It's an interesting story, along with his other novels, tho a bit gruesome towards the end.One problem i have with his books is that the foreigners speak their languages very ungrammatically! I can understand how an English sailor could mess up even French, but a Frenchman? This is very grating and there's no excuse for it. I even noticed a mistake in German, and my German is almost non-existent.My second beef is that his sailing talk is totally unintelligible. I don't understand C.S.Forester either, but he seems only to have the necessary minimum. When Lambdin talks about relative wind he's obviously 'going overboard'."},{"Title":"The Duke And Mrs. Douglas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"This book falls very much into the middle of being liked and disliked. There was much that was good, but there was much to counterbalance and drag it down.The Duke of Alban, disillusioned with life, leaves Brighton to visit his favourite aunt. Alban is wary and cynical regarding women. His wife ran away with a lover and his most recent mistress was playing a double game with him. Three men accompany him, an old friend, a social acquaintance and a slight acquaintance who somehow tagged along. Unbeknownst to him, his aunt has become blind and very much needs her companion, Mrs. Kittie Douglas.Kittie is a widow in need of employment, due to her dead husband's gambling. She has an unrealistically noble picture of Alban, as she has been reading his letters to his aunt. Of course he appears all that is good and she suspects she is more than a little in love with this idealised picture. Hardly surprising that she should immediately be strongly attracted to him when they meet.He finds himself similarly drawn to her. However, his thoughts are not at all honourable. He feels torn between his instinctive desire to seduce her and his conscience telling him he should not, because of her position.The second man, Lord Orkeney muddies the waters, by immediately flirting with Kittie.Two friends of Kittie's then arrive to complicate relationships with the other two men. Spring might have been in the air.Basically this is a story of how Alban and Kittie fight within themselves regarding their deep attraction. He wants her, but will not consider marriage. She wants him, but cannot reconcile herself to being a mistress - to her it is an insult and debasement.Orkeney is all the time complicating the issue, on purpose as is obvious. He is lying to both of them. Alban may have wanted excuses to see Kittie as being open to being his mistress, but he does see behaviour that is strong evidence to that effect. Here Kittie is astonishingly stupid.A strong story, but I really could not get to like Kittie and Alban more than tepidly. They were both so bristling with resentments and suspicions. Maybe being so privy to their thoughts made it a bit too claustrophobic.There were also several secondary plot threads that were created and showed promise of interest, but then were not developed. A pity.The ending was good and made up for some of the sluggish internalising of hero and heroine.As usual Simpson recreates the era convincingly. The characters do actually think as such men and women of the period would have done."},{"Title":"The Duke And Mrs. Douglas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Donna Simpson is one of the few authours who can (successfully) write a novel that almost exclusively focuses on the feelings and private thoughts of her characters and still not end up with the book that is either maudlin or awkward. It takes a real talent to write such a novel where nothing much ever happens save for the characters talking to each other and ruminating about the behaviour of others and themselves. Which is why I so enjoy reading Ms Simpson's novels. But this time around, I rather felt that Ms Simpson fell short of her usual excellence.Feeling gloomy and having had his fill of the back-stabbing lot that surrounds the Prince of Wales, the widowed Duke of Alban decides to leave Brighton and repair to the North in order to visit his favourite aunt. And he takes with him his best friend, Bartholomew Norton, the Earl of Orkenay (not a very close or well liked friend) and another gentleman he knows little of, Sir John Fitzhenry. It's a trip in which he will reestablish his close link with his adored aunt (an aunt he hasn't seen in almost three years, not since he arrived broken over his wife's desertion), and spend time hunting and riding with his friends. But all his plans go out the window when he arrives to find that his aunt has hired a comely young widow, Kittie Douglas, as her companion -- a ravishing and voluptuous lady moreover who makes his pulses races with longing and desire. Can the duke, who had been seriously and publicly betrayed before trust that seemingly virtuous and tenderhearted widow is exactly what she seems? Or does the comely Mrs. Douglas have some conniving plan up her sleeve?Part of the problem with &quot;The Duke and Mrs. Douglas&quot; was that the duke and Mrs. Douglas spend very little time with each other in a constructive manner at all. They both spend a lot of time thinking and obsessing about each other, but when they do converse, they are, quite frequently at daggers drawn and completely misunderstanding each other. So that when, somewhere towards the end of the book, Kittie laments to her friends about the duke's poor treatment of her esp when she had thought they were becoming friends, I wondered how she had arrived at this conclusion? When, exactly, had they become friends? Had I missed a few chapters somewhere? Kittie, actually spends more time with the cad of the group, and allows the man more liberties than a respectable widow would have (I thought), and I really wasn't too surprised that the duke got, and maintained, a certain impression of Kittie. Also, because the duke and Kittie never really establish any kind of relationship with each other (at least none that I could see aside from lusting for each other), the book does tend to stagnate a little. On the plus side, however, is Ms Simpson's wonderful character realisations of all the individuals involved in this story. She made me want to know more about Kittie's friends (Rebecca and Hannah), Mr. Norton and Sir John Fitzhenry. Truly, no one can show the many different facets of a character (major or minor) the way that Donna Simpson can. And it was the character portrayals of the minor characters that saved this book for me, because, truth to tell, I did find Kittie and the duke and the perpetual fog of misunderstanding that they seem to revel in fairly boring."},{"Title":"The Duke And Mrs. Douglas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Although it seems that most of the reviewers commenting on this book were not totally convinced, I did like it very much and for one reason: each member of the dramatis personae was three dimensional for each one hid some sort of personal difficulty or trauma and each dealt with it in a a serious and adult manner not usually found in short form regency novels. I liked it because each character had to examine him or herself deeply to identify and overcome motives coloured with suspicion of self and others. I felt that the interaction of the various couples/combinations was well drawn. The sexual tension was well portrayed and, I think, realistic. And, of course, the ultimate surprise was the story of the hero's much adored aunt - certainly her own heart required a great deal of self-examination for her life was so nearly wasted.All in all, I thought this was Donna Simpson's best effort thus far. It is not particularly an easy read and one could easily be frustrated over the behaviour of the various characters. But, in the end, it was a very mature, well drawn look into the hearts and minds of a group of people I personally found exceptionally interesting. None has an easy journey to happiness but you feel that you know and understand them when the story ends. Not \\"lite 'n' fluffy\\" - it takes some degree of commitment to read but I felt truly rewarded when I came to the end."},{"Title":"The Duke And Mrs. Douglas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Kittie Douglas, a widow for 4 years and companion to Lady Eliza, is happy to find out Eliza's nephew will be visiting their Yorkshire estate. Over the years, Kittie has read his letters to his aunt, and she is intrigued by the very thought of him. She wants to meet the man whose late wife abandoned him. Could he really be so bad?The Duke of Alban was hoping for a peaceful visit with his aunt, who he hasn't seen in 3 years. He and a few hanger-on friends travel to Yorkshire. But there are a few things Alban didn't expect. He did not know his aunt's companion was a beautiful widow, and he didn't know his aunt was blind. The duke has never desired a woman like he desires Kittie. Unfortunately, his friend, Lord Orkenay, has also set his sights on her.Eventually, someone makes an offer that changes everything...&quot;The Duke and Mrs. Douglas&quot; had its good points and bad points. I liked Kittie. She was willful and opinionated, but hardly overbearing. Those expecting a light-hearted Regency should look elsewhere, as this book is somewhat dark, and deals with some very serious issues. I also liked the fact that the characters were at least a decade older than the average romance characters. It was a refreshing change of pace.Now, the bad points. I didn't care for the Duke of Alban. I thought he was rude, bold and prying. I don't think his interest in Kittie ever extended beyond physical attraction, and I certainly can't imagine why she liked him. In terms of romance, it was lacking. I thought some of the &quot;secondary&quot; plots were more interesting, though slighted. I was more interested in Kittie's friend's dalliance with a younger man. I would have liked to see more of Alban's saintly friend, Mr. Norton. The central characters often left something to be desired.Overall, it's very average. In the past, I've read better from Donna Simpson. The book is somewhat weak, but it does deliver in certain areas. For instance, I was COMPLETELY blindsided by a twist in the end."},{"Title":"Physical Examination and Health Assessment","review":"Compared to Bates' book I find this one more easier to read and understand.

The author did a marvelous job in conveying the story of Stonewall Jackson. At the end of the book the reader will have an excellent understanding of not only Jackson but also the campaigns in which Jackson fought.The book also gives the reader an oblique insight of the British military's mindset at the time of publishing. For example, civilian leaders should merely appoint a great captain and then let him do as he pleases in the conduct of a nation's wars. Also, some modern readers may find the author's analysis of slavery.My downloaded version did not have any maps or illustrations. I downloaded a Gutenberg press copy with the maps but these too were not very helpful in Kindle format. I hate to say it but Wikipedia has excellent maps that cover the campaigns.

Henderson researched and wrote his outstanding biography of iconic Confederate General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in the 1890's, when Jackson was still in living memory in the American South. Henderson, an instructor at Britain's Military Academy at Sandhurst, brought both military expertise and an outsider's detachment to his study of Jackson. The result is an excellent biography of the man and the military leader that is still highly readable and instructive.Henderson's focus is Jackson's role in the Civil War, beginning with his legendary stand at First Manassas in 1861 and continuing through to his death following the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. In between, the author devotes much time to Jackson's famous Valley Campaign of 1862, his uncertain performance in the Battles of the Seven Days, and his status as Lee's best corps commander at Second Manassas, Sharpsburg, and Fredericksburg. The analysis is clear, closely reasoned, and considers the man and the leader. If portions of the text reflect Henderson's Victorian sensabilities, the overall narrative is good history, well-told. \\"Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War\\" is very highly recommended to the general reader and to the student of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War,","review":"If you want to read about Jackson don'twast your time with this book.

So only purchase one."},{"Title":"Spetsnaz: Story Behind the Soviet S.A.S.","review":"Background1. Title and Subject. Spetsnaz is an insight about the secret special forces of Soviet army. The book elaborately encompasses the details about their history, selection and training, traditions, strategies and command and control system.2. Author. Victor Suvrov, author of the book, is an ex Soviet army officer who defected to the West. First edition of the book was published in 1988. The author during his service was directly involved in planning and controlling of Spetsnaz secret force. He has written two other books including \\"The Liberator\\" and \\"Inside the Soviet Army\\"; however, Spetsnaz is given more importance by the West as it covers the military capability of Soviets more thoroughly.3. Thesis. In this revealing book, the author has unfolded details about military code of Spetsnaz, selection, training, strategies, war preparedness and future prospects.Contents4. To make this review logical, the book has been divided in three sections. The first section that includes three chapters describes the concept of Spetsnaz, purpose, history and psychology. The second part comprising nine chapters deals with organizational hierarchy, selection/training, network formation and strategies. The last part involving three chapters deals with command and control system for co-coordinated operations and prospects for future wars.Section I (Chapter No 1, 2 & 3)5. Concept and Mechanics. The author describes the psychological relationship between Spetsnaz soldier and spade by revealing facts about soldier's faith in accuracy of his spade. He explicates the purpose of placing Spetsnaz in between the functions of intelligence and reconnaissance that enables them to successfully engage in espionage and terrorism. He explains how the integrated network involving Spetsnaz forces, professional athletes and foreign agents forms a lethal combination. The author has narrated the primary role and task of Spetsnaz as an instrument to seek, find, attack and destroy tactical nuclear weapons, strategic installations, weapon stockpiles, aircraft/submarine Bases, nerve center, communication network and command and controlling set up by inflicting simultaneous blows.6. Historical Perspective. The author relates the history of Spetsnaz with sixteenth century concept of Utopia that involved stratagem of surprise, deception and stealth. He states that current Spetsnaz operations have a striking similarity with the same. The author narrates introduction of Spetsnaz in Soviet forces, effectiveness of Spetsnaz during the World War II in operations like \\"War of Rails\\", \\"Concerts\\" and Mauchurrian offensive and their cessation and reemergence in 1950s.Section II (Chapter No 4 to 9 & 13)7. Selection and Training Philosophy. The author writes about the selection/training of soldiers in the Spetsnaz units. He argues that tough psychological and physical training of Spetsnaz soldiers is based on the aspect of deprivation. The author declaring this vital states that Spetsnaz philosophy involves cynic and pessimists human beings that operate on extreme limits of existence and such characteristics are essential for them to perform the acts of heroism. He says philosophy of brutality and indignified malice enables Spetsnaz to discharge accumulated cruelty with absolute authority and ferociousness during operations. The writer has also given details of the presence of the soldiers of foreign origin having Soviet nationalities for overseas campaigns.8. Spetsnaz Athletes. The author throws light on including the athletes in Spetsnaz by stating that they are infected with the strong desire for victory. He explains that overseas visits and participation in the competitions enables the athletes to gather valuable information about the potential targets, terrain and climate.9. Agent Network. The writer describes the tremendously stable and vital network of agents who are employed by secret agencies for terrorist operations with Spetsnaz.10. Battle Training and Weapons. The author stipulates that the Spetsnaz are trained on the philosophy of destruction of the enemy. He also indicates that during operations group mobility is paramount. The author also describes the special concealment and deception techniques adopted by Spetsnaz to survive in extremely unfavorable conditions. The author covers the wide variety of weapons and equipment used by a Spetsnaz. However, he clarifies that selection of weapon commensurates with the profile of the mission from modern to simple one like crossbow.Section III (Chapters 12, 14 & 15)11. Command and Control for Coordinated Operations. The writer describes the command and control functions with desired flexibility and autonomy of the commander. He narrates adoption of the philosophy of concentration of forces on the weakest enemy spot for a meaningful blow. He mentions about the coordination between different detachments of Spetsnaz and army.12. Future Prospects. The author describes that the Soviet research agencies are studying to provide interference free environment to Spetsnaz with improvements in clothing, fire power, electronic devices and small airborne vehicles. The writer has also covered probable actions by Spetsnaz in future wars."},{"Title":"The Everything Father Of The Bride Book: A Survival Guide for Dad!

The first several chapters where fine but when references were made about the bachelor party and the FOB attending, I was shocked. It made references to lap dances, nude women, and other things I don't care to mention. I thought it was inappropriate to suggest that those activities are expected. Not every one indulges in those kind of activities and we are proud to say our future son in law wouldn't dishonor our daughter in that way. The problem was that it just didn't mention it in one place but it was repeated in several areas.

The stress on feminism and lesbianism is insistent (though not nearly as unsubtly so as in some of Alther's other books), and the characters are quite cliched - polite Southerners, aloof Northerners, sensitive gays, sophisticated but tricky Parisians and the like. At the same time, the passion and love that are the book's main subject and the light, understatedly dramatic writing style used to depict them are such that the reader will forget about the cliches and be drawn into the story, which is totally, totally gripping.

The book does describe for beginners, and perhaps intermediates, the basics of C and C++ in detail, but on the Builder side no information about Borland extentions such as AnsiString, properties, and __finally. Less than 5% of the book has any Builder specific information. I bought Builder to write Windows applications and there is little about Windows in this book. In the functional descriptions it is hard to determine if the function discussed is a standard, an addition or a depricated function without a careful reading of the text. A header like Borland used to have with a compatibility chart for each function would have helped. Books like the set that Borland used to produce detailed all the features of the language.

Here is the problem. The title of this book is &quot;Borland C++ Builder - The Complete Reference&quot;. Most of the book is on the C language (even if you wanted to learn C, I wouldn't recommend this book because, to me, it appears to be much of a reproduction of the Help Files). OK, Microsoft Windows in written in C; but this book doesn't even teach how to create Windows using C. Then you get to the few chapters (I mean the fea pages) on C++. This section is completely useless because, if the author wanted to write a book on C++, the title of the book would be different; and a C++ learner would expect more than a few pages. I agree: some of the VCL functions, not classes, are documented. Still, the author didn't go farther than the Help Files. I agree that the book is not meant for a particular version but the fact that it pretends to be a C++ Builder &quot;Complete Reference&quot; would cover issues that are common to all versions.This is unfortunate because the author was trying to exploit the lack of documentation on C++ Builder.

Most of them were very badly written, but they were never intended to be high literature. They were for people who read International Combat Arms, a magazine that petered out at the same time as The Guardians series did, around 1991; and Soldier of Fortune, a magazine still in print. They were for people who memorized the specs of every model firearm in the Guns 'N' Ammo Annual, and who would buy any book with a picture of people shooting M-16s on the front, the same way science fiction fans would buy anything with a picture of a space ship.Whether or not Victor Milan, the \\"Richard Austin\\" who wrote at least the first dozen Guardians books, ever was a soldier himself, doesn't matter. This reviewer loved combat novels as a teenager and later became a soldier and a veteran of the Gulf War, and as a major consumer of Men's Adventure I've always remembered The Guardians as the best of that genre. The characters are more interesting and developed and consistent, and the combat itself is both more spectacular and less fanciful than predecessors like Mack Bolan or Phoenix Force.Decades after reading the first nine of these novels, the Amazon Marketplace allowed me to collect the entire series and finish them off. None of the other blood-and-guts novels from the 1980s have tempted me to go back for a re-read, but the Guardians books I'd already read were still just as fun, and the new ones didn't disappoint.Although as an adult I detected huge plot holes that I missed as a teenager, I'm now better able to appreciate Austin/Milan's skill as a story teller. He is a deliberate writer who manages his pace and crafts his scenes and chapters so each contains a complete arc of conflict, resolution and new challenge.Brilliant stuff! If you're looking for deep, contemplative literature, this isn't for you. If you're looking for the best combination of technical accuracy by a genius author who knows technology and combat tactics and politics and geography and who wrote some books that were a snapshot of what the future easily could have been looking forward from 1985, and if you like an unapologetically testosterone-laced tale full of crass language, blood and guts, this is the best place to start."},{"Title":"The Guardians (7 Books in the Series sold as Set: Freedom Fight, Thinder of Hell Night of the Phoenix, Plague Year, Desolation Road, Ammageddon Run and the Guardians)","review":"I have read every book in the series, a number of times.

As a Cold War buff who reads up a lot on conventional and nuclear warfare protocol and other issues of that period I couldn't help but notice at least one BIG technical error. My issue is with transporting the VP from the White House after the war.The book says it was procedure for the vice president to remain at the White house while the president went off in the airborne command post. This is incorrect. In reality with Washington D.C. a likely primary target (command and control) , The Vice President would have been evacuated to a secure location most likely outside of Washington. The same with others in the line of succession. Maybe even airborne himself in a separate aircraft of course .This would have been done sometime before or shortly after the initiation of hostilities in Europe For more details on this process look up anything on Continuity of Government Operations.

They are, or course, equipped with a wide array of really cool guns and gadjets. They also have an arsenal of one liners and dry comments to spout when faced with combat.This book, and the others in this series, read like an ill conceived Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

They took a grimly funny novel about a group of predatory monsters and turned it into a series of light comedies. As splendid as William Powell and Myrna Loy are, they cannot hold a candle to the Nick and Nora portrayed in this novel.Hammett did not write a novel about a sophisticated couple who genteelly solve a murder while pouring cocktails and trading quips. He wrote a dark novel about an ex-detective who has married a wildly wealthy woman, and wants to spend the rest of his life managing her money. He is only faintly connected to the murders, having known the victim and his family briefly several years before, and wants nothing to do with the whole business. He is continually dragged in, however, and very nearly becomes a victim himself. Even a cursory reading of the novel should demonstrate that Hammett was up to much more than a series of one-liners with detective interruptions. Why else would Hammett, one of the most economical of authors, bring the novel to a halt to include a case history of Alfred Packer, the only American convicted of the crime of cannibalism?There is much more here than Hollywood, or anyone else that I know of, has yet realized."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I believe it was F. Scott Fitzgerald who once said, &quot;Hammett is one of those good writers ruined by Hollywood.&quot; This book shows Fitzgerald's quote in action.Don't misunderstand me, 'The Thin Man' is an excellent story. It's amuzing, tense, and contains possibly Hammett's most memorable characters, but it's also a complete departure from his previous novels. In a way, 'The Thin Man' is a farewell. Here we have a once hard-boiled detective, Nick Charles, who has settled down with his wise-cracking wife, Nora, and doesn't want anything to do with his previous work. Instead, Nick drinks, and drinks, and drinks, and goes to parties, and hosts parties, and the like. Whenever anyone questions Nick over the case that he's rumored to be working, Nick simply claims that he doesn't want anything to do with being a detective and leaves it at that.This being Hammett's final novel, I believe that it an all too valid assumption that Hammett was using the character of Nick to symbolize himself and his own mentality. To connect this with Fitzgerald's comment, following the publication of 'The Thin Man', some movie studio handed Hammett a check for something like $40,000 for use of the characters, cementing his literary decrepitude, and he never worked again.But it is a good read, very good, and while I would have liked to have given it the full five stars, i've chosen to remain with four, as 'The Thin Man' just doesn't compare with many of Hammett's other classics."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is one of the best crime novels ever written because it transcends the genre so beautifully, you won't even care about the mystery plot. The characters make it biting, strong and unforgettable, freaks and weirdos alike... Nick and Nora Charles are 2 of the most perfect literary creations in all of fiction. Hollywood cleaned them up a little and made them classy social lushes, but in their original written form, they're cynical, world weary wise acres. Their heavy drinking only adds to the book's appeal. Dashielle dedicated it to his long time love Lillian Hellman, as she, in turn, dedicated a few of her plays to him. The Maltese Falcon is the most famous of Hammett's works, The Daine Curse, his most complicated, Red Harvest, his most violent, The Glass Key, his most bitter. But the Thin Man is the most entertaining. You'll feel like reading it with a bottle of booze at your side."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Boy, these reviews are all over the place, aren't they! Well, they at least give you the plot so I don't have to. Here are some quick comments:There is so much going on in this book that most people miss much of it the first time (as these reviews show), especially if they don't know Hammett's life. As noted, Hammett modeled Nick and Nora on himself and his paramour, budding playwright Lillian Hellman, so it's interesting to see how he dealt in fiction with their relationship and his ultimate failure to cope with success.Yet, \\"The Thin Man\\" works - and works well - as a straight, hard-boiled detective novel, too (which is why none of the characters are particularly likeable). Also, Nora, one of the few, strong female detectives of the pulp magazine era, has inspired countless woman (including Myrna Loy) through the decades.Hammett's sparse style of writing, which many critics (including myself) think Hemingway merely popularized, revolutionized American literature. Each of Hammett's words had to do its part. Similarly, unlike those of earlier detective novels, Hammett's characters committed murder and other mayhem for actual reasons! The notion greatly affected Chandler, Macdonald, and all the others who toiled in the garden Hammett created. His books are all classics of American literature.Some of these reviewers have made too much of the \\"alcoholism\\" in the book. Fact is, a certain, large segment of society in the \`30s - products of Prohibition - did (or wanted to) drink the way the book's characters do and thought nothing of it. Basically, everybody drank in those days. Even the President of the United States had a bootlegger.To my mind, an alcoholic is a person who drinks because he or she _has_ to; these characters drink because they _want_ to. Those revisionist Puritan reviewers just don't understand the context of the drinking in \\"The Thin Man\\".Speaking of Puritans, the city of Boston banned \\"The Thin Man\\" upon release (thereby greatly increasing its sales) because Nora asks Nick if he got an erection while wrestling with one of the female characters. The word - heard without reaction on TV and in the movies these days - was simply too much for the city fathers. (\\"Just a little one\\" Nick answered, if memory serves.) The movie producers could not chance a similar ban on the movie so they cut a lot of the dark humor out of it but introduced Hammett to a lot of people over the world. The problems come when the viewers don't realize the book and the movies are two very different animals.I would love to see \\"The Thin Man\\" made into a movie now - when the producers would respect the work while employing fantastic production values. I'm sure they would remember that Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" did not succeed as a movie until the third try when new producer John Huston wisely utilized most of Hammett's cutting but sparkling dialogue.Hammett wrote five novels and, while they share similar traits, each one is different from the others and each one is an American classic. \\"The Thin Man\\" sees an older, wiser, possibly drunker, Hammett playfully poking fun at himself, Hellman, and the genre he mostly created while staying within the confines of that genre - a difficult trick. \\"The Thin Man\\", the most commercially successful of the five, can stand proudly next to its brothers. You'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"My first Dashiell Hammett book and after reading it I decided I'm hooked on his writing. The plot is tight no doubt, but the ending especially left me thoroughly impressed at the skillful crafting of the story. That aside, the playful banter between Nick and Nora Charles amused, and surely the dry wit of Nick will elicit a chuckle. Add to the whole mix a bunch of crazy characters like the Wynant family who can't seem to talk straight, and you get an absorbing whodunnit with a generous dose of humour."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder. Nick Charles, a retired detective, and his wife Nora find clues while helping a young girl named Dorothy through problems with her abusive mother and crazy suspect of a dad. As the story unfolds the situation turns out to be more complex than a single murder. There are many twists involving many characters that make the murder hard to solve.The characters are well-developed with depth and realistic personalities. Detective Charles sarcastic wit makes him a fun character through which to sift through all the information to solve the murder.Nevertheless the detail of information sifted through in the book can also make parts of the book a slow read. The author goes on large tangents that seem to detract from the story. For example at a party at the beginning of the book Nick is asked about cannibalism in America by a suspects child, Nick hands him a book which is then quoted at great length. Perhaps the author includes this to keep the reader guessing as to its relevance or as a device to show what people may do under extreme circumstances. Either way these side stories make the book drag at parts.Despite being slow in certain sections the character development and the way the author highlights the relevant pieces of information to solve the mystery is satisfying. If the mystery is like walking through a forest to identify which trees are needed to guide the reader through to the far side of the forest, the author describes in detail too many of the trees. Yet, at the end, it is fun when the detective highlights and connects the facts that are part of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a wonderful novel. Written in the classic Hammett style, the story is full of twists and turns of the interaction of well defined, recognizable characters.The central characters are Nick and Nora Charles. Nick has been a history as a successful private detective. Nora is a wealthy socialite. Together they are an intriguing and fun couple, who are forced into investigating the circumstance surrounding the mysterious death of a secretary and the unexplained disappearance of an eccentric,wealthy scientist.The story is so well crafted that everyone becomes a serious suspect and you are left chasing after each individual motive, trying to &quot;figure it out&quot; before the Charles' do.This novel is a classic from start to finish.If you have never watched the classic Black and White movie from the 1930's, THE THIN MAN, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, you have missed out on a treasure, although the book was better and more in-depth.The movie mirrors the book the closest of any I have seen. The reason, Dashiell Hammett was there to keep it true to the novel. Many of the delightful lines are directly out of the book!This is a grand and classic detective tale."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The last of Dashiell Hammett's novels was &quot;The Thin Man,&quot; and what a last novel it is. A hard-edged whodunnit, Hammett's writing had become very polished and his characters even more intricate by the time he wrote this, and while it's not the best he had written, it's a solid example of his work.Nick Charles was a rough'n'tough detective... until he married wealthy socialite Nora. Now he's retired early, drinks a lot, and has no apparent wish to come into contact with his messy past life. Enter Dorothy Wynant, daughter of weird (and possibly insane) inventor Clyde Wynant. As it happens, Wynant's secretary/mistress has just been murdered, and was found dying by his ex-wife Mimi.Nick keeps insisting that he doesn't want to detect, but somehow he gets sucked into it anyway when a gangster (ex-boyfriend of the murdered woman) invades his home and nearly kills him. Dorothy keeps popping up and pleading for help and protection; Charles' old flame Mimi is acting oddly; and her husband has some secrets of his own. Despite Nick's aversion to detective work, he and Nora set out to unravel the mystery surrounding the Thin Man. (Wynant, for your information)Hammett's cynical attitude was a huge part of his writing, but there's a new dimension to it in &quot;Thin Man.&quot; Charles spends a lot of time trying to distance himself from his detective past, and in a way it feels like Hammett was distancing himself from his detective novels. Was Nick's dissatisfaction a sign of Hammett's? Quite possibly.But many of the things about &quot;Thin Man&quot; are vintage Hammett: lying waifs, men in disguise, lots of lying and booze. Almost everyone is sociopathic, and Nick and Nora aren't exactly what one would call &quot;heroes.&quot; However, the dialogue is sharp and witty and the action is slickly exciting. Best of all, Hammett's writing had evolved a bit from his minimalist style; here he describes things like Mimi snarling in a bit more detail.Nick is the quintessential Hammett anti-hero (cynical, tough, and more than a little obnoxious), except here he's a bit weathered and tired out. Sam Spade and the Continental Op were on top of their games, but he's past his. Nora comes across as a little perkier but as tough in her own way. The crazy Wynant family, like manipulative mom Mimi and freaky son Gilbert, serves as a nice source of conflict.&quot;The Thin Man&quot; wasn't the best thing Hammett ever wrote, but it's still a solid mystery read. Pass the martinis."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I love Hammett's fat detective from Red Harvest, etc. but I think this is a wonderful story. The characterizations are razor sharp, the pacing incredible, and there are no false notes, for me at least, through many readings. In a fairly short novel with dozens of characters and settings this is remarkable. The Maltese Falcon is at the top of the genre, but I would put this one just behind. Great fun!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This may be a \\"detective novel,\\" but that's the least of it. The Thin Man is a statement of the good life, and included are plenty of style and sexiness. Nick and Nora Charles are the greatest, most reasonably decadent couple and the final, best commentary on the American high life that was thrown into such relief by the foil of Prohibition. Sure, there's a murder mystery, but there's also raw roast beef and onions, plenty of onions, from an all-night deli, washed down with perpetual scotch and soda. ... Dashiell Hammett wrote Nick Charles in order to be Dashiell Hammett: drunk, yes, but so what? Once great, always great, as long as you leave a legacy that people admire."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"As the year 1932 draws to a close, Nick and Nora Charles of San Francisco are vacationing in Manhattan. Fabulously wealthy and as sophisticated as you can get, Nick and Nora are having a great time ordering up room service, receiving old friends, slumming in speakeasies and generally enjoying what New York has to offer.Before marrying Nora, Nick had been a private detective in New York and a fairly highly regarded one at that. One of his former clients, an eccentric inventor named Clyde Wynant, has been missing since early October and Nick is called upon to assist the police in finding him. The case starts to get complicated when Wynant's secretary is murdered.Helping round out the cast of characters are Wynant's boisterous ex-wife Mimi, his daughter Dorothy who happens to have a crush on Nick, and his son Gil, a very weird young man to be sure.Of the five full length novels completed by Dashiell Hammett, The Thin Man is far and away the one with the most humor running through it. And that is mainly a result of the sophisticated repartee that takes place between the urbane Mr. Charles and his equally witty spouse.As is the case with all of Hammett's fiction, The Thin Man is writtten using very strong sentence structure that makes for smooth reading. Moreover, the plot is solidly constructed and Nick and Nora are both delightfully entertaining characters. The Thin Man very much deserves its place among the classics of American fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"When I see a film based on a novel, I like to read the novel to compare plots and execution. Most of the time the novel or story is fuller than the movie due to the short media time and the target audience. In this case, the novel does have a better-developed plot and is more cohesive. The characters are more true to form and there is a real Rosewood/Rosebrien. However, the book characters are more sinister and Dorothy is sleazy. I planed to make this the last story I would read by Dashiel Hammett. However, others tell me I just picked the wrong one to start with.The film on the other hand, was modified to give a lighter approach. It is the film that I will think of as the real \\"Thin Man\\" and Maureen O'Sullivan as the real Dorothy that was concerned about her father.

For business reasons, they are spending Christmas in New York City where Nick was once a first-class detective. Clyde Wynant, a man that Nick once helped, is missing and his daughter Dorothy (played by Maureen O'Sullivan in the movie) asks Nick to help find him. Nick isn't anxious to get back in the detective game (although Nora wants to see him in action) but when Clyde Wynant's secretary (who is also his lover) is killed and Wynant is suspected, Nick is dragged into the investigation.All the players are here, Mimi Jorgenson, Wynat's ex-wife who is desperately in need of money; Chris Jorgenson, Mimi's current husband; Dorothy and Gilbert Wynant, Wynant's two grown-up children; John Guild, the police detective stuck with this baffling case; Herbert MacCaulay, Wynant's lawyer; Nick Morelli the gangster and speakeasy owner; and Arthur Nunheim, the police stool pigeon and blackmailer. The problem is that none of these characters are in the least bit likable which makes it hard to care about them or even care if Wynant is found. Unlike the movie, Dorothy is a floozy who drinks too much, Mimi beats her children, and Gilbert is beyond eccentric and is simply unbelievable. And the book drags on with side steps into discussions of cannibalism, for example, that really have no point nor do they move the story along.But the main failure of the book is in failing to do what the movie does best... make a couple of Nick and Nora. There is no Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson feel in the book. Nora mostly hangs around comforting Dorothy and keeping Mimi from smacking poor Dorothy around. When the killer is revealed and the case solved, Nora isn't even around... she's back at the hotel. Rarely is a movie better than the book it is based on (Jaws come to mind) but this is one book that is poor compared to the movie. I should add that the book has a gratuitous use of the n-word and stereotypes lesbians as man-haters which made me like the book even less. Yes, I know the book was written in the 30's but still it grates on the modern reader and probably quite a few readers even back in the 30's."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Good book, bad recording.Ever hear Firesign Theatre's \\"Nick Danger\\" episodes, where male actors do the Femme Fatale's voice in falsetto? This recording is exactly the same. Unfortunately, here we are supposed to take the characters seriously. The unintentional humor lasts about five minutes, after which I turned it off and listened to Firesign.The contrast between the realistic male narrator's voice and the absurd falsetto of the females creates a jarring disconnect. Although I did finally listen to all six disks, I never really lost myself in the narrative.Next time, how about just reading the story?"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"What do I love about this book? Let's see: the dialog, the story, the pacing, the characters, the rivers of booze, the gangsters, the weirdos, the Big Apple, the double meaning of the title, the breezy way it all goes down... A timeless classic. I just wish Hammett had been a little more prolific."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"For those of you who allow amature reviewers to guide your reading decisions, know this: Those reviews that talk about the book as being about a \\"destructive relationship\\" and the characters of Nick and Nora Charles as the user and the willing usee have made the mistake of not reading the actual text on the page, but instead have tried to apply some late-twentieth century literaty criticism, which they don't fully know how to apply, paired with the social-moral attitides toward blatant alcoholism and frivolity, to a book that is simply what it purports to be: a detective novel with imperfect characters and a perfectly logical final twist. If they find Nick Charles to be a violent womanizer, one can only imagine what they have made of Chandler's Marlowe . . . although I wouldn't be surprised to find similarly misinformed opinions of those books by the same reviewers if I could be bothered to look for them."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"If you've never read a detective novel, this is a terrific place to start. If you happen to be a seasoned veteran of the genre, you'll find yourself remembering why you started loving detective novels in the first place. The precise, well-crafted plot, lively pace, and vibrant characters help make this underappreciated work a classic."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I imagine for people way into the detectival genre, this is not the book for them. However, the characters in this book are a hoot!! Nobody's telling anyone the whole truth, no one is sure who they can trust. The mystery, as with everything else in this novel, is a bit bizarre, but I think the important part of this book is the characterization. The Wynants/Jorgensons are all nuts. Many of the men are womanizers and boozers. And then there's Nick and Nora. They are one of the most fun couples I've read about. You get the impression that Nora doesn't know much about Nick's past (and really doesn't care). Nick is a good deal older than her, but she has money, so that's all that matters. They are probably the best part of this book. Overall, it is just a fun book to spend an evening with."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"... and intelligent detective work to boot. Nick Charles is teaching his lovely bride Nora about the detective business while on a Christmas vacation in the Big Apple as he gets involved with some old friends. It seems the Thin Man, an eccentric inventer named Clyde Wynant is acting in suspicious ways after his secretary (or is it lover?) is murdered. Equally goofy are his ex-wife and children. This book will entertain and reads very quickly. I can't wait to see the movie and compare it."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book really disappointed. I was looking forward to some clever hard-boiled detective, like Hammett's Sam Spade or Continental Operative. What I got instead was ex-detective Nick Charles, who is medium-boiled, at best.Nick Charles quit the detective game when he married the wealthy Nora, instead managing their (her) fortune and spending most days sleeping late, attending and hosting cocktail parties with the rich, going to all-night clubs, and coming home drunk in the wee hours. While on a trip to New York City he happens to meet up with the 20-year-old daughter of a former client, who of course needs his help. She just wants to find her father, whom she has not seen in many years.Then her father's secretary is found dead, and the father cannot be located (although he keeps sending notes to people). It turns out that nobody has seen the father for several months, except, possibly, the secretary. Several suspects emerge, most notably the missing man and members of his dysfunctional family.The Thin Man contains echoes of Hammett's razor-sharp dialogue, but it seems unnatural for a character who spends most days drinking and socializing with the wealthy. The suspects may be neurotic and slightly immoral, but they are not the street-smart toughs of Hammett's other books. Even the body count pales in comparison, and Nick is in danger only once, almost by accident. And the most disheartening element of all: I anticipated the ending about half-way through.This was Hammett's last novel, even though he lived almost 25 more years. And it was first published, not as a \\"pulp mystery,\\" but as a serial in Redbook, of all places (essentially a woman's magazine). This was in 1933 during the Depression, so maybe he really needed the money. No one knows, even those closest to him, why he never wrote another mystery.The one aspect of this novel that stands out for me is the alcohol use. Nick and Nora have a drink or two, \\"to cut the phlegm,\\" before breakfast. Every time anyone shows up, including the police, they all have drinks. They have drinks with lunch; they have cocktails in the afternoon, they have drinks with late suppers; they go out to late-night clubs and have many, many drinks. I have read that Hammett was an alcoholic. If he drank only half as much as the fictional Nick Charles, it is no surprise that he had a problem.If you want to sample the origin of the hard-boiled detective story, read Red Harvest or The Maltese Falcon, not this one."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Most folks know The Thin Man for the famous 1930s/1940s film series about detective Nick Charles and his socialite wife Nora. The films are known for being breezy and comedic rather than for the actual plot, which typically involves a murder mystery. The original novel The Thin Man is certainly of this mold, which for some might be perfect but for others (like me) a bit disappointing.In The Thin Man we have our handsome couple tinkling champagne glasses in 1930s Manhatten. Our reluctant detective is asked to sort out some shenanigans of a former client, and his very dysfunctional family. We are entertained by cameo appearances of thugs, crooks, and Asta (the family dog). It is all very cutsie without being too silly. However fans of other private detective novels of that genre, especially the Philip Marlowe stories by Raymond Chandler, will find The Thin Man to be too ... thin. No sparkling dialogue, no real nasty characters, ... no \\"oomph\\".Bottom line: painless reading. But see the film, forget the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"For Nick Charles life has become a comfortable routine of running his wife, Nora's, inherited businesses, social gatherings, and stock market investments. Waiting for Nora to return from a Christmas shopping trip he enjoys a drink in a local bar where he is reacquainted with Dorothy, daughter of an old client, Clyde Miller Wynant, who she claims has disappeared and is under suspicion of murdering his assistant. So Nick Charles is reluctantly drawn back into his earlier profession as a private investigator.All is not as it seems, and Nick Charles discovers that Clyde Miller Wynant has been murdered by his attorney, who, in consort with Wynant's ex-wife, is out to lay claim to the Wynant fortune.Dashiell Hammett's writing skills are terribly stretched in what should really been a short story in order to avoid the relentless vapidity of the first 120 pages, after which the story springs to life when the Nick Charles character breaks away from the tiresome and trivial spats between various members of the Wynant household. The book's ending was also pretty dismal, with a kind of tacked on piece to help explain how conclusions were arrived at.As Nora says in the last line \`...it's all pretty unsatisfactory.'The Thin Man is regarded by many commentators as Dashiell Hammett's worst book. And it is. A shame, since the story is intriguing, but too poorly executed to extend its appeal beyond the hardcore fen."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"One of the things about coming to the crime fiction scene so late in my life is that I know the clich&eacute;s before I actually get to their origin point. The same is true for films, too. When I finally saw \\"Casablanca\\" in my 24th year of life, I was amazed at how many phrases/scenes were originally from that movie. It was fun but it lost a little because I had seen cartoon characters utter certain lines for laughs, not human characters saying those lines like they meant it.When I first decided to read Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man, I knew enough of the book to know that the stars of the show were Nick and Nora Charles. I am a child of the 1980s. As such, certain things are ingrained in my head and I bring them to every new adventure I go on. With The Thin Man, \\"Moonlighting\\" and \\"Hart to Hart\\" were the things that moved past Star Wars miscellanea and rare music trivia to set up shop at the forefront of my brain. There they sat, ready to divulge some little chunk of knowledge that might prove useful with my new book.Honestly, I was disappointed. With those two TV shows in my head--and the relationship between the respective couples active in my memory--I read The Thin Man waiting for the book to be like those shows I remembered. It didn't happen. Granted, the book was published in 1934, but I expected a little more involvement from Nora. There are large chunks of the book where she's relegated to their hotel room while Nick, the former PI, goes off and solves the case. True, Nick and his cop pal, Guild, go to places a socialite like Nora wouldn't want to go to, but still, I'd have thought she'd be in more scenes. And take a look at that cover. Glamor and intrigue ooze from the cover painting. Didn't find much in the prose.The story itself is light but not in a bad way. Much of the action is relayed to Nick or Nora by other characters telling a story. As a modern writer whose mantra is \`show don't tell,' some of the scenes were annoying. The dialogue between Nick and Nora was fun and the reader, William Dufris, does a remarkable job of speaking in multiple female voices.Another preconceived notion I had going in was a direct result of an earlier Hammett novel, Red Harvest. In that novel, much blood is shed. I kind of expected some more blood but I guess The Thin Man was something of a cozy in hard-boiled clothing."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Having come off of reading Maltese Falcon and watching the Thin Man movie, I had high expectations for the book. Unfortunately I found it extremely dull, and the characters Nick and Nora, who are so vibrant and alive on screen, are two dimensional alcoholic drips on paper. It took a lot of time to get through this book, and in the end, I didn't care what happened. Although the movie doesn't have much of a plot, it is far more entertaining than the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the first novel I have ever read where I cared nothing at all about any of the characters(excepting Asta, the dog). I actually wished, while slogging through, that all of the characters would die so that I could stop reading.None of the characters feel real and the prose itself is choppy. I realize that I'm looking at this novel through modern eyes, which is unfair, but it seemed that all the women do is cry, lie, and answer the phone, which grates on my nerves.If it weren't required for school, I would have been done with this book two pages in. Save your money."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is the last novel from the creator of the crime novel, Dashiell Hammett. This is my first Hammet book, and I have to admit that the mystery--the assistant to an eccentric and missing inventor is murdered--wasn't what kept me turning the pages of this book. (Or rather, hitting the forward button on my Kindle.) As I read, what I liked most was Hammett's crisp portrayal of the times in the ways his characters spoke and acted. For example, in a time of prohibition, the characters, especially the main characters, Nick Charles and his wife, seemed to be drinking all the time. And there's also a light, but easy misogyny, representative of the times, but probably something that will seem a little off for most modern readers.Nick is the main character, a former detective who tries just as hard to avoid getting involved in the case as others try to bring him in. But he's living the high-life, not working, living off his investments during a depression, and he doesn't seem to want to ruin that. His obstinacy and sharp tongue provide for many funny moments, and also serve as highlights in the book.In fact, I almost found this more of a comic novel, with an edge satirical of the times, rather than a crime novel. I haven't read any of his other novels, so can't compare to determine if this one book was an exception, but I think most modern readers looking for a crime novel, with their tastes shaped by our modern penchant for more intense suspense and plenty of violence, will find this book too tame to satisfy. But if you want a short and funny look at a chaotic and vastly different time in our history, this might do it for you."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Maltese Falcon is like film noir fine wine; The Thin Man is the hangover. This was Dashiell Hammet's last novel and it's apparent he was tired. But that's not a knock.The story starts off noir-ish enough: a woman approaches a detective about a murder case. But then you realize the main character Nick wants nothing to do with the case and is seemingly dragged in. He needs alcohol to even function around everyone. He's tired, knows the game and just wants to rest.There's a four page story about cannibalism that stops the plot; incest is randomly mentioned. This is unlike anything any other author has attempted in noir. Facetious? Yes. Boring? Nope. The random subjects touched upon suggest a deeper, darker meaning. And I've yet to mention the scumbag character Mimi and her pesky games. It's obvious Hammet cynically cackled writing portions of this book.Sadly, many people find fault trying to read this as straight noir. For that, check out Hammet's other novels. Ideally, a reader will ponder what they think are flaws in this story (maybe Nora's underdeveloped character?) and ponder if Hammet had hidden meaning in it (statement about marriage?). I still don't know what Hammet's exact meaning is with this book. Though, the deeper I go, the better it gets."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I know I'm in the minority in this, but I liked this book much better than The Maltese Falcon! I really enjoyed it.Nick Charles is a newly married former private detective who gets pulled into a murder/missing person case unwillingly. He has no choice because the people connected with the case will not leave him alone.His wife Nora doesn't seem to mind - she is fascinated by the case and helps as much as possible. Nora was impressive; a great female lead. Nothing seems to rattle her.(I gotta say, the family under investigation in this book is completely CRAZY. Rarely have I met a weirder bunch of people. Kooky and entertaining.)"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the book the first movie is based on. Also some of the scenes were used in later movies. The book is a lot more serious, hinting at relationships that would never be allowed on the big screen's version of the story. While some things are funny it isn't really a comedy like the movies were. The characters are crisp, realistic, and sometimes people you would never wish to run into in a dark alley.On the other hand it did seem to drag just a tad. I think it is because there were scenes in the book that were never in the movie, giving it a feel that suggested it was being padded, which it was not. The movie was edited heavily when compared to the book, so if you enjoyed the movie you may feel the book is slow.I would suggest reading the book first and then, if you wish, watching the films.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was my second Hammett read after the Maltese Falcon, and the contrast was impressive. While the former book was dark and mysterious, the Thin Man had a lighter feel, an aloofness which attests to the author's changed life circumstances. Yet while some fans of the earlier style may find this disappointing, it's important to judge each work on its own merits and in the contextual frame of the time and world in which it was written. And with this view, The Thin Man clearly deserves five stars.As a pure mystery, it was solid: the reader has a chance to guess \\"whodunnit\\" based clues. But the real value goes well beyond the plot. The Thin Man provides a window into its time, the Great Depression following the social liberation of the preceding decade.It's a little bit sad that this was Hammett's final novel, as he is clearly one of the great writers of his time. Indeed he even appeared to have difficulty getting this one out: more time had passed since the publication of The Glass Key than it had taken him to write all of his preceding four novels. But maybe it's better his work was so reserved: compare with many modern mystery riders who turn the crank one or two times per year, year after year, producing story after story with the same characters and style. That Hammett was able to produce works of such contrast within the genre of detective fiction is a testimony to his talent, and to the importance of each. I'll certainly read them all."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The last of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, THE THIN MAN seems lighter, more superfluous, than the other two I have read, THE MALTESE FALCON and THE DAIN CURSE. Perhaps. But Hammett's name is almost synonymous with crime noir. Even his lighter work reveals something much darker than might be apparent at first glance.Nick and Nora Charles, the detectives introduced here, are markedly different than Hammett's other creations. Elegant in a way that the Continental Op could never be, superfluous in a way that would make Sam Spade sneer, they are an insufferably smug couple that are at times rather difficult to like. They spend whatever free time they have drinking and socializing and seeming oh so important.In New York on vacation, the couple is pressed into service by an old friend to look for a missing man. They enter, or perhaps merely describe, a world of moral vacuity for which Hammett was, and still is, so well known. The lies, evasions and apathy of almost everyone in the book are universal. Underneath the light banter and eternal cocktail hour, Hammett presents a view of the upper crust as having a beautiful veneer as thin as cigarette paper which, when torn away, reveals the dark underbelly of contempt towards anyone outside of their own little circle.Although I liked THE THIN MAN, I am also glad that Hammett did not use Nick and Nora for any of his other novels (I have read many of Hammett's stories and do not recall seeing them in any; if they are, they are not major figures in Hammett's canon). Like a strange label of beer that I can enjoy for a bottle, but which becomes distasteful after two, the Charles are an interesting pair to be sparingly sampled."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Back in the days when a cigarette wasn't the cinematic equivalent of a black hat and when real men had scotch for breakfast, Nick and Nora Charles enthralled Depression-era America with their witty repartee, beautiful clothes, and glamorous parties. And with their idleness - they didn't work! All this wealth but no work! All they did was drink, sleep, throw parties and solve the occasional crime.The book is clipped and breezy. Nick is economical in his words, not least because talking slows down his drinking. (Reporter: Say listen, is he working on a case? Nora Charles: Yes, he is. Reporter: What case? Nora Charles: A case of scotch. Pitch in and help him. ) There are frequent asides, the hard-boiled detective equivalent of \`yadda, yadda, yadda,' to skim over the pleasantries and glad handing that consume so much dialog in books and movies.\\"The Thin Man,\\" like the movies that followed it, is heavy on style and that makes it a pleasant read. As a book its aims are modest, its execution is excellent, and you just enjoy the journey from mysterious murder to having everything neatly wrapped up, courtesy of your tour guide to both the under and over worlds of New York, Nick Charles.Watch also \\"After The Thin Man,\\" which is the tenth best mystery/detective film set in San Francisco and the second best of the Thin Man series of movies (based on my analysis as a reader/watcher of San-Francisco based noir/detective books and movies)."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"There are three things that stand out about this novel in the 21st century:1. Liquor is the glue that seems to hold all the relationships together; it's always easy to be charming when everyone is \\"tight\\" with alcohol.2. The word \\"tight\\" has certainly evolved away from its meaning in this book, and it took me a couple of times seeing the context to realize what it meant.3. Hammett does not pretty over anything. All the foibles and faces of the various characters are there to see, making them far more realistic... and tragic than so many characters in the novels and mysteries of today.I highly recommend this short novel to anyone who's heard of the old 1930's mystery noir but not read Hammett or Chandler."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This fast-paced mystery by Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) plays out with humor and suspense. Nick Charles is a hard-drinking and hard-bitten ex-detective now living the high life of 1930's New York sophisticate with his wealthy wife Nora - whom he also teaches about the detective business. Despite their heavy drinking and cynicism, both remain decent persons. They are soon enlisted in the search for Clyde Wynant, a successful inventor who has disappeared. Did he vanish on his own or was he the victim of kidnapping or worse? A mysterious letter arrives and helps set the ball rolling. The mystery proceeds with a rapid mix of mystery, suspense and humor though the final pages.I liked THE MALTESE FALCON even more, but mystery fans won't go wrong with either of Hammett's most famous efforts."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Dashiell Hammett is perhaps better known for creating the classic modern prototypical detective, one Sam Spade the detective-hero (or anti-hero, if you prefer) of the literary noir Maltese Falcon. With the Thin Man he took a different tack in providing a model detective- the urbane Nick Charles, his side-kick society wife Nora and their ever present faithful dog companion, Asta. The story line here centers on a missing eccentric inventor/businessman who it is suspected has been a victim of foul play. Enter Nick, Nora and Asta at the request of his wondering society family (wondering, that is, about the fate of the dough necessary to keep them in their luxuries) and after a series of misadventures and false leads Nick grabs the villain. That is what old Nick has in common with the illustrious Mr. Spade-the dogged (not pun, intended) and tenacious search for the truth and the killer, come what may. If you like your detectives with a light touch this is for you. If you like your detective novels to be minor workS of literary art this is also for you. Hammett (along with Raymond Chandler) practically reinvented the previously rather shabby art of the early detective story into literature. Kudos."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Let me begin by noting that I am reviewing the audio cassette version of The Thin Man that stars Daniel J. Travanti as Nick Charles and Lynne Lipton as his young and wealthy wife, Nora.If you are like me, you met The Thin Man first in the movie series. Those movies have Nick Charles straddling the gap between the &quot;haves&quot; and the tough guy world with insouciance as he waltzes with the wealthy socialites and unravels fatal plots. The book itself is much darker, directly suggesting alcoholism, incest, adultery, and all the minor crimes . . . and deadly sins. The view is that humans are thoroughly flawed, but some can rise above that to serve others anyway. That is the nobility of the Nick Charles character . . . as he staggers out of bed in the afternoon with yet another hangover. Helping out old clients is his source of redemption against the temptations he cannot resist.The world view is probably somewhat autobiographical as Hammett spent more of his time in Hollywood late in his career, rather than working as a fiction writer. The echoes of F. Scott Fitzgerald are very strong, especially to Tender Is The Night.For those who love the classic &quot;tough guy&quot; stories by Hammett, this one can never have the same appeal. Nick is still tough, but he mostly shows it by taking abuse with style. That's a feminine kind of toughness that comes from maturity. He passes off the chances to trade punches when they arise.The characterizations of Nick and Nora Charles are the strength of the novel. But the book transcends that by also creating a picture of a flawed marriage between two people with hearts of gold who love each other, but are also killing each other. The development of the relationship is brilliant.I would like to especially note that the acting by Daniel J. Travanti as Nick brings a great sensitivity to the role. When I read the book, I put a snarl into a lot of the Nick lines when he is beset by yet another visitor or telephone call. Mr. Travanti wisely chooses to share an equivocal openness instead. I think his reading is correct, and added much to my appreciation of the story. Whoever cast him for this role deserves commendation as well.The mystery itself isn't very mysterious. It just has lots of red herrings. If you judge mysteries by the quality of the plot unfolding of that mystery, you will probably rate this book at 3 or 4 stars. I rated this audio cassette version for 5 stars based on the story line about the nature of modern people and relationships, and the superb acting by Mr. Travanti.After enjoying this dramatization of the story, I suggest that you think about what temptations are difficult for you to resist. How will those temptations undermine your life and your relationships? How can you occupy yourself in ways so that there will either be less temptation or you will be more able to resist it?To your good health and that of all your relationships!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I'm a Hammett fan - the snappy dialogue, the whole noir-schtick. Facing a long layover (and longer flight), and having never read any of Hammett's \\"Nick and Nora\\" mysteries, I gave _The Thin Man_ a read. While the elements of Hammett that I always enjoy remained the same, the characters just didn't click with me the way Spade does.The _Thin Man_ is set in New York City - a far cry from the San Francisco, the city I most readily associate with Hammett (it was both his hometown as well as that of Spade), the protagonists here urbane, wealthy, and dashing: they could not be more different than the hard bitten, cynical Spade. Nick and Nora Charles are to Same Spade what the White Sox fans are to regular attendees to the Chicago philharmonic (no knock on either, and to those who attend both, more power to you.) I assume Hammett was either spreading his literary wings, or was wanting to avoid his characters getting stale. They could not be more different.The plot revolves around a series of murders involving a socialite's dysfunctional family, the pater familias a person of interest in the crimes. The MacGuffin is that the comings and goings of the father are as etheral and elusive as the murderer him (or her-)self. As the story moves along and the list of suspects shifts, is modified and changes again as suspect after suspect is corssed off the list of possible candidates for the crime as they, too, end up in the morgue, the father a shadow - making him both the perfect suspect and a possible target for the next killing.The mystery eventually became so tangled and convoluted that I eventually gave up trying to figure out \\"who dunnit\\" and simply resigned myself to letting Hammett take me where he would, trusting that he'd eventually solve the crime and connect the dots for me. Thankfully he did, although I remain a bit fuzzy on exactly how the murderer led me (and Nick and Nora) on such a merry chase. In terms of difficulty, _The Thin Man_ is a double-black diamond.The real attraction of Hammett to me has always been his writing rather than his sluething. And while there is witty banter, wise-cracks and some snap to the exchanges between the characters, I remain much more a fan of Sam Spade. _The Thin Man_ is a good mystery, but the characterization just wasn't as compelling."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I grew up watching Myrna Loy and William Powell play Nick and Nora Charles on the silver screen. I chose The Thin Man, by Dashiell Hammett for my book club in February. And even though I have seen the movie several times- and even studied it in college- I was still guessing and intrigued until the very end. This is a wonderful step into the \\"hard-boiled school of detective fiction\\". Murder, mayhem, the mob- all are present but with a love story that seems both imaginable and desirable. Nick and Nora Charles have an intelligent and loving marriage and are embroiled in a deadly mystery during 1930s prohibition New York- with just the right amount of screwball comedy."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"An old story. It is amazing what changes there have been in culture since the 20's or 30's. In this book, they drink and smoke from morning till night. The humor is great and so is the story.

I will not give out the plot twist, read it."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Dashiell Hammett along with James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler is one of the trinity of hard boiled fiction's trinity of great authors! Hammett was the longtime lover of playwright Lillian Hellmann, a former Pinkerton agent in Baltimore and a member of the United States Army. His many short stories and novels have earned him a rightful place in American letters.The Plot of The Thin Man-Nick Charles is a private detective who has become rich. He is wealthy because he is married to Nora Charles whose family is wealthy. Nick and Nora love to make smart cracks, drink booze and attend plays and parties. Their little dog Asta is an adorable creature! In this early 1930's novel the story is narrated in the first person by Nick. A very eccentric inventor named Wygant is missing. His secretary Julia Wolff is found murdered. Nick and Nora are friends with Wynant's family especially young Dorothy the daughter of the inventor. The Charles become involved in finding the murderer and locating the inventor.This is a short but entertaining novel that hardboiled fans will love!

That's what happened with Nick Charles, who had managed to marry a gorgeous woman with tons of money. He didn't need detective work to pay the bills. He had a few accounts to manage, some stocks to buy, and some martinis to drink. So he didn't want to get involved with the murder of the secretary of a man for whom he once worked. But I doubt he could turn off his curiosity or sense of justice any more than he could stop observing the world like a detective. Even when a small fight broke out while he was sharing a cheap champagne at a speakeasy with a man he had sent up the river several years prior, he couldn't help noticing that the more-or-less-former thug still led with his right. It was that mistake which the two men had agree allowed Nick to bag the thug back when they were on opposite sides of the law.\\"The Thin Man\\" is a great crime novel. It's very funny in parts, and if you have seen the movie series based on Nick and Nora Charles, both movie and book characters are alike in the sexy wit that has appealed to many readers and viewers for decades.Some readers have found it dark, but I do not. Nick has a sharp, funny way of looking at the people in his life which lightens any darkness from the corrupt people he deals with, and his interaction with Nora is priceless. Certainly it is a hard-boiled detective novel because the plot doesn't go off on unrelated tangents, but I think the story is great fun."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"A 2007 Summer reading list mini review.I just finished listening to Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man read by William Dufris. If I had actually read it, I would certainly call it a page turner. Hammett turns a phrase with the best of them, and Dufris does an excellent job embodying the narrator: sleuth sophisticate Nick Charles and the rest of the assundry characters that populate Hammet's world.I think listening rather than reading helped me to catch the atmosphere of this detective novel. And what atmosphere there is! There's lies and there's sex on this audiotape. There is so much drinking in this book, that I will probably wake up with a hangover, and I never touch the stuff. But besides the whiskey, there is also the wry sensibility of Nick Charles. Hammett never lets Nick lose control of the caper and that makes for an enjoyable read or listen for the audience."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the third work by Dashiell Hammett that I picked up, the others bein Red Harvest and The Dain Curse. While I enjoy Hammett's sharp and colorful prose, these stories left me wanting a little more. In the case of Red Harvest, the crooks and the gunfights had an over-the-top B-Movie essence; The Dain Curse has more of the same, with an extemely offensive racist portrayal of a character thrown in.The Thin Man marks the first time I have thoroughly enjoyed a Dashiell Hammett novel. The tale is told in the first person by Nick, who is a retired private eye who quit the business after marrying the independently wealthy Nora. Nick and Nora essentiality live life at parties or lazing at home, almost always with cocktails in hand. What makes this duo so charming is their easygoing marriage in which they display affection for one another more via wisecracks than kisses. On top of that, playful Nora is the one person who has Nick's number: he can say no to anything and anybody excepting his wife, for whom he is head over heels.While Nick & Nora Charles are the characters who steal the spotlight, Hammett paints a fantastic array of characters involved in the disappearance of an eccentric inventor named Clyde Wynant, as well as the murder of his secretary. Most entertaining is the trio of Clyde's family: his ex-wife Mimi (a shallow woman who tries to lie her way out of trouble, with little success), son Gilbert (fragile inquisitive young man intrigued with detective work, human nature, and the effects that illegal drugs have on the mind and emotions), and Dorothy (manic young woman who recognizes her family's erratic behavior, but has trouble tempering her own identity).The majority of other characters are the colorful and pulpy gangsters, thugs, and cops. You will not find the coarse, gritty realism of a Raymond Chandler story. The Thin Man is more of a \\"Who Dunnit?\\" romp that deals with the collection of dysfunctional folks who have ties with the disappearance and the murder.When all is said and done, Dashiell Hammett leaves \\"The Thin Man\\" as a solid packaging consisting of both his excellent descriptive writing and a well plotted story. This story, and nearly any Raymond Chandler novel, are good places to start if you are new to the detective fiction genre."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Unlike the famous film version starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, the characters of Dashiell Hammett's THE THIN MAN range in tone from vapid to vicious, with only Nick and Nora Charles emerging as somewhat similar to their cinematic counterparts. The plot is also considerably less lean, and Hammett packs it with a number of unnecessary excursions that tend to sidetrack the flow of action. The result is less of an action-packed detective story than it is a portrait of New York in the early 1930s, where cops are brutal and stupid, society rubs shoulders with criminals in lowlife speakeasies, and every one is out for what they can get.And what they want are sex and money and more sex, preferrably laced with bootleg liquior. Fans of the film will easily recognize the basic plot: retired detective Nick Charles is unwilling dragged into the search for a former client, inventor Clyde Wynant, who is wanted for questioning in connection with the brutal murder of his secretary-mistress. But not only the police want him: ex-wife Mimi is low on funds and would like to lay hands on his dough, his estranged children Dorothy and Gilbert have vested interests of their own, and Mimi's current husband is playing his own hand as well. The characters are considerably darker here, particularly in reference to Dorothy and Gilbert, with Dorothy a manipulative and hard-drinking little tramp and Gilbert an ineffectual weakling; mother Mimi is viciously neurotic and abusive; and the missing Clyde Wynant is so eccentric that whether or not he had a hand in the murder he clearly needs to be locked up. To further complicate matters, both Dorothy and Mimi are on the make for Nick Charles. As for Nick and wife Nora, they possess considerable sparkle--but they too are of this world, Nick clearly en route to an alcoholic hell and pulling Nora along with him.Hammett writes with his usual strength, but as a novel THE THIN MAN lacks the focus of his more famous THE MALTESE FALCON, and his digressions and excursions hinder the book as a whole. Even so, his dark and frequently witty look at the underbelly of depression-era New York packs enough punch to bring it in at a solid four stars. Recommended for fans of the classic \\"hard boiled\\" style, but probably of more interest to hard-core completists than casual readers."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The writing is OK, but Hammett tries to describe a life style that, in my opinion, never was. Two words."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Having now listened to two of Dashiell Hammett's works -- The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man -- I am scratching my head at how they have managed to be such enduring classics. Unless it is just that they were such different, ground-breaking books at the time they were published that they made an indelible mark in the world of literature.For me, I am not a Dashiell Hammett fan. His books are all about snappy dialogue and action, peopled with interesting but shallow characters who never show any true emotions. There is lots of melodrama but very little real feeling. I didn't find Nick and Nora Charles all that admirable -- for one thing, Nick Charles drank from morning to night and was almost never sober. But I will have to say that Dashiell Hammett's books do give an interesting, and I must assume accurate, picture of 1930s New York (or, in the case of The Maltese Falcon, San Francisco). As for the mystery aspect, it is so-so. Hammett likes to tangle and intertwine the relationships of his characters like a plate of spaghetti, so that you end up feeling everyone is at least a little bit guilty, including the person who was murdered.William Dufris is an excellent narrator who somehow manages to give each of the large cast of characters their own distinctive voice."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was a gift to my granddaughter. She had read it, but wanted to keep it because she loves the story. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I could not believe how well this book is written. A great detective story written with style, wit and intelligence."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"First of all, anybody who's read any of my reviews, knows I love the old hardboiled detectives from the thirties and fourties. These guys had to use thier brains, not some hidden camera, DNA, whatever the latest CSI science gimic is.Since none of this existed when Dash was arround, he never even thought of it. It has brilliant character developement thru out. You can even see \\"the Thin man\\" even though he never makes an appearence. My habit is the listen to it initially to hear the story, plot, etc. Then immediately listen to it a couple more times to see if there are any gafts, errors, etc. There are none. The only thing I'm not sure of is why a sudden narative on a wild west cannibal even though Dash does fit it in for no apparent reason. It has nothing to do with the story.The narrative is excellent, the story is classic. And if you think, you'll justwatch the movie instead, you'll miss a lot. The movie is different, even though it is good also."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder. Nick Charles, a retired detective, and his wife Nora find clues while helping a young girl named Dorothy through problems with her abusive mother and crazy suspect of a dad. As the story unfolds the situation turns out to be more complex than a single murder. There are many twists involving many characters that make the murder hard to solve.The characters are well-developed with depth and realistic personalities. Detective Charles sarcastic wit makes him a fun character through which to sift through all the information to solve the murder.Nevertheless the detail of information sifted through in the book can also make parts of the book a slow read. The author goes on large tangents that seem to detract from the story. For example at a party at the beginning of the book Nick is asked about cannibalism in America by a suspects child, Nick hands him a book which is then quoted at great length. Perhaps the author includes this to keep the reader guessing as to its relevance or as a device to show what people may do under extreme circumstances. Either way these side stories make the book drag at parts.Despite being slow in certain sections the character development and the way the author highlights the relevant pieces of information to solve the mystery is satisfying. If the mystery is like walking through a forest to identify which trees are needed to guide the reader through to the far side of the forest, the author describes in detail too many of the trees. Yet, at the end, it is fun when the detective highlights and connects the facts that are part of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The year is 1932. Nick and Nora Charles have decided to spend Christmas in New York, away from their California home and family business. Nick was a hard-drinking hard-nosed private detective before he married Nora. But Nora's family money paid for his early retirement, and now he wants nothing to do with the investigation business. One afternoon when Charles is out drinking, he runs into Dorothy Wynant, the daughter of an old client of his. She's looking for her father, an eccentric old inventor named Clyde Wynant. When the headlines splashed across the next day's newspaper say that the inventor's secretary and mistress, Julia Wolf, has been found shot to death in her apartment, a lot of people begin to wonder about Clyde Wynant's whereabouts. Mr. Wynant's lawyer, Herbert Macaulay, plies Nick for information. Clyde Wynant's ex-wife Mimi also questions Nick about her former husband. Dorothy Wynant flees her mother and step-father's apartment, and Nora invites her to stay at hers. Nick finds himself in the middle of a mystery he never wanted to know about. But when a thug forces his way into the Charles' apartment at gunpoint and the police shake Nick down for answers, he is left with no choice but to investigate the case. Nick's investigation takes him to New York's speakeasies and into its underworld, through the sordid affairs of the Wynant family, and leads to two more murders before Nick is confident he has cracked the case.Fans of the 1934 film \\"The Thin Man\\", which starred William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, will likely be a bit shocked when they read Dashiell Hammett's novel on which the film was based. Although the film is excellent in its own right, the characters were altered beyond recognition to make them more palatable to a wide audience. Dashiell Hammett's novel is hard-boiled and cynical beyond words. Nick Charles is a violent drunk who married young Nora for her money so that he could spend the rest of his days sleeping and drinking and would never have to work again. Nick and Nora don't like each other very much and don't treat each other very well. The only interest they share is found in the bottom of a whisky glass. All of the characters in \\"The Thin Man\\", regardless of social status, are hardened and, in one way or another, quite depraved. There are no likable characters in this novel. It would not be an exaggeration to say that every one of them is a pathological liar and a sociopath. But \\"The Thin Man\\" is a good read. The characters, although distasteful, are well-drawn, and Hammett renders every scene vividly. The dialogue crackles with sardonic wit and is the novel's great strength. Dashiell Hammett's novels and stories were extremely popular in the 1920's and 1930's. Readers had a real taste for the blunt talk and bold-faced corruption that reflected urban culture at the time. \\"The Thin Man \\" would have fewer fans if were written today. Even if people could get past its cynicism and lack of sympathetic characters, many modern readers will be put off by the novel's abusive attitude toward women and the fact that everyone is so alcoholic that his/her ability to function and speak with any coherence at all really stretches credibility. But I recommend \\"The Thin Man\\" precisely because it isn't like modern crime novels. Dashiell Hammett's style is admirable. It won't put you in a good mood, and you may not even be sure that the mystery was solved in the end. But you'll be entertained."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book makes for very good reading. The plot and characters are very well thought out and developed. Well written all around! I recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"What a difference three years can make. Between 1930 (when Hammett finished \\"The Glass Key,\\" perhaps his bleakest work) and 1933 (when he published \\"The Thin Man,\\" his last novel), Hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life: a steady income from book sales and from Hollywood filmwriting and, perhaps more important, Lillian Hellman.There's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love: Hammett's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of \\"The Thin Man\\" he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book, which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels.While his first four novels, as well as the early draft, featured an anti-Establishment loner (the Continental Op, Sam Spade, Ned Beaumont), \\"The Thin Man\\" introduces Nick and Nora Charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in New York (which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue) to solve a murder. Readers with only a passing knowledge of Hammett's biography will recognize both Hammett and Hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife.What also separates \\"The Thin Man\\" from Hammett's other full-length works is its giddy humor, which revolves around seedy nightlife, early-morning alcohol consumption, and Nick and Nora's freethinking rapport, while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself. The morning after being grazed by a bullet, Nora asks Nick: \\"How do you feel?\\" \\"Terrible, I must've gone to bed sober.\\" This playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures.Many Hammett fans have long regarded \\"The Thin Man\\" as his weakest novel, and I tend to agree--up to a point. This book lacks the quality for which the others are famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word). Although it's a sophisticated Manhattan comedy, Hammett's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits, and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often doesn't ring true. Even so, it's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The story begins when Dorothy Wynant asks Nick Charles to help locate her father Clyde Wynant who has gone away. Wynant's lawyer Macaulay visits Nick to confer with him. The next day Nick reads that Julia Wolfe, Clyde's \\"confidential secretary\\" was found shot to death (Chapter 3). Chapter 5 shows Hammett's skill at conversational dialogue. A visitor brings excitement to their rooms (Chapter 8). Dorothy has problems at home (Chapter 9). Lieutenant John Guild visits Nick and tells him about the case (Chapter 11). Clyde Wynant sent a letter to his lawyer from Philadelphia (Chapter 12). Is the story about Alfred G. Packer padding or a clue (Chapter 13)? Nick learns more about Mimi's current husband's past (Chapter 19).Chapter 22 tells what it was like in a speakeasy for Nick Charles when he meets people. We learn more about some people's past. Mimi, the former wife of Clyde, has something new to say (Chapter 23). Wynant called his lawyer Macaulay for a meeting (Chapter 26). There is a new development when Wynant's son Gilbert gets a letter (Chapter 28). Then Mimi tells about what happened (Chapter 29). Lieutenant Guild shows up with more news, and there is a solution (Chapter 30). The loose ends are tied up in Chapter 31. Nick explains how a theory of murder is created from what makes sense from the known facts. They can't wait for \\"every little detail\\".This 1972 paperback book cover has a picture of Dashiell Hammett, a thin man in real life. This fast-paced and very readable book was one of Hammett's best novels (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\" was the other). It was also his last novel. His later years were spent in Hollywood working on film scripts. The film of this novel was also excellent, although changed for a visual media and simplified. Its success led to a series of films, as happens with other popular films. This 75-year old novel also tells something about life in those days."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man, Dashiell Hammett's high-society detective novel, is most definitely NOT like the movies based on the book. While the movies are about a gay, carefree couple who solve crimes and do a lot of social drinking, the book is more about a couple in a destructive relationship. Nick only married Nora for her money, and they both know it. He's also a womanizer and an alcoholic (as is Nora). Nora is a younger woman who seems enchanted by Nick's sinful ways, and allows him to use her as he feels free to. The whodunit mystery, although discussed very much in the book, is not the most interesting part of the novel, nor did Hammett intend it to be. Read it for the satirical potrayal of bad relationships. Not just Nick and Nora's, but the dysfunctional (although dysfunctional may be an understatement) family they help to solve the murder.The Thin Man is also notable for the use of a certain word to describe male arousal. Hammett was attempting to pave the way for other authors to discuss sexuality more openly. Unfortunately, it didn't quite catch on."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book actually is worth reading a couple of times. Read it the first time for fun, but then reread it to see what you missed seeing the first time around.You probably know the basic plot. A former private eye has given up on the detective work after his wife has inherited her father's businesses, and is running her financial affairs for her. On vacation, they run into his former acquaintances and, of course, a mystery develops which he reluctantly is persuaded to investigate.There are a lot of undertones here. The obvious fact is that both husband & wife are slipping into alcoholism, although he's ahead of her. He has lost interest in what was once his very life. He apparantly slips out on her on occasion, and she seems to tolerate it...they obviously love each other. But he's not the man he once was. He's going to avoid violent confrontations and he takes the easy way out. His drinking habit, his unwillingness to exert himself in solving a crime, the fact that the only noticeable cheating on Nora is at a party where the other woman apparantly drags him off...all this indicates a once vital person such as Sam Spade or, to compare with another author's detective, Phillip Marlowe who is losing interest in life.I wonder if this book didn't inspire Raymond Chandler's idea for POODLE SPRINGS which opens with Phillip Marlowe's having married a wealthy woman. Chandler only wrote four chapters before his death and Robert Parker finished it, showing Marlowe as too rough hewn a character to settle into the wealthy life style.But Nick Charles gave in to it, and maybe was worse off for doing so.This isn't the strongest of Hammett's books, but it sure is worth reading and wondering a bit about."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Contrary to what someone else wrote in these posts, the novel is very much like the movie, except it gets away with things the Code wouldn't allow Powell and Loy to get away with. It's uncanny how the screenwriter nailed the tone of the book and the voices of the Charleses -- as you read it, Powell's and Loy's voices come right through. It's fast-paced, witty, and, as someone else in here said, the mystery's not the thing. The banter is. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The characters are great. The plot twists are clever. The setting in a time that is long gone.I thoroughly enjoyed this old favorite once again."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"if you like the thin man movies this is a must read 4 you. this is where it all started."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man was Dashiel Hammet's final novel. It sticks with the familiar hard boiled themes and motifs common in his previous works like the Continental Op series or The Maltese Falcon. There are scenes showcasing the gritty underbella of prohibition era America and the thugs and speakeasies of the time. Where the Thin Man takes a different tack is that our main hero is a \\"retired\\" detective Nick Charles. Nick got married 4 years ago to Nora, a rich socialite from the West Coast. When Nora's father died, Nick left detective work behind and has taken on some responsibility for overseeing the businesses. Granted, his level of \\"oversight\\" seems to involve hobnobbing, spending money and doing a lot of drinking.The novel is set during Christmastime in New York City. Nick and Nora are enjoying a luxurious vacation when Nick runs into Dorothy, the daughter of a family he did detective work for years ago. Her father, Wynant is missing and she wants Nick to help find him. Nick says he's retired and gives her some ideas of who she might call. A bit later it is revealed that Wynant's secretary has been found murdered.Wynant's family members and associates keep turning up asking Nick to help find Wynant. The police also try to rope him into helping them solve the murder. More and more details are revealed and more suspects keep turning up. One of the suspects ends up shooting Nick and Nick decides he can't stay out of the investigation any more and starts gumshoeing. He still tries to defer to the police where he can and keep the press at bay as they try to get him to admit to working the case.Nora is enthralled with seeing her husband work and she keeps trying to push herself into the action alongside him. I love the banter between Nick and Nora. They are both so witty and sarcastic. It's a lot of fun to see them tease each other and especially fun when they're teasing in front of other characters or teasing other people. A lot of the other characters don't seem to know what to make of the Charleses. It's pretty funny.While this is still a gritty murder mystery full of all sorts of suspects both from high and low society, it is definitely less grizzly than the Continental Op. There were action sequences but they weren't as intense or drawn out as in Hammet's other works. The tone and action was closer to Maltese Falcon than the Op books.I really enjoyed the mystery of this book. There are a ton of little nuances and extra layers that add to the complexity. While some of the characters felt a little flat and stereotypical there were also a lot of very distinctive and interesting characters. Wynant's family members are each very outrageously distinct and quirky. Wyant's lawyer and business associates are a little more predictable but still interesting and add flavor.As with a lot of these early mystery novels, the final revelatory narrative is a bit drawn out with Nick going into a lengthy monologue explaining just what happened and how and by whom. I did like the humor that Hammet brought into this scene through short comments between Nick and Nora as she questions just how it is that he knows these things. In some cases his response is that \\"it's the only way that makes sense\\"...in other cases he comments that he's \\"not sure\\" but he suggests that by making deductive theories in one direction, it's sure to put pressure on the real guilty party and expose something they don't want exposed.All in all I really enjoyed this story. It was a funny, exciting and intriguing mystery tale. While the overall mystery elements were all actually pretty complex in their unraveling, the actualy resolution was quite simple and seemed to make a lot of sense once fully explained. In the end this made for a rather satisfying conclusion.After reading the book, I sat down with my wife and we watched the movie based on the book. I loved that Dashiel Hammet received top billing. The movie was pretty faithful to the overall plot of the book although it did start out providing significant back story prior to the introduction of the Charleses. This served as a good introduction to Wynant and his family and associates. I felt like this change was a good way of putting a face to a character (Wynant) who otherwise is almost always \\"off screen\\" but constantly talked about. They did make a significant change to the \\"Dorothy\\" character. In the book she's flighty, erratic and just possibly a little crazy. In the movie she seemed pretty grounded and she's engaged to be married (which introduced a new character but also got rid of her \\"flirting\\" with Nick). Most of the other characters and situations remained the same until the very end of the story. Rather than having the final revelation meeting happen in the room of Wynant's wife and family, Nick sets up a dinner party and invites all of the suspects to attend. During the dinner he announces that he's brought the killer in and expects to reveal him or her there. The dinner party scene certainly made for better theater by adding more tension and suspicion as well as providing more opportunity for situational humor.Overall I really enjoyed this book. I've had a lot of fun reading Hammet's works and I look forward to reading more. If you're in the mood for a \\"Noir\\" mystery without as much grittiness but with just as much intrigue and fun, The Thin Man is definitely a good place to start.*****4.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was a really fun read for me!

Sure, the mystery is good, but this book is really about Nick and Nora Charles, their wonderful, sassy relationship and the incredibly witty, charming banter between the two of them.

Also, a nice example of trust, where spouses allow each other to openly flirt with others without having their fragile egos threatened."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Saw a marathon of the Thin Man Movies on Turner Classic Movies. A friend of mine said she had read the book. I ordered it from Amazon. Wow! What a great book. Thrilling, exciting, funny, crafty, witty and charming -- phew -- a lot of descriptive words that all are appropriate. I wish the movie could have included more of that kid, Gilbert, who is the brother of the girl, Dorothy. He seems like a hoot from his story line in the book where he is more utilized. I suppose hollywood had to make adjustments for time and the flow of the story's sake. I gave it to a friend at work and he said the book is a definite classic -- he exact words \\"great story and great story telling.\\""},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Hammett's novel is different enough from the movie to make its reading worthwhile. Lacks a good deal of the wit and personality supplied by William Powell and Myrna Loy, but packs in additional details missing from the script. (Oh, and there's one big difference: Asta is a girl!) The film is a bit sleeker, sometimes to much better effect (e.g., it omits the three-page report of cannibalism in the Old West that struck me as wildly out of place). Those who have seen the movie will have a terrible time trying to imagine the characters as anyone other than the actors who portrayed them in the film."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"It always saddens me to think that Hammett, who created hard-boiled literature with THE MALETESE FALCON and RED HARVEST, should close out his writing career with this polite fluff about a married couple solving a socialite murder. Chandler would years later praise Hammett as the man &quot;who gave murder back to people who had reason to committ it&quot;, but THIN MAN shows an unfortunate regression back to the old school that Hammett helped to eclipse. This is lightware fare, and nothing else."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I simply adore the movies... and while this novel had some of that panache, it is a much darker, harsher world.Is that disappointing? Well, yes."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Thin Man series of movies, so when I saw the book being offered I snapped it up. I found that the movie only slightly follows the book. The characters are there and some of the Nick and Nora relationship dynamics as well along with the basic plot but other than that there wasn't a lot of similarity. The humor that was such a wonderful part of the movies only occasionally shows up in the book. The witty dialog between Nick and Nora is pretty much absent as well. In short I was pretty disappointed. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Nick and Nora movies I would have enjoyed the book. If you like old detective stories you will probably enjoy it. My next stop is the Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett. I may not enjoy it as much as the movie, as in the case of the Thin Man, but who can resist reading the books that started such classic and enduring movies?"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I feel bad for writing this but: I didn't love The Thin Man. I wanted to, and Raymond Chandler did, and I love Raymond Chandler but...oh, I just couldn't.I thought the book was kind of repetitive. Oh, look, yet another morning when Nick wakes up and wants to down a bottle of hard liquor. What, another shady visitor thinks Nora's just a doll? Is that weepy girl really coming round again?I figured out who the villain was pretty quickly, and I never really attached to the characters. So yes, it's a fascinating period piece, and a good character study, but I don't think I'll be picking up another Dashiell Hammet anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"If you are looking for vintage, hard-boiled crime fiction this isn't it. While Hammett's talent is still evident, it is only wasted on this type of writintg. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book. It's just that the man who gave us The Continental Op and Sam Spade wrote this well after his writing had peaked. It is a very quick read because there isn't much to miss. Nick and Nora could best be described as one of the hardy boys marrying Nacy Drew, and then they become high society drunks who solve a mystery involving very one dimensional characters."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"\`The Thin Man' was Hammett's last novel. Unlike \`The Maltese Falcon' which had a mean and lean quality to it with characters you can't forget, his last novel seemed padded and most of his characters uninteresting. He wastes four and a half pages in telling the story of cannibalism in the old west. This would be a good technique if the story related to the current story. For example, if the story mentioned some treasure that disappeared and now people are getting killed because of the treasure. This is one of those rare times that I liked the movie rather than the novel.I gave \`The Thin Man' two stars. Even though I was disappointed with this novel, Hammett is still better than the people who try to imitate him. I guess that his time working as an operative for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency put a little edge in his writing. As a wanabe writer, I know you can do research and try to make things realistic, but if you have lived what you are writing about - you can put in all those little details that will let your readers know that you have \`street cred'"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Although this was the last novel completed by Hammett, he did live for over twenty-six more years until 1961. The story introduced the dashing couple Nick and Nora Charles who in some respects resembled Hammett and his long-time companion Lillian Hellman.If you entertain romantic notions about New York City in the 1930's, this will help you enjoy the book. However, you will have to cope with unceasing dialogue which is difficult to follow."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"There's always a problem with reading a book when you've already seen the movie version of it. You may be imagining characters that are different from the way they were described in the book - imagining dialog and nuances that just aren't in the book - and remembering scenes that you liked better the way they were in the movie.Those are all problems that I dealt with when I was reading this book. Not only have I previously seen The Thin Man (starring the ever-so-classy William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles) - I grew up watching it. I have probably seen it a hundred times.While I did my best to just say that this is a totally different experience and I should try to forget the movie while I read it - I spent a lot of time involuntarily judging the book against the movie. I couldn't help it.Well, if you're a fan of the movie, let me just say this: the book is a lot more raw than the film.The plot is essentially the same. Some minor details are changed. Some scenes take place in different places than in the film, and some characters are slightly different, or important for different reasons.But in the book, there is \\"language\\" (in the sense that censors use the term), implications of sexuality and more violence. The character of Dorothy Wynatt (who is essentially a heroine in the film) is definitely not so heroic in this. Nick is still smart and suave, but he's a little less classy than in the film.There is also a long, inexplicable section in the center of the book where Nick tells Gilbert (the eponymous Thin Man's son) the tale of Alfred Packer, North America's first cannibal. (You can see this tale colorfully illustrated in Matt Stone and Trey Parker's film \\"Cannibal: The Musical!\\" if you have any interest in it). This story relates in no way to the plot of the book, so I really don't know why it's there, if other than to assist the author in making a minimum page count.Looking at this book as a thing totally disassociated from the film, I can tell you this: yes, it was entertaining. Yes, it held my attention. It was a good way to while-away a couple rainy afternoons, but I can't tell you that I'd call it a great work of literature. And the thing that I liked the most about the movie (which, honestly, is mainly the characters of Nick and Nora) was a bit lacking in the book. It dwelt mostly on the Wynatt family, which was more twisted than in the film.It was good for what it was - a mystery novel. But I won't tell you that if you love the movie (as I do) that you'll love the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Being almost completely unfamiliar with the old Nick and Nora Charles movies, I came to The Thin Man with no preconceived notions about its two main characters and how they might fit into the rest of Hammett's body of work. At first, the book did not strike me as being particularly dark or hardboiled, two qualities I have come to expect from Hammett's writing, but by the time I finished it I had changed my mind. As Hammett developed his storyline and fleshed out his characters it became apparent that the more sophisticated Nick and Nora were dealing with characters from the criminal underworld and the NYPD who would have fit comfortably into any Hammett novel.Ex-detective Nick Charles and his wealthy young wife have come from San Francisco to spend Christmas 1932 in New York City, a city with which Nick is very familiar and in which he still has many friends and contacts because of the years he worked it as a private detective. Nick, retired from the business and hoping to earn his keep these days by managing the enormous wealth that his new wife has inherited, wants nothing more from the holiday than a chance to visit old haunts, see a few friends, drink some good booze on a regular basis and sleep until noon each day.A chance encounter with the daughter of a former client of his who wants him to help her find her father makes sure that most of Nick's original holiday goals will be impossible to achieve because, try as he might to avoid any involvement, he is slowly sucked into a mess beyond his imagination. Before he knows what hit him, Nick is working with a NYPD detective on a murder investigation, becomes the target of one of the murder suspects, finds that the wife of another suspect is trying to frame him for the murder, realizes that he and Nora have become surrogate parents to the young lady who first got him involved, and is still trying to squeeze in as much booze as possible into his daily routine.The Thin Man was Dashiell Hammett's last novel and I had hoped to enjoy it much more than I did. Strangely enough, what will stay with me the longest is the alcoholism that the novel's main character, Nick Charles, so obviously suffers, suffers to such a degree that he is constantly joking about his need for a drink and offering drinks to others so that he will have an excuse to mix one for himself. In fact, his young wife Nora, if she stays with Nick too many years, is almost certainly going to end up in the same boat. Hammett, an alcoholic himself, portrays these drinking habits as humorous and sophisticated, very much a positive thing in the lives of Nick and Nora Charles. I found that attitude, along with some casual use of the \\"N-word\\" to be distracting enough to keep me from fully buying into the novel's plot. I realize that the book was written at least 75 years ago but I struggled to get past this kind of thing, especially Hammett's attempt to make alcoholism seem so appealing a lifestyle.I listened to the audio version of the book and I was impressed with the way that William Dufris read the novel. The Thin Man is largely a first person narrative by Nick Charles with the remainder of the book being told in conversational format. Dufris does a superb job providing accents, inflections and different voices for the various characters, male and female, and made listening to Hammett's story a pleasure but, overall, I was disappointed in the book. Based on its reputation, I think that I expected too much."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder. Nick Charles, a retired detective, and his wife Nora find clues while helping a young girl named Dorothy through problems with her abusive mother and crazy suspect of a dad. As the story unfolds the situation turns out to be more complex than a single murder. There are many twists involving many characters that make the murder hard to solve.The characters are well-developed with depth and realistic personalities. Detective Charles sarcastic wit makes him a fun character through which to sift through all the information to solve the murder.Nevertheless the detail of information sifted through in the book can also make parts of the book a slow read. The author goes on large tangents that seem to detract from the story. For example at a party at the beginning of the book Nick is asked about cannibalism in America by a suspects child, Nick hands him a book which is then quoted at great length. Perhaps the author includes this to keep the reader guessing as to its relevance or as a device to show what people may do under extreme circumstances. Either way these side stories make the book drag at parts.Despite being slow in certain sections the character development and the way the author highlights the relevant pieces of information to solve the mystery is satisfying. If the mystery is like walking through a forest to identify which trees are needed to guide the reader through to the far side of the forest, the author describes in detail too many of the trees. Yet, at the end, it is fun when the detective highlights and connects the facts that are part of the mystery."},{"Title":"Elizabeth","review":"First of all, the publishing date as listed on this site is not 1960. 'Elizabeth' was published in 1972. Elizabeth wasn't born until August 27, 1965. I know this for a fact because she is my sister and I was 12 years of age when she was born, and I have an original copy of the book.The book was written for one reason, because at the time we were told Elizabeth was blind, due to what is now called Premature Retinopathy, my mother searched for books on raising and helping one's blind child thrive in a sight-dependent filled world. Every book she found stated that a child who was blind was also retarded. Mom, already having raised four babies, knew this to be a complete fallacy. She knew it to be untrue because of Elizabeth's reactions to stimuli and the voices around her. So, with encouragement from Selma Fraiberg and Edna Adelson, the book was written to correct the untruths and to bring hope and help to other parents whose children were struck by a disability.Today, Elizabeth is 43 years old, lives on her own, and works as a medical transcriptionist. She has her third leader dog, Sammie, she is totally independent, travels to concerts (mainly Jimmy Buffett or Tom Petty). She enjoys her life. She is also a very good cook.Mom, insisted on independence for Elizabeth, she insisted that her daughter would not be treated as 'special', and in raising her she only 'tweeked' a few things ... like hanging the streamer of bells across a crib lower so that when her baby would raise a hand or foot one or the other would come in contact with the tinkling sound. Music, reading, singing were a huge of Elizabeth's life, but it was no different for my brothers and sisters and myself. Elizabeth was not going to grow up thinking she was 'special' because of her blindness or to think God allowed her to be blind to glorify him. Her blindness was a result of being very premature and the amount of oxygen given to her which caused the blood vessels in the retina to hemmorrage and thus resulted in blindness.Our mother, Sharon, journeyed on in death on November 2, 2007. She is now sleeping in the passage that connects life to life. She died proud of her children and content in the knowledge that Elizabeth and her other children would be just fine with out her. Well, we aren't quite fine without her ... we miss her terribly. She was a woman that cared and wanted the best for her family..This book can help anyone who has a child with a disbility know there is hope, and you have to work at it to see that hope realized. Now, in this day and age, there are more services available for parents to rely on, but in the end, most of the work will still be done by the parent to insure their child will thrive and function in a society that seems to still have a mid-evil view concerning disabilities."},{"Title":"Places of Learning: Media, Architecture, Pedagogy","review":"If you are an artist, art educator, or enjoy thinking about the arts, this book will take you to that other place."},{"Title":"The Paradox of Success","review":"This book changed my perspective and helped me identify a number of 'shadows' that kept me from really enjoying life.

The main theory behind the book is Carl Jung's shadow image, which contains every part of ourselves that we repress, deny, and leave undeveloped. These shadows lay in the unconscious mind, destroying successful and unsuccessful people. Though it is scary to face our shadow, or the shadow of an organization, having done so we become energized and liberated. We waste more energy denying the dark-side of our personalities than accepting them.A huge part of my shadow was anger. Being a communication skills coach, it was \\"wrong\\" for me to feel anger. I had to be perfect. My status and position, according to O'Neil, put me in a prime position to deny what I needed to accept. Leaders often deny parts of their personality that gave them their level of success. When times change, however, their dark-side breaks them down. Unfortunately, there are endless examples of this with celebrities.It's okay to feel anger, make mistakes, admit your wrongdoings, and even play again. We repress being playful because \\"adult's aren't suppose to play\\". Anything that gets denied goes into the shadow to take away our happiness and wholeness.The success-sustainer creates a fertile ground for learning and openness. When the leader encourages his followers to confront their shadows and the organization's shadows, secrets get removed and organizations become renewed.O'Neil will have you confront the dark-side of your personality. It is scary, but liberating.

'Rebel Planet' perhaps proved the best sci-fi gamebook, because of two aspects: firstly, the concept of Earth in the twenty-fifth century being occupied by the Arcadian Empire; and secondly, the adventure itself was spread across four planets diverse in culture and attitude. There wasn't much added to the Adventure Sheet - only Credits for currency. But despite lacking in new additional rules and attributes, Waterfield devised a breathtaking, sinister mission to end Arcadian rule and free mankind from alien tyranny. Although not of the sword and sorcery type, 'Rebel Planet' proved an interesting challenge. Certainly, it would take you more than one attempt to find the clues and gain access to the Central Computer."},{"Title":"REBEL PLANET (Fighting Fantasy)","review":"Such is the storyline of Robin Waterfield's rather enjoyable and original science-fiction gamebook. The hero's mission is an urgent now-or-never attempt to liberate the human race by exploiting the one weakness of a pack of aliens nazis you'll love to hate. The Arcadians are controlled by a single computer on their home planet Arcadion, they're all mind-linked to it by cerebral-receivers. It directs them like an ant colony queen and if it's destroyed - so is the brain of every single solider in the galaxy. The empire will be instantly reduced to a bunch of zombies wandering around, bumping into walls and apologising. People will rejoice!Sounds like an oppression-lifting dream too good to be real doesn't it? But it's true, only it won't be easy.It's virtually impossible to get into the computer building, so the Arcadians aren't likely to be releasing their iron grip on humanity any time soon. To get inside one needs to know the special code to the building's door. Your last-attempt mission is to make contact with the resistance groups on the interesting colonised worlds of Tropos, Radax and Halmuris to get parts of this code (if they have them), which won't be easy either as you know not a lot about the resistance cells. There are some interesing sub-plots to experience as you track down these people.Then if you make it to Arcadion with the code you should be able enter the building, lay explosives and teach those no good vegtable-faced goons no one uses the human race like cattle!But beware - there is a reason why your mission is being launched without much preparation and little or no info about the resistance cells - the Arcadians are on to the scheme. Resistance cells have been betrayed by traitors willing to earn a few more days to live. It's a terrible world.Like Robin's first Titan-based adventure \\"Masks of Mayhem\\" this one's set in a variety of places (space, futuristic cities, undergound basements and bleak planets still forming from creation) and also has some good and unexpected sub-plots. This book is full of a lot of originality, starting with a very plausible introductory \\"history\\" about the human race's colonisation of three distinct planets with their own unique stories before running into Arcadion, contact with which proves to be fatal.I think a flaw in this book is some things aren't explained as much as they could be, and therefore not utilising this book to its full potetnial. A few paragraphs are described too briefly and/or covered a bit too quickly. Another problem is that Binary Code is not really properly explained, only a table to given to calculate the reference you must turn to to enter the computer building. I myself got hopelessly confused in 1987 when I was only 12 and didn't know what to do! I recommend familiarising yourself with Binary before starting this message (or email dougr@paradise.net.nz and I'll tell you).But other than that it's a very original and interesting book.

Some day I may get all the way through it."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"Glad he dares to criticize Mitchell, among others. Major flaw?Completely avoids Norris &amp; Keele's superior translations of theElegies and Sonnets."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"It may seem odd that a book about translating Rainer Maria Rilke would be a good place to start encountering the poet.But Rilke is not only a brilliant poet, one of the greatest of the twentieth century, he is also difficult to approach. I read him on and off for ten years before I could see beyond what I thought was pretentious esthetic posturing. (Now, like so many others, I see Rilke as one of the great meditators on art and life, someone who reveals us to ourselves with a depth and clarity that few -- if any -- can equal.)Here, in sum, is why this book is so wonderful. William Gass has read, and struggled with, and been guided by, Rainier Maria Rilke all his life. In many ways, he tells us, he has been clolser to Rilke than any other human being. And now, after a half century of that intimate relationship, he tells us who this literary 'friend' is, what his life has been, what he has gone through, what he has achieved -- and why we should care. There can be no more important book for any of us to write: 'this is what I cared most about in my life, this is what I learned from that caring.'This is what Willam H. Gass, a major American novelist, does in his book:-- He provides a brilliant short biography of Rilke-- He explicates, effortlessly, some of his shorter lyrics, so that the reader can understand what Rilke does and what is at stake in his poems.-- He teaches us, through a long but not boring chapter on translation, just how complex and apt Rilke's language is. That is not small accomplishment, since Rilke seems to sing so effortlessly that it easy to overlook how much is going on in each phrase.-- He knows what is best in Rilke, focusing on the revolutionary &quot;New Poems,&quot; the amazing &quot;Requiem&quot; to Paula Modersohn-Becker, and Rilke's towering achievement, the &quot;Duino Elegies.&quot;-- He, by following Rilke's artistic career with all its hesitations and confusions, helps us to understand how the &quot;Elegies&quot; are discovery and revelation: not just for us, but for the poet himself.-- He provides us with fine translations of many Rilke poems, including the &quot;Elegies.&quot;The book Gass has written is a rich and satisfying way to enter into Rilke's poetry. It is as if one's grandfather sat down under a shady tree one bright and sunny summer morning, and began, &quot;The love of my life has been....&quot; and then spentthe rest of the day speaking in warm and intimate ways about that love and what it has meant to his life.Just as that would be a marvelous day, so this is a marvelous and unforgettable book"},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"at first I was skeptical about a 200 page book that combines everything from the entirety of Rilke's life to an in-depth analysis of not 2, not 3, but *12* different translators and their treatment of Rilke. in a relatively short space this book manages to dazzle me with the way it stands back from all that's been done to Rilke and twisted from Rilke, and offers up a Rilke who is human -- both a puppet and an angel."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"Gass's comparisons of previous translations of Rilke show a deep understanding of the problems involved in translating this complex poet. His own versions of the Duino Elegies are passable, though he is largely unconcerned with poetic rhythm. He even quotes previous translations in prose (i.e. without line breaks)! Gass's own famously ornate prose shows signs of strain; it is breezy and full of jarringly inappropriate similes. Wonderful insights are often juxtaposed with irrelevant comparisons, making the book enjoyable and frustrating by turns."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"I found myself split over this book. I very much liked the author's unraveling of his work as a translator of such a complex poet as Rilke. But, and this is a big but, I found his actual translations dry and formal, especially when compared to earlier translations by people like Stephen Mitchell, translations that made Rilke one of my favorite poets."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"For those of us who have been caught in the overwhelming force of the Duino Elegies or the Sonnets for Orpheus, William Gass's short book of reflections explores the life that brought forth such poignant works. After reading what moves from essay to biography to personal response, I found myself understanding the trials that Rilke endured and the concerns that he faced each day. I could not help but grow closer to Rilke and his work, as Gass's masterful language found the perfect word, the perfect thought, and the perfect explanation for what made Rilke's poetry so powerful. The book carries an unfortunate title, because ultimately it is Gass's account of the life, the poetry, and the symbols that permeated Rilke's ouvre, not Gass's translation efforts, which remain sharp in my memory. This book is not for the casual reader, but for those who are truly moved by Rilke's work, for those seeking a deeper understanding and appreciation of it."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"I found Gass's insights about translation and the art of poetry easier to appreciate than his translations of Rilke. This book has wonderful sections about Rilke's life and the difficulty of reconciling that life within the context of translating his poems. Gass often seems to find the right words to describe the art of poetry, and for that, I found this book wonderful. In Gass's attention to detail his analysis of poetry and of other Rilke translations are insightful (and at times beautiful) and led me to make notes in the margins. As for Gass's own translation: although he seems quite sure of himself, I don't find that his attention to detail gives him an easier time in translating Rilke's poems. This book provokes appreciation for the difficulty of translation and the magic of poetry."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"I found Gass's insights about translation and the art of poetry easier to appreciate than his translations of Rilke.

This book provokes appreciation for the difficulty of translation and the magic of poetry."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"This is the kind of book that rarely appears these days, a meditative cycle of free-form essays that adopts its own poetic approach, here to the densely metaphorical and sometimes mysterious imagery of Rainer Maria Rilke, the most important poet writing in German in the 20th century and perhaps even more, an artist's artist, and a figure whose influence has only increased in recent years.This ever-widening attention to Rilke is reflected in Gass's fascinating and trenchant discussion of side-by-side excerpts from nearly two dozen translations of Rilke's masterpiece The Duino Elegies, the book's centerpiece and a most useful guide for the non-expert attempting to penetrate Rilke's powerful use of German, a language that non-German-speakers don't immediately identify with poetic utterance. In that alone, Gass's book will be a revelation, taking the reader into lines, words and images with a translator's critical and aesthetic eye and ear, elucidating why Gass himself makes the choices he does.In fact the book appears to be a kind of gloss, an extended set of notes with related ideas that allowed Gass to arrive at his own translation of the Elegies, a translation that appears at the end of this volume. It is a plus that Gass's own version of the Elegies hardly offers the final word on the matter - although he is transparent in discussing his own sometimes idiosyncratic choices and solutions, you feel that the results are sometimes artificial, unmusical, and enjambed for meaning. But we only bring that level of critical insight because of Gass's own discussion, and in that vein the book is really very generous: rather than closing the door to others, Gass's study invites further efforts. Making the finest possible English translation of the Duino Elegies is a worthy quest, and Gass's volume will no doubt draw many other aspirants to the challenge.The book is also a pleasure for the casual reader of Rilke, highlighting important poems, ideas, and biographical moments from the writer's life with a couple of unorthodox observations - for example, that the poet had a limited education, reflected in his sometimes quirky allusions and sources. On the othe hand he was also a prophetic, visionary critic of painting, whose early and deep appreciations of Cezanne and Picasso appeared long before those artists had been very widely recognized.Finally, I gave my copy of this book to a friend, and soon found I had to buy another copy for myself. For the reader of Rilke, and perhaps for poets of all persuasions, it's a book that takes us closer to the surface craft and deeper art of poetry than many other critical works. Rilke may be indispensable for all artists, particularly aspiring ones, and this book may well be indispensable for students of Rilke. An easy five stars."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others."},{"Title":"Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation","review":"Gass's book gives the voyeur in us all a rare glimpse into the sordid life of Rilke but the lack of correctly quoted German (mostly spelling mistakes) and the fact that no poem is quoted in its entirety in German, makes for slipshod scholarship. Gass, who is probably a riot at parties of PhD students, can't put a stop to his sometimes foolhardy attempts at humor, albeit sarcastic at times, to make a point about translating. He refers to himself in the third person (among variations of poem translations) , which is ridiculous, and can barely contain himself when bashing other translators. Ho, hum."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"I echo the sentiments of other reviews.. Bruce Thomas, former Attractions Bassist, can turn a phrase with almost the degree of virtuosity that he displays in his mastery of the electric bass guitar... no small feat.As a fan of Elvis Costello, I read the book, perhaps a bit defensively, knowing of the falling out this book reportedly caused between EC and Bruce. I readied myself to hear the worst about Elvis and the boys. I did not find Bruce's anecdotes particularly inflammatory or derogatory to \\"The Singer\\", \\"The Drummer\\" or \\"The Keyboard Player\\" (Thomas' Wodehouse-esque thinly-veiled psuedonyms for his bandmates.) No, it all seemed refreshingly frank, and having had just a small taste of life on the road in a band, it was nice to see the monotony so well chronicled. I enjoyed Bruce's irony and word play and found his style to be not unlike the wit and intelligence of Elvis Costello's own writing. I also appreciated Bruce's willingness to turn a critical eye to his own thoughts, motivations and behaviors.Unfortunately, the overiding tone of the book is essentially joyless and bleak. Obviously The Road was a source of monotony and introspection, but surely there were more than a few moments where Bruce must have found the journey worth the taking. At no point is there any acknowledgement that he was having any fun or finding any personal joy and fulfillment in making a living playing music for adoring fans. Obviously it can't all be sex, drugs and rock n roll party fun, but this books makes the journey out to be nothing but dreary skies, shabby truck stops, and hangovers. The book seems dominated by an overriding sense of Bruce saying with a condescending tone 'oh why can't everyone be as observant and cynical as me?' The chronicle does manage to end with a slight glimmer of hope, and hints that Bruce may be at peace with himself, but it came across to me as an almost obligatory afterthought to round it out. Too little too late. Still, a good read, I just kept wanting to find the chapter, or even a paragraph in which he says \\"wow, how lucky am I to be playing in a band, and seeing the world and making a living doing it?!.\\" You chronicled the downside, Bruce. Now count your blessings."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"I've been reading for years about how good this book is, and how it caused a irreparable rift between Elvis Costello and the author. Having read it, I cannot understand either. The writing is repetitive and precious. Thomas tries too hard to turn a phrase at every, uh, turn, and his incessant descriptions of how boring the touring life can be are equally as excruciating. I cannot figure out what Elvis got pissed off about? The fact the uses the \\"lavatory\\" three times before a show? His fear of flying? I get the feeling he must have just learned to dislike Thomas over time and this book was a good excuse to chuck him from the band. Americans wishing to learn British slang and vernacular will find this book rife with opportunity. For hardcore Elvis fans only, and only suitable then as bathroom reading."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"I really thought this was going to show at least more than a fleeting glimpse at Elvis and the boys, but it's really just a pissed off ex-bass player spouting off at how everything sucks except him. There's not much about \\"The Singer\\" or the rest of the band, just Thomas waxing un-poetically about how much better he is than everyone else. Really sad..."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"Man am I glad I didn't pay big bucks to buy this used while it was out of print. Let me tell you the reason it has been out of print all this time: It's just not a very good book.Bruce Thomas is a superb bassist -- an extraordinary one, even. He is also clearly highly intelligent, well read and well educated. And he wants you to know that on every single page.The main aspect of the book that bothered me was Bruce's repeated expressions of contempt for his audience. Hey, we get it Bruce. You get tired of fans ligging about asking you what strings you use over and over again, and Holiday Inns suck, an life on the road can be monotonous and hard. We get it. You're not a dumb rock star, you are an erudite English gentleman. Enough already.For Costello fans, it is pretty obvious to me that there is no truth to the legend that this is an inflammatory book with loads of Elvis dirt that got him fired -- unless you consider eating too much sushi a salacious detail.I am not saying it's not worth a read as a novel, but keep your expectations where they would be for any first time novelist."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"Look, I dig Elvis Costello & the Attractions but why the hell did they fire this guy after he wrote this? There's nothing really in here that is all that shocking or scandalous. The book reads like someone's diary and as a sort of rock travel essay put me to sleep. It's all the same--disconnected observations on nothingness. Some hit the right tone but others are just there and make you go \\"So what's the big deal?\\"Compare this to some other books of this genre and this does not even hold a candle to many of the New Wave era."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"Kind of difficult to read at first due to his odd style, but the book picks up. Bruce comes off as a loner who lives deep in his head. He says he was fired twice because of this book. Unless this is an abridged edition I have, I dont see it. Hopefully one of the other Attractions writes a more straightforward account of these days but till then Bruces book is a fine look inside life in a very successful band."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"All of his anecdotes, jokes, and cringe-inducing puns imply that he views himself as the ultimate arbiter of taste and intellect. He's a great bass player."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"Having been a fan of the band from the beginning and being aware of the fact that \\"the book\\" supposedly caused the split, I began the book with some defensiveness. Before long, I found it to be a very interesting and well written record of life on the road. Granted, the tone is brooding at best but so was the music of this period.The lingering question that I have is what was so bad here to cause the split? One of the reviewers stated that Bruce should lighten up. I'm a huge Elvis fan but maybe he should lighten up as well.A good read."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"I am so pleased to see this book back in print! Bruce Thomas was the bass player with Elvis Costello and the Attractions and this &quot;fictional&quot; work featuring characters such as The Singer, The Keyboard Player and The Drummer, contributed largely to the eventual split between Elvis and Bruce (and the disintegration of the band) when it was first published over 10 years ago.Whilst Elvis may not have approved, the book comes across to me as an honest memoir of life in a band - not always full of glamour and hot women! It's not always flattering, either to the author or to his bandmates, but real life isn't.The anecdotes in the book are sometimes amusing, sometimes poingnant, but always interesting, especially if you are a fan of the music. It largely focuses on Bruce's life in the Attractions, but there are chapters about his childhood, his family, and his work with US band Quiver amongst others.It's a little thin, and won't take you long to work through, but is a highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"This is not a book for fans of Elvis Costello and the Attractions. If you're buying this book as a fan of the band, skip it. There's about 10-15 pages worth of material that mention anything interesting or funny related to that subject. The rest of the book is nothing but pointless rambling and pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo. I guess this could count as Bruce's outlook on life. Oh, and there's that goofy chapter about letting some guy borrow a van. (???) Seriously, it gets so tedious and boring I just skimmed the last few chapters for anything relating to the band, but found nothing and closed the book. I have no idea why this book could be cited for causing problems between Bruce and Elvis. There's nothing inflammatory or personal revealed; just a few jokes made here and there about the band members' habits or demeanor while on the road. Wow."},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","review":"Having missed the first printing, I eagerly waited for many years for this to become available again. I suppose the anticipation for something special and enlightening only served to set me up for a complete letdown, and that is exactly what best describes this utter waste of my precious time. There's no denying that Bruce Thomas is a superlative bass player...but as a writer, he just should not have bothered. I suspect this trash was induced by an overindulgence in halucinogenic dabbling. He appears to be an unappreciative and bitter soul. Such a pity for such a talented musician. But I will grant you this, I never was a big fan of the British low-brow sense of humor to begin with...I just don't get it. Benny Hill, Monty Python, all that garbage must be viewed on a good strong buzz to be appreciated in any way.

I was looking for such information as which brakes are best for my application, or which carb is best for performance and which is best for fuel economy. The book does tell a little bit about this kind of info, just not to the extent I was looking for. It did tell a bit about what is the best exhaust system to use, so that made me happy.

Indeed, for Padovano and Merton, the search for spirituality is nothing less than the pursuit of being perfectly normal--or as Padovano might say, being normal, perfectly."},{"Title":"Thomas Merton: Becoming Who We Are (Retreat with)","review":"This small book has much to offer. Padovano's insight into Merton's &quot;Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander&quot; is especially compelling, as it should be, coming from a writer who has himself chosen not to be a bystander but instead to aspire to being perfectly normal, or rather--as Padovano might say--being normal, perfectly.Also, Padovano's writing, here and elsewhere, offers a much needed antidote to all the goofiness that parades itself as &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;metaphysical&quot; in contemp culture. As Padovano says of Merton's own writing, &quot;spirituality is biography.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Humiliation of the Word","review":"In this book, Ellul makes a strong distinction between the &quot;word&quot; and the &quot;image&quot; as a method of perceiving and making sense of the world. He claims that the &quot;image&quot; has been elevated in our society beyond its original purpose and capability. The &quot;image&quot; is limited to the material world, to the practical and cannot probe the depths of human experience, to go beyond the surface of reality. Therefore a society based on image will be a shallow society, incapable of find ing deep truths.He contrasts the limitations of the image with the strengths of the &quot;word.&quot; The word, which has been humiliated in today's world, that is, lowered in status, demeaned, is capable of conveying truth and complexities that the image cannot. The word, because it is flexible and open to interpretation, is an instrument of communication and negotiation.Ellul takes this argument and applies it to several different areas of technology and communication.I agree wholeheartedly with his basic premise, although not with all of his applications. Sometimes his categorizations are a little unclear and confusing but overall he makes a very strong argument. He is absolutely brilliant in the way that he is able to analyze the very fundamental structure of the way we communicate and function as a society. He attacks the postmodern mindset by showing that they have a disdain for thinking and the intellect itself."},{"Title":"The Humiliation of the Word","review":"After reading the other reviews I must add a few comments.First, you can't blame the author for lack of clarity. If you blame anyone, blame the translator. This book is translated from French and most translations are cumbersome.Second, Jacques Ellul is a Luddite (read his &quot;The Technological Society&quot; and you'll see what I mean) so his conclusions are going to be anti-techonology.Having said all that, this book challenges the assumptions of our image-driven society whether you agree with the author's conclusions or not. Jacques Ellul is a Christian but missed one important point on the image vs. word debate. And that is this: &quot;The Word became flesh...&quot; The Word by divine mandate became an image of God in the flesh. Also, man is made in the image of God. But Jacques Ellul is a great thinker and always provokes thought outside the traditional box.This is a great book and deserves reading and re-reading for any writer in our image-driven society.Aloha, Glenn"},{"Title":"The Humiliation of the Word","review":"Ellul writes a compelling tale of how technology has effected the written word, and thusy the entirety of the communicative act.

Cornwell is (famously or infamously, depending on your perspective) writing these novels out of historical sequence, so even though while \\"Sharpe's Company\\" is in the middle of the Sharpe series chronologically, it is among the earliest books Cornwell wrote about Wellington's favorite rogue. And it is easily among Cornwell's best books ever - thrilling, ghastly, funny, and with perhaps Cornwell's greatest villain, Obadiah Hakeswill.[Full disclosure - I read \\"Sharpe's Company\\" after reading the terribly disappointing \\"Hannibal Rising,\\" and have Cornwell up on a bit of a pedestal right now. A gushing review follows.]Like all soldiers from the stews of London, born without name or wealth, Richard Sharpe started life in the British army as a lowly private. While serving with Lord Wellington (then merely Colonel Wellesley), Sharpe had the misfortune of serving under Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill, a grossly fat and evil man who knows that he cannot die - he even survived a hanging! Taking an instant hatred to Sharpe, Hakeswill has Sharpe flogged in events chronicled in Cornwell's \\"India Trilogy,\\" a sub-set of the Sharpe novels. Sharpe swears revenge and thinks he has killed Hakeswill off . . . only to have the insane Sergeant return in \\"Sharpe's Company.\\"Hakeswill is the kind of man who will trump up flogging charges on a soldier in order extort sexual favors from the soldier's desperate wife . . . and then kill her and frame her husband. Truly evil, Hakeswill's love for rape is only matched by his hatred of Sharpe. So what happens when Hakeswill comes across Sharpe's lover, the gorgeous partisan Teresa? He must have her, both to possess her beauty and to ruin Sharpe.And also, what is to happen when Sharpe finds himself demoted when a wealthier man buys his Captaincy and Hakeswill is put in charge of the 95th Rifles? A mere Lieutenant, Sharpe still outranks Hakeswill, but just barely. This gives Hakeswill the opportunity to ruin the Rifles, the only other thing Sharpe holds as dear as Teresa.Things are dire enough for Sharpe, what with the return of the mad, gibbering Sergeant. But he must also contend with Wellington's siege of Badajoz, perhaps the most impregnable French-held fort in all of Spain. Even the redoubtable Major Hogan despairs of British boots ever getting inside that mountain of rock and guns. And yet Sharpe must lead men inside, if not only for his honor and to earn his Captain's bars, but also to save Teresa and his new-born daughter, Antonia, who live inside the fortress.Cornwell writes a battle scene as well as anyone, and he has never been in finer form than with his description of the horrific siege. Perhaps shockingly for a proud Brit, Cornwell pulls no punches at the terrible crimes committed by the British soldiers once they crack open those walls - the robberty, rape and murder of the innocents is one of the most depressing passages you will ever read.For high adventure, slightly leavened with comedy, you will not find anything better than \\"Sharpe's Company.\\" Read these novels in order - don't start with this book, because the characters will make much more sense if you have the entire back-story."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I'm a little more than halfway through Bernard Cornwell's 'Sharpe' series and so far 'Sharpe's Company' is my favorite. This novel has Richard Sharpe fighting for his command and his family while waging war against the French held fortress of Badajoz. And as though this task wasn't daunting enough, Sharpe's nemisis Obidiah Hakeswill returns to settle an old score. Consistently entertaining, Cornwall's attention to detail is nothing less than awe-inspiring. I would highly recommend 'Sharpe's Comapany' to anyone interested in military fiction or to lovers of great action and suspence novels."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"\\"Sharpe's Company\\" is one of the better books in the Sharpe series with a mostly convincing plot, a geniunely interesting series of complications for our hero Richard Sharpe to deal with (including a demotion, the birth of a daughter and the return of the evil Sgt. Hakeswill) and some really terrific battle scenes.If you've read any of the Sharpe in India \\"prequel\\" novels (\\"Sharpe's Tiger,\\" \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" and \\"Sharpe's Fortress\\"), this is an especially rewarding book because of the return of Sharpe's old nemesis Hakeswill.While a great adventure yarn, the book isn't quite perfect. As some previous reviewers have noted, there are a few contrived lapses in the way the characters behave, particularly the failure of the normally aggressive Sharpe to quickly and cleanly end his Hakeswill problem. But, if you've read the Sharpe in India prequels, you're likely to just see this as an ongoing weakness of Sharpe, who tended to do things in India such as force Hakeswill into a snake pit and then walk off without ensuring that the snakes actually finished off Hakeswill. (If I wanted to get all literary, I could possibly account for this by spinning out some psychological theory about Hakeswill's role as a distorted father figure for the orphaned Sharpe, but, hey, this really isn't *that* kind of historical novel ...)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Cornwell's &#34;Richard Sharpe&#34; series is a bunch of grand adventure tales, and a valuable source of history, especially of the Peninsular War against Napoleon. They do get a little repetitive in places, since the author can't tell if you have read any others of the series. Hence he has in every book to explain that the Baker rifle is slower to load than a musket, but more accurate; and he always has to belabor the point of the British army having officers of very mixed competence, due to their having bought their commissions instead of earning them. Perhaps the custom prevailed even later, since, in World War I it is said the German General Staff referred to the British soldiers as &#34;lions, led by donkeys.&#34;"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I love all of Cornwell's Sharpe stories.

You can see his rights...\\" Oh, yeah, instead of earning the rank and gaining experience while surviving combat, Rymer's money automatically makes him a natural and effective leader. Uh-huh. Let me out now!!!What is it with all these officers telling Sharpe he doesn't need the glory of leading a Forlorn Hope? His commanding colonel should just be jumping for joy at the thought of a good chance of getting rid of Sharpe. Wellington. Well, we know why Wellington won't let Sharpe lead one and Hogan doesn't want him to; he appreciates Sharpe's abilities and, hoo boy, ain't he mad when he finds out Sharpe's captaincy was gutted! They all think that Sharpe will win promotion on the battlefield with all the potential dead captains. If that's true, then why isn't Sharpe a captain for real now??This is the first story in which Richard starts to hanker after a Forlorn Hope. It would cement his promotion and be a test for himself.As Cornwell notes at the end, there is a real-life romance at the sack of Badajoz when Lieutenant Harry Smith rescued and married Juana Maria de los Dolores de Leon. A love story that has found its way into many romances and history books.THE STORYIt's at the assault on Ciudad Rodrigo where Sharpe's luck takes a sharp turn down for Colonel Lawford is hit and the South Essex requires a new Colonel. One who won't be on Sharpe's side.There is some good to conquering Ciudad Rodrigo. Teresa has shown up and while she and Richard spend a bit of time together, Sharpe learns that he's a father. It helps offset the bad news of Hakeswill's arrival although nothing can offset the arrival of the regiment's new officers. Too bad that first meeting had to occur just after Teresa fought Hakeswill off.There's even a new captain along the news that Sharpe's gazette as captain was refused. So Sharpe is back to being a lieutenant. Without a company. Instead his new colonel puts him in charge of baggage and the regiment's women.If that isn't bad enough, Hakeswill is already up to his old tricks and has managed to frame Harper with theft. A frame that takes a bit too long to be revealed to Colonel Windham. We do have to give Windham credit for realizing it as quickly as he does. Not that it does much good for Harper's back. Still. Then Hogan takes a hand. At least Sharpe will have a chance at battle and get him away from the supply wagons, baggage train, and wives' inspections!At least until Richard is to guide a Forlorn Hope at Badajoz and somehow get inside the city to rescue Teresa from Hakeswill.THE CHARACTERSCaptain Richard Sharpe is a natural soldier and fearsome in battle for time slows down when Sharpe is in a battle rage and none can stand before him.His men include Sergeant Patrick Harper, an Ulsterman from Donegal; Sergeant Read is a Methodist and worries about the men's souls; Lieutenant Harry Price is nice enough--his father bought him his commission to get him away from the ladies and the bottle or at least out of sight of Hampshire; Daniel Hagman, the oldest man in the regiment and a former poacher from Cheshire; Roach; Parry Jenkins; Gutteridge; Cooper; Harris, a former schoolteacher; Perkins, the youngest; Green; Horrell; McDonald; Cresacre; Smith; Sergeant Latimer; Peters; Clayton has a wife Sally with pretty tits; and, Corporal Jackson. Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill joins the South Essex with its new officers: Colonel Brian Windham, an energetic hunter with a dislike of jumped-up officers (and a very moralistic wife); Major Jack Collett; Captain Rymer is slated to replace Sharpe--he's one of us, don't \`cha know although it's too bad he's so indecisive in battle; and, Ensign William Matthews.Teresa Moreno, a.k.a., La Ajuga (The Needle), comes back into Richard's life with a little something extra named Antonia and earns the enmity of Hakeswill. In the sack of Badajoz, Sharpe and Harper rescue Isabella from a rape.Lieutenant Colonel the Honorable William Lawford is only here briefly. Major Forrest and Captain Leroy are still here with the South Essex.Major Michael Hogan is the head of Wellington's Intelligence services and Sharpe's friend. Lieutenant Robert Knowles is now a captain in a Fusilier Battalion; he leads by thinking of what Sharpe would do. General Black Bob Crauford bites it. Colonel Fletcher is the Chief Engineer.Arthur Wellesley is now Viscount Wellington and the General Marshal of Portugal's army and commander of the British forces in Portugal.THE TITLEThe title rejoices in Sharpe's Company when he regains his men."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I am loving the Sharpe series, they are great reads and pretty good history. I wasn't as enthusiastic about the first one because I expected Patrick O'Brian and because it is not as well done as the ensuing books. Once into them, however, I got hooked on Sharpe as the Ajax of the British Army, a soldier's soldier. He is up from the ranks, a rarity in the British Army where officers buy their commissions. Big and bad, he is unpolished, uneducated, and a killer, but with a basic integrity that is very appealing. And he sure can fight!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"The adventure just doesn't stop. It is worth the read. Keep it up, Mr. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I actually started reading the Sharpe series starting from the India campaign (Cornwell's prequal to the regular Sharpe story) and ol' Obadiah was prevalent throughout. So I have to admit I was a little put off by, what I perceived to be, slight story changes from the prequals that I had read first.Despite the changes (yes, I know Cornwell wrote the Peninsular War series first!), this was an extremely enjoyable book and I found myself actually yelling at the pages for Sharpe to succeed. I knew he would, but Cornwell has an excellent way of telling a story that pulls the reader into the novel and the next thing you know you're at the end.My thanks to emilyh for putting together an outstanding chronological history of the Sharpe books. Otherwise I would have been completely lost and not have enjoyed this series as much as I have!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Reading the WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory has interested me in other war novels. I was referred to the Sharpe's series by my uncle, and started with &quot;Sharpe's Eagle&quot;, which had me spellbound. &quot;Sharpe's Company&quot; was every bit as good, and now I am hooked on the series. What a writer! Cornwell makes history come to life with a vengeance!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Let me preface my review by confessing to be a fan of the Sharpe series of books. Sharpe's Company tells the tale of the British Army led by Wellington and the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. As usual Sharpe is in the thick of things. I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of the others, mainly because all the action revolves around the sieges. Personally, I favour action in open country, with battalions of soldiers manoeuvring for tactical advantage and cavalry pitted against infantry. Nonetheless, Cornwell still provides the reader with an articulate depiction of siege warfare, that is grotesque yet mesmerizing. The detestable Sergeant Hakeswill makes a reappearance and the plot centres around his hatred for Sharpe. Frankly, I have had a guts-full of Hakeswill and I wish Sharpe would just finish him off and ...... (but I will let you read the story to find that out). A couple of the fateful encounters Sharpe has with Hakeswill in this episode of the series, just don't seem to gel, and I'm left with the feeling Cornwell has placed too much emphasis on this aspect of the story. This is a well researched book. The historical notes at the end are very interesting, and some readers might consider reading this part at the beginning or during the book. Again this book leaves me in no doubt that Bernard Cornwell has had a previous life as an infantryman during the Napoleonic wars. Recommended for military enthusiasts, but may be too gory for the squeamish at heart."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"my dad got me into the absolutly fabulous SHARPE novels. cornwell really knows how to create a character that you want to read about over and over again. i love a good war novel but i never had an intrest in the napoleonic wars befor i read my first Sharpe novel. i have also seen the moive's staring Sean Bean who portrais richard sharpe beautifully. i would recommend any sharpe novel to anyone who loves anything that has to do with war."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I've eagerly poured through this great series, but was sorely disappointed to see a re-appearance of Sgt. Hawkeswill. His presence ads nothing to this book, other than a great unbelievable diversion.Sharpe mutters about his life-long desire to kill his arch nemesis Sgt. Hawkeswill at least every 200 pages of every book in the series. Then Sharpe, who has not hesitated to kill before, finds Hawkeswill alone in a barn raping his wife, and then decides to let him go?????? This is the same man that murdered 500 innocent people just so he could leave a city, and now he suddenly wants an honorable public death for for his arch enemy??? Cornwell has made Hawkeswill into the ultimate evil nemesis, and he is just too evil and too lucky to be believed. Having Hawkeswill again and again dance around Sharpe and his friend Sgt. Harper makes Sharpe's other exploits all that more unbelievable. How could anyone that is so easily fooled by the insane Hawkeswill accomplish all the heroics described in this and other books? Here is a guy that tracked one enemy through mountains, rivers, etc. for weeks, just for beating him up, but when he finds Hawkeswill raping his wife (for the second time), threating to kill his child, after Hawkeswill has already killed his good friend Cpt. Knowles, and had Sgt. Harper flogged and demoted, he lets Hawkeswill jump out the window without even a chase???? The Sharpe character wanders all over the place from a vile evil killing machine to a goof-balled mush-mellon.Fortunately, we have not had to contend with Hawkeswill for a long time in the series, and hopefully we will not see him again."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"This is another entry on the Sharpe series. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Another great Sharpe book.This is one of my favourites, the book has everything, Sharpe has to deal with lots of things at once, he has his love life to think about, his company, his enemy Hakeswill an a new edition to the Sharpe family.Hakeswill is one of the best characters in Sharpe, his insanity is captivating. I hope to see more of Hakeswill in future Cornwell books, though am sure soon the character will become old and tired and have to be killed off. Robert Knowles is back, its nice to see some previous characters, and to see how they have developed.The book is based around the siege of Badajoz, a bloody battle with an infamous ending. As with all Sharpe books you get an insight into the history of the British army, its refreshing to get an insight into the British army back in the 1800's that not from Hollywood (the murderous soldiers in the patriot etc...). The British army prevented the world becoming one big French Empire in a campaign that today is largely forgotten. Many people talk of Napoleon as the greatest military tactician of his time, but many people don't remember how Lord Wellington beat he and his marshal's. This series of books really brings that great part of British history home.A great installment of Sharpe"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I have found other accounts of siege warfare to be quite tedious but once again Cornwell is able to deliver an exceptional piece of work. Richard Sharpe is truly a heroic figure whose lack of popularity in the United States baffles me. It must be the Telivision Sitcom addicted American public that has allowed this to happen. Long live Richard Sharpe and long live Bernard Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"It's a good book. You always have time for a good Sharpe's adventure. Especially because Obadiah Hawkeswille reappears in this book."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"What are some of the reasons why you read books?* Do you like adventure? * Do you like romance? * Do you like action? * Do you like history?If you answered yes to the above then you will enjoy Sharpe's Company. I started reading these books and I find myself having a hard time putting them down.Sharpe's Company by Bernard Cornwell is an exciting rip-roaring adventure addition to the Sharpe series. You can see Bernard Cornwell's extensive research come to life page after page. The setting is 1812 and the British forces are re-grouping in Spain to repulse the dreaded French juggernaut led by Napoleon. Sharpe's challenge is to defeat the French forces at Badajoz, retain his rank and marry the girl of his desires. All of Sharpe's soldiers are in attendance and ready for battle.Sharpe lost his rank due to a clerical error in England and is now a mere lieutenant. He answers to a commanding officer that has never led a battle command. The captain who replaced him is a well meaning light-weight who lets his sergeant give the orders.Additionally, the evil Sergeant Hakeswell is back in Sharpe's life again and up to his old tricks. I don't think I can imagine of a better villain than Hakeswell. He is ugly, twisted and thoroughly evil. There are no redeeming values to his character. He wants to kill Sharpe and ruin his career. Even Sharpe's friends are in danger from this psychopath.Where Cornwell shines is the description of the battle. He paints a picture of the siege at Badajoz so realistic that you visualize the battle and all of its horrors. His details are fascinating. For example, the advantages and disadvantages of a rifle and a musket, the uses of cannon to reduce castle walls to rubble and the siege warfare techniques of 1800s.I wholeheartedly endorse this book."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"This 1813-set entry in the Napoleonic War series finds Sharpe once again battling two of his most formidable foes: bureaucracy and the thoroughly evil Sgt. Hakeswill, the man responsible for his flogging in India a decade previously. The first of these battles is a foregone conclusion, as the Horse Guards finally reject Sharpe's battlefield commission to Captain, and he is reassigned away from his company as a Lieutenant. The depression this brings about is further exacerbated by the installation of Sgt. Hakeswill in Sharpe's old company. Early on, Sharpe has a chance to kill his legendarily unkillable enemy, but chooses not to and lets him go, saying that he prefers to do so in the sight of 1,000 men, so that everyone knows the deed is done. It's one of the unlikelier plot justifications of the series, made all the more annoying by the long-term implications of that decision. The story continues with Sharpe trying to figure out how to regain a Captaincy, while dealing with the schemes of Hakeswill. This is all set against the backdrop of the siege at the fortress of Badajoz. Cornwell excels at imparting the technical and murderous side of siege warfare at the time, while remaining entertaining. His descriptions of trench-digging, shelling, and futile charges against overwhelming firepower all eerily foreshadow the horrors of France and Belgium 100 years later. For Sharpe, the storming of the fortress is a test of his courage and pride, a point which Cornwell hammers home almost to the point of parody. To top it all off, Sharpe's lover, the guerilla leader Terressa, is holed up in Badajoz, and Sharpe must race to get to her before raping and looting soldiers do. The post-siege descriptions of wholesale rape are based on historical fact, and are not for the faint of heart (or young), so be warned. Another strong entry in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Overall, an excellent novel. I've read many of Sharpe's adventures, and have enjoyed them all. This particular story deals with the siege of Badajoz. It has everything we've come to expect from a Richard Sharpe novel: action, mind-boggling battle scenes, and the occasional romance. My only complaint sounds kinda dumb, even to myself-- the villian, Obadiah Hakeswill. Every so often an author comes up with a villian that he can't bring himself to kill. Even, as in this case, when it goes against all common sense. The character, Sharpe, simply would not allow an enemy to escape as many times as Hakeswill does. I know this is nit-picking, but having some experience in the military, I can safely say that an infantryman does NOT leave an enemy behind him. Not alive, anyway. Okay, enough whining from me. Again, this is an excellent read. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction, action, or military history."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Since I've already reviewed the television adaptation on Sharpe's Company, I'll only briefly give my praise for the Bernard Cornwell novel.The film adaptation keeps true to the written word, but the battle scenes on the page are much more detailed and complex. Cornwell finds historical niches for Richard Sharpe to appear, and the siege of Badajoz is lengthy, rough, deadly, and dirty. Several failed siege attempts are also in the book-unlike the film-raising the stakes for Sharpe-who of course has to deal with army politics, enemies within, and the rescue of his wife and daughter.Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill makes just as much trouble for the written Sharpe as he does onscreen. It's morbidly delightful to read the twisted thoughts of this madman, and Pete Postlehwaite does a fine job of bringing the character to the screen. Of course, on film characters are dropped or combined and dismissed, but in the Sharpe's Company novel, all the supporting officers and soldiers are given plenty of time to develop themselves and their relationship to Sharpe. Hard core friendships and army loyalty between Harper and Sharpe are almost more of a delight to read than see.Historical fans will love any Sharpe novel. I'm not really reading them in order, more as I find them, but it's easy to jump into the series-especially for Hornblower fans. As realistic as C.S. Forester's books are on naval warfare, Sharpe is their equal on the battlefield. The British-ness may take a few folks some getting used to, but Sharpe's Company is well worth the journey."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"If you're reading them in chronological order, rather than the order Cornwell wrote them in, this one has a greater intensity than the earlier Spanish books. Some enjoyable elements have returned. Sharpe is truly up against the career wall once more, his provisional appointment to Captain denied. He has a real love interest, his earlier dalliance with Spanish partisan Teresa Moreno taking a more serious turn. Harper's career is in jeopardy as well with the return of Sharpe's nemesis Obadiah Hakeswill, absent since the end of the third book, \\"Sharpe's Fortress\\" and the Indian battle of Gawilghur almost a decade before. All this fateful tension takes place against the backdrop of a monumental battle, the British assault on the heavily fortified city of Badajoz, held by the French and essential to any invasion of Spain. The heavily walled city is surrounded by a dozen strongpoints, water on two sides and modern fortifications elsewhere.Losing his company to a well-born stranger with no experience, the now merely Lieutenant Sharpe must plot his future as the British wallow in the winter mud outside Badajoz waiting to breach its walls.Cornwell's best writing in this series has been about 18th century siege warfare - the battering of the walls with artillery, use of the rubble as a ramp up to the broken part of the wall, and the hell the first invaders must go through to sieze the hole, after which they are invariably dead, or heroes. It is this and nothing but this, Sharpe thinks, that will win him back his captaincy.Cornwell's writing of the storming of Badajoz, and the pillaging of it by British troops, has a special and fearful intensity to it, his best siege and fortress storming since the aforementioned Gawilghur in \\"Fortress\\". And Hakeswill - merely evil, malign and relentless in the first three books - is here not only that, but mad as well. At times he sounds like Tolkien's Gollum, talking to ... well, you'll see.In the order that Cornwell originally wrote them, this is the first time he does a real siege and the first time he writes Hakeswill. Both come horribly alive. This book is short and bowstring-taut. Not a word is wasted."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"is great.I own all the Sharpe novels, and this is one of the best. Sharpe's exploits on the Iberian Peninsula rank alongside those of Horatio Hornblower at sea - except that Bernard Cornwell's writing style is probably more accessible for the modern reader.The Sharpe stories follow the exploits of a poor officer in the British army as it battles Napoleon's Marshals in Portugal and Spain. Badajoz was a pivotal battle in the campaign, and the seige was a masterpiece of engineering, and a triumph of courage and spirit.Naturally, Sharpe is in the thick of things, battling not only the French, but his enemies in red jackets: the malicious Hakeswill being chief amongst them.But Sharpe, and his ever-trustworthy partner, the huge Irishman Harper, fight through one of the grimmest descriptions of a battle you're ever likely to read.A great episode in the lives of Richard Sharpe, Patrick Harper - and the man who relies so much on them: Arthur Wellesly, the Duke of Wellington."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Cornwall is obviously a military history buff, relishing the dates, companies, weapons, troop movements, locations, battles etc. of the period. If you're into that sort of thing, go hard. Moreover we're drenched in action - this is centred on major battles. And the action carries you along; the page-turning managed to keep me up to knock the book over in a few nights. In his following \`historical note' Cornwall owns up to where he's bent things a little for the sake of his story:&quot;Purists will also be offended that Sharpe attacked Ciudad Rodrigo with the Third Division, and Badajoz with the Fourth, but it is the fate of fictional soldiers to be always where the fight is thickest even when that means a cavalier disregard for the make-up of divisions.&quot;This reminds me of Patrick O'Brian, who I believe said that all the things that happen to his 18th Century RN hero did actually happen - but never to the same man. Books like these can be a far more enjoyable way of learning a bit of history, and both writers are prepared to paint some of the less admirable sides of \`their' heroes and \`their' army (who both go berserk in Sharpe's Company, butchering surrendering French soldiers once they've breached the wall at Badajoz).Comparing the two military historical writers any further, however, can only put Cornwall in the shade. While Cornwall could contend that he's giving an accurate soldier's eye view - grim, ruthless - I found his characters one dimensional, something you couldn't say of O'Brian's Marturin or Aubrey. Indeed, Sharpe's right hand man Harper is barely even a cardboard invention: little John has simply changed his uniform, accent and century. O'Brian's characters often surprised me: it felt like the author had some insight into the journals and accounts he'd read from another age. Once I'd had their opening description Cornwall's characters never did - I felt more like I was reading someone who'd seen a lot of mid-day black and white movies (witness, for example, his massively stereotyped image of the coarse working class army wives). His heroine and his villain could have stepped out of pantomime.For a purportedly historical novel this book is awash with melodramatic fictional conventions - and that bugs me more than if it were, say, thrown into an SF context based on the same historical events. I'd feel far less compelled to judge his W.E. Johns attitude to the largely faceless enemy or the glory of battle. Of course every book is contrived, but this feels so contrived (as opposed to crafted) - Sharpe will suffer several losses (no fault of his own) early in the book so that his eventual inevitable victory will taste all the sweeter. OK, OK, likewise Jack Aubrey, but there's so much else happening along the way. The devotion of Sharpe's men to their dashing leader feels so much more Hollywood than history, as, of course, his charmed ability to stand in a spray of bullets that can only ever touch the minor characters standing around him.Maybe you could put aside the pretentions of authenticity (of character, not dates, events and places) and just enjoy the well researched settings and brutal victories. However even with some pretty generous suspension of disbelief parameters Cornwall's fairly central plot around the villainous Hawkeswill is internally stupid. A deranged (yet cunning) serial rapist-murderer, Sharpe's nemesis, who in previous books has given Sharpe overwhelming personal motivations to kill. Early in the book he gives us one more - he corners Sharpe's lover and attempts to rape and kill her. Sharpe and little John step in mid-attack and overpower him. Hawkeswill sternly vows his intention to rape and kill her at the earliest opportunity. Sharpe's assassin girlfriend offers to kill him. Harper begs for the task. Sharpe - who's bread and butter is killing - says he wants to kill him. Yet ... like those who oppose Batman and James Bond, for some reason these seasoned executioners inexplicably can't bring themselves to simply fire a round or insert a knife. Sharpe's reasoning, \\"I want to do it publicly,\\" out of some sort of supposedly noble desire to thereby purge the evil Hawkeswill has visited on so many - is nothing short of ridiculous. The result is that Hawkeswill is simply turned free - by the hero - to torture, rape and kill more innocents and provide suspense. In order to set up the climax of Sharpe having to win the race past the walls of Badajoz to rescue his defacto wife and child from the lurking killer/rapist, Cornwall expects his readers to have his supposedly super-resourceful hero blithely let him walk around untouched - without even bothering to attempt to kill him. It's far worse than the insufferably procrastinating Hamlet, as Sharpe is supposed to be an unusually able plotter and killer. This absurd contradiction bugged me (did you pick that?), and got more and more stupid as the book went on - to the supreme stupidity of Hawkeswill getting away yet again (from three armed experienced killers in the one room) to lurk about in the next novel! Hawkeswill, in contrast, actually had the intelligence to know who his enemies were, to carefully observe them and take rational and devious measures to bring them down (such as the not uncommon fragging. That being said, it is also stupid that Hawkeswill's never been fragged).OK, sure, if Cornwall was wanting to write cartoon farce (\\"Next time, Gadget, next time\\"; \\"Ah, Von-Stalhein - we meet again\\"), this is acceptable, nay, expected. But hard-bitten, carefully researched historical fiction? Only as hard bitten as Georgette Heyer. He doesn't have to write something as bleak as All Quiet on the Western Front, but he should at least be informed by it. Alternatively he could write \`historical fiction' like Alexandre Dumas, where the characters are deliberately far larger than life and we can relish the greater emphasis on the \`fiction' without the troubling demands of trying to be essentially \`historical' within precisely documented specific events."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Sharpe! Sharpe! Sharpe!I encourage you to read these books in order of the chronology of the events, rather than the order in which they are written. If you've been doing that, you've probably wondered whatever happened to Sergeant Obadiah (\\"I can't be killed\\") Hakeswill who we last read about in India. In Sharpe's Company, this spawn of the underworld returns to cause lots of mischief.Viscount Wellington is still leading the allied forces in the Peninsula, having secured Portugal. In Sharpe's Company, two fortresses bar the way into Napoleon's Spain, Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. Naturally, Sharpe plays a key role in both battles. In this book, you get two sieges for the price of one.The love story is much stronger here than usual in the series as the female partisan leader from Sharpe's Gold, Teresa, makes an important return appearance. In the process, Sharpe learns he has become a father . . . and his daughter is being cared for in Badajoz.Sharpe's career also takes a turn for the worse. The temporary captaincy comes to an end, and he's reduced in rank to lieutenant reporting to a new captain who isn't as decisive as he might be. Hakeswill is soon undermining everyone to put himself to an advantage, and Sharpe's morale plummets while his hatred of Hakeswill grows.Sharpe also comes to resent that he cannot become a permanent captain and toys with the idea of leading a Forlorn Hope into the breach to gain such a promotion.The story's ending may turn your stomach more than a little as Mr. Cornwell treats us to a pretty graphic description of the sack of Badajoz by the British and Portuguese. It may be more historical realism than you really want to know about. Before that, the blood and guts get to be pretty strong as suicidal charge after suicidal charge is led into Badajoz's breaches.It's an exciting book that you won't soon forget. I happen to like fiendish villains, and Hakeswill is a fine example to my taste. I love to wonder what horrible trick he will pull next."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"This was the third novel written in the Richard Sharpe Napoleonic Wars series, though by internal chronology it's about halfway through Sharpe's recorded career. It's early 1812 and the comparatively small British-Portuguese army under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, now Lord Wellington, is about to undertake the invasion of Spain. But first, they have to take the fortified Ciudad Rodrigo, guarding the principal highway in the north. Sharpe has a part in that, naturally -- and then he's reunited with Teresa, the Partisan leader from _Sharpe's Gold,_ and finds out he's a father. Now the army will move south to attempt (for the third time) to take the much larger and much more formidable city of Badajoz. Things appear to be looking up. But Sharpe is never lucky for very long, and when his badly wounded colonel (his old friend from India, Lawford) is shipped back home, the replacement is a fox-hunting countryman with no patience for Sharpe's somewhat eccentric ways. More than that, Sharpe's temporary promotion has been rejected back in London and he finds himself replaced in command of the Light Company by a young officer with the funds to have purchased the position. Sharpe is back to being a lieutenant, at least until a vacancy opens up. To retrieve his command, and in a way that no one can deprive him of it again, he's determined to be the first man through the breach when they assault Badajoz. But, worst of all, Sgt. Obediah Hakeswill has joined the battalion. Hakeswill is a thief, blackmailer, inveterate liar, and the man who not only recruited Sharpe nearly twenty years before but also got him unjustly flogged when he was just a private. He's also increasingly insane, believing (with some justification) that he cannot be killed -- and he harbors a passionate hatred for Sharpe. The reader can sort of see where all this melodrama is going, but it's the journey that Cornwell makes fascinating. Badajoz was one of Wellington's greatest challenges in the Peninsular Campaign and taking it cost him thousands of casualties. Cornwell takes his time telling of the siege, the assault, and the sack that followed, and does it all with his usual attention to the gritty, bloody details."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Company: Book XIII of the Sharpe Series","review":"In the early months of 1812, Wellington led his army to French-occupied Spain. Captain Richard Sharpe participates in the storming of the fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. The siege of Badajoz is bloody for the British army. They failed twice before and now Wellington wants the fortress at any cost. As Wellington moves on Badajoz, a new Colonel and a new Captain arrive from England and the command of Sharpe's Light Company has been given to this new Captain who bought the promotion. Sergeant Hakeswill, who is ruthless, cruel, indestructible and Sharpe's oldest and toughest enemy also joins the company. Hakeswill could do anything to terrorise everyone in the company, including Sharpe and Harper. Sharpe desperately fights for his company, and for Teresa, the woman he loves and with her is Antonia, their daughter, both blocked in the besieged city of Badajoz.Again, Mr Cornwell did an excellent job in Sharpe's company.

Who knew vinegar had so many uses?!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I have in the past been paid to do other people's laundry. I've had to remove blood, rust, wine, stage blood, body odor, urine, mud, crayon,gum, lipstick, sap... and so on and so forth. On the rare occasion I've been faced with a stain not listed in this book, the Queen has usually left enough information to help me figure it out for myself. The products she recommends are simple and gentle (vinegar, baking soda, Borax...) and everything is laid out in an easy to read format. This is a reference book for everyone."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"When my son came home from pre-K with dirty/grass stained pants, I knew that was just the start of learning how to clean his clothes. I knew I needed to learn how to do laundry, else I would be throwing away A LOT of clothes. I actually have highlighted several tips in this book, and purchased some everyday type of products I would never have known about how they work with cleaning to get rid of spots, stains, and scorch marks. Now that we have pets, and we go to the gym regularly, I'm learning more about getting rid of odors and smells. The only time I had to refer somewhere else was to learn how to get rid of candle wax off of clothes. I wrote the tip in the \\"Your Personal Tips and Hints\\" page, which was obviously designed for this type of purpose.I do not believe you would be disappointed in this book. It makes a great gift for a new mom, a new wife, or as a gift to someone who has everything."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"Great book with very useful information to use for a life time.

I'm pleased with my purchase. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I bought and liked &quot;Talking Dirty&quot;, but was disappointed that much of what I was looking for was not in it. Ah, here came the &quot;laundry&quot; book and I was more than impressed. I salvaged two garments, both of which were pretty new but BADLY stained. I now have two beautiful &quot;new&quot; tops...(one a beige sweater, one a white sweatshirt)...Love the book, wish I would have had the advice througout the last 35 years of marriage and babies, etc...can't wait to tackle the future grandkids' stuff now!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"Hi Kelly: You wrote that this book didn't have a solution for GRASS STAINS, so I thought of you when I saw Linda Cobb's other book called &quot;A Queen for All Seasons: A Year of Tips, Tricks, and Picks for a Cleaner House and a More Organized Life!&quot;In this book it states the following: (Just ONE of the things in this book.)Spring: Garden the natural way...allergy-proof your home...banish GRASS STAINS...color your Easter eggs....SO....I thought you might like to get this book to help with some of those grass stains we all know kids are very good at getting ground into clothes. You didn't have your email address so I could write you......so I hope you see this recommendation."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I found so much useful information in this book! I really enjoy it and use it often. I appreciate the fact that most of her cleaning solutions are non-toxic as I have a 2 year old at home.I found that baking soda WILL unclog a drain (combined with a few other things) :) In fact baking soda by itself will clean quite a bit of your home."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I have done a million loads of laundry, and I learned a lot from this book, including ways to wash for my really allergic family, and use more natural products. A really easy read, and great advise."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I saw this book on Oprah. If she recommends it, it must be good, right? Wrong. The book doesn't deliver what it promises. Common stains are not always included. I assume that Oprah recommended it because (of course) she doesn't do her own laundry and would have no way of judging the quality of this kind of book for those of us who do not have hired help."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I'm not very good with laundry. It turns out that every time I've referenced it, the stain I'm looking to treat isn't included. For instance, GRASS STAINS! Where is that??? Anyone who has children would look for this first, yet it's not even in there. There are many common stains that aren't even listed. I wouldn't recommend this book; and I'm surprised that Oprah did."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"The &quot;Queen of Clean&quot; has done it again!

One should always take precautions before doing a lot of this tips at home. Not everything is for everybody. If you have children with allergies or smaller children, you should take more precautions. The book is helpful, but some things in this book is basic common sense."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"I read this book, to find a way of cleaning off coffee-ground emisis off my coat. My mother had a upper-GI bleed and had projectile vomit all over my new kitchen. This emeises did not match my costom drapes nor, my paisley wallpaper. This book did not give any information on how to clean this blood-induced mess up. I then looked in the chapter named &quot;Cleanin' up after your religious sacrifice.&quot; I found this chapter loaded with vivid details how Linda C. Cobb was able to clean up after her llama and spider monkey sacrifice. I would recommend this book to all teen-agers and some wacked out geriatric people."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"By now many of us are familiar with the &quot;Queen of Clean,&quot; the duchess of the dustmop, the princess of pressing problems - she's frank, funny, down to earth Linda Cobb, author of &quot;Talking Dirty with the Queen of Clean.&quot; Who can forget Tang in your toilet?This foe of all that dulls the sparkle of our homes is evidently also a bundle of inexhaustible energy as she is a regular on morning television, and publishes a bi-monthly newsletter.Now, she's come to cure our Monday blues - laundry! If your T-shirts shrink, your socks are unpaired, your drip dries don't, the iron spews instead of steaming, give a listen to &quot;Talking Dirty Laundry with the Queen of Clean.&quot; In addition, she has more remedies for spot removal than linen has wrinkles. These cures for grape juice on gingham or jelly on jumpers are all inexpensive, effective, and surprising!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"This book could be retitled Laundry for Dummies.

The Queen is so smart--and she's adorable too!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"OK, I admit it. Laundry isn't exactly my favorite subject and I certainly had no intention of buying a book about laundry. But after enjoying the sense of humor and solid down-to-earth advice from the Queen of Clean's first book, &quot;Talking Dirty with the Queen of Clean,&quot; I went for it. And I'm glad I did. Once again, the Queen provides great ideas for formerly impossible stains and new techniques for old products. Every home should have the complete Queen of Clean library. Write on, Queen!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"A very easy to read and follow book about removing every kind of stain that I've encountered. Organized by chapter for those who want to read it cover to cover. Great index for those who just want to look up their stain problem and find the solution quickly without reading the book cover to cover.Many of the stains can be removed with simple projects we have around the house. Other times specific chemical solutions are recommended. Often times she suggests both a specific chemical and an alternative with something you probably have at home already which is handy. General instructions such as dabbing at a stain, not rubbing at it, and why, are explained and are easy to remember (and work)!A great chapter on general use and care of the washing machine and another on the same subject with your clothes dryer. Why didn't anyone teach me this information? Why doesn't this information come with the appliances when we buy them? I don't know the answers but this book is the solution. Tips such as how to clean the fabric softener dispenser and how, and when to clean your dryer's lint collector, and a solution for when you discover wrinkled clothes in the dryer. General care instructions for all kinds of fabrics and items such as drapes and lampshades.A great resource for an inexpensive price. How about both of her books as a bridal shower gift or for the new parents?"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"Ever try to explain to a teenager or a guy WHY the yellow bathmat and the jeans don't go in the same wash? Well, don 't bother. Just hand them this book. And read it yourself if you screw up and leave a lipstick in your pocket, a pen or face some unruly stains."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"This book should be one of the first books you ever buy your son or daughter when they leave the nest. Perhaps, when they come home to visit, the underwear will not be hot pink, the pant legs (if they are pressed at all) will not have three separate creases down the front, the pantyhose will not be a glob of twisted pretzels, and the pricey angora sweaters will not look as if someone just shot the poor rabbit!No matter how old you live to be, you still live and learn, and no matter how great a homemaker you truly are, you are bound to discover something here that you never knew before. Buy the book, it makes a terrific reference guide and is filled with interesting facts and tips. Aside from the book, I wonder if Linda Cobb does house calls. I have this incredible mountain of laundry piling up...."},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"OK, I haven't read it myself, but I've heard enough from my wife to write a review (she keeps reading tips out loud to me)! She sat down and read it cover to cover and keeps it handy as a &quot;reference&quot; book. It's filled with practical, simple &quot;secrets&quot; that really do work when it comes to cleaning laundry (like using lemon juice and sunshine to whiten whites), much as her other book about general cleaning does. The book will probably pay for itself after you try a few tips. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"This book is priceless! I got sap on my car, so I found on the internet to clean it with alcohol, which helped with the sap, but it left a residue behind. After looking on the internet again to clean THAT, I remembered my book, which I bought years ago while still living at home. I flipped open the book and under the \\"Cleaning Products You Should Never Be Without\\", Ms. Cobb said to use a paste of baking soda and water. I did just that and sprayed white vinegar after I was done (my mom told me to use that). TA-DA!!! A clean windshield again!! All Hail The Queen Of Clean!!"},{"Title":"Talking Dirty Laundry With The Queen Of Clean","review":"This explains how to do laundry so easily! Get stains out, ect. This book has helped my laundry doing greatly within the past month!"},{"Title":"In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture Through the Ages","review":"Michael Rose's In Tiers of Glory is an excellent follow-up to his earlier book Ugly As Sin. Whereas the earlier book delved into the theology and philosophy of church architecture in order to show how it had been derailed by modernists with an obsession with novelty and an aversion to orthodox Christianity, In Tiers of Glory examines the historical aspects of the Catholic tradition in church architecture. Written for the layman, it is amazingly clear, concise and accurate. Chapter 10 on the return of Iconoclasm and the advent of modernism is worth the price alone. Its greatest asset perhaps is that it is generously illustrated with dozens of examples of beautiful church architecture (along with a few warty toads for contrast)."},{"Title":"In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture Through the Ages","review":"The standard stereotype of history, architectural or otherwise, imagines humanity leaping from one sea-change to the next. In the study of architectural history, one style gives way to the next as each generation of designers seek to outdo one another in the name of progress. However, with &lt;em>In Tiers of Glory&lt;/em> Michael Rose seeks to understand not these ruptures but the more important element of the underlying continuity of principle that runs throughout the development of church design. It is this unity which ties the various styles of Christian architecture together like a vast tectonic Communion of Saints. And, as Michael Rose shows us, it is the deliberate rupture of those common elements that stretch across the centuries, done in the name of a false modernity, that has led to the current decadence of sacred art.Unlike past attempts to reform Christian architecture, art and worship, &lt;em>In Tiers of Glory&lt;/em> is not merely revivalist: it proposes no single idyllic golden age of architecture but instead opens our eyes to see the beauties of every age (and the organic continuity which ties them together) and urges us to learn from them, synthesize them, and with these lessons, evangelize the art of the future.Rose does us a great service by liberating us from the trap of the \\"spirit of the age\\" and showing us we can choose beauty over banality. Indeed, as he shows us, many architects already have. In his final chapter, \\"The Wisdom of Hindsight,\\" he showcases the works of contemporary architects, such as Thomas Gordon Smith and Duncan Stroik, who have drawn on more than two thousand years of experience rather than merely pursue change for change's sake. Magnificently illustrated with color photographs and specially-commissioned watercolor renderings, &lt;em>In Tiers of Glory&lt;/em> is not only a joy for the committed architect to read, but also a must for any layperson looking to be educated about the history--and the future--of church architecture."},{"Title":"Commodity and Exchange in the Mongol Empire: A Cultural History of Islamic Textiles (Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civilization)","review":"I first read this book when researching clothing of the Mongol Empire. Thoroughly researched and supported by primary sources, this book sets a gold standard of scholarship for textile and costume research. Although somewhat dry reading for most people, it provides valuable insight into cultural priorities of the Mongol Empire, in addition to practical information suited to the reenactor. Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This enchanting book is made up of vignettes from the points of view of two bachelor brothers who own a bed &amp; breakfast, as well as the perspectives of many of their visitors. I had a lot of trouble putting this one down because I looked forward to reading what new insights the characters might have. The format made it even more difficult to put down, as it is made up of short sections, leading me to constantly think, &quot;Just one more chapter, then I'll do something else...!&quot; I loved the observations in the book, and found myself calling up people I knew or typing short excerpts into emails just to share the delight with them. Many of the excerpts were funny, many were thoughtful, a few were sad, but all were interesting. This one is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I have just finished reading this book and am already looking for more titles by this author. It is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read - and I have read many. I loved the style of writing and the humor. I only wish I could visit that bed &amp; breakfast. It sounds like my idea of the perfect vacation. I will read this one again. And Bill Richardson, if you read this, please write more!!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"A friend gave me this book feeling that I would enjoy the way it was written and how Mr. Richardson uses language throughout. She was half right.The twists and little turns of phrase and language were enjoyable, but rare. Instead, uncommon words are used to fill the simple sentences and try to lend some weight to an unremarkable book.Otherwise, the brothers are barely distinguishable, though they have completely different mannerisms. There is nothing that grabs hold of the reader to differentiate between them or any of the guests.If I found it in a $.10 box at a yardsale, I would buy it. Otherwise, it isn't worth the cost of shipping."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I laughed so hard, I nearly bought a round of drinks! Especially the part about what the parrot said when their mum was found dead.It was that hysterical kind of laughter; you know, you think you're done laughing and then out comes another hysterical giggle. A laughing jag, I guess you'd say.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I stumbled upon a well-worn copy of this little gem while vacationing at the Pudding Pan Guesthouse on the south shore of Nova Scotia. I advise each of you to buy a copy, then rent the Pudding Pan for a week or so (902-354-4944). Snuggle under the down comforter on the comfy loft bed, open the window (for the sea breeze), and read this book. There is a danger in this endeavor, however...it may cause you to question your current hectic pace of living."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"You'll be glad you checked into the Bachelor Brother's Bed &amp; Breakfast. What a delightful read! The twins Hector &amp; Virgil alternate chapters telling tidbits of information and charming stories about their lives, their b&amp;b and people they have met along the way. Thrown in are entries from guests of the B&amp;B. There are many laugh out loud moments. The pictures painted are cozy, light hearted and humorous. Reading it is like curling up into a warm quilt and spoiling yourself with a mug of hot cocoa. I can't wait to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"Bill Richardson is always brilliant. Bachelor Brothers B&amp;B is touching, whimsical, hilarious and eloquent. This is the perfect book for a rainy day at the cottage. The Brothers live in a world where you can embrace life's simple pleasures and leave cynicism, violence, sexism and homophobia at the gate. A great gift for book-lovers, your best friend or your grandmother."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I first noticed the colors and fonts on the binding in the library, and that's what made me pick this book up in the first place. But at soon as I started reading I knew I would love it! One of the great things about this book is that you can open it anywhere and start reading and it's just as fun. I thought it was very entertaining, funny and heartwarming, and I think just about anyone could enjoy it. I ended up buying it for everyone on my Christmas list last year, and so far I've heard all rave reviews!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This is a terriffic book - good for reading in short spells or all at once. It touches on a variety of topics close to my heart - cats, learning to play an instrument as an adult, books, croquet, scrabble - many of life's simpler pleasures! As other reviewers have said, I began re-reading the book immediately upon finishing it! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"Some of the small moments are cute in this book but I wouldn't recommend it as a must-read. The author goes off on tangents and the literary writing is a bit over the top to sound like owners of a bed and breakfast."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This is a GREAT story, brilliantly written. The audio version is a let down.It is titled 'unabridged' but parts of the book ARE missing. For instance when we first meet Mrs. Rochester - in the book we get a few paragraphs about Virgil & Hector's mother's dying moments. These paragraphs are censored on the audio version.While it was some curiosity value to hear the author's voice, his delivery is akin to an uninspired newsreader at times.The material means it will be good. I am sorry it is so pasteurised. It could have been so much better.B~Gal"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I read this book with delight in every page. For fun summer reading....this is the book. Many vignettes make for varied story lines. You can pick it up anywhere and read just one story or several. Don't read all at once for then it will be over too soon."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"Everyone in the story seems to be eccentric, and perhaps that's why they all fit together so well. I enjoyed the story, and the idea of place you could vacation where you'd actually have the time to read. The two lists of authors that one of the brothers offered intrigued me. And a couple of the stories that were told had me laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"What a delight &quot;The Brothers&quot; are - this and the follow up, &quot;Pillow Book&quot; are delightful to read and to give to those who love books, love life, and love off-beat lifestyles. One can, from Bill Richardson's descriptions, picture well the brothers and their guests and neighbors.Alas, I've had friends in Vancouver check and it seems the B&amp;B and the brothers are .. fictional but if one could ever find a B&amp;B of this sort, with characters that make the town lively, do pass it on."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I love this book!!! It is the only book I have ever read that I immediately wanted to re-read as soon as I finished it. My husband read it at the same time as me, he would pick it up as soon as I put it down. The book left me with a happy feeling every time I read any part of it.Bachelor Brothers' Bed & Breakfast"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This book is a delight - an educated, hilarious romp through the stories of middle-age twin brothers, living on a remote west coast island, who run their own bed and breakfast. Chapters consisting of stories about the brothers' past are interspersed with anecdotes written by their guests. Particularly sidesplitting are the arrival at the B&amp;B of Waffle the cat, and the account of one guest's &quot;decorator&quot; robbers. Endearing characters meander their way in and out of the stories. Overall, a refreshing sense of humour prevails; it is very sad to have to put it down after the last page is read"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"Wonderfully relaxing short read. I loved the stories, the characters, visiting the idea of that kind of life vicariously. I'd read it with a cup of tea or coffee and a whole grain muffin with fruit.I read a lot, 2 to 4 books per week, depending on length of books, a lot non-fiction, but love my fiction and literature (junk too to keep up reading speed). Always have 4 or more books going at a time (no, I don't have a hard time keeping them straight). I'll remember the feeling of this little book and I do. Read this a long time ago.Debbie DOrlando, FL"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"We should receive some royalties on the numbers of this book we've purchased for friends. We reread it every year. It's pleasant for bedtime shared reading. Just a wonderfully delightful read."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I love this book. It is funny, warm, intelligent and relaxing. If you are stressed and need a place to relax, visit Bachelor Brother's Bed and Breakfast."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I think heaven might be a little like this: a beautiful, cozy bed and breakfast, in a rural, peaceful setting, where the owners are two delightful, quirky, book and animal lovers, whose labor of love is a retreat for people who also love natural beauty, good books of every kind, and their pets. Reading this book is like a mini retreat in itself. Every page brings something to smile about or to reflect upon in the gentlest way. In this bed and breakfast the food is good, solitude is encouraged, yet good company is never far away. I refuse to believe this place is fictional, but then again, I keep looking for Middle Earth around every corner. This is a great gift book, sure to bring many smiles of pleasure to the bibliophiles in your life."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"It's a light read--slow paced yet easy to digest, and quirky enough to be worthwile."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This book was suggested to our reading group because of its rave reviews. I felt that this book had no character development, no story and had very little to offer. Even the writing style was weak. Why was this novel so highly recommended when there are so many enriching book to encounter?"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This book was well-written but too &quot;cute&quot;. The author tried a bit too hard to make each character an eccentric. While I consider myself well-read, the numerous literary references grew tiresome. It is simply not an interesting book and one I quit reading before reaching the end."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"What a stupid book! I was expecting a good read, but the writing was pretentious and pedantic and the plot was pointless. I'm so disappointed!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I have to admit, I'm easy to please. Great audio books are few and far between, but the writing, the reading, the tone and the stories on these cds were to me pretentious and overbearing. Save yourself the money and buy a classic. I enjoyed the &quot;seabiscuit&quot; story on Cd. Get that. I should have known better. Was it quaint? Maybe. Interesting or well done- no. I'd have more fun just reading a log book from an inn than listening to this again."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This is a charming little book that centers around twin brothers, Hector and Virgil, 50-something bachelors who run a Bed & Breakfast in a remote island location. Though word-of-mouth, they have attracted a customer base consisting entirely of fellow bibliophiles, and thus reading is a central theme throughout the novel.The book is written as a series of reflections: each chapter is narrated by either Hector, Virgil, or one of their guests, whose musings make up the B&B;'s unique guest book. The brothers relate stories of their unconventional childhood with their single mother and MIA father as well as offer present day anecdotes about their entertaining guests, neighbors, and pets. Also interspersed throughout the book are recommended reading lists such as &quot;Hector's List of Favorite Authors for the Bath.&quot;This quirky, whimsical novel is ideally suited to be a reading group selection and likely to be enjoyed by any book lover."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"The Bachelor Brothers Bed &amp; Breakfast remains one of my top five books. The sequel falls right behind it, and in fact, is even funnier than the first. U.S. readers may not be familiar with Mr. Richardson who is well known across Canada as one of the funniest and most interesting of the talk show hosts on C.B.C. radio. The novel has, I think, a Canadian quality to it, but in all respects, any lover of books, good humour, and exellent writing will enjoy this book. It is not a &quot;deep&quot; read but still witty, thoughtful, and by no means &quot;fluffy&quot;. Bill Richardson has been referred to as a Canadian Garrison Keillor. The comparison is likely not incorrect, but from my perspective, Richardson is much funnier. Buy BOTH this book and the sequel (don't wait because you will indeed want to read the next one) for a fun, enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"This is such a wonderful book! It was one of the few books that I've read that I actually laughed out loud. The best part is when I tried to describe it to others, the characters seemed even more eccentric and loveable, even though the people I was telling it to thought it sounded insane. Richardson writes in a gentle way, never knocking you over the head with his attempts to be witty or clever. Who can't read the chapter about the disastrous Halloween party without doubling over? All in all, a wonderful, fun book for a rainy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I was browsing the local (independant) bookstore shelves the other day and this little gem veritably leapt off the shelves into my hand. I read over the back cover and was sufficiently intrigued to carry it to the till and purchase it. I must say it's one of the best buys I've made in a long time. This book has been described as whimsical - I find this little paperback a work of comic genius. It is no surprise to me that it was awarded the Stephen Leacock Award... it's a well deserved win.The ever-endearing Canadian charm that holds us in high esteem about the world shines through this brilliant penning. It is laugh-out-loud funny... particularly the eccentric Mrs. Rochester. One of my fave sections of the book is the birthday serenade by bagpipes. Thankfully I hadn't finished my coffee and needed a toilet break whilst reading that segment. Brilliant writing and my kudos to Mr. Richardson. I look forward to reading more of his work. 'Bachelor Brothers' has instantly become one of my all-time favorite novels. Can't recommend this title highly enough!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"For those of us who do not prefer to read grizzly horror novels, but instead clever, amusing stories that de-stress us on work breaks or ease us gently into sleep....this is a great book! I've read it four times - and it has become a bedside favorite. Ignore the cynical Kirkus review above...everyone I know has loved this book and has passed it along to a friend."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I picked this book up off the shelf of the library partly because I could not find anything better to read. What I found was a treasure. I don't know why this book isn't better known. I laughed out loud in quite a few parts. It was refreshing to find a book that was funny and smart without being vulgar and too cynical. (Not that cynical is such a bad thing.) Anyway, I can't wait to read the sequal. Being a bibliomaniac myself, I was delighted with the snippets of poetry and book lists in between. You've got to read this. If you like this, you might try P.G. Wodehouse or James Herriott."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I love Bill Richardson! I just caught up with the Bachelor Brothers; it is rare for me to laugh out loud while reading, but this book and one of its sequels had me roaring. All I could think was, &quot;How can I start a similar bed and breakfast?&quot; It is touching, funny, literate -- a real bibliophile's delight. Nuts to Kirkus Reviews for not liking the lists (bathroom reading, bathtub reading, etc.); I was very grateful for them. Hector and Virgil rock!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I'm a great fan of Barbara Pym, Emily Eden, Margaret Oliphant, Anthony Trollope, PG Wodehouse, and similar writers of gentle (and not-so-gentle) social humor. When I found this book, then, I was pleased to find another promising author that seemed to fit this type.The first chapter was amusing enough, written from one of the Bachelor Brother's points of view. Richardson has some very nice turns of phrase and is very good with his imagery. He's also skilled at changing the &quot;voice&quot; of the narrator for each chapter. The book very quickly palled for me after that first chapter, though, and it quickly became just a tedious read. I found the characters uninteresting, the setting only mildly engaging, and the overall lack of plot dull.Fortunately, it was also a very short book, which is good for anyone who has to finish whatever book they start. As light summer reading, one could do worse that this light-weight volume, but one could undoubtedly also do better."},{"Title":"Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast","review":"I love the wonderful 'play on words' which is delightfully scattered throughout this book.

I prefer to keep the review simple with a few facts (so as to keep the book a surprise) and my opinion if it's worth the read. With that in mind, I will say that this book is worth the read.I enjoyed the writing style, the humor and found myself savoring the book; stalling my reading it in order to make it last longer.Buy it!

It is relaxing, refreshing, and if you are a book lover you feel you are among friends while you read.

Modern business does not put up with the attitude presented by the author. In the conclusion, he actually writes, \\"To be a good network administrator is to have your end users love you. To be a great network administrator is to have your users too scared to ask you for help\\". A person with this attitude would not make it past the first interview in any organization I have worked for.In other words, this is a book on how to make yourself useless to your organization.This is such an outdated mode of thinking. The modern IT department is an internal customer service organization (and if it is not it will soon be outsourced); not an adversarial IT guy versus end user organization.There is only about two paragraphs of useful knowledge in this book (under \\"The know your servers\\" and \\"Know the server room\\" headings).This author proves the old adage \\"Those who can't do teach\\". I would recommend a pass on this title."},{"Title":"What All Network Administrators Know","review":"Finally, I found a book that tells me what you really need to know to become a Network Administrator. No other book I have found is as informative and interesting, with it's to the point writing style and witt thrown on top. I have looked high and low for a book like this, and it is finally here.

I also stumbled over the typo's. Dougie, you gotta get a different editor next time! A typo every 2-3 pages in a book this size is unacceptable and distracts from the subject at hand. The book was a great attempt at self-publishing except for that one issue. I will read the first chapter of the new book at Borders or B&N; if the editing isn't any better it will stay on the shelf.Overall, it's a good read for the target audience, including wannabe-netadmin's who are interested in NA - I still refer back to this book from time to time as it covers some good basic ground on NA."},{"Title":"What All Network Administrators Know","review":"Mr. Chick sure knows how it is!

I wish my former employer could read it!"},{"Title":"Traditional Papercrafts: Parchment Craft, Stencil Embossing, Paper Pricking, Quilling","review":"Of all the authors who publish papercraft how-to books, I turn to Janet Wilson most often because of her clear and practical directions on quilling, parchment craft, teabag folding--all decorative paper arts seem to be within her realm.If you already own her book on parchment craft, you will notice that it is included in \\"Traditional Papercrafts,\\" however the card and bookmark patterns are much larger in the original book. This will not be a problem if you are already planning to enlarge the patterns.In the largest section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts,\\" the author describes and shows photographs of the materials and equipment you will need to get started with the fifteenth-century art of parchment craft. She does not actually list suppliers, but they are easily discovered out on the internet. (One of my favorites is \\"willascommodities.com\\".) You really don't need much to start with, just the correct type of paper (which is not really parchment), scissors with short curved blades and fine points (very much like manicure scissors), a pen and white ink for tracing, a couple of pads to place underneath the paper while embossing and perforating, embossing tools (basically knob-ended sticks to use for drawing & rubbing), and needle tools for perforating the paper into fancy patterns.Many of the directions are illustrated by step-by-step color photographs, especially when the author is demonstrating a new method such as applying color with oil pastels, or using the four-needle tool to make lace.The next section demonstrates the Victorian art of stencil embossing, and requires even less tools than parchment craft: basically card paper, stencils, fancy-edged rulers (for card edges) and tools fitted with embossing tips (just like you might already own for parchment work). A lightbox is nice for back-lighting the stencil, so that its outlines can be seen through the paper. The author demonstrates techniques for producing cameo (raised) designs and intaglio (impressed) images.If you are a fan of all things Celtic, this type of knotwork lends itself very nicely to embossing.Examples of the art of paper pricking can be found in Regency pattern books and correspondence, but the heyday of this craft appears to have been around 1840 - 1860. As always, the author lists the basic tools and materials (paper, needle, pricking mat) and useful extras, e.g. a needle vice and cuticle scissors. Some very intricate border patterns that you can prick out are included, with directions on how to enlarge them to card-size.If you really enjoy paper pricking, you may want to advance into paper lace. Add translucent paper, a sharp craft knife, a tapestry needle and some gold thread to your equipment and construct some very fancy card borders, complete with embroidery. The author includes patterns and examples of completed projects.The final section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts\\" concerns quilling, the art of tightly winding paper strips, pinching them into various shapes, and gluing the shapes into fancy designs--anything from flowers to coats-of-arms.Supplies include quilling paper (which you can buy pre-cut into strips), quilling tools which resemble small long-needled awls, blank cards, scissors, straight pins, and glue (I suggest paper glue). Another very useful piece of equipment is a quilling cork board marked with circles where you can pin your petals, rolls, leaves, and hearts into (say) a Christmas wreath before gluing the individual pieces together. An optional piece of equipment is a fringing tool ($50 at the quillingsuperstore.com). You might also want a paper crimper. Both of the latter items are needed for any fancy flower creations.Photographs of some fine old quilled borders for holy pictures and free-standing crosses are included, as well as directions for creating simpler designs for cards and Christmas ornaments.If you are at all interested in papercraft, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"Traditional Papercrafts: Parchment Craft, Stencil Embossing, Paper Pricking, Quilling","review":"I've read lots of books of papercrafting, and I have decided that ornare is the type of papercraft I love the most. The author of this book really knows how to pass on her knowledge of this craft. I would recommend this book as the best there is out there."},{"Title":"Point of View for My Work as an Author (Torchbooks)","review":"This is one of the master's most accessible works. Kierkegaard takes a summary look at his life- work at what he has tried to achieve as a writer. His contention is that from the beginning all his masks and poses, all his ironic gestures were made for one purpose only to waken Christendom to the meaning of what it is to be a true Christian. The life example is the teaching, and the teaching is of an attempt to inwardly relate to God, and live his life as life of total dedication to God.One does not have to be a Christian to be moved by the example, by the great power of mind, by the sense of play with literary forms, by the gift of language, by the originality in thought, and by the unique way of making his own story into literature."},{"Title":"In Him, I Am Able","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I personally knew Mellie Smith. I knew Mellie the woman and mission worker, the church secretary and fun-lover. Mellie the Christian, wife, mother, and grandmother was my friend. The author died before this book was published. And I, along with every other human being who had benefitted from her joy, wished that God had let her live. But Mellie wanted to be with the Lord. That was our only comfort at the time, and then her book came out. A family-written addendum detailing Mellie's last few weeks of life had not yet been added into my review copy, but was a powerful epilogue.\\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\\" That quote from Phillippians was Mellie's mantra and set the tone for everything she did. It's all here in this book. When Mellie was in Africa, braving human cruelty and killer bees, Christ was with her clearing out the way. And when evil personified threatened her in Haiti, her Savior was riding shotgun. Humanity took on a finer meaning when Mellie shared her love in prisons, because she hated sin but loved the sinner, just as Jesus wants us all to do. Every place she went, everything she did, Mellie Smith took Jesus with her. She spread her love and His around to make our sometimes dreary world a little brighter.This book is only one small part of Mellie's legacy. What she was and all she did for Christ and others remains as a testimony to her boundless faith. In Him I Am Able shares the author's zest for life, her strongly held beliefs. Her words are full of hope, the writing eloquent. Mellie Smith is still a bright example of what humans ought to be, sharing humor and a healthy shot of courage from beyond the pale."},{"Title":"The Barracks","review":"I had to look for a long time for a copy of this novel when I wanted to read it last year; it's fantastic that it's been brought back into print in the US and abroad. The success of McG's recent novels Amongst Women and By the Lake/That They May Face the Rising Sun casts a soft light upon his earlier fiction from the 1960s, but this novel is no romantic landscape.In the bogs of west-central Ireland, a policeman cycles about pretending to do his duty while his wife takes care of the children and waits to find out whether she has a terminal disease. Told in a powerful voice largely from within her consciousness, the narrative style shows amazing assurance for a then emerging writer. The last scene from her point-of-view ranks in my estimation with Joyce's closing of \\"The Dead.\\"I heard McG introduced at a reading as the greatest Irish author from the second half of the 20th (and 21st?) century. This is no hyperbole. While his reticence means he is not the showman that Seamus Heaney is, and while his oblique commentary acknowledges the trauma of the past Irish century rather than exploiting it like many of his lesser contemporaries, McG's dignity in the face of 1960s censorship (for subsequent work) commands respect and a renewal of interest in his entire body of work. Read this story and you'll find the ebb of rural Ireland charted precisely."},{"Title":"The Barracks","review":"The late John McGahern wrote incredibly poetic and beautiful novels set in his native country. The Barracks is about a middle-aged woman named Elizabeth Reegan who marries a widowed man with three children. A frustrated police officer with dreams of buying his own farm, and fulfilling the legacy of the Reegans, her husband is a man all but oblivious to Elizabeth and her needs. Already a widower, when he learns Elizabeth has breast cancer he can hardly bring himself to face the reality. When his first wife died his only thought was what a horror it was seeing her in the morgue. Any feelings of love or support are simply beyond him, leaving Elizabeth to deal with mortality on her own.As she worsens, declining into death, Elizabeth is able to observe the family as an outsider. Already all but a ghost, she watches them go about their daily tasks while inside she's screaming with frustration, hoping for any bit of attention or kindness she doesn't dare ask for.The Barracks is a heartbreaking novel, and a masterful one. McGahern gets inside the head of Elizabeth, expressing her plight with such empathy it's staggering. The prose is poetic and lyrical. I would even say it's flawless, and as perfect a work of fiction as I've ever read.What a loss to literature, and to humanity, when McGahern died earlier this year, leaving behind him an award-winning body of fiction. There simply aren't enough contemporary writers out there like McGahern, more's the pity, but that's what made him stand out like a shining light while he was alive. Better to have written like an angel and then been lost than never to have written like an angel at all."},{"Title":"Heathen","review":"I'm a big fan of Shaun Hutson and this is one of his best books. Kept me going till the last page in two days. Books sure can be more effective than watching a horror movie."},{"Title":"Heathen","review":"Heathen is a perfect example of what a Shaun Hutson book is about, although the storyline leaves much to be desired, as usual, he is a master of description, and can describe a &quot;feel&quot; or an &quot;atmosphere&quot; better than any author I have read and can convert his words into such a clear mental picture that you feel compelled to keep reading page after page. You will see what I mean as the heroine, Donna, attempts to solve the mystery of the husbands demise. Hutson's books are uncompromising and will go to all lengths to surprise you.This book is well worth reading and I am certain that all readers of the horror genre will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Framed in Cornwall","review":"Late Janie Bolitho belonged to a esteemed group of British mystery writers, who through years produced solid and enjoyable books. Her efforts didn't earn awards or the recomendations of snobby critics. What they managed to do, time after time, is to give pleasure to numerous readers. Her series, set in picturesque Cornwall is full of delightful descriptions and colorful characters. This novel is an unashamed cozy with an oldfashioned feel. The, far too early dead author and the books that people don't write anymore. More is the pity."},{"Title":"Framed in Cornwall","review":"These little books by Janie Bolitho are not going to win awards, but she paints a portrait of a likeable, middle-aged lady who is also quite an interesting character in the context of these stories. I think I like her because her choice of subject is usually counter to the usual mystery fodder and also because her characterization of the Cornish locals in her stories is so lovingly drawn. These won't keep you awake at night, rethinking the story line and wondering \\"who\\", but you also won't look back at these as anything less than the good use of an afternoon or two."},{"Title":"The New Gay Teenager (Adolescent Lives)","review":"As a therapist working with high-risk teens for several decades, I've been puzzled by how few gay teens I've seen. And in my routine questioning of teens about all aspects of their lives, I've had few responses to questions about sexuality, other than, \\"straight\\". I've rather thought that, perhaps, this might be accounted for by gay-les-bi teens seeking help within a \\"gay-les-bi\\" agency, combined with Colorado Springs' reputation for homophobia. But most teens with whom I speak over a longer time mention friends who are gay-les-bi (though not trans) -- and this has been true for about ten years. But given what I've read, and still read, in \\"research\\" and the news, about \\"high suicide rates\\" and extreme bullying -- all of which I took to be the norm -- I stayed a bit puzzled as to why I wasn't seeing gay-les-bi teens.\\"The New Gay Teenager\\", especially in combination with Savin-Williams' earlier book,...And Then I Became Gay: Young Men's Stories, gave me a better \\"norm\\" of what was happening developmentally with gay-les-bi teens, and equally important, with all my young clients regardless of their sexual fantasies, attractions, behaviors and identities. This stands the developmental history I was taught on its head, and not just in terms of sex & sexuality. Savin-Williams and the research he cites presents all development, not just gay-les-bi-trans sexual development, in what I suspect is becoming a more contemporary and realistic light. The emphasis isn't on fitting kids into categories, sexual or developmental, but what Savin-Williams calls differential developmental trajectories. That cumbersome term means that sexual categories, and any \\"standard\\" developmental categories, are becoming more & more irrelevant in the face of individual exploration and discovery. Teens, of course, both want to fit in and want to stand out -- a difficult balance at an awkward, ever-changing, often-confusing and increasingly plural developmental stage in an awkward, ever-changing, often-confusing and increasingly plural society, culture and world. Savin-Williams gives us a research-based look at one developmental aspect and one group that isn't so clearly a group anymore, at least in terms of self-identity. OK, that was confusing, but perhaps discussing some of the book's findings will clarify this as well as show, at least in part, its implications for why, I believe, this book is helpful for more than just gay-les-bi teens.\\"The New Gay Teenager\\" is filled with what, in 2007, was the most-recent research, along with thoughtful caveats on the limitations of that research. Savin-Williams' correctives include:1. Teens, including gay-les-bi teens, are more like each other, both in their similarities AND in their diversities, their individualities, than they are \\"like\\" a single sexual category. Certainly this fits in the seeming, not reluctance but disinterest current teens have in identifying themselves by their sexual fantasies, attractions and behaviors. Said another say, gay-les-bi teens don't think of themselves, primiarly in those categories, and increasingly, it appears, they're more like other teens than \\"like\\" themselves as a separate group. As Savin-Williams writes, \\"The fact is, the lives of most same-sex-attracted teenagers are not exceptional either in their pathology or their resiliency. Rather, they are ordinary. Gay adolescents have the same developmental concerns, assets, and liabilities as heterosexual adolescents. This unnoteworthy banality might well be their greatest asset.\\" This leads to a different kind of research needed, one more geared to diversity and individuality than to similarity and \\"always-shared\\" developmental milestones. This leads to a reserach based less on \\"standard questions\\" than on listening carefully and at-legnth to individual stories and their particular meanings.2. Teens today have a different take on sexual fantasies, attractions, behaviors and identities, both among themselves and between themselves. Again, Savin-Williams writes, \\"Sexual diversity is becoming normalized, and the gay-straight divide is becoming blurred. Straight teens are acting, looking, and becoming gayish, and an expansive array of nonstraight teens is becoming visible. These young people are more apt to say things like \\"Why won't my parents let me go to the concert?\\" and \\"If I take chemistry, how will that affect my grade point average?\\" than \\"I'm gay, I'm gay, oh my, what am I going to do?\\"3. Not only do we see a diveristy within \\"sexual minority\\" teens and an approach to sexuality among teens overall that is rapidly evolving, research on teen sexuality is terribly flawed, including (to me suprisingly) that many teens reject any sexuality labels and, especially, that we lack sexual developmental research with \\"straight teens\\". Sexually, we're not really sure what is \\"normal\\" for US teens, gay-les-bi or straight, now or even in the past.This is not to say that Savin-Williams turns a blind eye toward the viciousness which at least some gay-les-bi teens face and its serious consequences: \\"Nothing I have stated in this book justifies neglect of gay young people who suffer and entertain thoughts of suicide because of their sexuality. I am willing to believe that this reality might have been more characteristic of earlier generations than it is today. But whatever motivation might prompt us to sensationalize the fate of gay teens or represent them as heroic survivors, it's not scientifically valid now,and it was not scientifically valid in years past.\\"As a personal note about someone who came of age in the 1950s & 1960s in small-town, rural midwestern America: I didn't hear the word \\"gay\\" until well into college. Our community then, looking back on it, made lables far more characteristic of an earlier period, one more based on gender norms. (Savin-Williams, who was born a year before me, discusses gender norms in this book, and the part they play now.) In other words, there were \\"regular boys\\" and boys (and men) who were seen as \\"effeminate\\". I don't recall them being much teased (though I may have missed that), but they certainly had a place in our community, including in our churches. No one doubted \\"they were born that way\\", in that effeminate men in their later years, generally unmarried, were known, by those in our fairly stable community, to have \\"always been that way\\". And they were accepted, part of community life, generally, not set apart. While we didn't know or inquire into their sexual lives, we didn't know or inquire into anyone's sexual lives. That just wasn't our business.This meant, as a therapist, when I found myself asked to counsel gay-les-bi individuals because other therapists weren't comfortable with sexual issues and I, as someone who had treated families with incest, I didn't know where or how to start. As a good University of Chicago grad, I checked out the research in three areas: psychology (and there wasn't much of use then), history (and there was only a bit, but a VERY challenging bit), and anthropology. What I read left me really wondering about our supposedly \\"scientific\\" and \\"universal\\" sexual categories. It was clear that, in general, sexual behaviors and attractions appeared in \\"straight\\" and in \\"gay-les-bi\\" forms. But how this worked itself out, within cultures and individuals, was enormously diverse, and certainly it generally didn't fit well into categories of mid-20th c. Western scientific sexual identities. This, plus my background, led me to be cautious and to listen to what the person in front of me was saying about himself/herself and his/her world. Which turns out, evidently, to have been the right approach.(For books that helped me absorb this diversity, via history and anthropology, see, for example,The Construction of Homosexuality,Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century, and more recently,Homosexualities (Worlds of Desire: The Chicago Series on Sexuality, Gender, and Culture). Note the preponderance of UofC Press. *grins*)So for those working with teens, not just gay-les-bi teens, and especially for those who, like me, came of age well before our 21st century, I heartily recommend Ritch Savin-Williams' book.A note: I bought the Kindle edition. It was on only so-so experience, as I like to highlight a lot in my professional reading. This created drastic slow-downs toward the end of the book, adding maybe a third to the time that I'd have normally taken to read the book. Supposedly, reading threads on amazon say that there are ways around it. I tried to ask on the threads, and to figure this out on my own. I heard nothing from the threads; I was completely unable to work around this. If you don't highlight much, I doubt this would be a problem."},{"Title":"The New Gay Teenager (Adolescent Lives)","review":"This product arrived on time and in great condition.

The authors here are probably most well known for their Red Sonja series. This story was very predictable and the ending was one large cop-out. Like a lot of fantasy i try to read: bland. And what makes it even worse is that halfway through the novel the spelling mistakes increase until there's almost one per page! Sometimes even multiple misspellings of the same proper noun on the same page!I would recommend this novel only for completists. But please! Put the PB in it's plastic sleeve and put it on your shelf. Look at. Don't read it. Instead, read the Howard originals."},{"Title":"For the Witch of the Mists","review":"This is rubbish.

A gladiator. There he meets a Roman witch, and a wealthy shrewd gladiator runner who sees potential, yada yada.Often a minor character in his own book, there are a lot of Romans running around you couldn't give a shagging stola about.To top it off, the proofreading is rubbish, too."},{"Title":"The Celtic Empire: The First Millennium of Celtic History, C. 1000 BC-51 Ad","review":"I'm really enjoying this book. I think the history research was very well done and presented. Not to mention the time period pre roman occupation, I look forward to read it again."},{"Title":"The Celtic Empire: The First Millennium of Celtic History, C. 1000 BC-51 Ad","review":"Peter Berresford Ellis' work on the \\"Celtic Empire\\" is an interesting, well-researched, and compelling read. His deep knowledge contemporary archaeological lore, modern Celtic scholarship, and the original Greek and Roman sources, makes this work a reliable and trustworthy account of a nation often clouded by the mist of Mythology and obscured by the stigma barbarity. Ellis begins his study of the Celtic peoples during the Bronze Age at approximately 1000 BC and concludes it at the conquest of Britain under the regiments of the emperor Claudius in AD 51. Also, the epilogue covers some fascinating theories propounded concerning Celtic relations with the American Indians around 800 BC, and also about possible ties of kinship with the Etruscans - Ellis discounts these theories, but they are worth checking out nevertheless. In general, the history focuses on the Celts struggle for freedom and identity against the pressure of an expanding Roman Empire. So, what will be found here is a very good, in-depth overview of Roman and Celtic military history. Little will be found here on Celtic law, philosophy, religion, and art, although it does contain much useful information on the Celt's language, achievements and contributions to Greco-Roman civilization and culture from Asia Minor to Ireland. The only flaw to this history is Ellis' obvious contempt for anything Roman, branding them as ambitious, greedy, and cruel; this estimate of the Roman's may to a certain extent be justified, however, Ellis' over-emphasis grows a bit bothersome early in the work. Apparently, to Ellis, anything that was good in Roman culture was inherited from the Celts. Overall, an eager reader will find a peaceful medium between the impressions left from the original Greco-Roman sources and Ellis' Celtic bias. This work should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Celtic Empire: The First Millennium of Celtic History, C. 1000 BC-51 Ad","review":"Having first read this book in 1991 I may have forgotten parts of the story but what I haven't forgotten was that it was an excellent story. The author has presented a rich account of the first millennium of Celtic history (1000BC - 51AD). This may not be a highly detailed history but its a good story and covers all the major points of history that you would want to know about the people we call the Celts.It covers all aspects of their life and their role in the ancient world. Its a good book, well presented and researched and it's a joy to read. The text just flows along taking you on a journey back in time to when the Celts were the most feared and respected people in the land. Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Billy","review":"I was in high school when I came across this book, just browsing through a NYC public library when I picked it up, out of coincidence. Bottom line - reading this book was an emotionally harrowing experience for me. It is a vivid account of a twelve year old boy who is adbucted from what is supposed to be the safest place in the world - his own bed, a couple doors down from his parents' bedroom. From there, the story takes the reader through a horrendous ordeal of the aftermath of this abduction and what happens to the child. Whitley Strieber tells this tale from multiple points of view. You get the boy, who is living through the worst, most traumatizing nightmare of his life. There's also the mother, experiencing the agony and pain of her only son - missing, possibly even dead, a mother who's only wish is to have him at her side. Then, there's Barton Royal, the darkest character to ever cross the world of fiction, a diabolical child murderer who has an attraction for young boys, someone who wants to make his perverse dreams a reality when he abducts young Billy. This book is not only a tale of suspense. It is a tale that puts things in a frightening real - life perspective. It is a sign that we must truly be aware of children's surroundings. We must make sure that what happened in this book will remain fictional, that it will never, ever become a real - life story. Billy, the book, was engaging from word one. It's a powerful tale with clear prose, a tale that makes the agony, the fear, and the monstrous perversion feel real. That's how powerful the book is. It will truly move anyone who reads it. I recommend it with the highest praise."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"A serial predator (obviously based on real life clown/serial killer John Wayne Gacy) breaks into little Billy's room in the dead of night and abducts him. The queasy similiarities to several recent child abductions makes rereading this book even more disturbing. Every parent's worst nightmare is played out here without a single pulled punch and the result is one of the most disturbing 'horror' novels in recent memory. Recommended for the strong of heart."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"Barton Royal, a clown in an L.A. bookstore, is obsessed with young boys. He wants to be their father, he even fantasizes how much they will love being together. In an arcade, he spots Billy Neary with a group of friends. Unfortunately, Billy doesn't pay too much attention, even when Barton offers him more money for the games. He finds out where Billy lives and abducts him. It's a disturbing book because it can happen and I'm sure that it does. For any suspense/thriller fans, this book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"I was not AMAZED by the book but it was an overall good book. Billy was a very smart child. He tried his best to manipulate Barton. Although it took a lot out of him he was very brave in this story. The only problem I had was the last 60 pages or so. The story just got weird. Then at the very last chapter Billy wanted to go somewhere (I don't want to give anything away) and I just thought as a parent that was a little to weird. Overall a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"Streiber is a very clever and well-polished writer, and I have enjoyed his horror novels for a long time. Billy was one of his books that I never got around to reading at the time of publication.Unlike his other work, the horror does not have a supernatural theme. The plot has more in common with a mystery or thriller, but Streiber's natural feel for the horror genre lifts Barton from a criminal to a monster.The book is surprisingly realistic at times, almost to the point of sacrificing pace. I found the material compelling, but somehow not as well structured as some of Streiber's other books.Three and a half stars. Be aware, the book is very violent and deals with an extremely disturbing theme. It is not suitable for younger readers."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"This may well be the most chilling and disturbing book you ever did read. It is a masterpiece from the first to the very last page. Horrific because it does not use ghost and goblins, but people having to deal with events that are so close to reality you just can't be dissapointed.One of my favourite books, not for the faint-hearted a must for horror lovers."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"I was in high school when I read this book. It was a surprise pick I made at a public library in NYC, just through browsing and reading book jackets. Bottom line, when I read this book, I was emotionally gripped by this grim tale of a 12 year old boy who was kidnapped by a monstrous, homicidal pedophile in what was supposed to be the safest place in the world - in his own bed, a couple doors down from his parents' bedroom. This story goes on to describe this child's horrendous ordeal through several points of view. Here you get to see the child living his darkest, most traumatizing fears. You also see the agony and pain of a mother who yearns to have her only son returned to her side. Finally, you are introduced to the darkest side of humanity ever to come across the world of fiction, a child murderer who goes by the name of Barton Royal. This tale is so VIVID that it all feels real - the pain, the fear, the monstrous perversion. A must - read, especially for parents. This is not just a tale of suspense. It is also a tale that shows that children are not 100% safe, that we must truly be careful of their surroundings and that we must watch out for them so that the tragic events that happened in this book never, ever become reality. I give the author the highest praise. The writing is clear and to say that the story is very engaging is an understatement. It was good from the first word on. I agonized right along with the main character, Billy. That's how real and powerful this story is. To whoever reads this - mark my words, this book will truly move you. That's how vivid and powerful the story is. The best read of a lifetime - and that is NOT an overstatement."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"Like another person who reviewed this book, I also picked it up by accident in a bookstore when I was a teenager. There was really no reason why I should have picked it up. The unassuming cover (I have the hardcover) didn't grab me, the title was quite basic and I had never heard of the author. Perhaps it was Whitley Streiber's lack of detail that grabbed me. Whatever it was, once I picked it up, the book soon became a part of who I was.I have a bachelor's degree in English Literature, and yet throughout my years of study of all the \\"masters\\" in the art, at the end of the day I count \\"Billy\\" as my favorite of them all.As a writer, Strieber does a magnificent job of detailing the innocuous with poetic precision. I can relate to the way in which when great tragedy comes, it's the unrelated details that seem to stand out. \\"What oft was thought but ne're so well expressed,\\" would be the best way of describing it.The story itself is more gripping than almost any movie I've ever seen. The only other book that gave me a similar feeling of traction was Stephen King's \\"Misery,\\" but King's book is much more verbose (and not necessarily for the better, as not much of it contributed to the story but worked more as a vehicle for his own thoughts on the process of writing). The rubber hits the road on page one and keeps on going until the back cover.This book is violent, unsettling and touches my dark side in a way no other book has been able to. If you have seen the movie \\"The Dark Knight,\\" you might agree with me that the Joker's performace was the best part in the movie and when he was offscreen you were waiting anxiously for the next time you could join his world. In the same way, Strieber's portrayal of Barton \\"Fat\\" Royal is so fascinating, well thought out and articulated that it makes Billy's sections look flat in comparison. Ultimately both interpretations compliment each other (alongside the family's). These characters are fleshed out so fleshed out you feel as if they could be real people somewhere.Out of print, but not out of my heart, \\"Billy\\" will continue to be a book that I look forward to reading as I grow older in order to compare my personal interpretations of Strieber's world.A must read."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"This is a great book. I wish it was offered in Kindle as all my books are in my reader. This book is worth keeping even though it is a paperback. It is very graphic is some places. It gives you the view from many different angles, from the boy who is kidnapped, the parents, and the kidnapper. I have read this book many times. I lost my previous copy in a move and just had to buy it again. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"More than just the story of a child abduction, this disturbing novel takes an unsettlingly close look at the twisted mind of the abductor, a man who works as a clown in a bookstore in between crimes. Barton Royal is one of the most frightening and bizarre villians in the annals of fiction. Highly recommended for all but the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"When this book was recommended to me, the person used words like \\"horrifying,\\" \\"tragic\\" and \\"real.\\" Having now read it, I can think of only one word to describe it: boring.\\"Billy\\" is a tedious read. There's no doubt that its premise is horrible (there aren't many things worse than hurting an innocent child), but Strieber is incapable of giving it its due.Strieber fails at characterization and creating drama from an obviously dramatic set of circumstances. Instead of making us feel Billy's fear, Strieber gives us ridiculous situations where people act like humans never would. It starts right at the beginning. Billy (who shifts from extraordinary precociousness to childlike naivete throughout the book) wakes his father in the middle of the night to tell him that he sensed someone was hiding in their basement and then saw someone run from the house and hide beneath a tree. So what does his father do? Does he call the police? Does he go outside and check? Does he look at the storm door which is barely secured to see if anyone's opened it? No. He tells Billy not to worry about it and to go back to sleep. Later Billy is being driven by his kidnapper on the highway. Barton, the man who takes him, gets distracted and gets into a minor accident. When the man in the other car approaches their van, Billy begins to scream and shout and say he's being kidnapped. Does this person call the police? No. He does nothing.These false, completely unbelievable scenarios continue throughout the novel. At one point Billy escapes Barton's house, but somehow fails to notice that the car he flags down is being driven by Barton dressed as a woman (all he did was throw a wig and dress on). Even in the car, he still doesn't realize it's Barton. Is Strieber serious?Later still they find out who Barton is and know he's the man who took Billy. The local police tell Billy's family that they probably won't get much help from the police force in California (where Billy and Barton are) or receive much airtime from the news there. What planet are we on? If the police and media knew a man had kidnapped a child, they would do everything they could to find him, and his face would be on TV all day long.I usually read books like this because I want insight into the evil person. I can't comprehend hurting someone. It's just not my nature. So I want to know what makes these people tick. We know from former profilers like John Douglas that people simply do not wake up one day and become serial killers. There are key moments and events in their lives that set a path for their sickness. With Barton we get a man who was laughed at by his peers when he was a kid, sexually molested by his father and physically abused by his mother. I'm not saying this isn't a lethal cocktail that would scramble a person's mind, but it's so textbook it's almost cliche. I wanted to know more about Barton. He's completely disgusted by what he does, and by what his parents did to him, and yet he is just like them -- a sadistic and sexually perverted person.The worst part of the book is anything dealing with Billy's parents. The scenes of their grief -- waiting by the telephone hoping that Billy isn't dead -- is rendered so melodramatic by Strieber that it almost becomes comedy. It's staged like some overheated Tennessee Williams play. It's so easy to identify with their sense of loss and regret and yet Strieber bangs on these scenes like a gong, making them tiresome and ridiculous.Now that I've read this book I'm shocked by the glowing quotes by the likes of Peter Straub and Oliver Stone and the favorable reviews here.Simply having a gut-wrenching premise doesn't make a book good. You have to actually do something with it. Kidnapping and hurting a child is clearly a heinous crime and it's the type of thing that leaves you mystified by the cruelty that exists in some people. But Whitley Strieber isn't able to bring across any of that in what is a slim slog of a novel."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"More than just the story of a child abduction, this disturbing novel takes an unsettlingly close look at the twisted mind of the abductor, a man who works as a clown, entertaining small children in a bookstore between crimes.

As much as I loathed the Barton character, and felt sorry for Billy as his captive, I think as a parent myself it was the parents' anguish and their feeling of helplessness that really drives the story.

The great thing about the book is that we see 74 color plates of Chihuly's work. Chihuly is a genius who manages to create a fireworks display of color and light in glass. Unfortunately, Warmus doesn't know how to write. The book pretends to be unpretentious, but it is, in fact, simple-minded. For example, in the section Warmus calls &quot;The Merchant of Venetians,&quot; he writes: &quot;Chihuly is astonished by these wildly innovative and beautiful pieces from the 1920s and 1930s. Ever the savvy businessman, he knows that their rarity drives collectors to snap them up whenever they become available. He'd love to collect them, but knows they are too rare. How to do it? Eureka!

Perhaps for this reason the personalities of the major players are drawn vividly: characters like Balfour, Asquith, Joe Chamberlain who played a major part in the convoluted politics of the nineties and Edwardian era.It seems to me this was a period of incredibly complex change: the end of the mid-Victorian sobriety, the end of Britain as an agricultural nation, the end of the hegemony of devout Christianity, the frenzied pace of reform and the development of infrastructure, and the increasingly claustrophobic atmosphere of European politics as the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of German nationalism threatened the status quo.Ensor is very fair to everyone, perhaps with a slight liberal bias, but strong Tory characters like Disraeli come out well, though he's not a massive fan of Salisbury, whose diplomatic skills are perhaps underrated.Ensor's greatest strength though is his absolute mastery of the detail of parliamentary activity and legislative change, where his approach is encyclopaedic.I agree with the other reviewer (on Amazon.co.uk), Ensor is a pleasure to read, his attention to his material is unfailing."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I shopped around a long time and compared lots of beginner books before I finally bought &quot;Learn New Testament Greek&quot;. There are many excellent resources to choose from and I probably overlooked some as well. Regardless, I am happy with my choice and am enjoying this book immensely. Follows a simple format, reminiscent of the Teach Yourself series."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"If you're a Christian who wants to learn a little Greek, this would be the perfect book to use. It doesn't overwhelm the reader with rules and paradigms but gives brief, straightforward explanations followed by LOTS of exercises. Most of the exercises are in columns with the Greek on the left and the English on the right making it simple to cover the answer while you translate, then check your answer immediately. In later chapters, Greek quotes from the New Testament are used in the exercises.One of the problems with this book is that some of the exercises refer you to the Greek New Testament (GNT) which means you'll have to buy a GNT to complete those exercises. Also, some of the longer translations don't have an answer key.Finally, if you want to become a serious Greek student, you'd probably want something a little more thorough than this."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"As a beginner who is studying on my own ,I've found this to be great for practicing vocabulary in short sentences , instead of just rote memorization , which I find very boring . Also he uses made up sentences in the practice exercises which is good because you can remember scriptures after getting just a couple of words in the sentence , with made up sentences you actually have to translate it all . The only real drawback is Dobson does'nt really cover grammar , so I recomend a grammar such as Mounces Basics Of Biblical Greek In addition to this , for someone who's really trying to learn the language well . I wholeheartedly reccomend this to anyone studying on their own ."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Dobson's Learn New Testament Greek is a great introductory method for self-tuition. It is especially useful for the absolute novice who wants to be able to read the text of the New Testament without undue immersion in grammatical forms and paradigms.I used this book along with a Greek NT with a glossary, and a scholarly translation with good notes (Oxford Annotated Revised Standard Version) and within one month I was able to understand and translate more than I had previously thought possible.It is important to remember that Dobson's book is just an introduction. This book won't turn you into a NT scholar. In the end, you really do need to know the Koine grammar, and in the interests of keeping things fresh and interesting this book arguably sacrifices too much of this essential knowledge. Also, it could use more self-testing exercises. But as an accessible introduction for people who want to be able to approach the Gospels and other NT texts in the original without having first to wade through tables of declensions and conjugations, it is just the thing."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"John Dobson's 'Learn New Testament Greek' is, for me at least, the perfect way to get into the ancient Greek language. It requires only persistence and attentive reading, so it fits in well with my later-life schedule and personality. The other reviewers find some more faults with the method than I do, probably because I know less, and am not that worried about accents yet. But then again, as far as I can tell from looking at photos and facsimiles of old manuscripts, they had no accents! My only objection to Dobson's book here is his translation philosophy. He consistently and persistently recommends the very type of paraphrased, approximate and (to me) dubious translation practice that has driven me to get the hang of Greek and Hebrew to begin with! I don't see the point of totally obscuring the oddities and richness inherent in ancient language usage just for the sake of smooth, denatured English."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Other reviewers have commented that this book is slightly lacking in some more technical points (eg. accents) and long lists of paradigms. This is true, but I found it very helpful for what I wanted to learn: I wanted to be able, while studying a difficult Bible verse, to be able to look at the Greek and (with the aid of a lexicon and grammar) gain some useful extra information about it.I don't think I'm every going to be able to pick up a Greek NT and read it fluently, at least not using this book, but it's given me a very good feel for the way Greek works. The fact that it has you reading actual Bible passages from very early one helps a lot with this. Also, a very clear discussion of the relation between grammatical form of verbs and meaning (eg. aorist) is helpful in understanding the sphere of meaning a Greek word might have.One thing it's majorly lacking is a lexicon (its \\"index of Greek words\\" is tiresome), so you'll need to buy a separate one. But, I'd say this is a very good introduction to how NT Greek works which will either provide motivation to more formal study or be useful on its own."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"'Learn New Testament Greek' is a great and easy way to learn to read the Greek New Testament, and it allows you to go at your own pace. The lessons are easy to handle, and the audio CD helps with pronunciation. I highly recommend this book; it is well-worth it. I cannot say enough how great this book is.Also, there are tests at the end of most of the lessons in which you are able to see whether or not you've learned the material from that lesson. They are helpful in letting you know how you are doing in the course."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Simply one of the best. Put in a steady 20-30 minutes a day, and watch how quickly your NT Greek starts to improve. No use buying the book and just sitting it down. Repetition is the key, with this or any other book on a foreign language.Contains good explanations, good, clear, examples, and helpful exercises, giving enough repetition to instill the basic principles. A good start for anyone who wants to get a solid foundation in Koine Greek."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I am currently about halfway through this book and am looking forward each day to every new lesson.While trying to learn Greek, I originally tried Mounce's method, which is famed to be one of the most established in academia. It was not bad, however after a few lessons, the abundance of grammatical explanations every time a new concept was introduced had left me extremely confused, and the \\"learn-by-heart-all-these-forms-before-starting-the-next-lesson\\" aspect was rather frustrating. While I agree that grammar is important, I also believe that its study should be left aside until one has developed a certain feeling for the language.I stumbled quite accidentally on this method. It is neither a well-known nor well-established method like Mounce's, and I could not find much feedback on the Internet. I bought it out of curiosity and because the price was about half that of most method books. I was pleasantly surprised.The lessons are very short: I usually go though one in about 20-30 minutes. Rather than go through long grammatical explanations, or presenting long lists of declinations and conjugations to learn by heart, in this method, each lesson starts with a few sample sentences to introduce a new concept, a short grammatical explanation, a few words of vocabulary, and then many (as in A LOT OF) translations/reading exercises to help assimilate the new material. After only a few lessons, I found myself reading naturally long passages in Greek from the Gospel, and was amazed that I could actually understand a good portion of it without having to think to much about the grammar. This method avoids an error all too common in many language methods: material that has already been taught is constantly being reintroduced in following lessons, which greatly helps with assimilating.I found this method to be extremely gradual. Rather that introducing, lets say, the whole conjugation paradigm of the present active indicative in a single lecture, or whole tables of declension and expect the student to learn it by heart, it is done over the span of a few lectures. I found this to be a most painless way to learn the high flexibility of the Greek language without having to rely on by-heart and mindless recitation of tables.I did find a few quirks however :- the author often asks to read various passages from the Greek Gospel but does not provide the text. You will therefore need to have at your disposal a copy of the Greek New Testament. It shouldn't be much of a problem though : it can easily be found for free and legally on the Internet.- sometimes, a few words appear here and there BEFORE they \\"officially\\" appear in a vocabulary list, which can sometimes be a bit confusing.- when presenting lists (declensions, conjugations, vocabulary, etc.) there are sometimes some alignment problems which can be a little unaesthetic.Note that this method only provides little grammatical explanations. The idea is that that through many examples and short exercises, you will come to naturally assimilate the language without having to think too much about the grammar. While this approach worked wonders on myself, it might not be the best method for everybody."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This book is good in that there are plenty of opportunties to do translation on short sentences. This way, we get the vocabulary and the grammatical ideas into our heads better than just try to memorising a lot of paradigms. I try doing the same translation exercises in the book in two ways: Greek to English and then English back to Greek. I am using this book as a supplement to other Greek grammar textbooks. The author's information on how the Hebrew language influenced the Greek we see in the New Testament is very valuable."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This book is not for scholars - it's not for people who plan on teaching NT Greek ('koine') or pursuing it at a post-graduate level. It really is just an introduction to give you some confidence and familiarity with the original text of the NT so that you can critically evaluate commentaries (and other scholarly texts that argue from 'the Greek'), be more informed when it comes to translations (and be able to do some translating yourself) and, of course, to have some basic empowerment to interpret and understand the text of the NT for yourself.It will not prepare you to be on a translation committee or to write your own commentary from the Greek. It's goals are more modest, and it is perfectly suited to people doing just a few subjects in NT Greek and exegesis. Once you properly understand *who* Dobson is aiming at and *what* he's trying to teach them, it all makes sense. Accents are useless for his target audience! (I have a major in Classical Greek and let me tell you, I ignored accents for the entire 3 years!) Having chapters of what noun form is taken by each participle is equally useless.What \\"we\\" (the target audience) want is to know how to dive into the Greek text that is there and make some sense of it. Quite simply, Dobson has provided the most incredibly useful, clear, empowering, inspiring and, yes, *comprehensive* text that gives its target audience what they *want* (and giving them anything else would just be a waste anyway). This is the book that frustrates classical scholars and delights seminary students who have no intention of lecturing in ancient Greek... ever! If you're in the latter category, this book's for you."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I've been using this book to teach my 13 year old daughter Ancient Greek. It's a great book with plenty of translations to do, good presentation of verb and noun forms, and an easy flow from chapter to chapter. We usually take 2 days to get through a chapter and spend four days a week for 45 minutes to an hour each day.I'm stunned at how quick she is learning. She gets frustrated now and then, but that's part of learning any new language. The book's pace makes it much easier to learn (and teach) than the other books I investigated. The concentration is more on the form, syntax and grammer of Greek rather than trying to build a huge vocabulary early on -- as Mounce does.The CD has spoken recordings by the author and his colleague of all the Greek sentences and paragraphs in the book. This is important for self study as most people who learn Greek by themselves or in an informal environment don't pronounce it very well. The author has some very good notes on alternate translations of Greek and the NT so the student can better see how others have put the Greek into English.I wish I'd had this book in college when I studied Greek so many years ago. This does bring up the point that the experience of teaching with the book may be easier for me than for others since I already had some background with the language. For a novice parent or teacher who wants to lead a Greek class, I would suggest that he or she learn the material to a point of at least three chapters ahead of the lesson being learned by the class. The author has some very good advice in an appendix on teaching Greek.You won't be a Greek scholar at the end of studying this book, but you will know at least as much as a college student does after a year's coursework. You will be in a position to buy a Greek/English dictionary, a Greek New Testament, some Plato, Herodotus and Xenophon (see A Greek Reader For Schools here on amazon) and start learning more by just reading.I plan to teach a Greek class at a home school co-op group next year using this book."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This is an easy to use textbook which makes learning New Testament Greek so much easier.

As someone who has learned other inflected languages in the old style, and then had to sink or swim in the country concerned, I would say it is wrong to dismiss inductive language learning as a 'children's approach'. It works for all ages, and in the end is the only serious way to fluency. Languages aren't like multiplication tables.

He doesn't identify tenses or indicate that different verb conjugations and noun declensions work differently. Exactly who does he think will be scared off by using correct terminology? How many semi-literates are interested in studying Greek? As Greek is a highly inflected language, the absence of proper identification for speech parts and verb forms leaves the student just memorizing dozens of different words without the grammatical structure in which to place and understand them.This book doesn't work well at all by itself."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Really well done.

Now I guess I'll buy the book and tell you more later."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Let me state up front: I am extremely skeptical that one can adequately learn Biblical Greek inductively. With that caveat, this is the best inductive grammar that I have ever seen.For those who have used previous editions of Dobson's grammar, the third edition offers significant improvements. Some of the noteworthy features include:1. The book is unusually well printed and a delight to read. If you have ever tried to read books created with inadequate Greek or Hebrew fonts, you will appreciate how important a feature this is - particularly in a grammar for beginners.2. The book is essentially error free. This is one of the benefits of a third edition, but it is a meaningful benefit. There are few things more frustrating to a new student than trying to figure out why he or she is wrong when it is the text that is in error.3. Dobson does a superb job of selecting exercises throughout the work. He keeps introducing minor variations so that students don't become lazy knowing what the answer \\"should be\\" in this section. This ringing of changes is the genious of inductive language study, and Dobson is a master in this art.4. Dobson has added simple, brief, grammatical explanations throughout the book that will help students relate what they are learning to traditional deductive grammars.My concerns:1. In trying to create excitement about learning Biblical Greek, Dobson implies that the student is becoming more competent than anyone could become through one year of language study. Would you hire someone with only 1 year of German to teach German literature at a University? Of course not! But I fear that students reading only this work could wrongly think that they are ready to criticise the scholars who do the incredibly demanding work of creating quality Bible translations. Mastering Greek is worth the effort - but we should not underestimate the amount of effort and discipline required.2. To gain an adequate facility with Greek, a student will need to move on to \\"second year\\" grammars such as Dana and Mantey or Wallace's \\"Biblical Greek Beyond the Basics\\". If the student hasn't worked through a deductive grammar, it will be almost impossible for him or her to grapple with these more advanced works which are necessary for sound exegesis.So how can I give this book 5 stars?1. It is the best inductive grammar you can find and just plain fun to read.2. Dobson's superb selection of material makes this grammar one of the best \\"readers\\" available for New Testament Greek. Most students (myself included), need a great deal of practice to achieve proficiency in the language. This book goes a long way toward providing that practice.My advice: Work through a traditional grammar such as David Alan Black's \\"Learn to Read New Testament Greek\\" or Mounce's \\"The Basics of Biblical Greek\\". When you are done, turn to Dobson for some delightful practice and continued learning."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Some people love it, some people don't. So you can decide for yourself, let me tell you how the book is set up:BACKGROUNDGreek is 'inflected' -- depending on their meaning in a sentence, nouns have several forms. The word is 'o logos'. But if you're saying it, the word is 'ton logon.' And if it's Mark's, the word is 'tou logou'. And if you're convincing someone with the word, it's ... well, you get the idea.The word(s) = o logo, ton logon, tou logou, oi logoi, tous logous, tw logw, etc.So having a \\"vocabulary\\" of Greek words isn't particularly helpful until you get the endings in your brain and tou logou makes you think \\"[of] the word\\" more or less automatically, without you really thinking about it.How hard is it to learn the endings? Plenty. For nouns there are three genders, five cases, single, plural, double, all done in three versions = declensions. 230 endings, all nicely tabularized in my old Greek textbook (not this one). Verbs have tenses, moods and voices.So all you have to do to read a sentence in Greek is figure out each word's root, identify each ending, match it with the table in your head [nominative, dative, accusative, genitive, dative, or vocative; singular or plural; masculine, feminine or neuter] ... and translate the grammar into English -- quick, you do know the English equivalent of the dative plural of 'book', right? And what's the English aorist subjunctive active form of 'go'? -- and viola, you're on to the next word.Did I mention \\"the\\"? My old text lists 30 !! versions. Thirty ways to say \\"the\\": o, tou, ton, to, ta, tw, tous, oi, etc. etc.METHODS#1 TRADITIONAL Greek textbooks list tables of noun endings = \\"declensions.\\" You memorize tables of endings and this helps you read Greek -- the same way, presumably, memorizing the interval of a diminished-minor-7th helps you play Bach on the piano.If memorizing 230 noun case endings and transmogrifying accusative-ablative-optative-nickelodeons into English is the sort of thing you're good at, traditional Greek textbooks are for you.#2. THIS BOOK uses THE OTHER METHOD. It teaches you Greek a little bit at a time, by having you practice short grammar-rich sentences. You're learning Greek not by memorizing case ending tables, but by getting your brain to recognize, without stopping to think about it, that ~ou words mean \\"of ~\\". This is the way you learned English. You speaks English good, right?Each section (just three or four pages) introduces a new topic -- little drills on how to say 'the book' or 'the books' for eg. Then there are practice sentences and their translations -- you cover the translation with a card, read the greek, translate it yourself, then move the card and check your translation.\\"You are saying.\\" \\" We are saying.\\" \\" They are saying.\\" \\" You speak the words.\\" -- they get tougher as you go along -- \\"You are writing the words and the prophet is reading the words.\\" \\" They are the people saying these words.\\"There are 30 or 50 little drills per section. They don't repeat, they build. The sentences are never beyond the level you're at; they do a great job forcing you to grapple with the subtleties of the grammar. It's hard but not too hard, and a getting each translation right is fun and encouraging. Each week, the stuff you struggled with last week seems easy.Will you be nuancing Paul in a month? No. You're a beginner. This is difficult stuff.Will you build a huge list-thingy-of-words-that-you-know? No. This book stuffs grammar in your brain; plenty vocabulary too, but vocabulary isn't really what it's about.Will you learn all there is to know about Greek? No. But you will learn plenty; the later chapters are extremely complex.Will you learn a whole bunch, quickly and easily? Yup, you will. And you'll have fun doing it.---My own preference is for method #2. This is one w o n d e r f u l little book. A treasure. A gem. A delight. A perfection between two covers. A smart buy. Order once; pay twice -- it'll be worth it.graphw logous alytheisI write true words"},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"For Christmas I asked for and received this book and the NT Greek grammar by Mounce at the same time, thinking that they would complement each other. So far, my expectation has been completely fulfilled!The good points of this book are:1. It provides lots of practice with reading Greek sentences. Lots of practice is the only way to become fluent in any language, and this book provides it. To me this is the book's primary good point (but see #4 below).2. As the other reviews say, it gets you into the language right away with few technical details3. It is highly inductive, meaning it doesn't go thru lists of paradigms and rules, but gets you right into reading the text.4. This book has the only really good explanation of preposition usage I've seen. They all - including Mounce - show the little boxes with arrows: eis, en, ex, hypo, etc. This is useful as far as it goes. But this book does something I've never seen: it gives multiple examples from the New Testament for each possible meaning of each preposition. For example, most books say \\"en\\" means \\"in, with, or by\\"; but this book gives you actual NT examples of \\"en\\" meaning each of these. Wonderful!The bad points are:1. It is highly inductive. I don't think this kind of learning style suits me as an adult at all. True, the deductive method is different from how we learned language as children. Proponents of inductive learning (such as Prof. Harris in his sometimes interesting alternative Latin grammar) always point this out and state without proof that everybody knows the inductive method is superior. And for children, they're probably right. However, we *were* children then. I think it a fairly well-established fact that children learn differently from adults: and the classical schooling model has been based on this fact for 25 centuries. As a result, based both on reason and my own experience, I don't believe that a purely inductive method is the proper framework for adults to learn in; but then I have not surveyed all adults nor performed a controlled experiment on them all. What I think I can say with certainty is that it's not the right framework for *ME* to learn in, and I doubt I'm alone.2. Going further than most NT grammars (even Mounce to some extent) that don't really explain accentuation rules, this book ignores accents altogether! (It doesn't even print them in the text.) I am still \\"coasting\\" on the accentuation rules I learned early and very thoroughly from Hansen and Quinn's Attic Greek book (H&Q; does at least one thing right), and I find they really do help. Without even accents printed in the text, I question whether you can get good consistent accent placement, making it much more difficult to talk to others or probably even to remember the words yourself. I naturally find myself using Latin-like accent rules, which is sometimes correct (i.e. present tense of many verbs) but usually goes horribly wrong for nouns and adjectives. Since I have Mounce's grammar also, everytime I find a new word in Dobson's book, I write in the accent. It's a good test for my own understanding, but it shouldn't be necessary.I believe these problems would make this book not work for me as a stand-alone way of learning Greek. But for somebody who is using another grammar such as Mounce and using this book as a side reading source that gives you lots of practice and another point of view, this book is very useful."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I tried several beginner's books on NT Greek before discovering this one, and I loved it. This is the one that made it all fun. After 5 years of study, I still enjoy thumbing through it.The accompanying tape is just OK, but good for gaining elementary oral fluency. I believe the pronuciation presented here is not generally considered correct but is still the pedagogical standard."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I've been teaching lay people (non-seminary setting) NT Greek for the last ten years and have tried four or five different first year grammars. John Dobson's Learn New Testament Greek has been unparalleled in its appeal and ease for getting into Greek. First of all, I really enjoyed working through the text myself! I've been reading the NT in Greek for nearly 30 years and have personally worked through just about everything out there. This grammar is fun! And it's translating well into the classroom setting. Normally by the sixth week of first year Greek, I've suffered a 30-40% attrition in class drop-outs because it was just too much. Not only have I not lost anyone in my current class of twelve, but we even picked up a few more after the first few weeks. Originally learning NT Greek in a very traditional manner with paradigms and cardboard sentences, I am loving the inductive approach and the sheer joy of hearing Greek that this course encourages. It's rejuvenated my own reading of the New Testament - I find I'm doing my readings aloud just for the fun of it and am experiencing the NT on a level that I didn't know existed. So, if you are new to Greek, give Dobson's book a try. If you've crashed and burned trying to learn Greek, perhaps several times - give Dobson a try. If you've been \\"buds\\" with Greek for a while - give yourself a refreshing Greek treat and work through this grammar...and then pass on the joy!"},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I studied the first edition of this book perhaps 10 years after I graduated from college, and I found the pedagogy was far superior to the language learning methods we had used in school.On the very first reading of this book you should be able to recognize some words. The method immerses you immediately into the language before you even have memorized the alphabet! It gives you a few letters and you are already reading sounds with just those letters. Then it reinforces what you have just learned through repetition and adds a little bit more. The immediate and continued rapid progress will keep the student interested and will help him to stick with it. For beginning students, this is the book to have."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This is the best language learning book I have ever used in my entire life, and I was a language major in College and I teach EFL for a living. This book is simply amazing, every single thing that can possibly be done right, is done right.Because it's much easier to understand a language (passively or receptively) than to produce it (in conversational situations, for instance), learning Koine to the level of being able to read the NT is actually not as difficult as you might think.After following Dobson's course of study, will you know Koine as well as a seminary student? No, but you will be able to read the NT on your own, provided you use an online concordance or a dictionary, plus a grammar book for the trickier parts.The best part of this book are the insights that Dobson succinctly makes on the biblical texts that are being used. Since Dobson knows both Koine and Hebrew, he is able to show exactly what the authors were doing when writing the NT. Not only is this spiritually empowering, it also provides a background context for remembering the information being given.In the new edition being sold on Amazon, there are accents. Also, there is an audio CD which complements the lessons nicely. This is the best value I seen in any product in quite a long time."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Please notice that the 3rd edition, the hardback (as of May, 2005), has accents. The 2nd edition has been very useful for me. I have made better progress with it than any other book I have used. But I wanted accents. I was ecstatic when I ran across a copy of the new edition and saw accent marks. I pretty much ignore them in writing, but I find them very helpful in reading. It makes it easier to remember the words when I am not making up the intonation each time I encounter them.I pretty much agree with the gist of the other reviews. An excellent book which may not quite work for some person's learning styles. But give it a try. You may be one of the many for whom this style is idea."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"Trying to learn greek on my own has meant years of frustration. Dobson's book has been the most user friendly way to learn that I have run across. Especially with the tape. It is still a great challenge to learn this language, but Dobson's method is very accessible."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I had known nothing about Greek before I picked up the book and started reading it, but within 30 mins, I had already memorized the alphabet, and was learning all kinds of words. The words you learn though are not in lists where you have to memorize them, he just puts them here and there in phrases and tells you what they mean. Within 3 days (30 mins a day) I was saying phrases and sentences, and within 15 days, I was reading paragraphs with ease. I've read many greek books, but this one tops them all with it's easy to learn style and it's fun way of learning. For learning Greek, Learn New Testament Greek was the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This book is great it gets write down to business your really reading the greek text in 10 days if you follow their lesson plans. the book is organized really well. There is a mini grammar in the back with paradigms, so you can read over them to aid in memorization. Great place to start. and then move on to something more meaty. But the real deal is your reading the greek text, thats what we all want right."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I have only been learning Greek a couple of years and I used Dobson as my introduction to the language. I have no complaints - I enjoyed the experience immensely, and I did not find the inductive learning method to be particularly inhibiting. It really helped me to dive into the GNT itself and learn all the more quickly by immersing myself in the koine text. After reading through the GNT six times and gaining a lot of comprehension proficiency, I am only now going to a deductive grammar (Hewitt) to sort out the structure, so to speak. I find that it is a lot easier to deal with the dryer approach now that I have a lot of familiarity with the GNT and a large vocabulary.My one quibble is that Dobson uses the book as a platform to preach dynamic equivalence at every possible moment. I am not a major proponent of formal equivalance, so I am not offended by the dynamic equivalence position in and of itself, but Dobson keeps ramming home the point that a good translation is not one that is literal, but one that gets the thought process across - almost to the point where he seems eager to indoctrinate the reader to his translation position, which to me should not be the point of this book. As someone else mentioned in their review, a 1st year Greek student is not in a position to critique translation anyway, so why not just teach us the language and hope we advance far enough to come to our own conclusions about formal vs dynamic when we are sufficiently educated years down the line?"},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I am trying to teach myself New Testament Greek and read the New Testament in Greek this calendar year. I bought another book that was more analytical -- you know verb conjugation, tense, case etc. This one had me reading \\"Dick and Jane\\" level sentences the first lesson! There is a thread of review with each new section. I am still thrilled and can't get enough of it."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This is a pretty easy book to study. It includes a CD that is a pleasure to listen to. After reading this book I was able to make my way through NT Greek text with the help of a short NT Greek-English dictionary such asA Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the Greek New Testament. This book makes good use of the passage found in John 1:1-2 (In the beginning there was the word...) as an example. I did feel, however, that the verb tenses could have been explained a little better. In particular I would have liked a better explanation of the Aorist verb tense. It is worth noting that \\"aorist\\" translated literally from Greek means \\"without horizon\\". The aorist tense is defined as expressing a completed or single action--as such it does not go on and on indefinitely and can therefore be thought of as \\"without horizon\\"."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"John Dobson, author of Learn Biblical Hebrew, continues his successful method of teaching foreign languages as he tackles the New Testament language: Greek. He applies the same methods and approaches that he used to convey the concepts of the Hebrew language to teach Greek.The instructions commence with the Greek alphabets and their corresponding English alphabets. Writing the alphabets is the next step. Even though no exercises are provided, Dobson shows the easiest ways to form the letter and guidelines on how to get the desired shape. Subsequently, pronunciation is introduced and this is accomplished partly through the use of the CD-ROM. The book has numerous examples of Greek sentences for reading practice so you can be sure that you understood the sound. Furthermore, the author does not include a lot of complicated rules but provides the needed information that is important in grasping the language. Students do not have to muddle through technicalities and formal rules as they learn to read Greek.In this book as well, he uses the Bible, specifically the New Testament, as his examples allowing the students who do not possess a Greek New Testament to get a feel for the language in the context of the Bible. After going through this book, I am looking forward to getting my first Greek New Testament. I have found deeper meaning to the English words of the Bible as I translated it to Greek. Many times the real meaning of the word is lost in translation and this book provides the tools needed to understand the actual language in which the Bible was written.The author also includes interesting tidbits of historical information throughout the pages of the book that offers students a glimpse of the origins of the language and how the Hebrew language influenced the New Testament writings. The appendix serves as a quick reference resource in an easy-to-access format. The fifty two lessons are grouped together according to similar chapters and each group has an introduction so that students have an overview of the topics that are going to be covered. The author also includes why Greek should be learned and the usefulness of knowing the original language of the Bible. This book is highly recommended for high school students, especially if they are being home schooled. It will not only spark a fire in them to learn the Word of God, but they will also learn an additional language. This book is a must-read and I would encourage all believers to own a personal copy!"},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This book helps make Biblical Greek easier to understand. Think of it as the Dick and Jane or Alice and Jerry of Greek textbooks. You start off reading right away. You reuse the same material a lot, which promotes mastery. It is much easier to understand if you are studying independently. It is a great supplement for Mounce, because it breaks the same basic material down and makes it easeir to understand.(The CD isn't really any help. It would be more helpful if they spoke in Greek paused and gave you time to translate. This would help prepare for tests. It speaks in English and then in Greek.)"},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"This textbook is perfect.

A good start but didn't offer comprehensive understanding of Koine Greek language structure. Dobson's books are more of a crash course then a Greek grammar and study guide.(It appears that this book was intended to be used with a cassette tape and in a classroom environment with a lexicon handy).The first 14 or so chapters helped me get started but w/o a vocabulary builder and knowledge of how Greek words are created I purchased \\"Basics of Biblical Greek\\". BBG book didn't jump ahead of my reading vocabulary but taught me how Greek is structured and from there I will get material to increase my Greek vocabulary.{{The 3rd ed of this book doesn't even use Greek letters}} - It does have GREEK letters but appears ENGLISH via LOOK INSIDE! - Apparently a bad OCR file and not PDF image.FYI every post here goes into all of Dobson's 'Learn NT Greek' editions.

Having studied Greek before, I was surprised to find that the Greek words in this text have no accent marks. This makes learning the language much harder because you cannot be sure you are pronouncing the words with the accents on the correct syllables. I would recommend that beginning students of Greek look elsewhere, and make sure whatever book you purchase contains accent marks so you can learn to pronounce the words properly as you study."},{"Title":"Learn New Testament Greek","review":"I would have preferred more modern/ethnic pronunciation, and it even seems that to an extent, the speakers are making the attempt, but it's a long ways off."},{"Title":"Knives Points of Interest Book 5","review":"Like the past Points of Interest books; this is another fine example that displays handmade cutlery to its best.

His suggestions are geared toward people who will be interviewing &quot;the common man&quot; and older people, so suggestions like &quot;put an ad in the local paper asking for interviewees&quot; and &quot;your subject may be hesitant to talk and/or think his experience doesn't have value&quot; are totally not helpful in regard to my project.Also, the guide is really geared towards archivists who will naturally consider their cassettes of interviews the most important source as opposed to the transcript, so little attention is given to the concerns of those editing oral history book projects. Little info is given regarding editing interviews down, narrative structure, how lengthy quotes should be and other concerns the first-time editor will undoubtedly have.Don't get me wrong, this is a good book. It is well-written, the illustrating examples are interesting and the appendix containing release forms is very helpful.

It's especially useful for oral historians and folklorists, but there are good, practical ideas that are useful for anyone who uses a recorder to document cultural traditions and local history. It's a good introductory manual, and it's also interesting to read to gain a better understanding of ways that Ives completed his fieldwork for his research for his books. This book is practical. The section that describes \\"what to do when it won't work\\" is especially useful. Although some material is dated, mainly because the manual doesn't discuss a lot of the newer digital technology, additional supplements about digital recording technology will fill out the gaps. But it's also worth remembering that many people continue to use tape recorders for fieldwork. Ives has a fine style of writing. The anecdotes and reminiscences reveal his great experience and expertise as an old pro, and they make the book an interesting read, especially for a \\"How-to\\" manual. An added plus to this book is that Ives produced a video called \\"The Oral Historian's Work\\" which demonstrates and reinforces a lot of the techniques that are presented in the text. Couple the book with the video, and a beginning fieldworker is well prepared for a foray into the field."},{"Title":"Bilal's Bread","review":"Breath of Fresh AirThis unassuming little story whispers a message more effectively than those books that choose to shout. Far away from the typical gay fare involving Hollywood dreams, turning tricks, and frequenting the gym, this is the gripping tale of timid, obedient 16-year-old Bilal Abu.An Iraqi-American living in the heartland, he lives an insulated life with his family. They struggle to get by, Bilal selling his mother's popular home-baked bread at local stores, and his older brothers Salim and Hakim holding down blue-collar jobs.Salim, at 26, has been the head of the family since their father's death in Iraq at the hands of Saddam Hussein's forces. But they don't find much sympathy in Kansas City, with suspicious eyes watching their brown skin and suspicious minds knowing only all Iraqis as the enemy--not understanding or caring to know the difference between a Kurd, a Sunni, and a Shiite.Bilal is of sexual service to Salim, who treats his abuse of Bilal as a secret cultural ritual. Bilal's feelings are unflinchingly honest. He struggles to understand his intuition that servicing his brother is wrong, while perceiving that there is something he deeply enjoys about a sexual relationship his domineering, muscular older brother. When Bilal meets a classmate, Muhammad, and learns of the beauty of sex plus love, his future becomes clearer...though certainly not easier.Fatima, Bilal's wise older sister, helps Bilal as best she can, while struggling with her own desire to rid herself of the veil, and some Iraqi ways, to be the strong American woman she sees herself becoming.The story intertwines cleverly. Salim becomes more violent toward his family members, especially Bilal. Family secrets from past days in Iraq spill, clarifying Salim's deeper, darker role in the changes wrenching their lives. In contrast to Bilal's tenderness with Muhammad is the fracturing of Bilal's family and the necessary intervention of a local Islamic leader.Rarely do we get a gem like this that blends a strikingly memorable story with a great cultural learning experience. No review can really do it justice. Captivating in its style, and daring in its content, it will surely become a classic of gay lit and perhaps a landmark young-adult book, too."},{"Title":"Bilal's Bread","review":"Graphic? Yes. REalistic? I think so. Necessary? Probably. As I read this book I was intrigued by the creative sense of desperation the author managed to engender in me as a reader. I wanted the story to have a positive outcome and yet, unlike many formulaic books (overcoming adversity as one comes of age) the outcome was in doubt until very near the end of the story. This to me is a compelling read. One that stays in the familiar territory of a literary \\"type\\" but also tweaks it enough to keep me engaged. We don't know if Bilal will indeed escape or overcome his oppressive surroundings. The fact that (spoiler alert) he does indeed and the community comes to so sort of comfortable acceptance may be a bit unrealistic but the author left enough un-tidy ends (the sister? the family's future?) to keep a tinge of reality. Not to mention that text exploring this coming of age in a multi-cultural, pluralistic society would be good reading for mature teens and adults alike. I'm a school teacher and I tend to read \\"adolescent literature\\" with this in mind -whether my early teens would benefit from a novel via enlightenment or entertainment and I think the answer for this one is yes. I would especially encourage young [...]teens to read this book. Yes, it is graphic. But as they say... it's nothing these kids don't already know and hasn't been presented in mainstream prime-time televsion or movies. Now... for his next novel.....?"},{"Title":"Bilal's Bread","review":"Bilal's Bread is wonderful for understanding the worst elements of homophobia in Muslim culture. It makes one think--can it really be this bad? The author, Sulayman X, shows the passion, deceit and hypocricy in a family that imperils the life of a young, teen-age American-Kurdish boy living in Kansas.Fascinating characters unfortunately speak a dialog that often sounds polemical and lacks the idiomatic flavor and languagestyle of these newly arrived immigrants into the midwest.Still, Bilal's Bread, although preachy and melodramatic at times, reveals insights that make us want to know much more about the people, the culture and especially its gay men and lesbian women's sufferings. It is a very timely work in view of the recent Iranian horrors against gay men.MARK V. ROSE, Author OF BANGKOK, OH BOY! HOW THE TSUNAMI AFFECTED THE LIVES OF A THAI MONEY BOY AND TWO AMERICAN PROFESSORS"},{"Title":"Bilal's Bread","review":"This is a good book if you're looking into some insight into the possible experiences of gay Muslims in the US. However, this book graphically depicts severe physical and sexual abuse of a minor (Bilal) at the hands of his brother. So, be forewarned there. Also, I am interested into what sort of research Sulayman X conducted before writing this work as to my knowledge he is not Kurdish-American and converted to Islam in his 20's. Furthermore, the writing in this novel is very plain, the dialogue between characters is almost cartoonish at times, and parts of the plot seem simply unbelievable."},{"Title":"Bilal's Bread","review":"I suppose it's to be expected that a convert is going to be preachy. I felt that the characters were mere mouthpieces for a monologue that the author wanted to deliver about Islam. We have the wise, accepting, progressive, gentle-giant Imam, we have the violent, racist, fundamentalist, sexual abuser brother, we have the oh-so-sensitive lead who learns the true meaning of standing up for himself, we have the too-too beautiful boyfriend. Yawn. The characters were all fluent in psychobabble at various times, even the generally mute mom suddenly bursts forth with her own stream. All that said, it was readable and certainly not your average story. I give it points for the concept, but it reads like a first draft, awkward and unpolished."},{"Title":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby Hb (Pop-Up Books)","review":"I love this book! I originally bought this for some children I used to babysit, but when I got it home, I started to flip through it and couldn't put it down. In the middle of the book is a pop-up house! It's so great. You can open up all the doors and windows and peek inside. Plus, with three different endings, you can read it again and again."},{"Title":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby Hb (Pop-Up Books)","review":"Professor Proudfoot is late to Countess Wilby's country party, but he's anxious to see her famous Russian Ruby. This little mystery for the middle-school set will charm younger and older readers as well, as they use pull tabs, fold-outs and pop-ups to peek in characters' pockets, look through windows and read clues about the 6 people weekending at Wilby Court. By the end of this 12-page book -- filled with clever manipulatives -- you should be able to solve the mystery, which has three possible endings. The emphasis is on the clever design here, and it is quite well done indeed."},{"Title":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby Hb (Pop-Up Books)","review":"What a fun book that encourages divergent thinking and problem solving skills! Amazing pop up book details with a mystery the reader must solve using clues that he/she finds. You can reread it three times with different solutions by rotating tabs that change the clues and hence the ending. It is reminds me of all the fun I had playing CLUE as a child. What a great addition to any child's library! Will definitely be read again and again and encourage the love of books as well as fluency. Would be appropriate and fun for a child from 3 1/2 - 9 and guaranteed to thrill even the parent as well. My two boys, my husband and I all LOVE this book!!!"},{"Title":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby Hb (Pop-Up Books)","review":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby was listed as \\"like new\\" but some of the pull tabs were folder over and had a definite \\"used\\" look to it."},{"Title":"Mystery of the Russian Ruby Hb (Pop-Up Books)","review":"My three-year-old daughter, Joy Winter Wilson received this book when she was two and has been obsessed with it ever since.

Still, we have spent many a night shining a flashlight into the pop-up Mansion and talking about the mysterious thief and oooohing and ahhhing over the secret passageway, and the clues, etc. It is facinating how riveting the story and the pop-ups are to children.

Good guy is a London cop. While investigating a complaint, he finds it may involve British and maybe American intelligence services. Although warned off officially and with threats, his professional pride and personal(sexual) interest won't let him quit his investigations. Positives: (1) the characters, especially the minor ones, are well presented as individuals, (2) plot keeps moving along well. Negatives: (1) attempt to combine police procedural and spy thriller just doesn't work. (2) even 30 years ago, a lot of the plot elements were cliches -- example: bad guys gimmick the hero's car to blow him up, but nice guy hero lends car to friend who gets killed instead."},{"Title":"The House of Nasi The Duke of Naxos","review":"The book was very informative.

It is also a lift-the-flap book, and these books seem to hold toddlers' attentions a bit more than others. I also like the way that at one point it depicts Sarah playing with the potty which is differentiated from Sarah finally using the potty. It's nice for a book to make that distinction because often the first stage is for a child to play with a potty not fully understanding the concept. I also like the way that it teaches that we should wash our hands after using the potty (one of the few books to do so). Overall, a great way to introduce the idea of a potty--bright simple illustrations, just enough information, and a little humor thrown in too!"},{"Title":"Sara's Potty","review":"\\"Lift-the-Flap Fun\\"\\"Who sits on the potty?\\" Not the zebra! Not the sheep! Not the giraffe! Not even Sara - at least, not at first. With simply drawn illustrations in soft colors and flaps that lift to reveal the answers, your toddler is sure to adore this potty book. After reading over two dozen picture books on toilet training, we liked Sara's Potty because it was entertaining and educational. The wide, square flaps are more durable than the smaller slide-the-arrow variety featured in other similar activity books such as What Do You Do With A Potty? by Marianne Borgardt and Let's Go Potty by Moira Butterfield (but these books are also worth a look). Harriet Ziefert's story identifies the purpose of the potty (\\"pooping\\" and \\"peeing\\"), includes the often-omitted handwashing step, and shows the transition to \\"big girl underwear.\\""},{"Title":"Sara's Potty","review":"We checked out Sarah's Potty from our public library but quickly decided we needed to get one to keep.

My daughter loves it and finds the story very funny and likes me to read it to her while she sits on the potty.

My daughter loves it!"},{"Title":"Cigar: America's Horse","review":"There are far too few biographies of thoroughbreds. (Man o' War's story has yet to be told in any comprehensive fashion!) So any fan o'the turf will want to pick up Hovdey's story of Cigar, a no-nonsense, straight-ahead documentation of the great Cigar's life, up to his defeat at Del Mar after sixteen straight wins.And make no mistake, Cigar is one of the best. Like Secretariat, Cigar had the perfect racing mentality, and the size and conformation needed for success in this most grueling of sports. The book also introduces us to Allen Paulson, Cigar's owner, who I found as interesting as Cigar himself. We learn how Paulson came up in the depression, built Gulfstream jets, and became a billionare.Hovdey's writing is clear as crystal, and the book's layout and presentation is easy on the eye. And for those doubters of Cigar, just let me know when another horse wins sixteen in a row in the open division."},{"Title":"Cigar: America's Horse","review":"Although it appears Hovedy did not put in the intense hours of research William Nack or Jane Schwartz completed in their respective biographies of the century's top race horses, the work is still an excellent chronicle of Cigar, the race horse and the immense pool of talent surrounding his incredible campaign. Where Nack and Schwartz offer a near-complete education of horseracing, Hovedy instead details the lives of the people behind the sport. Still, it's an easy, free-flowing read which seems to end too quickly."},{"Title":"Cigar: America's Horse","review":"I am happy to report that the writer for this book is in the same league as the horse he's writing about. The result? A thoroughly enjoyable story of how Cigar, the charismatic son of Palace Music and Solar Slew, carved a name for himself in racing history and in the process became the sweetheart of the sports world.Author Jay Hovdey did his homework for the book, tracking down and interviewing all the major players in Cigar's life from the folks who foaled him to those who tended to his needs as he raced. He also took the time to get to know and probe beneath the surface of the public exteriors of the people who surrounded Cigar. This means that the reader has a feeling for how things unfolded behind the scenes as Hovdey relates Cigars meteroic rise to stardom. What makes it even sweeter is that Cigar was a late bloomer with delicate legs that resulted in all but one of his initial 11 races being run on grass. As it turns out, Cigar didn't like grass, and it wasn't until his bones had a chance to strengthen and someone in the stables lobbbied strongly for giving him a try on the dirt that Cigar came into his own. And what a show it was! Not only did he win 16 times in succession, equally Citation's record, but he beat out the best in international competition after being shipped to Arabia where he ran in unfamiliar surroundings on a less than ideal track.If this book lacks anything, it's a personal connection with the horse by the author. Although Hovdey does a great job of relating what others have to say about Cigar, you never have the feeling that he himself has connected with the spirit of the colt. He talks about Cigar from a distance, removed by time and reporting from the immediate physical presence of the animal. Time and again you read that Cigar's exercise jockeys thought he was smart, how he loved peppermints, that his trainer always knew when he was in a playful mood, that he always carried himself with dignity, but in the end these are all second hand accounts. You never get the feeling that you are actually in the presence of Cigar, running your hand down the muscled neck, smelling his sweat as he cools out, seeinig his one, white-ringed eye roll in your direction as he listens to what you're saying, the feel of his lips as he plucks one of the peppermint candies he was so fond of from your hand, smelling that sweet mix of straw, manure, linament and sweat that is so much a part of all stables. Perhaps because I've spent time around horses I missed these very personal touches which would have brought the horse alive for me.In the end this is a very competent, well-written book, but it lacks the spark that would have made it a 5-star recommendation for me."},{"Title":"Cigar: America's Horse","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, although I feel that it doesn't really say all that much about the great big bay, it mainly talks about his owner, trainer, and jockey; although Cigar is also mentioned quite alot.

It was well written, easy to understand, and had funny and enjoyable parts often. I don't think I sat down and didn't smile after ten minutes of reading.

The writer really went into the emotions of the horse, not just the people associated with Cigar. The writer really told the story well, and I would read anymore of the books he wrote.

The writer seems to have had a pre-occupation with young girls because almost every enttry ends by saying that : &quot;If a young girl should dream of .... &quot; and then goes into the most amazing complex series of what she should dream.

Miller draws from Camille Flammariov's (1900) work especially Flammariov's &quot;Unknown&quot; for purpose and framework. The exact nature of where Miller's 10,000 dream interpretations-every single entry-come from is not clear. The assumption is that Miller has been able to tap into a universal reference on symbology with his higher self. Based on a small unrandom sample of dreams from personal experience and friends with follow-up, the accuracy of interpretation approaches the accuracy of prediction of daily astrological guidance in local newspapers. Beyond the possible rival factor of self-fulfilling prophecy, the accuracy depends on a person's point-of-view. The strength of the book is its symbolic database and proposed meanings as interesting points of discussion. For example, Miller's interpretation of dreaming about deer is generally favorable, denoting deep friendships or a quiet life. While killing a deer in your dream is interpreted as being harrassed by your enemies. Farmers and business people who dream of hunting deer should be warned that failure will be forthcoming in their ventures. My bias or tendency is for people to self-interpret symbols using their own local or personal meanings that they attach to objects in their dreams, so Miller's book fell short of my expectations."},{"Title":"10,000 Dreams Interpreted or What's in a Dream","review":"I originally bought this book back in the late 1970's. I'd already been working with dreams for 10+ years, and it helped me focus in on certain things that previously I couldn't make sense of.Easy-to-use reference book... Key words are alphabetized for easy reference. It helps to use a thesaurus, as some words to describe what's in a dream may not be exactly the wording you might use.If I had one dream reference book to use, this would be the one. It's a great starter book, and has been a great reference for me for years (I bought another copy not too long ago.)This book can help you on your way to understanding your dreams and that of others. VERY easy to use!I'd also recommend keeping a dream journal by the side of your bed, and before you do ANYTHING in the morning, write your dreams down that you can recall. The less movement, the better until you have it down. Sometimes it's a good idea to not move at all, play the dream back in your head, then write it down.

Why do some languages have only 3 vowels and others have over a dozen? If a language has five vowels, why is it most likely the same five vowels (i, e, a, o, u)? This book answers those questions with a computer simulation.The book is a published version of the author's dissertation for his degree in computer science. However, it's (I'd say) more relevant to linguistics than CS. In a nutshell, he creates a program that simulates natural language vowel systems using &#34;agents.&#34; These agents develop vowel inventories by interacting with other agents and adjusting their vowels or creating new ones, depending on the outcome of the interaction. The results are that the vowel systems developed by the agents are remarkably similar to those of the world's languages. It's truly spectacular.What I enjoy about it is that his methodology is very clear--clear enough to replicate if you have some CS background. I did in fact replicate it and got similar results.The book is free from linguistics or CS jargon, making it a fairly simple read. The discussion of self-organization for the first few chapters is very interesting as well.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in linguistics and HIGHLY recommend it to any linguist with even basic computational skills. It's a fascinating book and blows lots of other theories of the origins of vowel systems out of the water."},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"This book is definitely one that every Christian should read. Pat G'Orge-Walker uses humor to help all of us Christians to examine ourselves and our church. I can't even tell you which of the short stories contained in this book was my favorite. The first story really grabs you and you will not be able to put the book down. The characters in the book may resemble people that you know. That is not necessarily a good thing. You cannot go wrong purchasing this book. I am looking forward to reading more of Sister Betty's and the others adventures. God Bless Pat G'Orge-Walker!"},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"This is one of the funniest books on religion and the Christian life I have ever read and definitely should be made into a movie ( with Whoopie Goldberg of course)!

I didn't know anything until I read this collection of short stories about these spiritually lacking folks. I know practically all of these characters.My favorite characters, aside from Sister Betty, has got to be her half-blind, snuff-dipping and crazy as she-wannabe Ma Cile. I can definitely picture this as a sitcom or even a play. I just ordered Ms. Walker's DVD where she portrays a character named, Sistah I. B. DeUsher. I saw a sample of it at www.holyhumor.org She has a new fan and I will buy whatever this woman puts out. You can't miss with this one.

IMOI just could not get into it. I spent a month trying to finish it and still come not finish it before the bookclub meeting.I am one that try and finish reading a book no matter how bad I think it is . I got as far as 189 pages and I just gave up.A group of atleast 15 of us felt like we wasted our hard earned money to purchase and attempt to read it.We had an author conference call and I was truley hurt to have to saySister Betty made a failing grade with every one with the exception of one.I guess it goes to show how we can all read the same book and come up with two opinions. Either you love it or you hate it.The reviews posted have been great for her but .... I missed the boat somewhere.Of all 15 of us only one thought it was a 4. * read. This is one I would say study carefully before you buy it.I wished some one had shared these comments with me before we chose it a bookclub selection.It really hurts for me to post this but I just felt my literaryduty to do this.a review I am not proud to write but I just felt I had to do it. :-("},{"Title":"Sister Betty!

God's Calling You, Again!","review":"While I initially found the character names silly, I have found this book entertaining. It has allowed me to escape into a world where I can giggle because some of the character's like Sister Ima Hellraiser are completely without common sense. Reverend Knott Enough Money's antics leave me giggling as well. Any time a novel allows me to laugh at the end of a grinding day, I think it has redeeming qualities so while this novel lacks the literary chops of Toni Morrison's or Alice Walker's work, it has the funny one finds in Tina McElroy Ansa's novels. So if you want to escape your daily drudgery and get a laugh, try this one."},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"This book has all the scoop of so many churches these days.

At the end I did actually did laugh out loud, some parts did tickle me. Then she got a little too preachy and she mentioned herself in the book-something I hate for an author to do, (yes it is my own personal pet peeve). The stories in this book are not that great and the way she named the character and the church was very tedious after a while but I didn't hate this book. I didn't buy it either-1st book I ever got from the library because I usually just buy them but hey I was there so why not. Now if I would have paid for this book I would have been very upset. Why? There are several reason, 1. The name thing does get very irritating after awhile. 2. The characters/situation where so unbelievable that even if you went to church you wouldn't be able to relate them to anything you have every seen, an all out brawl inside the church? How is that possible? Am I that nave? 3.The testimony becoming an all out gossip fest. No matter how money hungry your preacher was he would still try to have some decorum in his church-I would hope. Something where hard for me to believe why and that is why I could not give this 4 or 5 star. That said I finish this book last night and the funny parts where very funny. If you read the book you will have to admit that the image of that old lady dropping the deacon was funny. So I am glad I did NOT BUY this book but I am glad I read it......"},{"Title":"Sister Betty!

God's Calling You, Again!","review":"Writer and Christian comedienne Pat G'Orge-Walker has her audience laughing out loud as she narrates the antics of the members of the Ain't Nobody Else Right but Us-All Others Goin' to Hell Church in her novel Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again. With various members such as Ma Cile, Sis. Connie Fuse, Ima Hellraiser, Mother Pray Onn and her daughter Carrie Onn, Rev. Knott Enuff Money and Bishop Was Nevercalled it is a wonder the church remains standing.Sister Betty receives a phone call from God that he is coming to visit. Sister Betty was so busy getting ready for his visit, that she misses him each of the three times he knocks on her door. The phone call changed her life and now she tries to do right and set a righteous example for the church members. However, chaos and confusion reign in this church. From the pulpit to the balcony, the members fight and raise hell for the sake of being in control and being seen. When Sister Connie Fuse makes a mistake with Mother Pray Onn's layaway payment, she trembles in her shoes at the fear of retaliation. Sister Betty and Mother Pray Onn wear the same one-of-a- kind hat to Friends and Family day, and all hell breaks loose. What happens when Ima Hellraiser attends the fund-raiser meeting? You will have to read this vignette to believe it.I was laughing out loud as I imagined what some of the scenes would be like if acted out on stage. While reading though, I would have liked for the characters to tell the story with dialogue instead of being told the story by the author. The set up was there, the descriptions vivid, but for a comedic read there was too much narration. However, if you ever get a chance to see this play live, I say go! You will not be disappointed.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"this book offers 7 vinettes exhibiting several flawed congregation members of the Ain't Nobody Right But Us-All others Goin' To Hell church. Sister Betty, once a very proud hypocrite receives a telephone call from God. The initial story centers on her very un-Christian-like behaviour after the call and her eventual turnaround. From that point of the book the rest of the stories center around characters whose names depict their particular flaws and embedded with laugh outloud hilarity in over the top yet familiar situations which are designed to draw you in with the laughter but make you think.I think this author has done something so ingenius that some will no doubt find it too tasking to see the deeper meaning and, of course, because there's no cursing such as in some other supposedly popular Christian fiction, it will perhaps not be as popular.My bookclub has had the opportnity to read her upcoming novel and it is pure delight. It's more of a serious read yet still utilizing these same characters in a outrageous and comical manner. In her upcoming novel, Mother Eternal Ann Everlastin's Dead we get a chance to see why these folks are the way they are and see redemption as well.Great job from this author."},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"Sister Betty has always considered herself a woman of God, so she is not shocked to receive a phone call from God himself. What is even more shocking is how she behaves after the call. Once a self-centered woman, she becomes more caring, and more cognizant of others feelings. She also has some revelations that forever change her life and the lives of those that attend the Ain't-Nobody-Else-But-Us-All-Others-Going-To-Hell-Church.In author Pat G'orge-Walker's new book, SISTER BETTY! GOD'S CALLING YOU, AGAIN! she offers a series of vignettes reflecting Sister Betty's efforts to keep everyone in the church on their proper path with God. All of the stories are tied together and offer up a cast of colorful and outrageous characters. My favorite character throughout the book is Ma Cile, she is the grandmother of two mischievous 10 year olds who are constantly testing her nerves and patience. This was something I could relate to, because when I was their age it was my goal to drive adults crazy.SISTER BETTY! GOD'S CALLING YOU, AGAIN! had me laughing from cover to cover. The author has found a way to marry humor and life's lessons, and the product is hilarious and informative. This is the first time I have read Pat G'orge-Walker's work but it will not be the last. I highly recommend that readers pick up this book and share it with their families.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawksof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"What an amazing, ingenius and wonderfully enlightening read. It's wonderful to see comedy used in such a profound manner. If you are looking for rocket science this is not it. If you want to read about church folks, and maybe you, this is definitely it. This is not relegated to the Black church it's in most churches; I should know- I'm a white woman. Those who have a problem with its simplicity may see themselves :-)Kudos to Ms. Walker. I also recommend Mother Eternal. It's a novel and superb. I will never take my Christian walk for granted."},{"Title":"Sister Betty!

God's Calling You, Again!","review":"Sister Betty God's Calling You Again is a collection of seven short stories about the zany congregation of the Ain't Nobody Right but Us-All Others Goin To Hell church. Sister Betty, who found herself changed after experiencing a phone call from God and a few misadventures one afternoon is trying to turn the congregation led by the Rev. Knott Enuff Money around.I found this collection of seven short stories to be both inciteful and hilarious. I like the idea of it being seven which is a number which equals completion.Finally, the bookclub had an opportunity to speak with the author. She could not come to Ohio so she sent a package which contained a video tape (she's an awesome comedienne) video CD's and other items. Each was autographed for the club members. She didn't have to do that with her busy schedule and I applaud her for keeping it. I recommend this book and others that are to follow.She kept it real...and like she said, don't let worry kill you off..let them church folks help!"},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"Having waited for a couple of years to finally read the entire collection of the Sister Betty vignettes, I was not disappointed. I think that 209 + pages is not enough. What an imagination.I love the way the author uses the simple things from life and turns them into humorous messages of spirituality without being preachy. I also loved the way G'Orge-Walker lets her characters TELL the story. I've read so many reviews where the reviewer states that her characters just &quot;jump off the page.&quot; This book was so well written that by the third story, I didn't need to know the character's names in order to know who was speaking.From start to finish, Sister Betty; a former hypocrit and head Pharasee at the Ain't Nobody Right But Us-All Others Goin' To Hell church is on a mission to save the members of her church. Aided by her snuff-dipping, crazy-eyed, take-no-nonsense buddy, Ma Cile they start off on their God-given adventure. I don't want to give anything away, but the two women are hysterical together and Ma Cile sometimes steals Sister Betty's thunder just by being herself.The characters Reverend Knott Enuff Money and Sister Ima Hellraiser were two of my favorite because they remind me of folks I know.On another note, I also read Ms. G'Orge-Walker's story, &quot;Consequences&quot; in the Proverbs for the People anthology. Her writing was totally different and I, again, was amazed at how she attacked a story about HIV and generational curses. It was amazing and I wouldn't have guessed, it was written by a comedy writer.You can't go wrong with Sister Betty! God Calling you, again."},{"Title":"Sister Betty! God's Calling You, Again!","review":"Dignified folk shouldn't read this one outside of the confines of their private parlor. Believe me, you don't want non' of this in public! This is definitely a \`hoot' aloud book. Pat G'Orge-Walker serves up the laughs in her hilarious book, \\"Sister Betty, God's Calling You Again,\\" about the dysfunctional church folks in your congregation and mine, whether you belong to a Mega Church, or the Friendship Baptist Church on your local main street.I've belonged to both, having traveled the world with a military spouse. That's why this a special joy. It takes the reader home.Sister Betty receives a call from God himself. Her transformation comes through a series of hysterics, learned lessons and self-reflections. The characters are so familiar. You can't turn a page with being able to relate to one of them.Seven stories; cleverly signifying the biblical realm. Seven churches and Seven Seals; the most heralded number in the Bible. Well, this is seven, very humorous stories with monumental lessons, told candidly and honestly, using church-parody.Pat G'Orge-Walker cleverly takes on a niche' not many can, in making real, poignant statements about the superficial antics of church folks. She takes on the art of church hypocrisy to a real eye-peeling level. Walker is quite a descriptive writer, which easily makes this book more pleasurable, because you can definitely see and hear her \`busy characters.' Several members of our book club emailed to say that they loved the way she fashions hats to reveal subliminal messages about situations and characters. Reading \\"Sister Betty, God's Calling You, Again,\\" is like sitting in front of a sitcom.Debra Whitmire, SAblack online book club member. (Now living in Oklahoma.)"},{"Title":"Sister Betty!

Poetry enthusiasts in general, and Ursula K. Le Guin's legions of fans in particular, will want to avail themselves of a copy of \\"Incredible Good Fortune\\". 'Waking in April': Drifting on the birdsong river/between no light and light/and the sleep of a man and a cat,/I wear the soft old shirt/my mother made me seventy years ago,/winter coat, wedding gown./I wonder, as it wears away to rags/and gauze, will there be a mirror/to see the naked soul in,/or only an unraveling of shadow/as the day widens/and things grow clearer."},{"Title":"Incredible Good Fortune: New Poems","review":"The author states in the Note to the Reader that many of these poems were written in response to assignments in her poetry group, and I think that shows. It's partly the mix of forms which makes it hard to get a handle on the poet's true style, but it's more than that. There are so many that I found unconvincing; I just couldn't believe she cared about them. Many have good ideas, some have vivid imagery and a few have strong rhythms, but those three things rarely came together in a single poem. Some had a few lines I liked but others which spoiled the total effect. The last line of \\"The Lorelei to Heinrich Heine,\\" for instance, struck me as clumsy and sophomoric:when I sit lonely in the sunand comb my hair and comb my hairtill there comes by another one,some boy a mother had,to sink with me and die.O why am I so sad?\\"There were poems I couldn't quite get my mouth around, wondering how is this supposed to sound?

Even so, it does contain a few gems that make purchase of this title necessary to Thurber fans.The showpiece of this collection is the famous but somewhat over-rated \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" but MY WORLD also includes a number of seldom anthologized pieces that show Thurber's wit at a high-water mark, including \\"The Whip-Poor-Will,\\" \\"A Friend to Alexander,\\" and \\"The MacBeth Murder Mystery.\\" It also includes several examples of Thurber's acid perspective on the battle of the sexes, such as \\"Death in the Zoo,\\" and several memorable examples of his ability to wring laughter from the perfidies of language, such as \\"What Do You Mean, It 'Was' Brilling?\\" and \\"Here Lies Miss Gorby.\\"But the bulk of MY WORLD consists of much less focused material that Thurber casually produced for THE NEW YORKER--pieces which are mildly humorous examinations of everything from French guidebooks to 19th century copies of the English magazine PUNCH. Thurber's clever prose lends such pieces considerable charm, but they are decidedly minor works when compaired with the side-splitting classics found in other collections. Thurber fans, of course, will be delighted by most of it, but newcomers would likely be happier with such collections as A THURBER CARNIVAL."},{"Title":"My World - and Welcome to it (Methuen Humour Classics)","review":"This collection of short essays and stories is marvellous.

However, I was continually frustrated while reading this book because I felt that the author did not analyze very well the things she said. She would point out interesting comments made by couples seeking fertility treatment, but then give the same anaytical comments over and over again about the different couples' feelings. Also, I felt she was too biased and critical in her assessment of fertility treatment. It seemed like every couple (indeed, virtually everyone in the book was a married couple, very little representation from anyone else) felt the same way, ultimately -- disillusioned, doubtful about themselves, cynical about the process, and overall disappointed, even angry and bitter. This has not been my own personal experience, and I have a hard time believing that everyone in her large study sample was so dismal. It just wasn't a sophisticated, layered analysis. But it will probably be interesting to non-academics who would like to get a foundation for some of the negatives associated with infertility treatments, and with having problems with infertility."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I happened to be reading this book as I traveled to the SC coast on vacation. I was intrigued as I passed through Richmond, VA, the location of this novel. As I Black woman I do not often have the opportunity to talk with Southern Whites about their attitudes toward the Civil War and the traitors they still revere as heroes. On the few occasions that I have had that conversation it seemed so strange to me that they have such passion about a war that happened generations before they were born. And it is not just Richmond, remember my destination was SC via NC. Reading this book told me that I was not alone in thinking the South of 2002 is still confused about who won the Civil War and why. I really wanted those who romanticize the Ante-Bellum South to come face-to-face with the reality of its Peculiar Institution and economic structure. All through the book I was getting ready for the confrontation that I was ultimately denied. Danvers provided the best of science fiction; the re-examination of our history from a future perspective, with the possibility of an alternate--a better--ending. I was challenged to think of what that alternate ending could be since Danvers denied me the pleasure of providing one. This book is rich, textured with characters that are deep and complex. The reader may need a notecard to keep from getting lost, but it is well worth the effort to make it through the wordiness. No sex or violence. Best if you are a history buff or student of Americana."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"The Watch is a genuine &quot;romantic novel&quot; and does a nifty switcheroo on the 19th century American speculative political science fiction genre seen in Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward,&quot; that also employs time travel.The Watch got me banging on the kitchen table on page 99, and the ending, curling back on the author and the courage of the protagonist's indefatigable spirit, was a fine finish. I believe Danvers ate and fully digested all of the Anarchist Prince's writings as he deftly dishes up a double dose of Kroptikin spirit while he unveils a detailed history of --- and genuine love for--- his own hometown, Richomond, VA.I'll bet this is the novel Danvers always wanted to write. And one you'll wish you had written about your own home town and intellectual hero."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"This is a very creatively constructed story with elements of both time travel and historical fiction. For his own reasons Dennis Danvers has made himself an expert on the obscure Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who died in 1921. In this book Kropotkin is sent to present-day Richmond, VA by a mysterious meddler from the future, who either wants to change history favorably with Kropotkin as the catalyst, or simply amuse himself by creating new time streams. The story is told as an autobiography by the displaced Kropotkin, and this leads to enjoyable musings on how a Russian from the last century observes modern America, and especially how he finds kindred souls among a group of punk rockers. Interestingly, and perhaps courageously, Danvers lays down a lot of criticism of his hometown of Richmond and its strange obsession with its hateful past, through the eyes of Kropotkin.Though many of the characters in this novel are quite well drawn and enjoyable, Kropotkin among them, he speaks mostly in the writings of the real-life anarchist, which Danvers clearly wants to bring to light for modern readers. That may have even worked with me, as my curiosity about Kropotkin's works has been piqued. But this method of storytelling leads to a rather implausible book in which Danvers is advancing his own theories and using Kropotkin's &quot;classics&quot; as a tool. The plotline also gets a bit out of hand toward the end, and the true motives of the mysterious future meddler remain vague. This is truly a fun and fascinating novel, and a great exercise in creative storytelling. But the use of Kropotkin's writings by Danvers to comment on modern society gets very heavy-handed and didactic.

The science part plays a fairly minor role, and is indeed neither detailed nor particularly convicing. It could, in fact, be safely replaced with some minor magic without affecting the story in the least. What Danvers does is to use his baby science/magic trick to create a situation rich with possibility, superimposing early 20th century anarchist ideas with present-day capitalism and 19th century slavery. It is this mix, with its contrasts and similarities, with its apparent superimposition of ideas, that is the real magic of the book.The character of Peter Krotopkin, based on the real life Russian anarchist, is drawn with a great deal of finesse (though the accounts of his past life tends to the clumsy on occassion). His actions follow a certain headalong buildup that gives the novel its energetic pace, but I felt the climax was rather unsatisfying. Krotopkin's release from jail feels very contrived; Danvers meanders in introducing too many different elements in effecting a simple jailbreak. The end of the novel feels a bit like he threw a lot of different ideas at it, in the hope that some might stick.The richness of the novel, however, is in the juxtaposition of an anarchist philosophy originally proposed against the communist system applied to today's capitalism, and in the open debates about individual freedom and slavery that Danvers outlines, and then leaves to the reader to answer. This, rather than the weak science in the novel, is what stays with you after you've put the book down."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I'd always enjoyed books by Dennis Danvers but had previously considered his works to be \\"light reading\\". This book has changed my mind. It has the potential to be considered one of the great works of modern literature. Comparable to 1984 and Alas, Babylon or Anthem in quality.Simply amazing."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I really enjoyed The Watch, although to be honest, I do not read much science fiction, so don't have much in the genre to compare it with. On the flip side, I think that this book will have much appeal to non-sci fi fans. Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist who died in the early 20th century is offered the chance, on his deathbed, to be reborn, as a 30ish man, in 1999. Kropotkin is a bright man and an utterly charming narrator. His story is interesting and engaging and fairly plausible. My only complaint is that the ending is not as strong as the rest of the novel, almost as if Danvers didn't really know quite how to end the novel. Still, this is an excellent, fun read."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I haven't read any other books by this author, but I really enjoyed The Watch. This book has love, compassion, and politics. I recomend this book to anyone who likes science fiction. It is very easy to read and has a deep meaning. It defenantly made me examine the way I live my life. It made me think of how the past has affected me and how I will affect the future."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"The aging Russian prince and noted anarchist writer, Peter Kropotkin, (an actual historical figure) is on his deathbed when he is given the chance to start life over as a young man, in America, in fact, in Richmond, Virginia, in 1999. In his pocket he carries a watch which is actually a time machine. That's the science-fiction aspect of the book. The rest is philosophy, a deep examination of choice and free will and what makes a person really free. Time-travel of course is loaded with paradox, as all sci-fi readers know. To visit the past (or the future) is to change it irrevocably. Kropotkin's time travel starts out as a lark, like Rip Van Winkle waking up in a new time, meeting some cool characters, finding a girlfriend, learning a new culture. But soon more people from the past are turning up. The lark begins branching off into a number of alternative futures, not all pleasant. Things start to get messy. The last third of the book turns very dark, as our hero learns that escape is not freedom and that choices may be painful but necessary. To time-travel out of slavery in Virginia may be easy. To escape from oneself, maybe not. There is so much packed into this book that I cannot truly say I understood it all. It was profound, yet at the same gracefully written, lucid, easy to follow, and often hilarious. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"Danvers builds a steadily credible narrative by staying with his characters and slowly building suspense yet throws in the towel at the novel's climax and loses his way completely in the last fifty pages.&quot;The Watch&quot; begins as Peter Kropotkin, real life Russian anarchist, is revived on his deathbed by a mysterious man who calls himself Anchee. Anchee sends Kropotkin, complete with a new 30 year-old body, to Richmond, Virginia 1999. The novel follows Kropotkin as he interacts with Richmond life and slowly contacts several people who will play pivotal roles in an alternate American future.For the most part, the novel succeeds in its characterizations and in persuading the reader to suspend disbelief. We come to believe this new Kropotkin and are thoroughly convinced by telling background details that we are seeing this story through his eyes. In this he rivals Farmer's portrait of Richard Francis Burton in his &quot;Riverworld&quot; series. There is also plenty of Richmond history as connected with the Civil War and General Robert E. Lee. Well done, Mr. Danvers.The problems begin when we discover that the watch of the title is a device for bringing the bearer back in time (any time other than the future and the era in which the bearer has lived). Right away a rent is torn in the fiction as any sane living person would use the watch immediately and tour recorded history. Kropotkin however, thinks it's a hoot and returns it to his pocket. Yeah, sure.When the climax of the novel arrives and events quickly overtake Kropotkin, Danvers bobbles and eventually drops the ball. The closing events in the story have little import, as Kropotkin's new political life is given such short attention. And it is here, finally, where Danvers wants us to believe in too many &quot;SF&quot; tropes at one time, all of which are made possible by the watch. All of which are used to cover up the fact that the author simply ran out of ideas. Also, the Anchee character is given unexplained godlike abilities and becomes the explanation for every plot hole or twist.&quot;The Watch&quot; looks good on the jacket blurb and for the first few hundred pages, give the reader the impression that it might deliver on its promises.Don't be fooled."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all of this book - except the ending. Danvers could have done so much more with the storyline. The truly ironic thing, I find, is that there is one scene in the book where Kropotkin criticizes the ending of Mike's play; and then _The Watch_ ends, in my eyes, having the same fault! He should have practiced what he preached."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"This is an endearing tale of a Russian anarchist dying of old age in 1921 who gets a second chance at life in his rejuvenated body in 1999 in the United States. So two themes that are appealing--time travel and wisdom in a young body.The story is interesting and appealing. The building of a new life from scratch, learning all about modern life and history, developing new friendships--this is good stuff. The ending had some problems and seemed a little vague and dark compared to the rest of this upbeat story."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"This book was really quite good. A very nice view of our world from an outsiders perspective. A great read for anyone with an open mind. The only problem with this book was the ending, it was interesting until I really thought about it.No one who has ever truly spent time in jail would willingly go back in, just to live a life without some form of control. You would have to be inhuman to want to live a life of loneliness, unhappiness and then eventually plunge into insanity, all inside a little cell.That is the only mistake the author makes in writing the book, but overall, an interesting perspective."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. However, it is stronger philosophically than it is on the sci fi element. Sci fi readers may be dissapointed that we don't get to know how the watch really works in great detail, but people who enjoy political commentary and are open to critical commentary on modern American culture will greatly enjoy this book. My opinion is that those who do not like the ending either did not feel the philosophical necessity of it, or understand the character of Kropotkin that Danvers presents. It is considerably darker than the rest of the book, but the only possible ending that would be consistent with the author's presentation of this remarkable man. If you spent your entire life (or both of them?) working toward a certain goal, would you choose to have someone simply hand it to you after all that time? I think not."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"This a wonderfully written book which revolves around a fun science fiction gimmick and provides a thought-provoking view of the nature of the institutions of power in our so-called free society. The character of Kropotkin is well drawn and full of the contradictions that plague all idealists. I also enjoyed the character of the displaced slave Jonah with his endless curiosity and mechanical fiddling. On a personal level, I agree with the other reviewers about the ending of the book. As one said, Danvers seems to commit the same error he advises Mike against. But although I wanted something different, I can understand Kropotkin's reasoning -- is getting a good ending by cheating really that good? If we truly want that ending, maybe we should go out and make it happen."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"In 1921 Russia, anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin is near death when a stranger Anchee Mahur offers him an opportunity to live life anew in a healthy body. Without a look back at his past or any Faustian consequences, Peter accepts the offer to live albeit in 1999 Richmond, Virginia.Peter finds a job, falls in love with Rachel Pederson, who helps immigrants adapt to the United States, and meets fellow time travelers. Peter soon sets the tone for community service by distributing food to the needy. Along with his out of time cronies, Peter concludes that Anchee is fostering his personal concept of how the future should look and that the out of time souls are the tools to create this brave new world. Peter questions what he and his peers are doing as he wonders if he should follow Anchee's vision that parallels his own desires for humanity or stop his mentor so that free will determines the future even if it is something he despises.THE WATCH is an insightful science fiction that looks closely at the question of free will vs. determinism, but from a fresh perspective. The story line contains a deep message about choices and whether any means justifies the end. The cast is believable especially the displaced Peter who struggles with an enigma between his dreams and his actions to attain what he deems is best for society. Dennis Danvers provides a powerful novel that political and social science fiction fans will savor except those fanatics who insist they have the only answer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"...Author Dennis Danvers does fine job describing how a man who truly believes in the power of the people over the power of the state would live and how he would decide amongst the alternatives available to him, while at the same time making Kroptkin human, with human desires and flaws. The brief quotes from the historical Kroptkin's work add depth to the novel as well as framing the decisions the fictional Kroptkin must face.THE WATCH is an enjoyable novel but it suffers from a protagonist who has no clear goals. While he seeks the utopian revolution that will overthrow the state and allow humans to live in harmony with one another and with nature, Kroptkin doesn't seem to really do much to bring this about (unless he believes that simply living that lifestyle will catch on). Without clear objectives for Kroptkin to work toward and for the reader to identify with, THE WATCH distances Kroptkin from the reader, reducing the emotional impact and reducing the reader's identification with Danvers' political message as well. This limitation notwithstanding, I enjoyed THE WATCH and am intrigued by the historical Kroptkin."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"A 19th century anarchist is given a second chance at life at the end of a 20th century.The premise is inventive and I wanted to like this, but...I got only partway through this before putting it aside. Parts were nice, but the crude and socialistic aspects were too much. This is definitely not for teens."},{"Title":"The Watch","review":"Reading the blurb this sounded exciting since I was a BIG fan of CIRCUIT and its sequel. I'd ignored Danvers earlier fascination with Russian Marxism as a sign of the times. He is a university professor and as a Russian wag said, \\"We may have seen the light but the college folks are still waitin' for the Revolution.\\" LOL The irony is that the very things the \\"hero\\" criticizes - greed, capitalism's messiness, redundance and competition - manage to deliver the goods AND political freedom whereas planned economies do neither.The premise is enticing - a dying man is given a chance at another life in a younger reincarnation at a distant time in the future (1999). In this case, it's mid 19th century Tsarist Siberia and our \\"hero\\" is the Marxist anarchist Peter Kropotkin, an actual revolutionary. Literary problems start immediately upon \\"arrival\\" in Richmond with the words \\"capital of the Confederacy\\". You moan, oh my God, not another evil South rehash. It appears to be 1969 instead with communal living, hippy lifestyle, power to the people atmosphere - tofu and guitar strumming are emphasized. Kropotkin is quoted throughout the book, interesting and silly. (Example: \\"All things are for all men\\" - When the Bolsheviks put his ideas into practice [the actual] Kropotkin got mad resigned.)There are logic flaws big enough for one of the hated SUVs. The anarchist acts like a 21st century hip metrosexual. He exhibits none of the rampant Russian racism, calmly accepts a young man's declaration of homosexuality, shows little surprise at the plethora of tats and piercings and multiple races, organizes a youthful revolution (against what?). The \\"plot\\" turns into a series of incidents designed for our hero to spout his ideas. You want to scream, \\"Just shut up for once!\\" Occassionally we meet other charactes (including the requisite love interest) but they're about as authentic as the Tooth Fairy. The ending is as muddled and mundane as the beginning is exciting. Here's hoping for better next time."},{"Title":"The History of the English Language: A Source Book","review":"Lots of great sources, background and commentary.

Authors Brown and Rose spent eight years gathering every shred of information they could find on approximately 2,000 African-American families who inhabited one or more of 26 counties in Southeastern Connecticut. Their sources consisted primarily of U.S. census records from 1790 through 1870 and secondarily on manumission records, deeds, probate records, diaries, church records, and military records. In particular, Brown and Rose have amassed an amazing amount of information on blacks who were living in an area that, on the eve of the Revolutionary War, had one of the largest slave populations in New England. The authors cite the specific source for each element appearing in their genealogical sketches. The brief introduction summarizes some of the challenges of investigating black roots, while the bibliography, name index, and subject index at the back of the volume make using the book quite easy.Clearfield Company would like to express its appreciation to the New London County Historical Society, the publisher of these two books, for allowing us to make them available to our patrons."},{"Title":"A, My Name Is--","review":"I shared this with my kindergarteners to much excitement.

Often maligned in the American press, which worked to bring down the government of South Viet Nam, the Ngo Dinh family worked to better their country and help out their fellow freedom loving citizens.It was quite touching that Ngo Dinh Diem cared greatly for the ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam that are being persecuted by the current communist dictators in Viet Nam.The book details the betrayal of Ngo Dinh Diem and his brothers by both the Americans and the corrupt Vietnamese who were interested in their own power and agenda.A great biography of an amazing family."},{"Title":"A Lifetime in the Eye of the Storm","review":"A Lifetime In the Eye of the Storm is a moving account of the Ngo Dinh family's determination to live and work for the freedom of their beloved country. As a woman, I am not often drawn to read books about war; however, this book is different. Although it is obviously about war, what caught my interest was the author's excellent portrayal of human emotions and the struggles of the people caught up in the long years of war in Viet Nam. At times, I was moved to tears by the tremendous losses suffered, but then I was encouraged by the steadfast faith and tenacious desire to survive and carry on with hope for the future."},{"Title":"A Lifetime in the Eye of the Storm","review":"I was surprised to learn from the publisher's blurb that this book was the story of &quot;all (Vietnamese)women who have lived through a war&quot;. I would not have thought that President Ngo Dinh Diem's sister was a typical example of a woman in wartime Vietnam? In many ways she was surely the power behind the throne, since she was a major channel for anyone seeking to influence the President and, as such, well protected, until the fall of Saigon,from many of the disasters that that suffering country experienced.The book itself is a disappointment. Its overblown romantic style and the numerous non-native speaker faults of syntax and vocabulary make it a dull and rather frustrating read. Hanoi translators write better English.One has the feeling that Mr Chau has been too much influenced by the pulp fiction about &quot;Indochine&quot; so popular in France at the turn of the 20th century. Unfortunately not only is this book an uneasy amalgam of history and fiction but a good deal of the history also seems to owe more to Mr. Chau's imgaination than the historical facts."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I thought the book was very well written with good characters and a strong emotional side to it.

A fun ride that takes us through Washington State to Wyoming and into the Colorado wilderness without skipping a beat of the action. I truly liked Sam McKade, the male lead and bounty hunter. The female lead of the mistaken twin Catherine MacPherson was fun to read, but she sometimes got on my nerves. LOL...what I mean by that is that she is mistaken for her showgirl-stripper-wild twin sister Kaylee and she tended to try and act like her sister to the point of annoyance. Hard to explain, but she was being hauled from home and practically accosted by this guy she didn't know and all she did for the first few chapters was figure, hell, I might as well try and be Kaylee and see why she does the things she does. She wears her stripper clothes and makeup and I got the impression she looked like a hooker to the people in the story, lol. No offense Ms. Anderson, I loved the story, it was fast-paced and fun to read, but Catherine was a little too unbelieveable in the beginning.~The last thing a proper Seattle teacher for the deaf needs is a surly bounty hunter breaking into her quiet home and mistaking her for her wild and out of control twin sister Kaylee! She hasn't even seen her sister in a long while! So when Kaylee shows up at her door wanting help and then suddenly flees leaving Catherine literally holding the bag, Sam McKade comes barging into her home and handcuffs her! No way is he believing that she is a twin! things dont get better when he drags her along with all Kaylee's clothes and puts her on a Greyhound bus handcuffed to his wrist intending to go to Miami! Things get even worse when she is crammed up next to him, all muscle and machoness, making her think bad things about him when she is a respectable schoolteacher from Seattle, not some floozy stripper!Sam McKade has no patience for the lies this irritating, yet gorgeous woman he spewing! Twins??? Yeah right! Did she think he was a moron? He needs this bounty to fulfill a promise to a friend and he is not letting some floozy stripper get the best of him, even though she makes his blood boil...and skin hot...he won't let her! He can't let her, it will make him careless and he truly needed this money! Problems begin to mount as someone is on their tail and that someone wants Kaylee dead. Sam can't believe his luck! Through tons of tricks she pulls to get away and this 'someone' trying to get her, am is at the end of his rope! To make things really bad is when Sam starts to realize that Kaylee is not what she appears to be afterall...is she really a twin? He has no time to ponder this as the fireworks begin to take hold between them and they are running for their lives!Funny moments that will have you laughing out loud and sweet ones that will make you smile.

I found it to be fast-paced, sexy, and hilarious. I liked the hero and heroine, and enjoyed the side plot. The dialogue was great. However, the book has very direct language - not obscene or vulgar, just direct. So those of you who like a softer read can consider yourself warned. The rest of us can sit back and enjoy this sexy, funny romance."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"A light, fun romance with some sizzling hot chemistry. Baby, I'm Yours takes the old good twin, bad twin story, but the author twists this stereotype enough to make the characters her own. Sure it's about the \\"good\\" twin awakening to and enjoying her more naughty side, and the \\"bad\\" twin learning to use her brains and be a bit more responsible - but at the same time the book is very tongue in cheek about these clich&eacute;s, and manages to make them heartfelt and, above all, entertaining. The \\"bad\\" twin, Kaylee, who's a show girl, gets into a spot of trouble when she overhears her boss plotting the murder of another show girl. Kaylee skips town before the bad guys can silence her as well and heads where she always goes when she's in trouble - to her sister Catherine in Seattle. Unfortunately, in escaping her boss and leaving Miami, Kaylee is also skipping bail. (She had gotten caught with a stolen car that she didn't know was stolen.) Catherine is the proper, repressed, responsible one who's always cleaned up after Kaylee's many messes. At the same time, she's not a complete martyr, for she knows she's a bit of doormat and is frustrated with herself and her sister for the way things are.The fun starts when the bounty hunter, Sam McKade, who's after Kaylee to get the reward for returning her to Miami, mistakes Catherine for Kaylee. He doesn't believe a word Catherine says and tries to get her back to Miami. Catherine, for her part, is not about to go quietly. And so begins a road trip that's a fun, often funny romp of a romance as Catherine and Sam fight, test, and outmaneuver each other - all the while racketing the sexual tension sky high. I love the interactions between these two. Kaylee is smart and, as she loosens up, gives as good as she gets. Sam is overbearing, rough around the edges, and tries to carry the world on his shoulders. My only qualm is the way in which he comes to realize Catherine is who she says she is. Besides that, the thing I like best about the book is that it didn't seem to take itself too seriously. The hit man that comes after Catherine (thinking she's Kaylee) isn't the most evil, most powerful, most dangerous henchman to ever imperil the lives of his victims. Sam boarders on angst melodrama territory, but Catherine doesn't let him wallow and calls him on his stupidity. Everyone gets their ego punctured in this book through good humored parody and/or the comedy of errors that is the plot. This story has been told before, has probably been told since it came out, but the author manages to make it seem relatively fresh, while the emotions of the characters remain real and compelling. I liked how everything was resolved in the end, and I felt good after reading it, so it gets a passing grade from me."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I really like Susan Andersen as an author. She writes really great characters and there is always lots of humor. It's a quick read and really enjoyable. I love that the heroine is curvy and sexy.

It starts off with a bang and never slows down. I was also a huge fan of the hero. Just tough enough, but not so much that he's a ridiculous jerk the entire way through.I didn't give it five stars, mostly because I wasn't really wow-ed by the dialogue. It fell flat a couple of times because it didn't quite reflect the chemistry that the characters had. Also, the heroine fell just a bit flat in my mind. She seemed to change personalities every other chapter, and I couldn't get a read on her enough to really relate.Still, for a fun read with a fast-paced plot, this one won't let you down!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Catherine McPherson has spent her life trying to be everything her twin sister was not...flamboyant, spontaneous, and fun. After growing up believing that having a stacked body was a sin, Catherine did everything she could to hide it. When bounty hunter, Sam McKade mistakes her for her twin, Kaylee, Catherine is at first shocked...then she is furious. While she may play down her looks, no one expects her to think as fast on her feet as she does.Sam McKade just wants to collect the bounty on Kaylee McPherson. The money he gets from this job will put him over the top for the fishing lodge that he wants to buy for his best friend. He can't help the instant attraction that he feels for her though. 'Red' as he calls her, is different than he expected. He expected a brainless bimbo, but he got one smart woman. The things that she does to slow their trip from Seattle to Miami astound him afterall, she's only a showgirl.The chemistry between Sam and Cat is red hot. In her normal storyline, Andersen injects a ton of humor into her suspenseful plot. You will crack up when reading about 'Chains'. Catherine is a great heroine who is self confident about herself and learns to be comfortable in her body. Sam is just the kind of hero the reader loves, dark and brooding, a man that just oozes sex appeal.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I found this book absolutely halarious!

Definitely a keeper!!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Susan Anderson does it again! This book was a great read. You never know what twist it going to happen next. Amazing how 2 identical people can be soooooo different!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"The story kept my interest throughout. It was funny and sensual. I thought the dialogue was ridiculous while they were getting out of the car that went off the road. Other that than, I loved it!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I really liked this book. It was witty, fast paced and the sex was fun. I don't like romances, but this one might change my mind. Great summer read."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This is an easy and quick read. I recommend it to anyone with a little spare time who's in the mood to read a good book. Good storyline (even if it seems a little unbelievable!)"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This isn't your typical romance! Many people have been raving about this author, but it took me a while to read her. I was pleasantly surprised at Baby, I'm Yours. While the plot can venture into silliness and the characters aren't very realistic, this is a fun book to read.The highlight comes from our heroine, Catherine, who is the source of most of the wit. She isn't the average heroine. Unlike many dimwitted heroines, Catherine is smart and clever. Instead of getting flustered, she returns with a sharp retort. For me, the heroine makes or breaks a book--in this case, she made an otherwise flawed book great to read."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Normally covers like the one on this book turn me off from even glancing at the synopsis on the back. However, something urged me to pick this one up, and I'm glad I did. It was clearly a lighthearted and playful romp across America with a clever redhead and a stubborn bounty hunter. Some readers have compared Baby, I'm Yours to works by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, while others have screamed that this is an outrage. Elements of humor are present in both of them, but Andersen does not tickle the reader's funny bone with outrageous Texans and athletes like Phillips. Andersen's humor is a great deal more situational. Nevertheless, the chemistry between Catherine &quot;Red&quot; MacPherson and Sam McKade is yummy and enjoyable. I'm not even going to bother worrying about the cover of her next novel before picking it up."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I was delighted to find another author. She is great fun to read.I found that I enjoyed' Baby I'm yours', somewhat better than 'Be My Baby'.Altho it was good also.The characters Sam and Cat,were a hoot.Made me laugh outloud a few times.Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Sam is a bounty hunter who is tired of the job and fools that he has to chase down. Hopefully this will be his last bounty and then he can move on and do what he wants kindof.Catherine is a twin that is as different from her sister as she can be. Kaylee is all flash and big hair and big big problems. Catherine is a teacher for the deaf and wears cloths that hide everything she can. Kaylee is in trouble. She has heard a contract being taken out on someone, plus there is the added fact that she has been arrested for car theft (thats another story within the story) hence the bounty, she has skipped bailto go to her sister Catherine.In the end Sam has taken the wrong sister and hits the road that will not be smooth! With typical humor and romance Susan Andersen has written another fun story that is both touching and amusing."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Bounty hunter Sam Mckade spots Kaylee MacPherson jumping bail as the beautiful woman leaves Miami aboard a plane to Seattle. Sam realizes that the recovery fee will provide him a down payment on some land he wants to buy. He follows her to Seattle where he promptly handcuffs her to take back by Greyhound) the runaway. However, the woman insists that she is a local schoolteacher named Catherine, Kaylee's twin. Sam refuses to believe the far fetched tale.On the way back to Miami, Sam is surprised by \\"Kaylee's\\" intelligence and Catherine is shocked by his tenderness. The real Kaylee knows that she has inadvertently left her sibling in a life threatening situation because her former employer Hector Sanchez will do anything to make sure that she does not reveal his secrets. She and her boyfriend must rescue her sister, who has fallen in love with her abductor, before any harm occurs to Catherine.Think IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and add on top of that a criminal element and the reader has the romantic comedy/suspense, BABY, I'M YOURS. The novel is a brilliantly written combination of those thirties madcap comedies and the nineties sensual sexuality. The charming characters are all fun to read about as Susan Anderson has written on of the best comical contemporary romances of the year.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"i will read this again and again - also have a paperback copy on my bookshelf at home - -"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"A clever sequence of love story mingled with action to drive the budding romance. Good line of ever-present humor and plausible story lines."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"It was ok. A little dry and slow. It kept my attention just enough to get me through the book."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I bought her new novel before receiving BIY (ok, stupid me) and then when I read it, I found myself really hoping she would take more care to develop her newer characters. Actually, I thought BIY was a lot like Rachel Gibson's books, given that the hero is really one tough SOB with a really hard head, not even a sliver of knowledge in female psychology and generally dedicated to believing women were created to be helped and ordered around by men. Her heroine, Catherine, starts out a lot similar to Ms Gibson's heroines, an independant woman fully capable of leading a productive life alone, but searching for the man who'll make it more fun. Very well, but why do I get the feeling that what they all end up doing is falling for Big Daddy and just passing on responsability for their lives on to the prehistoric version of a male? Sorry, but I don't much like heros whose only weakness seems to be the fact that he can't immediately seduce the heroine, otherwise thinking he's God's gift. If all these authors (Ms Andersen and Ms Gibson) are inspired by Ms Phillips, then all I can say is: do some research by reading her books because if there is an author in romance who credibly develops relationships as well as delivering good characters, it's SEP. Still hoping to be pleasantly surprised by &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and I'll stay in touch..."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This was great. At first I was a bit unsure the first chapter seemed to not grab my attention as quickly as I'd hoped but I plugged away and was definitely not disappointed. A perfect summer read and being in the last few weeks of pregnancy the romance and hot details are keeping me going. I just finished another Andersen book and am on my way to getting the rest."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I read this book on my vacation and it was the *perfect* choice! Unrealistic, of course, but once the disbelief was suspended, it charmed my socks off. The scenes where the heroine schemes to get them tossed off the bus they were traveling on were priceless, as is the scene where the hero finally begins to realize he snatched the wrong twin...you'll never guess what tips him off! Get it, read it, enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I am truly hooked on this author. This book was GREAT. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. The twin story line was hysterical! I was wondering how long it was going to take for Sam to finally realize that he had the WRONG girl. I am on my way to the library to see if they have any more of her books. She reminds me a lot of Susan Elizabeth Phillips. The style is so similiar that I could swear that they are the same person. Do you think they at least know each other?"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"As a previous reviewer pointed out, something WAS missing in this book and I think I found it. Integrity. The frustration you feel on behalf of the lead Kaylie is every woman's nightmare of feeling trapped and helpless in a situation you have no control over. She is accosted in her own home by the zealous bounty hunter Sam McKade, mistaken to be her twin sister, molested when she claims she is NOT the one, and then dragged across the country against her will. The fact that Sam is supposed to be a professional only makes Kaylie's plight worse in that he doesn't do anything conclusive to find out if she's really who she says she is. Read the blurb and take the book as you will. Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Truly, this book was a total waste of time. I saw a couple of good reviews on Amazon and decided to try this author, because somebody compared her to Susan Elizabeth Phillips, who is a far better author by the way. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. The storyline, which could have been played up more, was insipid. And the strangest characters kept running across the tattered tapestry of a weak plot distracing you further. If that doesn't get you, maybe the tone of this story will do it. Some said it was sassy, I say it is silly and base. Find a better romance writer, some suggestions include Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Linda Howard, Judith Mcnaught. This is my last book by this lady."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Catherine is a shy and prim teacher who hides her shapely figure under ill-fitting garments. Her life is turned upside down when she is mistaken for her felonious show-girl twin sister Kaylee by Sam, a brawny bounty hunter trying to bring her back to face justice. This assignment will be the feather in his cap that will allow him to get that fishing shack he has wanted so long...In a twist similar to the movie Midnight Run, Catherine does everything that she can think of to slow them down since he won't believe he has the wrong gal. Sam is not sure what to make of the resourceful showgirl - she is much brainier that he anticipated. And he is fighting a beast of an attraction for her.This is an early Andersen novel (1990's), so her style is not as refined as her more recent novels (or even her early suspense novels which are awesome). The dialog is pretty stale, and despite steaming up the pages, the couple seems ill-suited, making their coupling hard to fathom or the storyline in general hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I guess everyone has his/her own taste, but I don't understand anyone giving this book a negative review! It was a fast, fun read with witty dialogue and major heat between the two main characters. I found it to be innovative and touching. I contacted the author to tell her how much I've enjoyed her writing and was delighted to receive a quick response. She was very pleasant and funny and gracious. Keep 'em coming, Susan!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Curvy and beautiful, Catherine MacPherson has always hidden her assets under loose, plain clothing. She's quick, intelligent, stable, dependable and responsible. Her twin sister, Kaylee, who works as a showgirl in Miami, has always been her polar opposite. Kaylee is flashy, flamboyant, impulsive, and always getting herself into trouble. When Kaylee travels across country to Seattle and shows up on Catherine's doorstep unexpectedly, Catherine smells trouble. It seems Kaylee has skipped bail after being arrested for something she didn't do, not to mention she overheard her boss hiring a hit man to eliminate his girlfriend. So not only is the hit man after her, but also bounty hunter, Sam McKade.Sam needs to bring Kaylee back so he'll finally have enough money to buy that fishing lodge for him and his friend. After following Kaylee to Seattle, he snatches her from her sister's home while trying to make a getaway. This infuriating woman insists she not Kaylee, but her twin sister, Catherine. He's heard that one before and he's not buying it.However, it really is Catherine, and she'll do anything she can to delay their progress back to Miami. Along the way, Sam starts considering the possibility he has the wrong sister, because she's a lot smarter, and not nearly as self-centered as he imagined. But more importantly, it's getting increasingly difficult to be professional, and to keep his hands to himself. What will happen when he finds out the truth of her identity, and they finally give in to their mutual attraction?This was my first Susan Anderson read, and I had relatively high expectations because of the rave reviews of this book on Amazon. And I also found it on someone's listmania list as a favorite. Well, I was gravely disappointed, and only made it through chapter eight before I gave up. There just wasn't much to like about this book. The characters were basically one-dimensional, the writing was awkward, and the clich&eacute;d story just couldn't hold my attention. I really disliked Catherine's sister, Kaylee, because not only did she meet all specifications for the showgirl stereotype (how boring is that?), but also she was willing to hide and just watch her sister suffer the consequences of her wrongdoing. Then we have the hit man whose name is Jimmie Chains (oh please, how original).I quickly skimmed through the remainder of the book, and overall I can only find two positive things about this novel. It did have a funny moment here and there, when I wasn't rolling my eyes in exasperation, and the couple of love scenes I read were quite erotic. Unfortunately, that certainly isn't enough to torture myself by reading all three hundred seventy-five pages. For a good contemporary romance, try Jennifer Crusie, Susan Elizabeth Phillips or Rachel Gibson. I already own another book by Ms. Anderson, and at this point I'm unsure if I'll read it."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I'm not very demanding of my books. I just want a fun story with fun characters. This book failed to deliver either. The characters stuck to every stereotype. The actions and reactions were unbelievable. My first and last Susan Andersen book."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Between this book and &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, Andersen has gone on my automatic buy list. There are very few writers who can pen a hero as well as Andersen. In fact, only Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Linda Howard come to mind.I was shocked to see some of the bad reviews this book took on this site. &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; is a fresh, innovative, sexy, hilarious, light-hearted romantic comedy. If you like to laugh, and if you enjoy reading about feisty, quirky heroines who bring strong, primal males to heel, then this is the book to purchase.There's nothing quite as nice for a reading enthusiast as finding an author who can make you smile."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I've never read anything by Susan Anderson before, but if &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; is an indicator of how she writes, I'll be snapping up all of her books without a second thought. I especially like the cover art on her books. They are snappy and sharp and suit her writing style. I like how Anderson situates normal people like Catherine MacPherson and Sam McKade into her novels and bases her story not on an overly fantastic plot, but more a journey of two people who fall in love. I find that a lot of romance novels get caught up in the setting, regency England, for example and the history of the period and completely lose the characters. Without giving away too much of the novel, this is a writer not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This was my very first Susan Anderson novel and I was REALLY impressed. This book was so easy to read, so enjoyable. The main character is Catherine MacPherson, who is mistaken for her twin sister Kaylee. Kaylee has skipped bail, and Sam McCade is the penny pinching bail enforcer (aka &quot;bail boy&quot; or &quot;bounty hunter&quot;) who has come to claim her. Sam takes Catherine on a wild and sometimes dangerous but always hilarious journey from Seattle to Miami. At first, Catherine is outraged and does everything she can to foil Sam's mission, but as feelings grow between her and Sam she finds a different part of herself - the spontaneous and carefree side of her personality that she has kept inside until now. Meanwhile, her twin sister Kaylee, who is the exact opposite, is finding the part of herself which is honorable and sensible.Wow, the romance and the hot sex scenes alone make this a book you just can't put down. The subplots and the humor make it irresistable. Kaylee's character kind of annoyed me at first, but then I found myself grudgingly liking her. My favorite line is in the epilogue where Kaylee is comparing men to well laid kitchen floors .... Loved it! I would definitely recommend this book, and I can't wait to read more by Susan Anderson."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"While &quot;Baby, I'm Yours&quot; is entertaining enough to hold a reader's attention, there are some passages that appear to have been constructed using a &quot;Guide for Writing Romance&quot;. It is absurd for the author to expect us to believe that when a man enters a woman's home and threatens her with a gun, she's going to notice &quot;his strength&quot;, yet &quot;Baby, I'm Yours&quot; is full of scenarios in which Catherine, the heroine, notices Sam's physical attributes and inner appeal when she would really be trying to escape his clutches. Yes, this is a romance novel. Yes, we expect conflict and tension between our couple. But in this book, the attraction these two characters feel for one another pops up in places where it should not, giving the book a contrived sense about it. Also, at one point, Catherine has a chance to flee from Sam and just like they must teach in Romance 101 classes, she becomes a silly female and remains stuck in her predicament. The worst we have to face is Catherine's ludicrous request that Sam shoot a spider with the little bit of ammunition they have. Again, we are to find it &quot;precious&quot; that she wants protection from a spider in any old, silly, aren't-I-just-vulnerable?, female way she can get it. There is no depth of character, Sam is an unattractive, bratty male, and her subplots (Kaylee and Bobby; Gary back in Florida) are so much better-woven than the main plot, that one is left starving for those characters to creep back up and take over from the boredom that Catherine and Sam provide. In short, the story is too skeletal: The author hits on all of the Romance 101 keys but leaves us wanting a story we can sink our teeth into."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I bought &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; after reading &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; and I was a little disappointed.There are some cute situations in BIY, and I like it that Catherine's rotten sister eventually found a few redeeming qualities, but I had a hard time sympathizing with a twin who would knowingly let her sister take the fall for a crime.The &quot;hero&quot; is a jerk and a half, and it's difficult to believe the two will live happily ever after in a world full of other opportunities.I think the whole sign-language-thing could have been developed better, and it came off looking like a device instead of a bonafide plot twist.Regardless, it was interesting to see how Ms. Andersen has grown in writing talent since BIY, and I look forward to reading her next book."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"If you are looking for a very lighthearted read, that you can read in one sitting, than this is your novel. Catherine has a twin sister whose middle name is trouble. Catherine's twin shows up at her home, and the very next day Catherine is dragged from her house by Sam McKade, a bounty hunter on the lookout for her twin. Sam does not believe that he has the wrong girl. There is no way that there are two identical long legged red heads. This is pretty much a road trip story as Sam fights his attraction for his prisoner while returning her to town to face her charges. Now throw into the mix the local mob who wants her sister dead, and you have a very cute story."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"A sexy, funny and fun romp. Bounty hunter nabs the wrong twin and they're off on a wild journey. This was my first Susan Andersen book and convinced me to by ALL her books. Great fun!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This book was a fun read with a lot of romantic adventure. However, there seemed to be something missing. The characters were wonderful, and if it was not for their fire and spirit, this book would not have been as enjoyable. Maybe it was the lack of reality that got me hesitating on mores stars for this book, I do not know. There was just something missing. The main characters were fabulous. The book was about a bounty hunter that &quot;catches&quot; the wrong twin. Though she tries to explain to him who she really is, he dismisses it. The book is basically about their love hate relationship as they run into many different hardships and challenges. Meanwhile, her sister and her sister's boyfriend are out trying to rescue her from the bounty hunter. Every character in this book is charming and spirited and that is good enough reason to read it. I really LOVED 'Be My Baby' but this book would be a good novel with a laugh or two if you are in the mood for some crazy twists and turns and some outrageous chracters."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Kaylee MacPherson's flight just pulled away from the gate and bounty hunter Sam McKade just missed nabbing the bail jumper. Well, he would get a flight out of Miami and track her down to Seattle. She wouldn't get away from him. This job was too important. The bounty on her bond would put him over the top for the last of the financing he needed for the fishing lodge. Purchasing a ticket to Seattle would blow his budget but he would just have to economize on the trip back.After tracking her to a home in Seattle, and crashing through the front door, he was just in time to see her trying to leave through the bathroom window. After restraining her attempt to leave, the woman identified herself as Catherine MacPherson, Kaylee's identical twin! Right, like Sam would fall for that line!And this is where the fun begins! The trip back to Miami is by bus. Catherine tries her best to convince Sam that she is a twin but Sam won't buy it. She looks exactly like the woman he is after and her identifying mark (a tatoo--I won't tell you where it's located) identifies her as Kaylee.This is a very enjoyable read. Sam and Cat are great together and the secondary characters are the best I've come across in a long time. Although I enjoy all of Susan's books, I have to say this is my favorite with &quot;Be My Baby&quot; a close second. If you are looking for something just a little different from the average romance read, try this one."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This book is an easy to read contemporary romance that I found to be fast-paced.

I can not respect any man who's a cop wanna-be, sorry. He's obtuse (won't listen to heroine explain he's got the wrong girl), cheap, calls his best friend Gare (short for Gary). I mean what man would call Gary Gare (a woman might).We read romance novels to escape. I just wanted to escape from this hero. My skin was crawling by the time I finished this book.In fact, I am done with this author, I bought a whole bunch of her books because of all the glowing reviews, but I just can't take it anymore. This was her third book I read and I was not crazy about the first two, either, but this book does it for me. Fini."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I kept reading this book against my better judgement. While it moved fast, I did not find the characters appealing or sensitive. In fact, they seemed cheap and certainly went well with the venues of the story. This book may appeal to those who like the tabloid talk shows, but to the readers who enjoy the gentile and refined characters of the more classy romances, this book is NOT for you."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I found the book to be totally entertaining, an easy read. ..nothing deep. Parts were so funny I couldn't stop laughing/ a neat book! If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A Christmas gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This fun read had everything needed to make it a good romance. The hero and heroine were both very likable characters with a lot of fun banter. I liked the premise of the story; having the twin sister mistakenly rounded up by a bounty hunter was a fun and entertaining plot. The story had the right mixture of action,enjoyable dialog and romance to make me a new fan of this author. This was only the second book I've read by her but will certainly read more. The side plot with the twin sister was also a fun and enjoyable addition."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This is another one of my favorite genres. I loved how the relationship between the main couple developed throughout the story. I laughed out loud at their fights and their schemes. The other characters were hilarious as well and each brought something to the story to make it whole. It was a light, funny, everyday read for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I liked the story well enough. It is a cliche read, but that's what I go for when I just want some light afternoon reading. Some annoyances for me were the strange British slang speech the author used for the characters even though she is a native of the Pacific NW and her characters are American. Words such as loo, bugger all, and a few various others really annoyed me because, to my knowledge, most people born and raised in the US don't use those words ... or do they in the Pacific NW? I've never been there, so maybe she's actually teaching me something about the way people talk there. For the moment, I'm confused. Dialect is important to me as a reader and so it was a hard thing to accept; I tripped over these strange slang words every time. Otherwise, I think the story is fine. Not deep at all and I enjoyed the way she made some events occur. Definitely not reality based as far as character reactions, but then again, I don't always want that in a book."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"Anderson is an auto buy for me.

I really couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I can comfortably give this book a fat &quot;B&quot;. I bought the paperback for my mother because it was a topselling paperback romance novel in 1999 and she liked those types of books. I read it because I wanted to cling to a story that I knew she was recently close to. Besides, my mother actually told me she really enjoyed the book. The book does flow like one of those TV &quot;Movies of the Week&quot;. I enjoyed the 'fun of it' even if it was somewhat predictable at times. I learned how a simple story of dislike that turned into love could and would make a 'hopeless romantic' (like my mom) swoon with happiness. One of my favorite lines in the book was: Mom, it's a crying shame you're no longer with us, Sam thought grimly, doing his best to ignore his sulky, curvaceous passenger and focusing instead on the heavy downtown traffic. You woul've just loved the hell outta this."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I loved this book. I read romance novels to escape the real world and this was just the book. The characters were unique and the dialogue hysterical. The situations were not realistic but they were fun! This is the best book so far by Susan Anderson and I look forward to more!"},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"I loved this book. It was fast paced, funny and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Baby, I'm Yours","review":"This is Ms. Andersen at her finest. When I start one of her books, I do not plan on doing anything else until I am finished. Catherine and Sam got me kicked out of my bed with their antics. I was laughing so hard, I was shaking the whole bed. My husband turned over and gave me the evil eye and advised me that the book had to go or I did. Ok, so I did, right on the couch, finishing the book of course. Now, if we could just get Ms. Andersen to write double time. This is a great first time reader romance!!!"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"If you enjoy politics, American history, and movies, check out this read. What makes America great? Chris Matthews tells us. From the infinitely sagacious leadership of George Washington to the tantalizing, yet almost palpable, American dream symbolized by Jay Gatsby to the idealistic moral indignation of Jefferson Smith, Matthews smoothly runs the gamut of the great American landscape. Matthews exalts such seemingly common men as Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Harry Truman who exhibited, in what was no accident, truly uncommon leadership.Lincoln was said to have rebuked those who complained of Grant's heavy alcohol consumption. Find out what he drinks and give it to the other generals, the president told them. &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;Truman, sworn in to office as Vice President just 3 months prior to assuming the Presidency, was, as Matthews states, &quot;a regular fellow who just as easily could be standing behind the counter when you went to buy a new pair of socks,&quot; became an extraordinary leader in a time of extraordinary crisis. Truman, along with Lincoln, had the guts to do what he thought was right. In using the atom bomb to end WWII Truman, in effect, avoided a million American casualties in an ensuing invasion. The result was a dismal 23% approval rating when he left office. As Matthews so aptly states, &quot;Tough decisions don't always make friends.&quot; History, however, would be a better judge; Truman now is rightfully revered as one of the greatest Presidents of the 20th century. Matthews, being intellectually honest, honors the maverick leadership of John McCain and the eternal optimism of Ronald Reagan as well. Overall, a fun and stimulating read that I recommend you check out."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"In startling contrast with his MSNBC show \\"Hardball,\\" Chris Matthews has composed a moving reflection about America. Whether you are a \\"Hardball\\" fan or critic, you will find this book both insightful and moving. Matthews does not redefine America but instead reawakens us to the notions that make America such a grand nation.In AMERICAN, Matthews proposes \\"Ten Grand American Notions:\\" a self-made country, the constant rebel, the reluctant warrior, the common man, the lone hero, the underdog, pioneers, action, optimism and American exceptionalism. Each notion is accompanied by stories of American legends that personify it. The \\"characters\\" of the book are both fictional and real-life heroes. Whether speaking of Casablanca's Ricky or former President John F. Kennedy, Matthews captivates his audience with fascinating quips, motivating quotes and heartfelt memoirs.Perhaps the greatest aspect of this book is its timeliness. In a time of international turmoil and political conflict, AMERICAN reminds us of what our nation was founded on, what it has endured, what it is we are fighting to defend. Void of personal bias and political preferences, Matthews delivers an objective view of our country's history. He hails the good --- George Washington's perseverance during the Revolutionary War, the heroic firefighters of September 11 --- without forgetting to condemn the evils of corrupt politics and slavery.AMERICAN is written in a conversational style not often seen in history texts. Rather than continuous narrative, Matthews prefers to tell the story through short glimpses of the past. Appropriate pictures are interspersed among the pages, breaking the chapters into more readable portions.The only downfall of the book is that by the last few chapters the endless stories and quotes become tiresome and begin to lack life, which left me wishing for some of Matthews' trademark witticism. Overall, however, this is a great piece of work that every American should read.--- Reviewed by Melissa Brown"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Apparently, All of the reviewers bashing this book and Chris Matthews in general are just bitter because he talks fast, or is more intelligent than they are. The fact is, if you watch him interview other people, or being interviewed himself, his knowledge of history is such that he put the toughest of guests on the spot, and frankly is one of the more intelligent guys on TV. I find him, and his book interesting for that very reason. Like few others I have ever watched, or read, he has endless anecdotal historical tidbits that are absolutely relevent to the discussion at hand, and lead to some thought provoking summations. So, with that said, I'd recommend the book."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Hi! This book had potential apart from the... title, and so could have been better. The annoying thing about books like these is when they get a little bit too excited in their drum-beating and flag-waving. The principles that the book celebrates are real and important. But one attitude displayed prominently in is the conceit of falling into the trap of thinking we are the only democratic or free nation in the world. Other very successful democracies also uphold and illustrate important values and democratic and egalitarian ideals.Read books like this, but read them with an open and enquiring mind, and try not to be isolationist (or elitist) when you celebrate our American conceptions of democracy - otherwise you are in danger of betraying those very values!"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"The original American experiment with democracy was a brave and intrepid one, with amazing results. The spirit of the pioneering Moms and Dads and later waves of immigrants and the pragmatic values they contributed have built a great nation over the past several hundred years. Cataloguing these values is an important project.Sadly this book disappoints. It is overly biased and provides an uncrtical and overly romanticised version of America that is insular, proud and superior - and that is not a very American or democratic message at all!!I do not recommend this book to people trying to get in touch with their individual American spirit."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Boring, trite, rushed. These talking heads just seem to churn out books for the payday, but there's no substance behind it. This book was awful. It was so bad I actually got angry. I feel ripped-off."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"ISBN 0743240863 - Manufactured in the United States of America (and oh boy was that good to find in this book, of all my recent reads!). I want to love this book because it's about America, a country that I love, and Americans, a people that I... think highly of, in general. But LOVE just isn't happening with this book. I'm in like with it, though.Chris Matthews lays out a very loving, inspirational and wholly positive view of America and Americans, with \\"Ten Grand American Notions\\". These include our love of, and desire to be, \\"The Reluctant Warrior\\" and the way we love to cheer for \\"The Underdog\\". Using short vignettes about famous figures, both historical and modern, and a little pop culture, by introducing some of America's best loved movies, Matthews makes his case well.The book is a tough one for me, so I'll rattle off the flaws first. It seems obvious, given the publication date, that this book was sped to press in response to September 11, 2001. While Chris is not, by any means, the only person to rush to put out a \\"Yay, America!\\" book after the attacks, I can't help feeling a bit of distaste whenever I come across one, by anyone. In addition, the rush becomes more obvious when you take the time to read, something the editor apparently couldn't manage to do. Typos abound, some of them possibly due to the use of a spellcheck program, which allowed \\"In short, he was playing for keeps.\\" to become \\"In shot, he was playing for keeps.\\", among other stupid, preventable errors. (another, which I found hilarious but I've been told may be \\"accurate\\", was regarding the Bush v Gore election, where Matthews asks \\"So why didn't he [Gore] eat Bush's lunch?\\" In my neck of the woods, that would be \\"why didn't he eat Bush for lunch?\\")On the positive side, there's nothing here that is partisan. Matthews, generally a conservative Democrat, keeps his modern politics out of it and chooses politically diverse people to represent his \\"notions\\". Particularly well written, to my surprise, was the section regarding Bush's coming into his own as a president in the days after the attacks. Tomorrow, Chris will wake up a Democrat, but for the duration of this book, he's just an American who loves his country and loves the history of it, too. The vignettes he chose are not presented as events that shaped America, they're told to flesh out the list of very American notions he offers. This means that some people appear in several chapters, as they personify more than one American character type. George Washington, John McCain, Oprah Winfrey, Rocky Balboa... the list is varied, but they all have things in common, one above all: they're Americans.Worth perusing for the reminder that, under everything else, we're all Americans and we all love our country. Maybe not worth a spot on the keeper shelf, though.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Though I know who Chris Matthews is and I've watched a few clips of HARDBALL, I've never actually watched HARBALL or THE CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOW on tv. From what I've gathered from some political junkies I know, Chris Matthew's shows have gone downhill in recent years. I guess his shows use to at least appear to be more in the center, but in the past few years have seemed to have skewered to the left.None of that really matters when reading AMERICAN: BEYOND OUR GRANDEST NOTIONS. I picked up the book because I like to read at least one or two good books a year that espouses American virtues. My mistake was in assuming that this was a good book.The writing is terrible. I've taught high school students and some of my students can write better. There are quite a few of simple sentences. That can be a good thing. However, the book uses lots and lots and lots of simple students to keep saying the same thing over and over and over and without any real style that gets boring real quick. The actual writing in the book is about only 200 pages long, but the entire book should have been condensed into about 75-100 pages. Not only that, but the book is really just a rambling list of things that Chris likes and why we should like them, too. There's very little coherence, no flow, and hardly any structure.Unless you're a major fan of Chris Matthews, I can't recommend this book Instead, go read the actual Constitution, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, SACRED FIRE, etc. You'll learn more from those than you will from AMERICAN: BEYOND OUR GRANDEST NOTION and might actually be challenged."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I enjoy Hardball, and I love The Chris Matthews Show. Here is his quirky, funny, genuine, and insightful crystallization of what makes an American an American. Part history (which we should all know but don't), part anecdotal, part political gospel, part love of country, you want to read it all over again when you're done just to feel that good again...a great reminder of what makes us tick and how we got this way. Not high literary style, his vast experience makes up for it. I would imagine a newly naturalized citizen would read this book and say, \\"Oh, now I really get it!\\" How fine would that be. Chris may not be everyone's cut of tea, although he happens to be mine, but he's the genuine article...a modern-day patriot from Philly. Required reading for every American."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I surprised myself by purchasing the audio version of this book even though I find Matthews annoying and counter to my ideology. I should mention I paid very little for a used copy on this very site so the risk was minimal.The audio was enjoyable and devoid of obvious spin. As a history junkie the material presented held my attention. However,I did take issue with the organization of the material presented as the author jumped back and forth several times in the book. He would cover a topic, depart from it, only to return later with another point or a repeat of the same material presented earlier. I found myself checking the CD player in my car to make sure I had not hit the reverse button in error."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I am a big fan of Matthews' television show \\"Hardball.\\" He asks tough questions of all his guests and tries to pry the truth out of them. He also is balanced in his reporting as his guests span the entire political spectrum. In this book he gives a lesson on the history of the United States that is heavy on optimism and laudatory and light on serious criticism. He mentions the destruction of the Native American culture and the legacy of slavery, but only to say that they are negative aspects of the past that the nation must simply live with.He briefly describes the lives and attitudes of several major figures, nearly all presidents. He explains how Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan were extremely optimistic, which was the source of much of their success and popularity as presidents. Quite correctly, he points out that Abraham Lincoln was the most articulate president, it is hard to fathom how anyone could improve on his Gettysburg Address. The presidency of Andrew Jackson marked a major transition. Before he was elected, all presidents were members of the Eastern elite. However, he was from the west, a self-made man who defined populism.I enjoyed reading this book, even though Matthews occasionally overstates some of the aspects of American history and society. This is not a history lesson, it is a set of short stories about what the American ideal is as seen through the eyes of Matthews. If you keep that in mind, you can get a great deal of joy out of it."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"What could I expect from the host of a cable tv show who spends the bulk of his time shouting over his guests rather than engaging in any kind of meaningful dialogue. There's little of interest here: a re-warming of Matthew's rather tepid intellectual history of the American way. The Gore &quot;analysis&quot; is incredibly insipid and I have no love for Al Gore. Avoid this at all costs. It's a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"This is a delightful read and has a lot of very interesting information about some well known American icons.The writing style is smooth and fluid and if you are a serious reader you can probably get through it in a day or two.

I consider this book a total waste of money!!He pulls books, movies, some extremely biased and simplified American \\"history\\", and certain American \\"heroes\\" from his own past and presents them as having been the KEY factors in forming what we consider to be the \\"American psyche\\".What amazed me is all that he left out -- the many historical events that truly shaped America. If Matthews has any in-depth knowledge of American history, he failed to reveal it here. Further, his simplification of the forming of the \\"American psyche\\" is laughable.Although 200+ pages in length, the book is an easy one-sitting read -- I read it all last night. Why? The pages are small in size and the print is large and widely spaced. It could have fit into a 50 page book of normal size and print.In short, don't waste your money."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Did Chris M. need money for purchase of Christmas presents????One would expect Chrisy to posess a more meaningful depth of knowledge regarding American historical notions.Recommended reading for Chrisy is &quot;A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN&quot; from which he may gain a &quot;notion&quot; about American notions."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"If you are looking for an American History lesson, look somewhere else. This book has GREAT entertainment value. It shows American values by the media we produce. What a great insight on the American way of life.

Americans would have it no other way. &quot;War and Peace&quot; it ain't!"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I enjoyed hearing Matthews on the G. Gordon Liddy show discuss this book so much that I bought it. Well, I read Stephen Ambrose's final book just before this one and found Matthews' somewhat lacking. The two books are essentially the same in their goals, short essays on important highlights in American History. Some of the same topics are covered in both books. Ambrose just did a MUCH BETTER job. Ambrose was a skilled writer and Historian by trade, Matthews is a gifted gabber. So my suggestion is to listen to Matthews on Audio, but buy Ambrose's &quot;To America: Personal Reflections of An Historian&quot;."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"What makes America the greatest country and Americans the greatest people? Chris Matthews of Hardball fame takes those attributes and concepts of Americans from Abraham Lincoln to Jerrerson Smith (of Mr smith goes to Washington movie). There are real life people and fictional characters like Bogie's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. What makes America what it is? and how are we unique in the world? In this compelling and thought provoking story Chris Matthews tells us about ourselves. In this world particularily since 9-11, the warm feelings of Patriotism are appreciated. If I said this was a history lesson, perhaps a lot of people would be turned off. but this book is better than that its a history books that's not dull or boring and gives us, dare I say, a historical prespective without being the dull and boring &quot;H&quot; word."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"As everyone reading this probably knows, Chris Matthews is the host of MSNBC's prime time political talk show Hardball. Matthews represents the moderate left within the spectrum of the corporate media's permissible opinion, and is known by Beltway buffs to be a tough yet fair interviewer. Recently, Matthews has been among the most vocal skeptics within the cable news universe of the impending war on Iraq. I was therefore disappointed by Matthews new book, \\"American: Beyond Our Grandest Notions\\" as it is filled with the type of sub-intellectual flag waiving one would expect from Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh. Take for example his chapter on \\"the reluctant warrior.\\" Matthews argues, \\"If you're an American, your favorite movie is probably Casablanca\\" which somehow demonstrates that \\"Americans\\" identify with Rick, the \\"slow to anger\\" hero of the classic 1940's film. Like Rick, \\"Americans\\" are isolationists - unless our \\"ideals. . .love. . .and country are on the line.\\" As evidence Matthews cites a couple of lines from our Founding Fathers and quickly turns to the question of war today, about which he worries, \\"Will America still be guided by its role as a reluctant warrior in this century? Or will the reality of America's colossal military power overwhelm the fine instincts of our history?\\" There are several problems with all of this once we get past the initial absurdity of the argument. Of course, it does not follow that because \\"Americans\\" love a certain movie it therefore reflects our collective self image or illustrates our role in history. Let us pretend that such an argument is valid, however , and see where it leads. The first and fatal problem, as I see it, is that Casablanca may not be our favorite movie. According to Forbes.com , Casablanca has earned an inflation-adjusted box office gross of 172.8 million in 2001 dollars. This would place it on the all-time box office hit list at around number 60, in with such company as Crocodile Dundee and There's Something About Mary. I wouldn't care to guess what either of those films might reveal about our self image or history. One may cry foul at my use of box office data to determine the popularity of Casablanca, but Matthews offers no source to support his claim other than \\"the best surveys\\" which may include non-representative samples of the general population. More crucial is the premise that our history has shown us to be the \\"reluctant warrior.\\" Looking at history since Rick and Ilsa parted ways in 1942, this premise is just as preposterous as the last. To take the most obvious case, this past October marked the 40th anniversary of a report in the New York Times detailing President Kennedy's escalation of aggression against South Vietnam, sending attack helicopters on strafing , defoliation, and crop destruction missions directed mostly against the peasant countryside. The next decade plus of bloodshed left millions of dead in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia with devastating consequences for the survivors. Is it possible for a thinking human being to brush this aside as some exception that proves the rule? Is the concept of the \\"reluctant warrior\\" supposed to exclude diplomatic, financial and military aid to mass murderers like General Suharto and Saddam Hussein? Does it ignore the various coups we have staged (Guatemala) and death squads we have employed (El Salvador) and hundreds of thousands of corpses attributed to US Foreign Policy (East Timor) ? If so, doesn't this make the concept of \\"reluctant warrior\\" somewhat worthless? If the facts matter, the type of self serving propaganda generated by Matthews (and many others in his field) is worthy only of ridicule. Thoughtful readers would do well to spend their money on more accurate and substantial material."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Don't blame Chris Matthews for this tripe. He has to make a living somehow, and it's become the standard m.o. for manic political cranks on television to churn out these hastily written tomes about &quot;grand American themes.&quot; These books have become a genre unto themselves, featuring, invariably, a big glossy photograph of the &quot;handsome tv host&quot; along with the words &quot;liberty,&quot; &quot;freedom,&quot; and &quot;America&quot; in combinations limited only by the imagination of Fox News. If one criticizes such &quot;works,&quot; you are, by definition, a &quot;blame America first elitist.&quot; So don't even start.I don't criticize them myself because they are beyond criticism. It would be like critiquing the picture menu on a fast food establishment's cash register. It works, doesn't it? The pictures are easy to identity. The familiarity is comforting. What could be wrong?"},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I recommend this book, it is only 200+ pages and very well documented. It could be very good resource material for a civic class, American history class, and should be required reading for American's. This book is NOT negative, but delves into why we are like we are and not like anyone else in the world. Chris comes up with ten, uniquely American notions and they are very interesting. IMHO (in my humble opinion) this is very worthwhile reading! Senator John McCain is one of his contemporary examples, but Chris goes back to before the Revolutionary War for other examples."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Okay, so what makes the audio version of a book better than the bound version? Why, the reader, of course! How about if the reader is the guy who actually wrote the book? Even better, right? Suppose the guy has a highly rated show on MSNBC? Hmmm...intriguing. If you're a Hardball fan, you've come to expect a certain delivery from its mildly quirky host, Chris Matthews. Here we have a gathering of Matthews' favorite moments in American history. They may not necessarily be your favorite moments, but who cares? It's just fun listening. Matthews succeeds in bringing historical perspective and American attitude to what he considers to be important moments in cinema, politics, and events, which have shaped our country and its development. He could have continued with the idea, and possibly have written ten times the volume of work, but he kept it short and sweet. Here's the beauty of the concept. Sequels, sequels, and more sequels. Matthews has left the idea wide open for endless opportunities to add to the collection. I for one will be there to purchase every audio CD version as it becomes available. When you listen to Matthews reading his own stuff, you can occasionally catch a glimpse of the emotion he wants you to feel. Probably the same emotion intended during the writing process. He tried to keep it subdued, and during the first disk he appeared to consciously keep it under the speed limit. But with everything he does the intensity level creeps up on you, and he takes it up a notch. You really can't help but get into it. Why is Chris Matthews so successful, well respected, and yes feared by certain political and media figures? Because they don't take the time to research what his passions are before they appear on his show. My advice to guys like Kerry, Dean, and Gephardt is simple. Read or listen to Matthews' book before going on Hardball. If you're not good at thinking on your feet or taking the control away from the host (good luck), then you run the risk of being eaten alive like one Dennis Kucinich. Now the guy won't even appear on Matthews' series of shows from the Kennedy School of Government. Have a nice life, Dennis. If you're a guy like Joe Biden, however, who happens to be one of the guys that Matthews can't seem to touch, then you don't need the prep. Kerry should have read this book. I'm typing this before the Howard Dean show. Can't wait for the fireworks. They really need to let Chris moderate one of these debates. Wouldn't that be fun? One day MSNBC will smarten up and put Matthews up against O'Reilly. Anyway, you won't be disappointed with the book in any version unless you can't stand the guy. But if you're not a fan of his stuff then what are you doing even reading this review? I'm not trying to be a Chris Matthews suck up, or maybe I am, but I happen to like the guy. His idealistic albeit liberal approach reflects true patriotism. It is not only patriotic to question one's government, but it is every American's duty and responsibility."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Author Matthews has an &quot;All-American&quot; view of our collectivehistory, and he does a nice job of highlighting some of thethings that have specifically shaped him into a particular&quot;all-American&quot; character himself.He touches briefly on some of our cultural heroes, and sincethey are all worthy of review, his thoughts on them areworth reading. It seems a bit odd that he puts such emphasison movies and their heroes, but those movies have no doubtinfluenced his view of America, just as other factors haveshaped our own view.The author hits only the high points of a rather odd mixtureof historic figures, but they are all worth reviewing, andhe gives the reader some positive thoughts to consider, andit is a nice review of a few American leaders who have influenced our collective thinking about exactly what a &quot;real&quot;American is.Given the author's experience and education, this book has arather &quot;light&quot; feel to it, and it is rather easy to get throughit quickly, but his points are nonetheless valid. Many factorsmake up a true American, and they come from a great variety ofsources during the last 300 years, and we still credit a lotof our qualities to our forebearers, both real and fictional.An interesting read."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Chris Matthews' new book, American - Beyond our Grandest Notions, is a gem. It's a quick read, and for that reason alone may appeal to students, parents who want be able to explain to their kids why America is truly the land of the free and home of the brave and perhaps most importantly - this book will give boomers and seniors a much needed booster shot of pride in this nation.The prejudice comes in because it frankly and without pretense champions the citizens of the USA. Not a bad combination in today's world where it is fashionable to take the pseudo-intellectual position of seeing the rest of the peoples of the earth as victims of Americans and beating their chests with feigned mea-culpas. We've had decades of post-modern, deconstructionist cynicism. It is entirely appropriate at this time in our history to remind ourselves that Americans have some unique qualities and why this is so. The 10 people Matthews chose to demonstrate these characteristics come from nearly 250 years in our past to the present.Want to have some damned good, honest responses to share with the next boor who whines about the demise of your homeland? Treat yourself and people you care about to a copy of American."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"This book is alot like light beer. It satisfies somewhat, but after consuming it, you wonder why. I like Chris Matthews, because I think he tries to be fair to both sides on his TV show. I read to learn new things, and regretfully I learned little from this book. This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies. Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies. The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world. Again a long stretch. People are people, and Americans are no more unique than others in this world.I think highly of Chris Matthews and his first book Kennedy and Nixon. This just wasn't a great book. There are more deserving books out there."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Very easy, fast read, and right on the mark. Makes you remember that as Americans, we each have the opportunity to create and live the lives we choose.I was disappointed a bit in that he repetitively referenced the same historical figures throughout the book - it was as if there were no other Americans of significance to note as examples. The constant reference to George Washington, Tom Paine, Lincoln, JFK, became too obvious - as if he couldn't think of anyone else. The reference to the movie characters Jefferson Smith, and Rick Blaine though insightful became too repititous, as is there were none others.It wasn't a bad book, but not a great one. As I finished reading it, I realized that Chris is also living and pursuing the American dream - by writing this book. When complete, and upon reading his references - what a simple premise for a book. It focuses on the obvious, reminds us of who we are, and where we come from, without digging very deep. It is knowledge every American should, if not already has. The research must have been done over a weekend, and the writing on the next weekend.Why didn't I think of it first."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I read most of the reviews already posted, particularly the negative ones. I am not sure what people were expecting from Chris or the book but I found it to be an easy and enjoyable read. If I wanted a history textbook, I would have bought one. I wanted to read an optimistic, positive book about America that doesn't resort to the \\"liberals are traitors\\" thumping we hear from the Right. Chris mildy and briefly reveals his reservations about President Bush but he doesn't bash him. I don't expect Hardball to be sole source of political information, nor did I expect \\"Americans: Beyond out Grandest Notions\\" to be my sole source for American history. I probably won't refer to it again but it was a pleasurable read that stands way above the partisan name calling books we get from Coulter, Franken, Hannity, Limbaugh, and Moore. Casablanca may not be my favorite movie, but who cares? Some Americans identify with it. Chris did, and he's the author. I'm okay with that. Thanks for lifting my spirits Chris. America isn't as bad as some people say we are."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"This is terrific writing (fast and smooth reading) by Chris Matthews, just like the terrific commentaries he does on television. He is realistic about conditions in America today and the way Americans are. Well worth the time and effort to read, especially if you have read Norman Thomas Remick's allegory of America titled &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education..&quot; that tells us what it is supposed to mean to be an American, according to the Founders. Matthews has put forth another powerful analysis of contemporaneous life. I won't ruin it for you by telling you what he says.Get Chris Matthews' book, &quot;American: Beyond Our Grandest Notions&quot; and read for yourself the way it is ."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Well, I finally got around to reading this book.I note from the reviews they have been very mixed culminating in an average of 3 stars.I also note that there were only 2 in 2005 and 2 in 2004 ;so I guess it has pretty well run its course.Actually, I found it a good exercise in covering the values that made United States the greatest nation the world has ever seen .Sure ,she has seen dark days ,but in the end, the thing that all freedom loving people in the world associate with America always prevails;namely the pursuit of Life,Liberty and Happiness.Over her history, there have been a great variety in the men who held the office,and the fact that they all believed in their country gave them the strength to arise to meet the challenges,no matter how difficult they were.Although a Canadian,I realize that much of the good fortune we have had is because of the fact we have benefited from living beside the best country in the world.We tend to follow American politics because it has such a great impact on us.In my lifetime ,I believe that there were 4 Presidents that stood out to meet the challenges.Those being;Truman,Kennedy,Reagan and now Bush.Whether other Presidents would have been as great faced with the same problems--who knows?I also thought Matthew's use of books and movies to show they reflect what happened over the years.There are many wonderful ideas presented in the book,but on page 139,there is as good a summary of what makes America different than any other country.While there is a lot of America bashing going around the world these days,what other country could such a book like this be written?Just imagine that there was no America,what would the world be like today.To understand what made America this book shows it was the people ,not the government,that made it happen.In other words \\"By the People,For the People and in God We trust.\\"Though not a lot of new ideas,this book is a great reminder of what America is all about."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"Despite Chris Mathews political stance as a moderate Democrat, this book is a good read for all Americans, no matter your political tendencies.

He said on one of his snake-oil sales interviews that &quot;The word 'I' NEVER APPEARS.&quot; It was a fantastic assertion coming from this ego-maniac---and---it's a lie. The infernal &quot;I&quot; is there from the Prologue and Chapter 1 on. The whole thing is a re-hash of selected cliches in American Civilization 101 courses out there. And, sublimating his 3-years' hit-job on Al GORE here, without the &quot;I&quot;, his slant on President GORE in the 2000 Campaign was that this was the time for a Common Man and &quot;there wasn't one&quot; and that &quot;most people voted for him but they didn't want to hang out with him for four years.&quot; At least this weak product isn't on the best seller list---yet."},{"Title":"American: Beyond our Grandest Notions","review":"I usually don't write reviews, and I am not much of a reader myself, but I am greatly disappointed in this book. First, the book has the style of a high school paper. The book has a lot of stories of individuals who kind fit the author's thesis, but no big picture analysis of America. In the end this book says nothing.The only reason why this book is so popular is because it says everything we want to hear. It has the author's main points of \\"some basic-and sometimes contradictory-precepts, are pugnacious but anti-militaristic; they admire gun-slinging loners and heroic men of action, but love the little guy and underdogs; they are optimists with a manifest destiny and an eye for personal reinvention.\\" The book describes some Americans who were optimists. But there are equally important Americans, like Alexander Hamilton, who are not optimists. The book also claims that America loves the underdog. Why are the Yankees so popular then? Or that we are reluctant to go to war. Iraq, Spanish American War, War of 1812??? There are a lot of reasons why America is such a dominate power. In my opinion, the reasons why America has dominates is because we have a lot of natural resources, a lot of freedom that allows us to go from rags to riches, massive immigration, and a lot of luck. Rome lasted for over a millennium. America has barely lasted two centuries, and our dominance is more recent that that.

What a HUGE mistake!The book is, quite simply, &quot;history for dummies&quot;. If you know absolutely NOTHING about American history, then you might enjoy this book. Matthews simplifies everything and accepts at face value the myths and inaccuracies of American history usually taught to grammar school students. Quite simply, the book has no depth. (And I suspect that Matthews' knowledge of American history has no depth either!)As a Civil War &quot;buff&quot; of some 40 years (with a keen interest in America going back to colonial times), perhaps I was expecting too much from Matthews. I did not expect a comprehensive history in so short a book, but I expected some substance -- but there was none.

With the companion volume World War I, Maybury will give you a new perspective on wars and history. Filled with facts of interest rarely mentioned elsewhere--P. T. Barnum's source for his sideshow foreigners, the advanced German spearpoint backed by horse drawn carts, the comparison of civilian murders by the Axis versus that of the Allies, the end of the war in the Pacific and the reason for the use of the atomic bomb, the remarkably successful Swiss policy, etc, etc.--\\"Uncle Eric\\" writes succinctly and in a way to be understood. Highly, highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"World War II: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today : 1930 to September 11, 2001 (Uncle Eric Book)","review":"Before I bought this book, I read librarian Mary Mueller's original review of it. I was particularly interested in her comment (which has since been removed from her review), \\"He makes numerous other outrageous claims, which he supports with historical scholarship that is questionable at best....\\"So I found her contact information at the school where she works and emailed her about her comment, asking her what she meant about the author's \\"questionable\\" scholarship. She wrote back saying, \\"Maybury uses sources that could best be described as fringe, and they are not sources that are published by mainstream publishers or university presses.\\"Well, I bought the book anyway, and I learned that Ms Mueller's remarks were highly prejudiced. Maybury's sources were researchers who had combed through U.S. Government records released under the Freedom of Information Act. In other words, in Ms. Mueller's view, the U.S. Government's records can't be trusted because they're neither \\"mainstream\\" nor \\"university.\\" What a crock!Interestingly enough, after I bought the book, I revisited Amazon and found that Ms. Mueller had changed her review, removing the damning passage and replacing it with a broad-based rejection of Maybury's political viewpoint. At least she realized that she was wrong then. Too bad she doesn't realize she's wrong now, too!The Uncle Eric books are generally good, and the viewpoint they provide is desperately needed in this country. My only complaint is that they're very repetitive, often duplicating the same arguments verbatim. It's as if the author simply copied-and-pasted whole sections of previous paragraphs and chapters. I'd have given the book five stars instead of four if the author hadn't resorted to this dumbing down tactic.Still, this book is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"World War II: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today : 1930 to September 11, 2001 (Uncle Eric Book)","review":"In this book, Richard Maybury attempts to present a point of view of historical events which are linked to the rise of Nazi Germany and later, World War II. Without condoning his excesses in any way, Maybury shows that it was the political circumstances of the times that created the egregious nature of the Hitler that we know. And the same circumstances that led to the making of a Hitler, are present in today's society in good measure. And that we are to be forewarned by hindsight.Certainly Hitler was no angel. However, as Maybury shows, neither were Winston Churchill or Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In order to contain Hitler, they ended up siding with Stalin, who was one of the worst murderers in human history, displaying clearly through actual facts and figures, exactly who was responsible for more lives lost. Maybury debunks the widely accepted theory that Hitler was the only megalomaniac the world has ever known and that the Allies (the proverbial good guys) were forced to do what they did (carpet bombing) in order to extinguish him in the larger interest of the world. He shows that the number of civilian lives lost on account of Allied activity in Germany, was in fact, far greater. He goes on to show that the Allied military machinery was so much more precise, so much more well- oiled and so much more powerful. This point is illustrated by using the analogy of a wolf against a lion. The wolf (in this case it is Hitler) can have the initial advantage over a sleeping lion (the Allies), but never, a final victory.Besides putting across a totally new and refreshingly original perspective on historical events, Maybury makes some interesting conjectures. One question, for instance, Japan was ready to surrender after Hiroshima. Was the Nagasaki bomb needed? Why was it deployed? Another question is about Pearl Harbour. Was it planned (by the Americans)? Did the Japanese walk into a trap? What was the real motive of the Allied powers? World Domination? All these questions are increasingly valid today.Of course, all the conjectures need not be valid, and our so called heroes, leaders and statesmen (no women, unfortunately) possibly had a little more greatness or courage in them than Maybury gives them credit for. However, isn't it high time that the widely accepted version of history and historical events presented in school textbooks is publicly questioned, so that these legendary figures are not made into the kind of idols which they are made out to be?Read this book with an open mind. It will make you think. It will shatter a few illusions. But you will feel the stench of truth."},{"Title":"World War II: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today : 1930 to September 11, 2001 (Uncle Eric Book)","review":"This book is best understood after reading the authors book on WW1 first. The two books together show in a well reasoned and documented manner how that the U.S. govt. has followed the way of the Roman Empire. The war involvements are shown to be unnecessary for the welfare of U.S. citizens and even the world.

GLOBALIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY is an excellent book and, contrary to what some reviewers suggest, is one of the best historical studies of globalization available.The true significance of GLOBALIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY is that it was the first attempt by historians to bring a broader and longer perspective to the history of globalization. A.G. Hopkins, the editor, begins the book by underlining the growing urgency of the question of globalization, which has been made plain by terrorist attacks around the world, by conflict in the Middle East, and by the changes caused by expanding global trade. Such a pressing issue thus demands a thoughtful analysis. But scholarship on globalization has been dominated by economists, journalists, and political commentators who are primarily concerned with present events, while existing historical commentary has largely failed to approach the history of globalization with a sufficiently broad perspective. The authors of the nine essays that constitute this book seek to correct this gap in knowledge by emphasizing the non-Western origins of globalization and by expanding its inquiry to cover the last 300 years. The hope of the editor is \\"to reinvigorate the appraisal of large slices of the past,\\" and \\"to link history to the present in ways that ought to inform the appraisal of contemporary issues\\".It is therefore misleading, indeed unfair, to call this book an \\"academic indictment of American scholars,\\" as Mr. finconsult has - a gross exaggeration that suggests he never made it past the second chapter. Mr. finconsult, as a former Oxford student, should understand that where there is a scholarly imbalance, a corrective is necessary. GLOBALIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY attempts to provide this balance by emphasizing the non-Western as well as the Western sources of globalization, and by searching for earlier sources of globalization that, prior to 1945, had begun the process that since then has become associated with American preeminence.It is also strange that Mr. finconsult should accuse the book of lacking an economic dimension when the editor, A.G. Hopkins, is the author of AN ECONOMIC HISTORY OF WEST AFRICA, a book that pioneered the study of economic history in the under-developed world, and when the same editor is the author of BRITISH IMPERIALISM, 1688-2000, a book of enormous importance that, more than any other work, returned economic considerations to the forefront of imperial history.Mr. finconsult also missed the many references to economics in the individual essays in the book. The third chapter by C.A. Bayly concludes that, \\"already, in the period 1750-1850, features of proto-globalization based on the supremacy of market-driven, profit-maximizing forces emanating from Euro-American capitalism and the nation state were already apparent\\" (if resisted by old social and cultural formations). Similar developments are suggested in the fourth chapter, by Amira Bennison, who argues that \\"international economic exchanges, migrations, and global ideologies within and without state structures are not the sole preserve of late twentieth century or early twenty-first-century Western societies but have been developed, promoted, and upheld by many world systems which, although not necessarily global in reach, certainly maintained universal, and thus global, aspirations.\\" Or, take for example the fifth chapter by Richard Drayton, which considers New World sugar plantations as part of the \\"cutting edge of capitalist civilization,\\" and as a \\"complex\\" that attracted investment, employed labor, created consumption, and \\"generated global circuits of bullion, sugar, cotton, wheat, beef, and debt, and cycles of colonial expansion and European settlement on every continent.\\" These examples could be repeated for the remaining six chapters, but the point is clear enough: GLOBALIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY is a remarkably rich and well-balanced account of the history of globalization that, far from discounting economic forces, in fact places them center stage.It is equally curious that one would accuse the authors of attacking either the United States or American scholarship on globalization, when the final chapter by David Reynolds begins with an acknowledgement that last century was indeed the \\"American Century,\\" and that modern technology created a \\"multiplier effect\\" that makes American globalization uniquely influential in world history. Reynolds's only hint of challenging American scholarship is to point out that few economists, sociologists, or political scientists have looked beyond WWII, and that \\"a longer historical perspective is therefore appropriate\\" if scholars are to understand globalization as more than simply an American phenomenon. \\"It is a fundamental aim,\\" he writes, \\"to locate contemporary globalization in broader and longer contexts, by showing the globalizing patterns of other societies and earlier epochs.\\"Finally, it is regrettable that some readers consider this book an \\"extremely intellectual\\" and \\"impossible\\" read. There is - inevitably - some truth to the claim that the book is highly intellectual and that its authors write in a distinctive Cambridge style. But this should hardly be surprising (or difficult) for any reader familiar with the authors' work or with the literature on globalization by scholars from other fields. As a point of comparison, I would suggest reading the commendable, if densely written, work on the subject by Ian Clark, or by David Held and Anthony McGrew, et al. You might then discover that, in content as well as stylistic felicity, GLOBALIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY is a refreshing, timely, and highly important study of the history of globalization."},{"Title":"Globalisation In World History","review":"I did not care for the way this book presented the facts.

He elegantly expresses the thoughts and feelings of the main character Arianna, but still manages to keep a simple manner intact in the fantasy-like atmosphere of Skyhall.The novel takes place in a dangerous time as young Arianna slowly inhales the reality of her importance to the world. Shee reluctantly begins her training as a wizard, entering a new life where she meets new friends and discovers nothing is what is seems.Fate wields a nasty path for her as trial after trial beats her down. She holds onto the bonds of trust she has with her new friends, and the slim hope of surviving in the changing universe as evil forces she never dreamed of become real.I am positive it will inspire the minds of everyone who also reads it.

I was so impressed by his interest in the book that I read it too, and I must say I was immediately swept away by the author's writing.I was even more impressed when I found out the author is only 14 years old! While there are a few rough patches, the fact such a young author has written a book like an established author is simply amazing. If you've ever read the Artemis Fowl or Harry Potter books, then Arianna Kelt will be just perfect. Arianna Kelt has a colorful cast of characters, adventure and fun unmatched by any other (except maybe Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl....maybe).Arianna Kelt tells the story of an orphan girl trying to escape the awful places she keeps getting sent to. During one escape (and a bungled bank heist), she sees a man with a white robe and a long beard. She wonders to herself if this person thinks he is a wizard or something, and this person is in fact a wizard, only Arianna shouldn't be able to see him. Being a wizard seer gets Arianna into much trouble and she is taken to Skyhall. Suddenly, Arianna finds herself on trial in the \\"People Court\\" with nothing less than her future and her life at stake.Arianna Kelt is full of twists and turns that any sensible fantasy reader would enjoy.

I'm telling you READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Arianna Kelt was such a great book. i love how it just pulls you into the story. i just finished reding it for the fourth time, and was completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards is one of those rarest of books you can lose yourself in. My son says he liked this more than the latest Artemis Fowl and I agree. This is the better and more fun read. I hope more readers will discover this remarkable book from 14-year-old wonderkid J.R. King. I can see this becoming as big as Harry Potter and Eragon once more people catch on to how good it is."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. I'm so intrigued by this young writer. J R King is phenominal in her storytelling, and this book is sure to please fans of Eragon, Harry Potter, and Artemis Fowl.Eragon fans who have lavished praise on the then 15-year-old Paolinie will be amazed to discover another bright young writer oozing with raw talent. And this writer, who was 12 then and 14 when the story was released, has written a book that is much more fun to read. King understands wit, humor and sarcasism, and she isn't afraid to use it in her story.Harry Potter fans will love how the story features a wizarding school. But King has one up'd Rowling by an order of several magnitudes by creating an entire wizarding universe around the wizarding school. The wizards in training in this book don't spend much time in their classes, but they do spend time traveling the dimensions and battling the forces of evil.And I'm afraid to say that Artemis Fowl fans needs to graduate to this much more fun book series. Arianna Kelt is better on every level. It's better written, better plotted. It has better characters, and better ideas.I'm not saying this is a perfect book by any stretch of the imagination. But it gets a full five stars from me. When a teen author can write a better book than a grown up, that's a pretty humungous achievement. And if he's read this, Eon Colfer's head is probably throbbing after discovering a kid outdid him several times over!Overall, an excellent read full of wit, humor, sarcasm, and fun. You should be warned that this book isn't perfect, and I stated as much previously, but it is pretty darn brilliant. The author's raw talent could make her a considerable literary force in the future."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"My,My,My this book is so awesome I give hecka props to the teenaged author, she is so very talented. I'm 13 and i never finish reading a book i stop in the middle but i got it a friday night and finished it sunday night I HIHLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!!!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"My teacher said it was an EXCELLENT read and such a great accomplishment for someone as young as King. I agree I absolutely absolutely loved this book. I was unable to put the book down once I started reading it. I am a big fan of the LOTR series as well as the Harry Potter books and I feel this story will be as widely popular and a favorite for so many others once it catches on. I cannot wait until the next book comes out! I recommend this book to anyone who loves being transported to a place full of magic and adventure."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I saw an interview with the author and immediately purchased the book for kids! My eldest read it in record time and raved about it so much my wife and I decided to read it too. Once it gets discovered it will be a strong competitor against Harry Potter for space on the top of the lists and on peoples bookshelves. Good luck JR King.I am anticiating Renegades as much as my kids are. If this kids parents had a million dollars to spend on marketing like Paolini's, he'd be a household name by now too -- it's that good.If anyone is looking for a book that is full of adventure, wit, and charm, then buy this book!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I loved ARIANNA KELT. It is the best book I have read in a long time. Some people say, it isn't what people say it is, but I disagree. King has achieved a edge-of-your-seat, gripping tale. ARIANNA KELT is undoubtidly a classic in progress."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This is a perfect book for teen readers. While the book itself isnt perfect, the heavy dosage of action, wit, and sarcasm, make this a great read especially for teens. With great characters and a sequel to come, this is a great book for teens and younghearted adults as well."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Originally being attracted to this book because of the reviews claiming of its humor, I bought it, but after seeing it was more meant towards teens, I surprised my teenager with it and let them read it first.After hearing his praise of the books, shocking to me because I usually hear how boring stuff is and just tune out of what he says, I pick the book up and start reading it.Almost immediately I'm hooked as the wit, sarcasm, and action unfold.It's not an absoluetly perfect piece of literature, but it is a perfect book for a teenager to read. Full of action and great humour, this is a book your teen won't want to miss.Oh did I mention, the kid who wrote this was only 12 years old?"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Hate (envy) it if you want, this young author shines in this debut novel. I was amazed at the imagery and the wealth of detail. I was blown away by the plotting and heroics. What a fun story and a truly great one regardless of the author's age.The story works on many levels. The plot is effectively suspenseful and well-paced. It keeps you guessing about what's going to happen and there's plenty of comic relief in the form of Digerence, the onery gnome. Arianna's transformation from street kid to wizard is believable and her growth is nicely woven into the story to add depth and realism."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I was sure astounded by the fact that a kid my age wrote this book. It's a very good story line and I was hooked the moment I picked it up. It was among one of the best books I've read, HOWEVER you could tell that he was not an experienced writer. It was good nonetheless so I would really really really recommend it."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"When Arianna mistakenly sees a wizard, she is taken away into the wizarding world, where wizards coexist uneasily with other magica creatures. This world is on the brink of war, and Arianna's arrival is surely no accident. There are hints that Arianna has a role to play in the Xjoz's uncertain future. Arianna wants no part of it -- until she realizes it's the only way to figure out her own life and find out more about herself. Reluctantly, Arianna embarks on a dangerous adventure that will change both her and the Xjoz forever.Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall leaves you wanting more. This is an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"It reminded me of the good old days of being a kid. You know doing nothing, cracking open favorite book, reading until dark. Arianna Kelt, written by J R King when he was twelve truly captures the sense of wonder and atmosphere of a classy adventure story, the kind any kid or any one who is young at heart can truly enjoy. I was really impressed with King's writing skills. The story was outstanding, and I suggest you buy this book. Full of action, imagery and solid description, you'll feel like you are there in this wizarding universe with Arianna and her friends. The sequel,Arianna Kelt and the Renegades of Time (Deluxe Edition, Wizards of Skyhall Book 2) (Wizards of Skyhall), is equally as good if not better."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I would have never expected anything like this from a 12 year old even if I went to one of the most highly ranked private schools in the world, strolled into their most advance english class, plucked the 12 year old with the highest grade and made them write a book. Okay, a little silly I know, but you get the gist right?Anyways, the authors mastery of wit, sarcasm, and parody is pretty amazing for thier age. Another great fact is that the author isnt afraid to poke fun at himself, and he does it a few times in the midst of parodying other things.Interesting as well is the original storyline that isnt just a rehash of a bunch of fantasy movies and books recycled into a garbage book like a certain book I couldnt mention, but won't because thats not the purpose of me coming and writing a review of this book.What I mean to say is that this is a book that will really be enjoyed by teens, and by some adults as well.And while it isnt perfect, this book is good enough that It would still be an astounding accomplishment for an adult writer as well."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"In this accessible, almost-cinematic fantasy, Arianna is a mixed up teen who is up to no good when she accidentally sees a wizard. She's then abducted and taken away to Xjoz where she must stand trial as a wizard seer and where her fate is decided. Arianna just wants to get home, but her abilities as a wizard seer put the magical realms in danger. Given a choice between exile or learning to use her wizard seeing skills, Arianna decides to train as a wizard, knowing if she fails she'll be doomed to exile forever.Arianna is not an eager hero, but with common sense, quick thinking, and determination she grows into the role. The quirky gnome, Digorence, who provides some comic relief, also plays a key part because of his ability to create magical machines. Exciting scenes and cliff-hanger chapters are balanced by decisions and interactions that drive the action. Arianna is not the most compelling figure at first, but as the story progresses she becomes more interesting, maturing through the challenges she faces.Supporting characters are generally engaging, particularly the enigmatic Meilan and the moody Ranth. This is an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Some books are just bland, and \\"Wizards of Skyhall\\" is no exception. It's not an above-average read. It's not terrible, either. If it were, it'd at least be worth the lessons learned about how not to write. But this is just boring--not spectacular by any stretch of the imagination.First off, it doesn't have a good story. It's about a twelve-year-old kid who's a reformed thief and is destined to save earth. (Yawn.) The storyworld offers nothing new or interesting. It tries to blend medieval material in an American setting. Imagine characters in a wizarding world saying \\"You go, girl!\\" Plus, the first page dwells on escape from an orphanage and a minor crisis over a donut. No joke.The praise isn't justified. Compared to the others who read it, I didn't like it at all. The author claims that he was twelve at the time he published this, but in all my experience, I just don't believe it. I've watched the whole \\"young author\\" craze ever since Christopher Paolini entered the fold, and this doesn't at all come across like a child author. It sounds like it was written by an adult with the personality of an adult. His authors' notes, his prose, and his grammar are too precise to sound like the work of a kid.I've read books written by kids; even though they need work, I can tell they're having fun and using their imagination. This doesn't have any imagination or inspiration to it, and its lack of energy proves it. Most of the story drags on with paragraph after paragraph of description. Except for the part where I closed the book, there weren't any high points to hold my interest.Some of you might have looked at the \\"From the Publisher\\" headline and wondered the same thing I did: \\"Who's the publisher?\\" The publisher is Reagent Press, the same people who printed the books by Robert Stanek. I never heard about this book until I came across Stanek's profile. You might know his history, and you might be inclined to draw conclusions about this book, but the only way to judge this book is to read it. Whether the author is 12 or 112, he didn't write a good story. He needs a good editor, some inspiration, and plenty of time to improve. Period.The tagline says, \\"Full of humor, action, and adventure, you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter, sitting on the edge of your seat, and turning pages so fast the Law Gnomes will be out to get you.\\" Don't believe a word of it; all you can do is read the book for yourself."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This was the beginning of the Wizards of Skyhall series and it was an incredible read! I really enjoyed it. It had me constantly thinking about what was going to happen next, it had surprises that I didn't even expect, and it was very descriptive that the images constantly stayed in my head until I finished the book. This book will keep you reading until you turn the last page and you won't want to put it down.I liked the book because it has just the right amount of everything that you would look for in a book. It has action, adventure, comedy, and suspense. It also had lots of questions that really made me think, and as I continued to read, it answered them all. There are twists in the book that you wouldn't expect too!I thought the comedy in the book was great, but you have to understand what is going on and have to have a good sense of humor. The book is very interesting until the very end and you don't want to stop reading.The story is based on a teen girl named Arianna who is to be exiled from Earth because she can see wizards and she's not supposed to be able to. So she ends up on trial in the People Court and has to defend herself and prove she has magical talent. So she sets out on an adventure to prove herself. Along the way she makes friends, enemies, and comes close to dying.I think the author did a great job of creating an imaginative story that has you wondering what's going to happen on every page. I suggest this book to anyone that has a good imagination and who likes action and adventure because this would be the book for you. I suggest the second book too,Arianna Kelt and the Renegades of Time (Deluxe Edition, Wizards of Skyhall Book 2)."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Hello,The case of \\"Robert Stanek\\" has been very interesting as a avid fantasy reader. Stanek created +300 fake accounts on amazon which he used to promote his own books on forums, write fake reviews, and for some reason posting lot's of 1-star reviews on authors books including Patric Rothfus. While doing a case study about theese fake accounts and listing them up I found something funny, all the 5-star reviews on this book was actually done by Robert Staneks fake muppet army. So be warned about buying this product!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. It's a masterpiece with depth and intelligence. I like the explanation of magic and how to use it. It was also interesting to see the link between wizards and others. It is amazing what wizards can do including their magic and strength. Everyone in the world should at least start this book because if you do you will finish it. Every sentence draws a picture and the detail is simply astonishing. When I finished reading Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall, I was blown away. The conclusion will leave you breathless. I couldn't wait to start the second book,Arianna Kelt and the Renegades of Time (Deluxe Edition, Wizards of Skyhall Book 2)."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"My 13 year old is pretty picky when it comes to books but this one he enjoyed and I must say I did too.

It's 200 pages and took me 2 days to read. I found it to be entertaining and huge fun. King created a whole new universe for his books and it is fascinating. My favorite characters are Digorence and Arianna."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I'm so happy I found this book! Even though the author is a teen it is well written and tightly plotted. Reminded of everything I loved about Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl and it's such a fun read. My favorite characters are Arianna and Digorence."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I'm a fan of Harry Potter who just discovered this book, and I'm glad to have something to fill the \\"void\\" until the final Potter book comes out.Looking forward to continuing the saga with \\"Renegades\\""},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This was obviously written by a very precocious 12 year old, but a 12 year old just the same. Amazing for her age, but the lack of a plot and the immaturity of the writing is obvious. I would recommend buying books by Angie Sage, Jonathan Stroud, Brandon Mull, Jennifer Allison, Elizabeth Haydon, Diana Wynne Jones and so many others writing in this genre instead."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"'Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall' is a wonderful surprise - a book with the high action punch of Artemis Fowl and the zesty humor of Terry Pratchett. It has all the amazing attention to detail that made Harry Potter famous, complete with enchanting humor. I was rolling on the floor laughing every time the gnomes, and Digorence in particular, made an appearance.As a first novel, it is not without its rough spots, but it is a delight to read. I see great things ahead for this young, 12-year-old author. This is without a doubt my favorite novel in years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I'm breathlessly waiting for the sequel - and so will you when you read it.It should be noted this is a premium Coffee Table Size book that begins with an illustrated \\"Meet the Characters\\" section and ends with an \\"Illustrated Guide\\" to the world and its denizens. The front and back cover art is gorgeous as well. Kudos to JR King who created the original art in addition to writing the book! Quite an accomplishment for a 12-year old."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"What an incredible story Wizards of Skyhall is! It's filled with lush detail and such an interesting plot and complex characters that the final chapter leaves any reader hungry for the next book. The author started writing this book at the age of 12, and did an incredible job. The story is about a young teen named Arianna, who lives in an orphanage and is always getting into trouble. One day, while out in the city, she sees a strange man in a poited hat and thinks to herself \\"Does the fool think he's a wizard or something?\\" and it turns out it is a wizard she sees, only no human is supposed to be able to see wizards so she is taken to Skyhall, where the wizards live, and put on trial for being a wizard seer. It's funny, and mysterious. There's tons of action too especially when Arianna begins her \\"training\\". This is an incredible book. I find myself looking forward to the next installment more than any other book."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This is a rip off forf the price of $15.00. It is only 144 pages long with very large type and margins. So really it is maybe 70 pages if it were a real book.Other things I don't like:VERY BAD cover art - my classmates picked on me about it when they saw me reading it at schoolnot much of a plot - just a lot of pointless battlesthe characters are not too original - you could tell this was written by a 12 year oldfor a good book about a child wizard (besides Harry Potter) is the Wizard of Earthsea by Le Guin."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This was one of the best I have ever read, and trust me, I have read A LOT of books! This book is the story of Arianna, a troubled girl whose whole life changes when she sees a wizard, before that she was a thief and not a very good one because she kept getting caught. The book also tells the story of wizards and those who defend earch from evil warlocks and terrible creatures. It is funny in many parts with lots of action and adventure. I was amazed that an author as young as JR King can right such and amazing and magical story. I can't wait until the next one comes out, because if it doesn't, I will drive my friends insane, raving on about how the book was so good. I would rate this book with 5 stars, because the title gives you a feeling like you can't imagine, and the text draws you in you can't put the book down until you are finished. I can't even begin to describe the ending, all I can say is that you have a great feeling of satisfaction at the end where it ends and you can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Arianna Kelt written by J R King is the first book of the Wizards of Skyhall trilogy. Arianna Kelt is the main character in the story, a 12 year old girl whose life changed when she saw a wizard. When the law gnomes catch up with her they take her to Skyhall. Arianna soon finds herself in a different world of magic and wizards she never knew existed. This story is full of suspense, humor, action and adventure. Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall was written for people who enjoy fantasy and adventure. I think J R King's writing style was very good, because I understood everything in the book. The story was very good too, after I read one chapter I wanted to read the next one. In my opinion it was a very astonishing book, so if you are into fantasy I suggest that you read this book."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Young J R King has outdone himself; for such a young man to write like an established author is awe inspiring. His characters show a lot of spirit, such as young Arianna and Digorence. I loved this book from the start to end. I love reading books and I just happen to come across this one. I loved it from the moment I read the first page of this. It is perfect for teen and adult Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings fans. It should be a strong competitor against Harry Potter for space on the top of the lists and on peoples bookshelves. Good Luck J R! I can't wait for your next one!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"As a life-long reader, I've found there are very few books that make me say, \\"Wow!\\" when I get to the last line of the last page, but this is one book that certainly did just that. Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall is an amazing, intelligently written debut novel by a young author with a promising future. Although the novel isn't without its weak points, its strength is the author's vivid imagination and the richly imagined wizarding worlds that the author creates. Indeed, from entire worlds of wizards and warlocks to alternate dimensions with demons and gremlins, there is an entire wizarding universe here for the reader to discover.I'm amazed a 14-year old can write much a level of materity and professionalism well beyond his years. Having recently read \\"Artemis Fowl\\" and a few other books written by adults for teens, I can't help but think how much better this book written by a teen for teens truly is. This is without question a first rate book. This a book young and old alike can lose themselves in for a time. It has the wide appeal of \\"Harry Potter\\" with all the fun, action, and excitement of \\"Eragon\\".So what's the book about? It is the story of Arianna Kelt. She's an orphan and petty thief who lives mostly on the streets, except when they put her in one of the strict orphanages. After a badly bumbled bank heist, Arianna sees a shadowy figure in a robe and white hat, and wonders to herself if this person thinks they are a wizard or something. It turns out this person is a wizard, but since the wizard has cast a spell to hide himself from human eyes, Arianna shouldn't be able to him. This ability to see the wizard is puzzling and most unusual, so Arianna is taken away to the wizarding world of Xjoz, one of many worlds in the story populated by magic using creatures and beings. Almost immediately upon arrival, Arianna finds herself on trial in the \\"People Court\\" where the fate of her life and her future is at stake. The only problem is that Arianna doesn't believe what's happening to her is real, and the only one that can save her from herself is Mortimer the wizard. From there, the story takes off and if you want to know more, you'll have to read the book.This 14-year old author has an amazing raw talent. The main characters and more than a few of the minor characters are well drawn. Although there could be more character development, character developement was quite adaquate given this is to be a trilogy. Overall, I enjoyed this more than \\"Eragon\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Artemis Fowl\\" put together. I am looking forward to the next installment with great anticipation."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"My dad got it for me it's so cool it was written by a 12 year old! I'll tell you this: I wanted the sequel to be out when I was only half-way through the book!!!! It is a great story J R King is definately going to be one of the greats. The book rivals all fantasy I have ever read, and that is really saying something. I haven't enjoyed a book this much since Order of the Pheonix. It has just the right mix of magic, humor and battless. Arianna Kelt is a wonderful book with a plot so masterfully written it creates a world of magic and dragons, gnomes and wizards."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"This is really one of the best books I have EVER read.

I found myself wondering what would happen next to the characters when I had to put the book down for any length of time; something lacking in many Fantasy novels. Thus I finished the book in only two days. I can't wait for the next book in this series. King is fast on his way to becoming one of the best Fantasy writers. Those who love fast paced Fantasy novels will definitely not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Arianna Kelt is a MUST READ!

At the start of the story, she plots and schemes, dreaming up ways to leave her life in the orphanage behind. By night she is a thief and a pretty good one. She is saving the money from her ill deeds to get her through life when she becomes an adult.Arianna's life down the wrong path changes when she sees something that she's not supposed to see. She sees a wizard performing magic. This ability of hers to see magical beings gets her in big trouble and she soon finds herself on trial in the People Court in Skyhall. Skyhall is place where magical beings live separate from humans. To learn what happens next, you'll have to read the story.A wonderful story, full of humor, action and adventure. I highly recommend this book for teen readers and also highly recommend the sequel,Arianna Kelt and the Renegades of Time (Deluxe Edition, Wizards of Skyhall Book 2) (Wizards of Skyhall)."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"Quite to the contrary of the few questionable spurious reviews, King's debut novel, Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall, is an utter delight to read. The pluses: characters you want to know more about and like, detailed and interesting settings, and solid plotting. This is a fun story from a talented author. For a teen or otherwise, the writing is good and the story makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","review":"I am amused at how many of the reviews for this book marked as \\"A Kid's Review\\" use large, multi-syllable words that 9-12 year-olds don't even know the meaning of much less how to spell or use correctly, not to mention all the perfect grammar. Those are dead giveaways of faked reviews to increase the book's appeal.This book may be a cute story for King's mom and dad to show off to family and friends, but it never should have reached publication or mass-production. As a librarian and former America Reads reading tutor, I would never willingly recommend this book to any child of any age no matter how much they love fantasy. It is boring, poorly written, entirely too simplistic even for the intended age, repetitive, and just plain bad.If your 9-12 year old likes sci-fi/fantasy, give them Brian Jacques, Suzanne Collins (Gregor the Overlander series, NOT Hunger Games--it's a whole lot older!), Chris D'Lacy, Lemony Snicket, Patricia Wrede, Margaret Peterson Haddix, Bruce Coville, even JK Rowling if you must, but do not waste your money on this piece of drivel!"},{"Title":"Hopi Tales of Destruction","review":"If you enjoy Hopi culture you will have a hard time putting this book down. Archeologist discover an abandoned Hopi villiage. They also find numerous bodies burned inside the Kivas. Molotki matches local legends to describe what actually took place to cause everyone living in this village to die. In this case it was a game so addicting that the people no longer cared about anything except playing the game! You will have to read the book to find out how and why this villiage was destroyed. This is one of about 7 different stories blending archeology with actual events that have been passed down from generations in the form of oral tradition.The book is a little technical with the archeological eveidence, but the stories of each villiage are well written and many times you feel like you are there seeing the actual events. The stories them selves are fascinating and I think you will find them very stimulating.There is also a good mix of cultural mythology in many of the stories.I highly recomend this book as one of the best I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Hopi Tales of Destruction","review":"Any town can be destroyed by war or natural disaster, but three centuries ago, Awatovi was destroyed, its men slaughtered, and some of its women and small children carried away to other villages, by raiding parties from other Hopi villages. Awatovi's chief had concluded that his people, his children, had grown too chummy with the Spanish, who were then creeping back into Tusayan, or Hopiland and environs, two decades after being driven off in the Pueblo revolt of 1680. The chief met with his counterparts from other villages, planned the attack, then intentionally met his end with \\"his children\\" he had sorrowfully sentenced to die.The Awatovi site, an abandoned chaos of potsherds and human bones, has been left untouched except for one clumsy and aborted attempt at archeology (and doubtless a few thefts), and can be visited with a Hopi guide who will ask you only to refrain from photographing, sketching, or taking anything. A guest would be well-advised to dress and speak as one would inside a tomb. In addition to showing respect, your long pants and long sleeves will protect you from a howling wind you might conclude is more than naturally loud and chilly.The exceptional fratricide of Awatovi remains a topic some Hopi are loath to discuss, especially with outsiders, and I encountered subtle resistance at the Cultural Center at Second Mesa when I inquired about visiting the site in 2006. I recommend asking for a guide at Tsakurshovi, a store located 1-1/2 miles east of the Center on Highway 264. Owned by a Hopi woman and her Anglo husband, Janice & Joseph Day, and specializing in traditional-style kachinas, Tsakurshovi attracts not only visitors but locals in need of carving tools and costume implements and eager to sell their art, and it out-cultural centers the Cultural Center.Read this book before you visit, and after you return."},{"Title":"Scorecard System For World Class Enterprise Resource Management : For ERP Systems","review":"This is much more than a book - it's a book/service combination that is one of the most unique concepts for marrying traditional paper-based products with the web.What you get: 132-page guidebook that provides (1) a structured process for evaluating the alignment of your ERP system to business processes, (2) a comprehensive list of questions to which you need to provide answers, and (3) a web URL for entering your responses, which generates a report. The report shows where you are and what areas need attention.The book: Contains an 8-stage process flow for the evaluation. (1) identify need, (2) review scorecard system, (3) choose sections to be answered, (4) go online, (5) enter responses into system provided by the publisher, (6) receive scorecard and comparison report by e-mail, (7) review results, and (8) implement process improvement strategies as indicated by the report.The questions in the book are divided into key process areas as follow: (1) General questions, (2) Environmental characteristics, (3) Initial decision criteria, (4) Project Management, (5) TQM, JIT and continuous improvement, (6) Strategic planning, (7) People systems, (8) Training and education, (9) Performance measurements, (10) Ccommunication infrastructure, (11) Product design and development, and (12) Operational set-up, planning and control. The questions elicit scaled responses; i.e., you are given a range from 1-10 as a possible response to most questions.The service: Go to the URL provided, select Scorecard, select the key process areas for which you want an assessment and commence inputting your responses. You will receive an e-mail within a few days with the results and a baseline with which to compare where you are with where you should be based on survey averages. The format of the report is: question number in rows and statistics in columns as follow: Question, Result (your response), survey average for all surveys received, the difference between you and the average, industry average (based on the SIC code you entered), the difference between your average and your industry's average, software average computed per your specific ERP package and the average of all respondents using that package, and the difference between your score and the software average. This information is the basis of a gap analysis that is your responsibility to perform. It highlights where you stand in comparison to other respondents to the survey as an aggregate average, by industry and by specific software package.Some points about the service: The more responses to the survey the bigger the difference between your ranking and the averages, which means that you should consider re-taking the survey at intervals (6 months is a safe interval). The web page claims that it is best viewed with Internet Explorer - I had no problems navigating around using Netscape version 4.77. Also, there are no hidden costs - the survey report is truly at no additional charge. Finally, the suggested strategy is to perform the evaluation in stages. This will allow you to focus on key process areas and take action to remedy gaps instead of being overwhelmed by an overly ambitious initiative.The package as a whole: The book itself is a valuable resource to consultants because the question bank provided is usually closely guarded intellectual property. I personally intend to use it as the basis for a risk assessment spreadsheet, which will be a valuable tool. The service, including the report generated, will literally save a company tens of thousands of dollars in consulting fees.I am more than pleased with this book - I am amazed. The quality of the questions, the approach itself, and the reports are valuable beyond what I imagined when I purchased this book. It gets 5 stars and my strongest recommendation to anyone, business or technical, who wants to take a snapshot of how well their ERP system is aligned to their business processes."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function D(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const G=d(C,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-ba74bb15"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/50.md","filePath":"library/50.md"}'),N={name:"library/50.md"},q=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(G)]))}});export{j as __pageData,q as default};
