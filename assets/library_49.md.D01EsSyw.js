Laurie's mother beats her and does some horrible things. However Laurie covers up her mother's cruel marks by saying she is clumsy and bumps into walls, falls down stairs, and cuts herself with knives. She has told these excuses this all her life. Laurie's mother, whom she calls Annabelle, tries very hard to move Laurie to houses and apartments at least every other month, so Laurie doesn't have any social interactions with anyone her age. One day Annabelle goes too far! Will Laurie ever get the courage to tell anyone about Annabelle? Will Annabelle stop abusing her?I enjoyed reading this book because it is about a girl that at first is weak and then becomes stronger. It saddened me to read about the things Annabelle did to Laurie. However while reading this book I realized how lucky I am. I have a family that loves me, I go to a great school, and my friends and teachers respect me. I couldn't ask for anything more.I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves thrilling realities. This book is like a roller coaster of life, with all its ups and downs."},{"Title":"Don't Hurt Laurie!","review":"What a wonderful book to show children suffering from abuse that they aren't alone. 11 year old Laurie lives with her abusive mother, Annabelle, who makes Laurie feel as if she has to make excuses and lie for all of her 'accidents' in which her mother causes. Laurie endures more abuse than she can handle, but finds solace in a dog she 'adopts.' She hides this dog and cares for it, as it provides one of her only sources of safty and happiness. When Annabelle attacks the dog, things change.This book should be in every school library, and every media specialist should be familiar with it.

Laurie&#65533;s father ran away when she was little and Laurie&#65533;s mother, Annabelle, takes all her pressure and stress out on Laurie by beating her. Laurie has kept a secret that Annabelle abuses her for a long time. One day Annabelle goes too far and Laurie can&#65533;t take it anymore. She has to tell someone about how she feels.My personal experience from this book was really great. I have never felt like Laurie. She has gone through so much, and has kept her secret for as long as she can remember. I enjoyed the book because it showed me how lucky I am to live in a community where I am safe, unlike Laurie. Will Laurie ever get help? My favorite part of the book was when Laurie moved and found a new friend who she tells many of her thoughts to. My least favorite part was when Laurie couldn&#65533;t decide whether or not to tell her secret to her new friend, George, because I wanted to tell her how she should handle this situation.I would definitely recommend this book to someone who enjoys exciting, breathtaking stories, that doesn&#65533;t bring someone to a world of fantasy, but to a world of reality."},{"Title":"Don't Hurt Laurie!","review":"I thought this book was a good, quick read.

It is exciting, realistic, and written in a sensitive, detailed way that touches your heart. It made me cry. For those who do not like sad books, I would not recommend this book, although it has a happy ending. It is a story about Laurie, a girl whose father left her when she was young. Her mother has not a motherly bone in her, and is cruel to Laurie and physically abuses her. Worst of all is, since they live only with her mother's new husband, who is often away and his kids, no one knows, or cares. Everytime Laurie makes friends, or someone at the hospital recognizes her, her mother moves them. She doesn't want Laurie to get close enough to anybody to tell them the awful secret. Then one day, Laurie's mom goes too far, and she is forced to tell someone. But can that someone really make a difference in Laurie's horrible life? I loved this book, because it is touching, realistic, and it has a plot, not an adventurous story or a murder, just a simple story, with something that could and does happen."},{"Title":"Don't Hurt Laurie!","review":"GREAT BOOK!

This book takes place at Laurie's home. This novel is one of my favorite books that I know of so far. Some of the characters throughout the story are her father, her brother, and her mother Annabelle. Many interesting things happen throughout this book.My favorite part of this book is when Laurie stands up for herself one day because Annabelle her mother goes way too far with Laurie. She bosses her around and beats her, and also cuts her on purpose. However Laurie is finally desperate enough to do something to save herself, however her mother physically abuses her. Will she escape, and will anyone believe her story, if you want to find out pick this book up and start reading it.I did like this novel because it was very interesting, and the author puts you into the book it makes you want to read it more and more. The kind of reader that would like this book are people that are physical abused by someone in their family or a friend, and I would recommend this book because it was very enjoyable to read and I hope you will think so too. This book is important because it tells you how people feel if they are abused by someone or their parents. However it also tells you how people feel when you get abused. However it tells you that you should go tell someone what is happening to you, because after you tell someone you will feel very confident of yourself, and you won't have to worry at all anymore of what is going to happen next"},{"Title":"Don't Hurt Laurie!","review":"i can tell you exactly how i originally got this book and recap the plot line about 18 years later. my mom brought back this book from a garage sale. it was summer and i was bored and out of new books, (i'm a book worm), so i read it. it was so good that i re-read it several times and read every other willo davis roberts book there was. she had instantly become one of my favorite authors. willo davis roberts' writing is very empathetically detailed. you get a deep feeling and kinship with the characters, you see through their eyes and tend to live what they are living.don't hurt laurie is about a girl surviving with her abusive widowed mother. they move apartments so many times because her mother doesn't want other people finding out that she abuses laurie. her mother remarries and laurie gets a younger brother and an even younger sister. with a stepfather rarely home, and step siblings that grow attached to her, they end up with a house with a great big backyard.

I have really had an interest for the way things work, why they work, how they work etc... This book has it all, however, the reason I gave this product 2 stars is because the book contains heavy references to evolution and evolution theories. Educating readers of what evolution is, what the center focus of belief is based on, and why some scientists believe it is one thing. It's different when you base answers to legitimate questions on evolution. Lots of neat and interesting facts mixed in with a lot of hypothesis and evolution theory. I would recommend finding a different Q & A book.Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?"},{"Title":"Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan - VOL. 1","review":"I must admit that this review is tainted with bias. I read this book after staying in Izumo and Matsue on a week long trip to visit a good friend. In Matsue, Lafcadio is probably the most honored celebrity to have ever resided in the city. Statues, posters, honorary names of places abound with his image. I toured the house he lived in and describes in the book, and I became curious about this man I knew only in name.So a week later I bought this book. It is a collection of his writings from 1891 and his first days in Japan to when he left Matsue just a few years later. The stories range from his personal favorite of telling ghost stories and fables of old, to his traveling adventures, which usually involve temples and festivals. Some stories are really edifying (especially when I had been to places he described), but I must admit that many times my attention was stretched thin and I grew bored.Many moments in the book are enlightening and offer a glimpse of Japan and offer insights into the culture, but now after spending over a year here, I have to admit that most of these insights are a part of the past. Most of what is written is no longer around. Maybe it is because@I spend my time in Tokyo, but I feel somehow disconnected to the tales of festivals and people that filled Lafcadio's life over a hundred years ago.But that is to be expected I guess. The true complaint I have is that after a few temples and shrines, every place seems the same in its confusing description, and it gets, if not redundant, old. The use of the Japanese language will prove confusing for people who have not studied the language. Even I, who is still slowly but surely learning, was stopped occasionally at a word thrown here and there. Also Lafcadio really does have a love for Japan. Sometimes it is easy to see why. Yet even though he never brings himself to admit it, he will often defend Japan at the expense of all things western. (The most foreboding was where he praises the loyalty of the common Japanese for their Emperor and how wonderful it is. Something that just 50 years later would be exploited and manipulated to horrific degrees.)This is what half of the book is like. Other times there will be captivating stories that transcend time and bias and are completely absorbing. Lafcadio's prose are fluid and natural and I must admit make me jealous that I lack any such writing skill. It is captivating for exactly what the title says. It offers a glimpse into Japan that frankly does not exist anymore, at least that I know of."},{"Title":"The Everything Grilling Cookbook: From Vegetable Skewers to Tuna Burgers--300 healthy recipes for any grill (Everything (Cooking))","review":"What Rick Marx has done here is truly nothing short of incredible.

I'm not entirely sure what the trendy term \`old school' means, exactly, especially as I have mostly seen it in connection with motorcycles, but I am certain that Jim Villas is an \`old school' culinary writer and that casseroles are an \`old school' kind of food.Jim Villas, although much younger, belongs to the James Beard school of culinary writing, along with his Beard prot&eacute;g&eacute;s Barbara Kafka and Marian Cunningham. As he recounts in this book, the American casserole, based on several different European precursors, clearly reached it's apotheosis after World War II and went into eclipse in the late seventies and eighties with the scorning of canned and otherwise processed ingredients.That the casserole is making a comeback is also clear from both this book and from it's starring role in a recent episode of Alton Brown's very trendy \`Good Eats' Food Network show.In the introduction to the book, Villas eschews some of the less savory casserole ingredients of yore such as canned meats and vegetables, frozen chives, dried parsley flakes, processed cheeses, liquid smoke, MSG, crushed potato chips or canned fruit cocktail. He is not entirely born again, since he does embrace some traditional casserole roles and ingredients such as canned soups, frozen vegetables, dried noodles, bread stuffings, and leftovers. In fact, some themes are so close to the \`Good Eats' episode that I suspect Alton Brown may have used this book as a reference for his show.The book opens with a very worthy introduction on casserole \`hardware' materials and sizes plus advice on freezing casseroles. The casserole pantry repeats the theme of a reasonable use of prepackaged ingredients, citing Campbell's condensed cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and cream of celery soups as essential. Some recipes even state that he tried to create the casserole with a homemade replacement for the Campbell's product and found the home brewed substitute wanting.The names of casserole types are a feast for the crossword puzzle addict. There are quiches, stratas, scrambles, pilafs, pies, perloos, surprises, suppers, shroupes, royales, supremes, puddings, bakes, gratins, souffles, cobblers, crisps, crunches, and delights. Some of these names such as quiches, pilafs, and souffles indicate that the author may be coloring outside the lines a bit here and there, but I do not find this a criticism of the book. It adds to the value of the book as a source of good one-dish meals centered on the American classic. The author also seem to color outside the lines a bit when he includes some of his own recipes, but as Jim Villas has recently acquired the status of a classic American writer, I will give him a pass to contribute classic recipes himself.This is one of my favorite kinds of cookbooks, as it makes it easy to find a recipe to fit a particular need. Anyone who shares that attitude about cookbooks will do well to purchase a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"This is a lovely, cheerfully written cookbook, and only one recipe I have prepared from it has been any good. The rest are boring and flavorless. I love casseroles, but I've finally given up on this book.Update 11/12/2007: OK, so I didn't give up. I just made the San Antonio Chili Casserole. Sounded good: chili with a cornbread topping. Did he leave out ingredients for the cornbread or what? Butter and eggs and nothing else? Added some buttermilk, and although the chili wasn't terrible -- standard beans (lots of beans) and ground beef -- the recipe had to be tweaked too much to call it a success. Get some Junior League or community church cookbook if you want these recipes -- anything!Update 01/26/2009: OK, because I am a masochist (and apparently a sadist to my family), I tried one more recipe (Mamie's Ham and Black-Eyed Pea Supper), and I now plan to permanently delete anything by Mr. Villas from my recipe file. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"Villas is right, it is American, this casserole. It defines regional cooking and it has its own jargon: stratas, perloos, shroups. royales, supremes, gratins, souffles, cobblers, crisps, delights, etc.So if you don't know all of them, this is the fun of exploring this great comfort food area that we all grew up with. These are the dishes that people have always served and offered up to new neighborhood moveins to potlucks to you name it.There are simply too many just great recipes here among the 275 to pick only a few. So simply pointing out a few more than a few greats: I agree with Villas that &quot;Craig's Chicken Spaghetti&quot; is a casserole masterpiece; Lizzie's Low Country Chicken Bog; Chicken And Sausage Casserole; Michigan Baked Fish Casserole; Paper Bag Chicken Casserole; Ann Arbor Venison and Wild Mushroom Bake; Yukon Gold Potato and Goat Cheese Casserole; New Hampshire Turnip, Beet and Hazelnut Casserole; Midwestern Wild Plum Jelly Rice Pudding; Peach, Raspberry and Almond Brown Betty; Chilled Seafood, Mango and Rice Casserole.This is supplemented with good primer on essentials of casserole making and its equipment, techniques, and pantry essential list.Although void of any photos, the sidebar descriptions which accompany each recipe are enough to get the salivation going and out come the casseroles and one is off.Beaut of a casserole companion."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"To me, the whole point of a casserole is \\"quick and easy,\\" so I want recipes where I just dump things into the casserole dish and put them in the oven. But, like many other casserole and \\"hot dish\\" cookbooks, most of the recipes in this book require you to do a tremendous amount of cooking and prep before you put the stuff in the casserole dish -- and, since the ingredients are already cooked, why do they need an hour of baking time? Answer: so they can be called \\"casseroles\\" or \\"one-dish meals\\". Most of these things could be stirred together and served right after the stove-top cooking process (maybe with minor adjustments), without wasting another hour in the oven. I would also add that many of these casseroles are loaded with butter and are too fattening for me. I took this book out of the library and photocopied about a dozen things -- that was it."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"Although it requires some extra time to assemble, I always have plenty leftover to eat on next day. Also, I can freeze them. It is worth of extra labor. We really LOVE Blue Plate Beef and Cheese Noodle and Classic Tuna Noodle Casserole. Those really surprised our guests! Villas really made this close to perfect ones. I enjoyed his details on how he adjusted specific foods and the recipes' history. I like one straight way to a best casserole than trying on many recipes people giving or I find thru magazines. This book is one! Strongly recommend this one!I also like the big book of casseroles by Maryana Vollstedt. The recipes give ingredients that I have on hand. They are mostly from stratch, not canned ones. Comparing to both book, Crazy about Casseroles is more like Classic, International, and Historic ones while the The Big Book of Casseroles is more on from stratch and similar ingredients on other recipes. I love both books, anyway!!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"I'm a single girl with very little baking experience, and I took this cookbook out of the library because I like cooking large portions that I can eat throughout the week. I like the idea of making casseroles for that purpose.While the book is great to read and all the descriptions sound mouth-watering, it's hard to find a recipe that isn't loaded down with butter, cream, cheese, and/or eggs. Even the non-meat recipes are extremely fatty. Tonight I made the Monterey Celery, Almond, and Water Chestnut Bake on page 67. Not knowing enough about baking to be comfortable substituting lower fat ingredients without worrying that it would ruin the dish, following the recipe I used an entire stick of butter, three-quarters of a cup of half & half, and a half cup of Parmesan cheese. I was hoping it would turn out to be a very rewarding bunch of fat and that I'd be so happy I made it. However, tasting the casserole, it's not bad, but it's overly buttery and creamy. I ate one serving of it just now and feel kind of gross, which is not how I like to feel after eating a home-cooked meal. So it's a shame that not only does this recipe involve tons of butter and cream, but it's way more than is needed in the first place.Another issue I have with this book is that nearly every recipe is complex and involves several phases of cooking before you even get to the casserole dish.Based on a couple of the other negative reviews, it seems many of the recipes fall into these traps. I'd say the book is worth taking out of the library, or even purchasing, if you want casserole recipes for buffets, potlucks, or other special occasions. It's especially helpful if you're a skilled baker and are just looking for some new inspiration as there are casseroles in here involving a number of different meats, seafoods, vegetables, fruits, and grains. But if you're looking for a practical cookbook of things you can make any day of the week, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"Most of these casseroles require a lot of prep work in the beginning and then after already cooking it you put it in a casserole dish and put in the oven for another 1 to 1 1/2. After spending 45 minutes to cook the rice and then another 20 softening the vegetables and then frying the chicken you could just serve it as is rather than now putting it all in a casserole dish and baking it for 60-90 minutes. I'm making casseroles to beat the clock not fight against it.The author self-admits he does not watch calories so many of these recipes are full of full-fat sour cream, butter, milk, mayonnaise, cheese, etc. You would just have to make your changes based upon your dietary needs.I think many might find the food combinations a little bizarre. Pimentos, mushrooms, tuna and boiled eggs. I did make the Chicken Divan with almonds and we ate it before it even made it to the casserole dish. I had to cook the broccoli first, then make the sauce so I just needed to take 10 minutes more to cook the chicken slices rather than pouring it all in a casserole dish and waiting another 35 minutes. How strange to have a casserole book where everything gets cooked before it gets put in the casserole dish.I would pass on this one, tryBake until Bubbly: The Ultimate Casserole Cookbookinstead."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"James Villas has comprised a casserole cookbook that highlights the major one dish meals that represent the major food regions of the United States. This is a book of about 275 recipes. Chapters include: Essentials of Modern Casserole Cookery; Breakfast and Brunch Casseroles, Statas, and Scrambles; Beef, Pork, Lamb, Veal, and Game Casseroles, Pots, and Pilafs; Poultry Pies, Perloos, Surprises and Suppers; Fish and Shellfish Shroups,Royales, and Supremes; Pasta and Rice Puddings, Bakes and Casseroles; Casseroles for a Crowd; Vegetable Bakes, Gratins, and Souffles; Casserole Breads; and Casserole Cobblers, Crisps, Crunches, and Delights.All recipes are presented without photographs, which I personally am not bothered by. Having prepared two meals in one week from this book, I wonder if it was intentional. I certainly would not have included pictures had I been the author. The sidenotes to each recipe are perhaps the most riveting thing about the book although I find the first chapter to be fairly useful as it includes essential casserole information about what constitutes a certain size pan, etc. I also value the homemade \\"cream of\\" recipes in this section so that you don't have to open a soup can necessarily.I have prepared two recipes and they were both decided flops. First, I made the Pork Chop, Sweet Potato , and Orange casserole, a nod to the German Midwest. The sweet potatoes cooked down to a mushy mess that did not marry well with the beer. The oranges dried out and the pork was pale and tasteless. No one in my home could swallow the mess and I had a hard time stomaching it as I raked it into the trash.The Canadian Bacon and Cheese Strata seemed like a better contender for a winner as it is mostly a basic breakfast casserole. This recipe took the premium, artisan Canadian bacon I purchased and encased it in a sodden, eggy, bready nightmare. No more! This book is shelved for good!I applaud what Villas was trying to do, but he should have invested more time in looking for the best of each recipe. This cookbook is a shameful waste of paper, time, and money. I woldn't even feel good about giving this epic failure as a gift. Run! and buy any other casserole book out there."},{"Title":"Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics (Non)","review":"A broad range of recipes written with a facile hand -- well-written with a little background information on each recipe. The layout is a bit loud but doesn't interfere with the information.There are different sections for various types of casseroles and some unusual but not exotic ingredients and combinations. No apologies are made for store-bought pastry crusts nor use of condensed soups. The tone is worldy but down-to-earth. I'd recently read by Mr. Villas and was impressed enough with that cookbook to purchase this one and I'm not at all disappointed. A friendly, knowledgeable voice throughout. Excellent cookbook overall. Lean but thorough with no waste whatsoever. No outlandish recipes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"really boring, in between steps here.. the art work is okay, no where near as detailed as sadowski. DC seems to give up on its titles after a while, ala JLA. JSA is headed in that direction."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"*Please note, this review is based on individual issues, not the TPB. As per DC Comics (http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=2376) this TPB is comprised of issues #39-45, so that's what I'm basing this review on.This collection starts off with a single issue story dedicated to Power Girl. The issue is mostly played for laughs as a bombastic (in more ways than one) villain tries to draw Power Girl's attention. The ensuing fight is enjoyable, if a bit \\"light\\" and the issue really tries hard to portray Kara as a self-reliant super heroine. The highlight of the issue is Kara's speech at the end to the JSA's two youngest female heroes as to why she acts the way she does.The next story appears to be dedicated to Dr. Mid-nite, but Captain Marvel really steals the show, which is a shame. Pieter Cross is one of the more interesting alter-egos out there and while in recent issues Geoff Johns has done a good job of fleshing him out, this issue is really more of a focus on his surgical skills. The issue does start hinting at a Captain Marvel/Stargirl relationship, but it's not fully developed. I kind of felt this issue was more filler than anything else. Once again, the ending of the issue saves it, as it sets the stage for \\"Black Reign.\\"Next up is the main storyline in this collection, the 4-Part storyline \\"JSA, BC.\\"The first issue features a rather generic fight against an unknown entity, first foreshadowed by Sand a few issues back. Black Barax isn't really fleshed out here and the majority of the issue is spent building up to the battle. While Barax does pull off some interesting moves, especially against Captain Marvel and Black Adam.All of which leads into the following issue's Mr. Terrific/Mr. Terrific team-up, which is actually quite enjoyable. The concept of a hero who fights for \\"Fair Play\\" does seem cheesy, but it plays out rather nicely, as the plan to defeat Barax has one of the Mr. T's playing not so fairly. Another nice bit in this issue is the appearance by the Freedom Fighters, who are among DC's often forgotten Golden Age Past.The next two issues are the highlight of this storyline, where Mr. Terrific and Hawkgirl travel back to Ancient Egypt to find Captain Marvel. There they find not only the villainous Vandal Savage and his \\"monster,\\" a precursor to the former Justice Leaguer and Outsider, Metamorpho, but also Nabu, the originator of Dr. Fate, Black Adam (as he was in this time period) and Prince Khufu and Princess Chay-Era, who are fated to be reincarnated as Hawkman and Hawkgirl.The scenes with Captain Marvel and Black Adam are really nice, as Marvel must confront an earlier, heroic version of the man who will become his most dangerous foe and also uneasy ally in the JSA.I did feel that they could have done more with Kendra (Hawkgirl) meeting her previous self, especially given the fact that Kendra is in denial about her previous lives.At the same time, these issues also foreshadow the next arc \\"Princes of Darkness,\\" with Dr. Fate making a mistake that will unleash one of the JSA's deadliest foes.Issue #45 sets up \\"Princes of Darkness\\" and brings together several previous plot lines that will converge in that arc. I'm kind of surprised that DC added it to this collection and I have to wonder if it was an error on DC's solicitations to note this issue as a part of the \\"Savage Times\\" collection.I'd say buy this TPB for the \\"Justice Society, B.C.\\" story and make your own decisions on the solo issues featuring Power Girl and Dr. Mid-Nite.As always, Geoff Johns (joined in this collection by co-writer David Goyer) weaves multiple threads through each story and little of previous stories is \\"wasted\\" or forgotten.The art in these issues (save for the Power Girl one) is by Leonard Kirk, who is tied with Steven Sadowski as my favorite JSA artist. It's clean artwork that's easy to follow and the action is easy to follow.If you're a current fan of JSA collecting the series through TPBs, I'd say this is a \\"must have.\\" If you're new to JSA, I'd say your best bet is to start with \\"JSA: Justice Be Done\\" and work your way through the series."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"We live in times wherein comic book stories come in arcs - and usually comic creators work not on an ongoing book but only on a particular arc. Therein lies the problem with a lot of \\"greatest hits\\" style of storytelling in today's comics (e.g. Whedon's \\"X-Men\\", Millar's \\"Spider-Man\\" and Loeb-Lee's \\"Batman:Hush\\"). With JSA however, the writing team of Geoff Johns and David Goyer delivers month after month. In music terms, they feel like the Beatles or Led Zep during their heydays. Every new album is an attempt to top the previous one - while maintaining an obvious intelligence, growth and direction with the constant move forward. This is how I feel everytime I pick up a new TPB collection of JSA. Regular artists Leonard Kirk and Keith Champagne takes over the chores from the previous artists Steve Sadowski and Rags Morales very well - the style is similar and the action is no less blockbusting.As with ongoing stories, there are times when things are quieter. This volume \\"Savage Times\\" is one of those times. It sets up the events to come in the next two epic storylines \\"Princes of Darkness\\" and \\"Black Reign\\". However, with the JSA, \\"quieter\\" doesn't mean uneventful. And this is why I come back again and again to this book - in contrast to the \\"talking heads\\" attempts of decompressed-writing over at Marvel (see anything by Brian Bendis for example). This is what comic books should be - action-oriented, fun, melodramatic and above all, superbly entertaining. Here, we get a time-travel story back to 1944 (the Freedom Force and Mr. Terrific appears) and ancient Egypt. This story wraps up a lot of things originally set up previously and successfully sets up new things for the future (the cliffhanger ending of this volume guarantees that you WILL want to get the next volume).Another reason to get this volume is the focus on Captain Marvel (the \\"Shazam\\" guy). This storyarc fleshes him out in many ways and takes him way beyond the \\"cartoonish\\" feel that he's always been portrayed. We also get additional light shed on Black Adam (Theo-Adam) never before seen. This adds a lot of meat to his once over-simplified \\"villain\\" character and also forces the reader to symphatize with his methods and ideals (a lot of which will result in the explosive \\"Black Reign\\" saga to come)."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"I am a fan of JSA but this book was an 80% disappointment...We learn that Thunderbolt has a son who is married to 'peachy pet' that cartoon character from the 40's Johnny Thunder...When in the heck did that happen.Shazam sends Captain Marvel off to find the Spectre..We only see him in three more panels fighting Superman and Batman..Where?

Each has a relation to Infinite Crisis, but also insights into the heroes, which makes them more three dimensional.

When Wildcat starts mouthing off, kill him. Obliterate him. Erase him from existence. I know what you're thinking, \`but Wildcat's a pussycat'. Sure, and you know what's gonna happen. You're gonna find yourself momentarily weakened... as you ALWAYS do... and Wildcat's gonna haul off and punch you in the face, shouting something like, \`PAYBACKS A B!TCH'... You're an immortal, ultra-powerful wizard but when Wildcat pastes you with one of his haymakers you're gonna look like a punk and the heroes are gonna chuckle behind your back and Wildcat's gonna tell ALL his loser friends down at whatever greasy pub he hangs at how he punched out Mordru.This was not one of the better JSA compilations. It started out with more of the sad trials of Atom Smasher followed by a series of Infinite Crisis tie-ins that go nowhere. Finally the action started with Mordru attacking the wizard Shazam and then going after the disembodied form of Nabu dressed as Dr. Fate and a handful of JSAers. Meanwhile another crew is out searching the fifth dimension looking for Jakeem Thunder who disappeared during a battle with The Specter.The JSA and JLA have always had a problem with juggling characters of wildly varying powers. The JSA in particular had the godlike Specter fighting alongside Sandman. Gardner Fox was a brilliant writer but he used to employ an extremely tiresome technique to minimize the heavy hitters in the JLA that included copious amounts of Kryptonite for Superman, fire for J'onn J'onzz and yellow for Green Lantern. Geoff Johns just seems to fill the weaker characters with so much pluck and spunk that no villain would kill them. If I were Mordru I would be laying waste. It's been established that the beings of the fifth dimension have near unlimited power. I mean this is where Mister Mxyztplk hails from. Yet the heroes stoll through strutting as confidently as if they were walking down Main Street at Disney World. Courtney (Star Girl), in particular, is quite a petulant brat to one of the fifth dimensions less friendly residents. He could, say, snap his fingers and cause her to immolate but instead he merely endures it.Despite being a disjointed mess Mixed Signals has some good points. It advances some storylines and the final tale focussing on the relationship between Star Girl and her adopted father Pat Dugan is a pretty good story. My suggestion for die hard JSA fans is to set your expectations low and you might find it decent."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly.."},{"Title":"JSA: Savage Times (Vol. 6)","review":"I've been a fan of Justice Society since the mid-1970s when All-Star Comics 3 was re-released.They've been updated and brought into modern times.

Perhaps it is because Dutch was his first language, or perhaps it is because of the depth of material, but those who do carefully wade through his work will find themselves the better for it. The Teaching of Jesus Concerning Kingdom of God and the Church is no exception to that statement.Vos' purpose in the book was to demonstrate that a biblical concept of the Kingdom of God that was in the mind of the Jews when Jesus announced that the Kingdom was now present was less than adequate. Indeed, the Kingdom Jesus announces is new and its presence brought in something more than the reign of law in which the Jews found their ideal, and more than a national entity by which Israel would gain their glory and supremacy. Moreover, it is more than just the place where God's sovereignty is unmeasurably experienced and understood. Rather, it is supremely and ultimately the realm of God's work of salvation, which has to do with delivering individuals from the powers of Satan, darkness, and the world. And thus, Vos shows that the Kingdom of God is primarily a spiritual entity with a spiritual and moral force (thus it is connected to God's righteousness) that is otherworldly. From that, Vos demonstrates the NT understanding of the Kingdom as it manifests itself in the Church leading on to its eschatological fulness when Jesus returns. Thus, salvation comes as a result of realizing the Kingdom and its King.Of real importance is the chapter devoted to various misconceptions regarding the Kingdom, both in its present and future presence. Since is it primarily spiritual and heavenly, it is wrong to try to make the Kingdom a national and political force. On the other hand, we must be careful against relegating the Kingdom merely to the sphere of the ethical summed up by love. Modernists and liberals seek to make all religion have the same goal: teaching people how to be better people. Vos went against the message of then popular but controversial preacher, Henry van Dyke, especially as he stated his theology in his popular hymn, \\"Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee,\\" where he wrote, \\"Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are Thine; Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.\\" However, the teaching of Jesus in the Kingdom is that no one is able to better themselves enough for God's righteousness without the work of God in their lives. Vos is careful as he forcefully demonstrates that the Kingdom is a supernatural thing that brings God's grace in salvation.This book is not large, but it will require serious thought and careful reading. But it will help the reader in discovering the great truths about the Church itself that is often neglected in this present day. It will create a love for the Church and an appreciation for what became a motto of the early church (If you want God for a Father, you must have the Church for a mother)."},{"Title":"The teaching of Jesus concerning the kingdom of God and the church,","review":"No doubt, this is an excellent book. The problem with the book isn't so much the book itself, but the difficulty of the ideas and the syntax of Vos' writing style. I am left with the distinct impression that this book *cannot* be read casually or at leisure. It is a serious book that demands a serious reader. My review, then, is not so much a review, as much as it is a practical piece of advice for the interested reader. Be prepared to be confused, or at the least, to have to fight fiercely to gain an understanding of Vos's ideas. I will need to read this book again one day, as my first time reading wasn't too beneficial. Everything went over my head (whew! There, I said it! My darkest secret!), which is unfortunate for me, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Happy Motoring: Canine Life in the Fast Lane","review":"This short picture book is the perfect gift for any dog lover!

As an Italian recently graduated in History at a UK University, I have to admit that my dissertation would have been just a sterile effort without the inspiration of Dr. Riall's work. It is definitely compulsory and compelling reading for readers that know already about the crucial episodes leading to the Italian unification and about the mythical protagonists, but are more interested in the debate and evaluation of the period."},{"Title":"Miss Jacobson's Journey","review":"If you like road trip romances, love triangles (one heroine facing two suitors), a bit of adventure, and an unusual theme, try this book. Heroine Miriam Jacobson is Jewish but a British subject. She is asked by a Rothschild in Paris to help two fellow Britons out with a dangerous but patriotic attempt to get gold to Wellington's armies in Spain. During the trip, Miriam learns more about herself and the two men who soon begin vying for her attention.This is a rare Regency with a Jewish heroine. Others in this genre are Star Sapphire by Rebecca Danton (Fawcett 1979), although the heroine of that book marries a Gentile (a marquess) at the beginning, and the recently published A Question of Honor by Nita Abrams. Carola Dunn treats the situation of Jews in British society and on the continent with sensitivity, and her heroine (and one of the suitors who is Jewish) act in consistency with their upbringing.Miss Jacobsen's Journey, long out-of-print, is now available as an e-book (published from Belgrave House). Get it here or look for it at your public library. If you liked this book, you might want to try Bk 2 (His Lordship's Reward) or Bk 3 (The Captain's Inheritance) to learn more about Miriam's future life."},{"Title":"Miss Jacobson's Journey","review":"Miriam Jacobson rejects the match made for her by her parents with Isaac Cohen and humiliates Isaac by her rejection. For nine years she travels across Europe with her uncle who is a medical man and her faithful servant, Hannah.When her uncle dies Miriam finds herself stuck in Europe because of the war with Napoleon until she is offered safe passage home if she will travel first to Spain with a consignment of gold for Wellington's army. Miriam agrees and finds herself on a coach journey across France with Felix Lord Roworth and the same Isaac Cohen she rejected nine years ago.I found this book did not hold my attention quite as much as other Regency romances by this author have done. It is just as well written and the plot is interesting but there was something lacking and the book did not quite gel for me.I sympathised with Miriam's impatience with the restrictions placed on women at the time and I liked the way the four travellers gradually settled into a workable relationship. Maybe I was in the wrong mood for this particular book and it will not stop me reading others by this author."},{"Title":"Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia","review":"This book mostly looks at the racial aspects of the colonization and founding of Australia. Most chapter headings indicate the views of the colonists as being very anti Aboriginal. Although the account is biased and highly subjective it lends itself to a very interesting read, one that any scholar of Australia or the far east and especially anyone interested in Indian-white relations will enjoy. The book details the original encounters with the natives as well as contemporary native issues, such as the 1988 bicentennial of the founding in which a massive wave of Aboriginal protest swept the nation to draw attention to the plight. Of course parallels with American Indians are everywhere. A very interesting book, although \`Fatal Shore' is probably a superior and less anti-European account.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia","review":"The title of this book is dishonest. There is little pretence to this being a comprehensive history of Australia. Instead, its focus is almost exclusively on the British colonists' policies and attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants, and towards migrants of non-British background. On its own terms, it is very well written. The writing style is by far the most engaging that I've ever encountered in an historical text - and this very fact betrays what is really going on here: David Day has written a polemical argument, rather than a history.*The tone of the narrator borders on the humorous - it is angry, in a sneering and critical way, so much so that it reminded me of the work of the Austrian (not Australian) novelist, Thomas Bernhard. Like Bernhard, Day does not shy away from repetition. His argument is one of insistence. Facts are shaped to fit his purposes, and then deployed effectively. For those figures whose actions he dislikes, he feels entitled to make ad hominem attacks; thus Prime Minister Menzies is described as 'rotund' and 'stout', his bodily habitus being fair game for Day; relatedly, Day feels comfortable offering cursory psychological analyses of political figures - thus Menzies' and PM John Howards' attitudes are 'explained' by their childhood circumstances in country Victoria and suburban Sydney respectively - this is more the stuff of politcal satire than of history.*It is also not accurate to dub this a thoroughgoing revisionist history. Its scope is just too limited. For instance, there is a glaring neglect of women's roles - Day has perpetuated this neglect, rather than questioning it. He mentions various racial groups, but does nothing to tell their history - they are only important in their being the target of racist British colonial attitudes.*There is a frustrating lack of clarity in the presentation of basic chronology. Even on facts central to Day's argument, such as the size of the Australian population, both migrant and indigenous, he refrains from providing tables or summaries. Extracting the factual basis upon which to build an argument, be this his or one's own, is very difficult.*His biased perspective at times leaves him looking a little silly in the face of events. Thus, for several hundred pages he carps against the Colonialists' fears of the \\"Asian hordes\\", virtually laughing at them rather than seriously analysing the source of their fears - when the Japanese do begin their expansion in WWII, Day is embarassed; he is left to pull up his trousers with claims such as that Japan never intended to invade Australia, this claim being justified in cursory fashion. Worse still, changes in Australian attitudes and policies are left without an explanation. Day admits, and tacitly praises, the change in policy regarding the origins of migrants after WWII; but he is unable to enter a discussion as to why this change occurred. Having branded Australians as predominantly racist, Day simply recounts this change as an uncharacteristic, if welcome, deviation from the norm - it is left to PM John Howard to re-establish Day's argument. As a history, this is very weak - rather than exploring causes for events, Day gives up, implicitly saying, \\"Well, this just happened\\". For me, this is one of the most disappointing aspects of this text - the condemnation of racism, and the acknowledgemnt of atrocities, is stirring and vital, but Day gives little clue as to the forces which mollified such detestable inclinations.*Similarly, in regard the issue of how ownership/proprietorship is established over a territory is conceptually barren. Day circles around this issue, establishing its prominence in Australian history, problematizes it, but then fails to offer any conceptual machinery with which to clarify matters. He does not draw analogies with other countries. He does not invoke legal distinctions, nor their conceptual basis. In the end, he merely states the problem. The discussion remains at the level of - the indigenous people say that they were here first, and that they were using the land; the British colonialists say that for land to be claimed it need be worked and permanently settled - Colonial courts have upheld this argument up until the last few decades, when the Mabo and Wik judgements have called it into question. Of course, this is fine as far as it goes, but it does not go very far considering how central this issue is to the structure of Day's entire book.*I would certainly not recommend this book as an history, revisionist or otherwise. As an historian Day is not very insightful. However, I would encourage this work to be read as a polemic. Day adopts a position contrary to that implicit is some older historical texts, and he writes with verve and a cynical edge. The manipulative tone is a worthy counter to that spouted by current Australian politicians."},{"Title":"Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia","review":"[This review is based on the original 1996 edition.] This is an excellent overview of Australian history. It covers the entire period from settlement to the modern day (which day depending on the edition you have). Day presents Australian culture as a colonial one, dispossessing a native population, dependent militarily and morally on a mother country, and believing its claim to proprietorship of the land, to use his term, is under constant scrutiny by other contenders. There is also information about the physical development of Australia. Personally though I found that to be a bit lacking. It could have done with a few more facts and dates about when different areas were settled and more about the specific political and social conditions.Dispossession of the original inhabitants and owners of Australia is the first of Day's two main themes. As he shows later, this has largely been ignored until the last few decades, and is still a topic of hot political debate. Day presents the fact of dispossession and the killing of Aborigines through the records and statements of the people of the time. They knew what was happening, did not consider it something to be disguised or concealed, and used various justifications for it, depending on time period and the conscience of the individual. Day presents all the justifications as attempts to render the Aborigines inhuman, or at least lesser humans, and therefore expendable. He himself utterly rejects that and consistently refers to the killings as murder or massacre. He presents the colonists as having a deliberate though not systematic policy of massacre, occurring when new lands were to be used. Also, it may be worth noting that he contrasts this with the events in the other white Dominions of Britain and in America. In Australia, there were no official attempts to negotiate with the Aborigines. There was no attempt to portray it as other than a takeover, except through the denial of Aborigines being humans to begin with.The second theme is the fear of dispossession, and not feeling at home in this country. He goes through the various stages of White Australia, from the obsession with \\"bleaching\\" Australia through deportation of non-whites and restricting immigration to the British Isles, to the gradual government recognition of the policy's abandonment by the people of Australia. He also goes through the various stages of industrial development of Australia, and shows through quotes how this was related to possession of this country. All throughout, the fear of dispossession is shown through quotes that talk about quite explicitly, and for an amazingly long period of time. The feeling of being far from the mother country is one that he has to show indirectly. Most of it is shown through the statistics of travel and immigration policies. However, as he shows, it was made quite explicit in World War II, which also began the shift of colonial allegiance from Britain to America.Finally, this book is well written and enjoyable just to read. The author generally strives for balance, except on whether Aborigines are human, and that killing them was, and is, murder. In fact, there are a few times when Day is so dispassionate and detached it is a little creepy. So, this book achieves what it set out to do: present a broad overview of the history of Australia, with a focus on two areas of crucial importance to understanding Australians, our society and why our governments make the types of decision they do. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Although the book was written in the 50's, most of the information is totally relevant today and although back then it wasn't foreseen the fall of the Soviet Union, it is very easy to put everything in context.With that out of the way, the book is excellent. It starts with the historic background of WW1 and WW2 from a perspective not often discussed here but covering from the times of the knights, the rise of Bolshevism and communism, to the aftermath of WW2 and then to his prediction of a strong possibility of a WW3 with a middle east battlefield as the starting point. A lot of historical facts are brought up that are hardly found in any publication today, which is easy to see why, as this same author points out, that there is a media and history black-out. After all, \\"Truth is always the first casualty of war\\".Of special interest to me was the connection between the Soviet Bolshevik and the USA government, and how it has endured till today by implanting itself in the USA political body but specially in our foreign policy, the same way they did in the Soviet Union right before taking over!Furthermore, Information that has been declassified since the writing of this book have supported and confirmed everything the author wrote.This book is essential in understanding a big part of this conflict and the forces behind it. A great, factual, well-documented work that should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"This book contains an incredible ammount of crucial information regarding U.S. foreign and internal policies. As a student of modern History, I spent a year writing a theses on this book. John Beaty hits the hot spot, and as incredible as it might sound, he illustrates his points with documented facts."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Colonel John Beaty's book is truly remarkable. The man is a scholar, a soldier, and, clearly, a devoted Christian. In his magnificient work, Beaty exposes the long term enmity of the Khazar people for the Russians, its impact and resolution in the Bolshevik Revolution, and the influence of these same Khazars on American foreign policy within the Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman administrations. Further, Beaty elucidates the motives behind the crazy hodge podge of Truman administration foreign policy in the post World War II period and prophetically analyzes the roles of MacArthur and Eisenhower. Keep in mind that this book was written in advance of the 1952 election season, which saw the elite come to support Eisenhower in order to prevent the election of MacArthur and Taft.In the corpus of this excellent manuscript, Beaty does make the following observation. In 1940, the World Almanac listed the world Jewish population at 15,319,359. The same publication in 1949 listed the world Jewish population at 15,713,638. As six million were alleged to have died during the \\"Holocaust\\", the reader is invited to reach their own conclusion.Beaty writes with the passion of a soldier and a compassionate leader of men in desribing the Korean conflict, its sabatoge by the Truman administration, and the terrible toll this subterfuge represented. In this, today, one is, of necessity, reminded of the ongoing tragedy in Iraq.This is an excellent and terribly important book. Pick it up and give it a read with open heart and open mind. You will be informed and renewed."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"I could go on and on about this book, but would fall short of its praises. I am a veteran of the armed forces, a Christian, and a patriot of this once great nation. It is not too late to turn the downward spiral we are in around, but one must know where it is coming from. We as citizens have been along for the ride way too long with a mismanaged government of the past and present. This book is fully referenced on all material. Material is from men and women throughout the government agencies and branches and from some of out greatest military leaders of the century. All in the position to know and provide documents,insight and knowlege as to the source of the cancer eating away our Great Nation from the inside out."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"I read most of the book and found nothing about any holocaust hoax mentioned by reviewer \\"ruggero.\\" Looking in the index showed no listing for the word holocaust at all. It might be in there somewhere, but I doubt it. The author seems too smart and too honest to deny the genocide against the Jews and numerous others in Hitler's regime.What I did find were plenty of impressively documented pieces of evidence that both FDR and Truman knowingly allowed communists to crawl throughout their administrations, even up to the level of positions advising the president. Furthermore, it's rather obvious that Truman passively helped the communist forces of Mao tse Tung take over the nation of China. He did that by cutting off aid to the Nationalists. Before that of course he winked while Stalin scooped up all of Eastern Europe.Great book, important work, should be a part of everyone's library for quotes and reference value. Plus America needs to become more informed so we can combat the enemies of truth, those infesting and controlling the Democratic party and the mainstream news networks. Yes, that makes me sound like a conspiracy nut. The problem is, if there really were a conspiracy, what would we call the people who figure it out? That's me, nut or whatever."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"The Iron Curtain Over America&quot; is a most pertinent and excellently presented treatise on the cancer on our national set-up. &quot;I hope this book has had, and will have, the widest possible dissemination, particularly to our leaders-in Washington, and in industry and the press, -- and that our leaders who are &quot;uncontaminated&quot; will have their serious attention engaged by it."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Great book. Interesting theory about how the first half of the 20th century unfolded in America and Europe. Beaty had his critics, but they also tended to think that Senator McCarthy was delusional and that noticing the extraordinary power of Jews in America was \\"anti-Semitic.\\" lol(Of course, if you know much about the 1960's, then you know that neither of those charges are true)."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"U.S. Army intelligence officer and SMU professor reveals the communist infiltration of the U.S. government during and after the Second World War and examines the roles of the Jews in Marxism and subversive activities.

Originally published in 1951, scholar and WWII intelligence officer Beaty's classic diagnoses America's condition in mid-century and finds our land threatened by the cancerous growth of Communist and Zionist subversion and control. The extraordinarily well-informed and courageous Beaty was one of the first Americans to breach the Iron Curtain of silence guarding the Holocaust hoax and the Middle East mess, and to call (in vain) for Americans to clean out the Augean stables of New York, Washington, and Hollywood. A revisionist classic."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"The author, a true patriot in an era when the Conspiracy first openly reared its head and showed its cards, here delineated the origins and goals of the group which was then seeking to undermine America and whose plans are now about come to fruition, with the current complete submission of the remains of America to their malignant will.The information in this book will not be revelatory to anyone who is the least familiar with the suppressed history of East and West over the past 100 years. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a primer to the modern-day uninitiated because, although the author covers all the bases, his presentation leaves something to be desired, as he can be a bit scattershot and cursory in his treatment of too many complex and heterodox subjects. Neverthless, as a historical document, it's valuable to a modern scholar for the details he presented about the Truman Administration's treason, of which we might have forgotten or never been aware; and for the big picture as a whole which he presented to the American people of the era.That, I think, is one of the most horrifying things I've taken away from the book: the American people_knew_. They had the facts, from this source and a thousand others, back in the 40s and 50s and they still re-elected the blatant traitors who were openly subverting their own country. Yes, the patriotic reaction made a great effort and almost achieved critical mass, but the majority never bought into it. Why? I suppose they were simply were too gullible to doubt the propaganda from the liberal media, too co-opted by federal and state government jobs and handouts, too busy, too corrupt, too apathetic and just plain too stupid. If the far healthier America of the 1950s couldn't resist the Conspiracy, what hope does preset-day degenerate, deracinated and dimwitted America have?The author's solution to the great problem of internal treason was to write letters to the editor and to one's Congressman; in other words, to \\"wake America up\\" with information, the Right's great nostrum since the days of FDR. It makes one wistful to think that we once lived in an America of such hope and fairness that this tactic was once taken seriously by earnest people. Alas, we no longer live in such an America. The undeniable fact is that normal Americans are now permanently outnumbered due to unlimited immigration, federal dependency, moral perversion and cradle-to-grave, 24/7 indoctrination, and no amount of successful \\"waking up\\" is going to change demographics or simple mathematics. The Enemy is now the American majority whose material interests, ethnic privilege or desired perversions are inextricably tied up with the success of the Federal entity, as we have seen in the victorious coalition of last presidential election. Voting is hopeless and democratic change is getting more and more risible with every passing day. The only choice left to us, the only choice forced upon us by the spiritually diseased Evil that rules us, is Resistance or Death."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Great book for our times. Highly recommended in this day and age. Goes to show that nothing has changed from history."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Regardless of what you think of the author's views on Jewish roots and influence...today, we do have an iron curtain over America.

Excuse me...time to watch American Idol...the Roman Circus of 21st century."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"I tried to read all of Colonel Beaty's book but found the contents burdensome although adequately descriptive.Much of it is buried in an era (1945-1950's) when concerns about Communism were in their heyday.The author:*Exposed Khazar Soviet influence*Was Pro Semitic (Pro Arabic)*Exposed some Invisible Government*Gave a slightly sane \\"Right Wing Extremist\\" view*Revealed major media problems in the USA*Proved that some fine folks in Texas were Pro Arabic*Exposed some powerful selfish interest politics*Was diametrically opposed to New York City politics*Offered adequate accurate citationsHowever, its use of \\"native\\" or American refers to immigrants rather than real Americans (\\"Indians\\"), although it correctly uses the adjective \\"Semitic\\" to describe Arabic and genuine Middle Eastern people, rather than central Asians west Asians.Completely crazy propositions by Beaty to establish a large entanglement of Pentagon military bases in Western Europe and the Middle East was probably part of an attempt to completely control Arabian oil rather than setting up despotic tyranical puppet regimes as has been the case for the past century.If You are looking for a book that will quench your thirst for knowing about activities \\"behind the scenes\\" in many socialist-affected societies, from a military intelligence perspective, then this book can be revealing.If You are interested in discovering and testing different perspectives, from an \\"extreme\\" side of politics, and are very interested in actual history and US politics from 1000 A.D. to the late 1940's and early 1950's, then this book is also revealing.However, if You are looking for a truly delightful rewarding book with a positive outlook and effective solutions, that could help discipline and limit the Military Industrial Complex of the New World Order then look elsewhere.The author was too much a hawk for a dove like me."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"Boy, I love these types of books. Printed in the height of the Cold War, Beaty sees just about every Democratic leader as a stooge for Communism, and every Republican leader as the last line of defense against the gathering Red hordes. Hilarious! In its defense, there is some good information on the frustration that President Truman had as the Chinese revolution was taking form.That said, this book was most certainly a John Birch Society pick of the week, right along with the dangers of fluoridation, integration, and secret radio waves emitting from televisions which transmit signals from Joseph Stalin.Read this to understand the thinking of the early extreme Right Wing, which today feels at home with the likes of Pat Buchanan, etc."},{"Title":"The Iron Curtain over America","review":"This notorious book is a thinly-veiled antisemitic attack on Jews claiming they are behind a vast conspiracy to undermine the United States and deliver it to the communist Soviet Union. It has clearly attracted rave reviews from Holocaust deniers and other Jew-bashing conspiracy theorists."},{"Title":"The Discus: An Owner's Guide toa Happy Healthy Fish (Happy Healthy Pet)","review":"This book is a complete waste of money. I'd give it a negative number of stars if I could. What's so bad about it then? It is simply a beginners guide to aquarium keeping (and not a very good one at that) with a few mentions of discus thrown in to make it sound as if it is a discus book.The photographs are OK as far as photography goes, but most of the fish pictured are poor specimens including the malformed discus pictured on the cover. Many of the photos are re-used in different parts of the book, occasionally in reverse as if there was an attempt to disguise the fact that the pictures were being re-used. The captions have nothing to do with the photos. There is a picture of a fish with holes in it's head and another of a fish with early stages of fin rot, but neither of these pictures are used in the section on diseases and the captions do not point out these defects. There is no identification of the strains being pictured and virtually no photos of wild specimens to help in identifying the 2 species and 5 subspecies that are briefly described in the text.There is a section on the history of the discus, but important names such as Jack Wattley, Carrol Friswold, and Gene Wolfsheimer are conspicuous by their absence.A lot of the information is redundant and contradictory. For example on page 39 we find &quot;One way to estimate which size heater your aquarium will need is to allow 5 watts per gallon. For example, a 55-gallon aquarium would need a heater that is at least 275 watts&quot;. Meanwhile, on page 54 we read &quot;A heater should supply 2 watts per gallon. So, a 55-gallon aquarium would need at least a 110-watt heater&quot;. Now which do think the authors would have you use? Of course they also don't mention that nobody actually manufactures heaters of those wattages (they can readily be found in 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250 and 300 watts).On the whole, this is one of those books that seems to regurgitate a bunch of stuff that has become &quot;standard knowledge&quot; in the aquarium hobby, without really knowing why these things have become so (or the science behind it). On page 80 in a side box on bare tank set-ups, we are admonished that these are &quot;less cozy for your fish&quot;, whatever that is supposed to mean. I doubt that &quot;coziness&quot; is anything we can measure or the fish can give us feedback on in the same way that they behave if their water is too warm.On page 47 there is an extremely poor and misleading diagram of the nitrogen cyle. It implies that the major source of ammonia in the aquarium is the fungal and bacterial decomposition of fish &quot;wastes&quot; (feces?). The major source of ammonia is: it is directly exhaled into the water from fishes gills. There is also no mention of the relationship of pH to ammonia ionization, which is critical to be aware of in the low pH of a discus tank, particularly with regards to water changes and the usually accompanying rise in pH.There are a lot of other points I could raise, but time constraints prevent me. In summary, this book is a complete waste of money. Just about any book would be better, but if price is a concern the T. Giovanetti book is far better in this price range. I haven't seen M. Sweeney's discus book, but I have seen other things she has written and although I don't really care for her, even her book has got to be better than this one. Even better, spend a little extra and get something by B. Degen, J. Wattley, or J. Quarles. With the price of discus being what it is, if you can afford to keep them, you can afford one of the better books."},{"Title":"The Discus: An Owner's Guide toa Happy Healthy Fish (Happy Healthy Pet)","review":"I recently had the pleasure of purchasing, and reading, &quot;The Discus:An owner's guide to a Happy Healthy fish.&quot; This book is a great source of information for beginning hobbysts who would like to try their hand at breeding these gorgeous fish from South America.

He was also one of the authors of \\"The God that Failed.\\"This book is definitely not one of Koestler's best known works. But I enjoyed it. It is a collection of some of Koestler's essays, dating from 1946 to 1955.The very first essay shows a clear moral dilemma. If one refuses to make any sacrifices for the sake of society, society will be destroyed. If one sacrifices everything for the supposed sake of society, society will also be destroyed. Where does one draw the line?There is a very interesting article on the Hiss-Chambers case. Koestler notes that Chambers was attacked as a renegade ex-Communist. And Koestler quite properly ignored some confusing elements of the case (some of what Hiss was accused of looked dubious, but Hiss' intent to help the Communists was pretty much unchallenged). I think the result is a very reasonable defence of Chambers.We also see an article on Judaism, where Koestler suggests that all Jews either go to Israel or renounce Judaism. Well, um, that's really up to them, isn't it? It is sort of like asking all Mormons to move to America or renounce Mormonism. Still, I found this idea interesting, although I certainly do not agree.There is a hilarious story about what Russia might be like after the fall of Communism there. And the book finishes with the title essay, which discusses the dramatic increase in destructive power available to us humans in recent times, along with (according to Koestler) a corresponding decrease in moral strength."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Don't let the title of this book convince you that it's only for people who are divorced or divorcing.

The Law of Surrender is one of my favorites, as it regularly helps me remember to cease resisting my life as it is, and trust that I'm loved held and supported by something larger than myself.If these ideas resonate with you, please go to: www.debbieford.com for information on other useful materials and trainings."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Personally, I did not find this book helpful or uplifitng - the content is too \\"fluffy\\" during a time when difficult decisons are being made. Might be a better read down the line after the divorce is final and you are moving on. Maybe it's the book for you if you are a big Debbie Ford fan. Books can be trial and error - this was an error for me."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book, and the Spiritual Divorce Coaching Process, has changed my life beyond anything I could have imagined. If you're carrying around wounds from any past or current relationship, this book and the exercises included will help heal your heart so that you can love again."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book came highly recommended by my therapist and I see why. Also note that it is not based in religion. Do not confuse spiritual with a set belief system. I was not the party that was left in my marriage as was the author. I do find her insight on recoverying ones true self helpful. Healing verses stuffing the pain and telling yourself that time heals all wounds, it does not."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Thank you Debbie Ford for writing such an amazing book on divorce. In order for there to be more peace in the world it must start in your own heart and in your own home so that it can be passed on to the future generations. This book gets to that heart of the matter. This book is only for the people who want to work through thier pain and anguish to fully understand what may have brought them to that place to begin with, so that the \\"problems\\" they faced can lead them to the relationship that was meant to be in the first place. With themselves."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I found this book while going through my own divorce after 22 years of marriage, and I can honestly say it changed the trajectory of my life. Full of fear and rage, I imagine I would have unknowingly placed my children smack in the middle of the battle. Instead, Debbie walked me through an incredible step by step process that allowed healing and growth and the ablility to help my girls through that painful time. Using the tools in this book, I was able to understand that I could choose my perspective about how this divorce would affect me, which in turn would affect my daughters. Without Debbie's book I don't think my ex and I would be friends today or be able to still spend time together (all four of us) as a family. This is a MUST read for anyone going through or considering a divorce."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"wow! the information and suggestions in this book really have helped me to mature and reach beyond myself. ford writes in an excellent style that inspires you to greater things. i was very impressed with this work. for many guys, her approach and vocabulary might be seen as a pie-in-the-sky approach. while probably true, if you can look beyond that to the message that she offers, it is well worth it. this book is very affordably priced and is worth the purchase, new or used."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Debbie Ford provided some excellent ideas to focus on making divorce a life affirming catalyst for your future. During this time we all find it difficult to see how to view divorce as a positive step, we feel have failed. But her ideas and exercises help you see how everything is happening as it should and how to take the lessons learned to design a happier future. I found it useful in reframing my thoughts to focus on forgiveness as well as designing a new life that works for me. A great addition for everyone considering divorce or already finding themselves in the midst of one."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I have read several books on divorce and this is by far the best!! It is a MUST if you have gone a through a divorce and are serious about recovering and moving on. I say the last sentence because while much of the book is calming and reassuring there are sections that will challenge and force you to really look at your part in the divorce. Lastly, this book is not just for people who have gone through a divorce, but for anyone in a relationship. BUY IT!!! READ IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This is a book that adopts elements of spiritual transformation that are proven successful. It misses the mark completely by implying that divorce \\"happens\\" rather than being the result of the shortcomings of one, or both, partners, and forgoes an investigation of what these shortcomings could be, and how to heal them. Yet, it is right in expressing the force that a traumatic event like divorce can have on an individual, normally the one being \\"dumped\\", to promote personal transformation. If the divorce is the result of a consensual split, the couple will likely learn little. Likewise, the \\"dumper's\\" learning from the experience tends to be precious little too, so much so that statistically the same errors are then replayed in other relationships.Outside of chemical abuse, physical abuse, severe mental illness, marriages are as a rule repairable, through the commitment to be compassionate, understanding, forgiving and appreciative of the other. It is the childish self-centeredness of many of us that destroys marriages, the unwillingness to be loyal and forgiving, and the lack of desire to give to the partner what one desires to receive. We are all keen to demand what we want, but stingy in behaving the way we would want our partner to behave with us.This book is in many ways naive. A useless exercise that skips the meat of relationships, including the need to identify what led us to select the partner we married, and how this points to what needs to be healed in ourselves.I do NOT recommend this book. Focus instead on \\"Real Love in Marriage\\" by Dr. Baer, and \\"Is it love, or is it addiction\\" by Brenda Schaeffer, to understand the how and why relationships break down, and, most importantly the lessons to be learned. Being in sintony with one's values, that is DOING (acting) in such a way that life follows the course of you deepest values is a most difficult exercise, that however, will bring true freedom. Most cases of divorce hinge on one , or both, partners succumbing to the shadow (in a Jung-ian sense), and being at its mercy, rather than refocusing and acting in harmony with what your deepest beliefs are, as well as exposing and understanding our dark side."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"How sick and tired I was of telling everyone in my life the sad tale of my divorce. \\"My husband never came through for me, he wasn't who I thought he was, he let me down...\\" bla, bla, bla.... Until I read this book and came in contact with Debbie Ford's work, I thought I had no other choice but to drag my victim story around with me. How wrong I was!Little did I know that hidden within my rage about how my husband never came through for me was the realization that I know how to take care of myself! When I let go of the disappointment that he never provided financially for our family I suddenly unleashed my own earning potential (after I stopped waiting for him to do it!). Honestly, nothing has made such a change in my life - both my inner world and my outer world -- as the process outlined in this book.If you are a parent and are going through or have gone through a divorce, I would also highly recommend Ford's audio program called The Essentials of Extraordinary Parenting - A Self-Guided Coaching Program."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This is a very insightful, sensitive and comprehensive map to help anyone deal with pain in general, not relationship pains only. I loved it! I also love the idea of turning negative events into something positive for yourself.

It helped me to heal and move on. This book was better then therapy."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book is amazing and I scoured the shelves of bookstores and online to find something that really spoke to me. I continue to recommend it and it is a loving way to move on, in spite of pain and heart ache.The exercises may seem boring or trite, yet they help to see how we make the choices that we make and how to empower ourselves to feel our feelings, speak up and be respectful all at the same time. If you are looking toward a spiritual path this is your answer!!!Divorce is not something I planned on, nor something I would ever want anyone to go through and yet this was one of those &#34;life savers&#34; or &#34;life preservers&#34; that helped me to move forward and do it with dignity. Taking responsibility for my actions, even when I didn't want to. This book is profound and should be sold everywhere.Thank you, Debbie, that you could share your intimate experience and I could be so touched by it and relate to everything you expressed. I am forever grateful! My friends who have gone through divorce have also expressed their thanks for lending it to them!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This is a wonderful read for anyone trying to get through a divorce.

Thank you Debbie!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"For anyone who wants to approach divorce from a healthy and healing mindset, this is the book for you. I have returned to it frequently as I navigate my divorce. It gives me strength to not get stuck in the negativity and anger that can surround everyone during (and after) a divorce. THANK YOU, Debbie Ford!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Debbie Ford proposes a new idea to me. Accept light and dark within yourself and make friends with your story. Own your story and don't let it own you otherwise I'd be in trouble. Profit from your story, not let it profit from you. I liked some of her ideas/suggestions, like focusing on the gifts your marriage brought you and doing the work of seeing how you contributed to the failure of the marriage (not just blaming your spouse.)"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book gave very good information presented in an easy to understand manner. The exercises were not difficult to perform and were most helpful. Difficulty in relationships in demise or post demise can be better comprehended through Ford's technique of dissection and repositioning of thought processes. With a little willingness it could help change a person's thinking and lead to having less resentment and anger in life. Highly recommended to those who think love has passed them by, injuring them and that only the very lucky can be happy. Outlooks and attitudes are adjustable, Ford can offer some useful tools in this book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Debbie Ford's book is fabulous. I bought it for a friend but found myself reading it. I found it interesting even for people who are having trouble in their relationship not just those getting divorced.It has wonderful exercises, and some practical tips to help people expand what they think is the end of the lives, when it could be just the beginning!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"When my 15 year marriage came to an end, I was a mess. I was bitter, resentful, hurt, angry, sad, confused, scared and lost. At the insistance of my good friend Tessie, I got this book. It is filled with so much insightful information and helps you see clearly at a moment when all you can see is pure darkness. Through this book I was able to heal, forgive and forget. My marriage taught me many things, my ex-husband was my teacher and this book helped me see that it was all in preparation for a better life that lies ahead.Thank you Debbie for writing this book and sharing the secret to living a better life through our life experiences. I will never be the same again..."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"If you are thinking about ending your marriage, seperated or already divorced, Debbie Ford shines a bright light on the path toward reclaiming your spirit. You can spend years in therapy or sit down and absorb the insights that Debbie offers as she shares candidly and with great passion, the journey to not only heal, but rediscover who you are and where you are headed.In a quote from Proust Debbie captures how we must shift our vision when confronted with the pain, fear, anger and uncertainty that divorce bestows upon us - &quot;The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.&quot;Through Ford's new eyes and personal divorce experience, we learn from and make peace with what we are leaving behind and focus on what new vistas and opportunities are opening up for us. She offers 7 spiritual laws for healing and takes us through these stages with examples that we can all relate to. We begin with acceptance and move along through various stages, including forgiveness and accepting responsiblity. We transform this experience into a new future, filled with the power, energy and knowledge we have gathered from this life lesson.Debbie guides us through this journey with support, warmth and enthusiasm and the reader is left with the vision of unlimited opportunities by seeing tomorrow through &quot;new eyes&quot;. I have read many books on divorce, but none as powerful,hopeful and motivating as &quot;Spiritual Divorce&quot;. Thank you Ms. Ford for lighting the way for me."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"The basic mantra of this book is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot; and until you let go of your anger toward your former SO, you won't heal. This message is repeated over and over, in many very helpful ways.When I was first seperated, I was a victim of cloudy thinking, life as I knew it was over. And while that was true, it has become a spring board for personal growth and a new life. It's the no pain, no gain theory of life. While I would not advocate this life experience as good plan, if it happens to you, you might as well use it as an opportunity to grow.While it has been a number of years since the divorce, I still found some good information about myself within the pages of this book. Plus it was an affirmation that the course I was on is the right one. (Also people thinking about getting married, might do well to read this for the information on how not to choose a mate, as Ms. Ford goes over what happened with her marriage. The misplaced expectations and poor commuincation.)"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"In a deep state of depression, I looked up \\"divorce\\" on Amazon.com, hoping to find something to help me through the pain of my own divorce. Let me state first that I have read several books, dozens perhaps, by so-called \\"life coaches\\" or self-help \\"gurus.\\" While there is wisdom in many of them, none of those books connected to me in any deep, visceral, meaningful way. Then I found this book.I took a chance and ordered it. When it arrived, I began reading it immediately. Within minutes I knew I had made the right decision. Debbie Ford was writing about the EXACT feelings I was having, laying bare the hurt, self-doubt, ego, jealousy, anger etc that was ruling my mind. This wonderful book reached places deep inside my mind and spirit that have been malnourished for years.This book is NOT a bunch of new agey platitudes and superstitious claptrap. It is written in clear, almost conversational tones and is very easy to understand and absorb. I found myself highlighting sentences on EVERY page. It truly is a wonder.Debbie Ford has been through divorce herself, and as a life coach, such a \\"failure\\" could have been disastrous for her. But she realized, as we all must, that divorce is NOT a failure at all. It is an opportunity to learn and grow, to find out what it was we gained from our relationship and how to use that information to better ourselves. It is about acceptance, forgiveness and gratitude, not vindictiveness, fear or jealousy.Relationships don't end. They cannot. They can only change. Those we are tied to in a relationship are tied to us forever, even if only in the seemingly smallest way. A part of us is with them forever, and a part of them is with us. We can spend the rest of our lives bemoaning our fate, wondering why this happened, how could they have done this to us, why does life have to be like this etc, or we can really look at if those are the questions that need answering.Jettison negativity, throw away hurtful thoughts and feelings, rebound from your divorce in a way you never thought possible. I don't know exactly why I chose this book over the dozens of other books available on divorce. I can only come to the conclusion that I was meant to.I had never heard of Debbie Ford before I got this book, and the thought of taking relationship advice from a woman, especially when one had (I thought) just broken my heart, seemed like a stupid idea.I was wrong. This was perhaps the most important book purchase I have made in the last 20 years, if not in my entire life.Will everyone gain what I have from this book? Who can say? I doubt it. Different strokes for different folks. I find it hard to believe that anyone could have a less-than-amazing experience with this book, but I suppose it is possible. If you are experiencing relationship trouble, a divorce, a messy breakup--or even if you aren't and are just looking for insight into the workings of relationships themselves--do yourself a favor and get this book.I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. Every chapter led me to new levels of self acceptance, freedom, forgiveness and hope.The book takes you on a journey through the seven laws for having a spiritual divorce -- acceptance, surrender, divine guidance, responsibility, choice, forgiveness and creation. Each step along the way to healing is punctuated with down-to-earth exercises, examples, and the author's own compelling story.I was totally inspired by this book, and by Debbie Ford's work. I've already recommended it to several of my friends. This book will heal the hearts of everyone who reads it, and could ultimately transform the experience of divorce as we know it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"To express how truly wonderful and helpful and enlightening and potentially life-changing this book is. In a way it's almost unfortunate that the book has the title &quot;Spiritual Divorce: Divorce as A Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life,&quot; because a lot of people are going to pass right by it on the book shelf because they are going to feel it doesn't apply to them. In fact IT APPLIES TO VIRTUALLY ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE BEST THEY CAN BE AND SHARE THAT BEST WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING BE IT IN MARRIAGE, FRIENDSHIPS OR WORK RELATIONSHIPS. In other words, this is NOT just a book for couples contemplating separation or even a book just for couples. Anyone who wants to grow as a human being, get the most from what life and people have to teach them and get rid of the baggage or negative thinking that might prevent -- or is preventing --them from having a healthy, long-lasting loving, productive relationship with another person should read this book.Trust me it is THAT good."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book gave me the tools to end my marriage peacefully and amicably with my now ex-husband. It allowed me to see the end of my marriage not as a failure, but as a success. As I got more into the book, the more excited I became over the rightness in me. I read it while on vacation and when the vacation was over and the marriage was truly winding down, I was able to truly thank my ex-husband for the lessons I learned about myself through him. I could not have done this without this wonderful book. I have since referred this book to many people and all agree that it changes their outlook on divorce in a most positive way.Debbie Ford is a talented, thoughtful writer. As in her book &quot;The Dark Side of the Light Chasers&quot; (another MUST read), she shows you that out of the most painful experiences can sometimes come the most joyful lessons.Everyone contemplating a divorce should read this book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"As a guy who was going through a painful divorce, this book was a Godsend. Although portions of it might be described as \\"psycho-babble\\", for the most part it is nothing other than gold. The chapters on \\"Acceptance\\" and \\"Surrendering\\" changed my healing process dramatically and forever changed my perspective on life. In the darkest times of the divorce, I found myself going back to the book time and time again."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"My belief has always been that \\"There's a reason for everything\\" and along comes Debbie Ford's 'Spiritual Divorce' that not only supports this belief but beautifully illustrates, explains,and embellishes this idea. This book is not only for those that are in the realm of a divorce, but for anyone who wants to (like me) reach a higher level within themselves, and not let other people (or events) negatively affect their attitude toward life. This book is even for those folks who think they're 'OK', that they aren't in need of a 'makeover'...this book gives all who reads it an uplift in their life...it's an intriguing collection of thoughts and ideas and methodologies based on good old fundamental principles, trust in yourself and Fate, and Divine Intervention, and the simple belief that God has a reason for everything.I need a new highlighter after reading this book...a favorite passage is (though there is many): \\"As you can see, you never know how life will turn out or why particular events occur. The Law of Acceptance teaches us that we always evolving, whether we are aware of it or not. What might look like the worst event that has ever befallen you could be part of a brilliantly designed plan that will lead you to a place of fulfillment, peace,and contentment. Accepting your circumstaces instantly relieves you of your internal struggle and frees you to start seeing new possibilities.\\"This book validated, as if it were written for me, almost every fear I knew or didn't know that I had. I learned my own faults through the self-realization practice that Debbie walks the reader through, and was able to talk to my husband honestly about some things for the first time in years. This book is easy reading and had me reading passages over and over in awe as to how much the book talked directly to \\"me\\"...and how articulately yet simply written the whole book is.Another thing I liked about this book is that it talks freely and adamantly about God...not religion, but God and his Divine Intervention. I've always struggled with summing up my personal relationship with God into any particular religion, and thankfully, Debbie talked nothing of religion - but instead of God and the trust we should have in Him that everything happens for a reason. There's a story about angels in here that had me sobbing...with relief...with revelation that we are exactly where are supposed to be.I guarantee that everyone will benefit from this book and while the each of us may walk away focusing on different areas than others, my opinion of Debbie's bottom line will be the same for all of us when reading this: We learn from each and every experience, no matter how bad it is at the time...Every relationship, every life event, is a lesson learned...and most importantly, remember that \\"...there is a very specific reason that we are standing in this exact place at this moment and time.\\"An incredible, excellent book...it's like a bible for the soul. Easily earns it's 5 star rating.Happy reading fellow ... friend, and congratulations on the personal journey you are about to experience through Debbie Fords' 'Spiritual Divorce'."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I never thought I was the type of person to buy self-help books. But this year, when I started experiencing marital problems as well as other personal issues, I stumbled across Debbie Ford's books, and they have literally changed my life (I can't believe I am saying this!).This book helped me earlier in the year make the decision to finally separate from my husband, and it is helping me now as we go through the tedious process of breaking up. Debbie's wonderful insight on ending a new life and beginning another and her personal story of divorce is motivating and comforting and has given me hope for my future and the future of my husband.I think many people going through a separation or divorce feel very alone (I know I do) since you are creating a sea of distance between you and the person to whom you were previously closest. This book has helped me realize that I am not alone and that I have the power, through this difficult time, to create a beautiful life for myself - a life that I deserve. In addition, as a Catholic, I am learning to accept that God can be as much a part of divorce as a part of marriage.I highly recommend this book to anyone experiencing marital problems, contemplating separation or divorce or in the process of a break-up. In addition, I would give a copy to family members or friends of those going through a divorce who also might be having troubles with the situation. I have read a number of Debbie Ford books now, and when I finished reading them, I feel infinitely better about myself and my situation and enlightened in a way.

I returned the book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"If you like gushy mushy gab about relationships, love, and forgiveness, all told in parables and ancedotes, you'll love this book. The slant is from the issue of divorce but it is like thousands of other self-help books out there. If you want practical, analytical help don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"When I went through my divorce 5 years ago I encountered this book and it CHANGED my life! This book stood out from the dozens of other self-help/divorce books by the results I created in my life because of what this book taught me. Spiritual Divorce gave me a roadmap for using this devastating emotional experience as a powerful springboard to a new, more inspired, loving and positive expression of myself. So if your heart has been broken through divorce, or if you've struggled in any kind of relationship, you must read this book. It will guide you, step-by-step, on how to turn lead into gold. As she points out, if we don't get the lessons of why we created these relationships in the first place, we'll simply keep on repeating those patterns in future relationships.

At first I thought \\"why am I reading this book?\\" I'm happy about my decision and I'm not hateful towards my ex. I stuck with it though and am now very glad I did. I found the contents of this book to be so helpful that I just purchased five more copies to give to people I know. This is a book I want to keep so I can refer to it often. Although it is an \\"easy read\\" I would suggest only reading a chapter/section at a time in order to give yourself time to digest the material.

I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking about marriage or is in a serious relationship"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I am not going through a divorce, but like everyone else, I have had relationships that didn't work out the way I hoped. A few friends are going through tough times so I read this book to have an understanding of what they are going through and WOW, was I in for a surprise! This book had so much to say to me on ways I can work on myself so that I can have a better marriage and better relationships with kids, friends, co-workers! If both partners care enough early on to follow her wisdom and guidelines, I think you could prevent divorce with this book.I could not put this book down. As a Christian, I may be talking to a different God than Debbie is, but that didn't slow me down one bit--she has a way with words that cuts through murky, repetetive thoughts and forces you to take responsibility for whatever your situation is in life. I I have read a LOT of self help books, but this one says things in a very practical, non-judgmental way. I can now look at my friends going through divorce, point this book out to them and be happy that there is a bright light at the end of their tunnel. And I believed that before, but I didn't know how to help them believe it until I found this book. Many thanks to you, Debbie."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"It seems that too many women go through the physical act of divorce and then don't divorce on the other levels, so they're still shackled and living with the fallout for too many years after. This book gives some excellent insights and guidance on how to claim your life as your own, once again. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"After reading many books about divorce, this is a real treasure for the spiritual depth it portrays. Being in a long-term marriage however, I find that the information is almost too compassionate toward the other person for helping me to make a decision, but that is not what the book is about. It is more for women who have been in short-term marriages and are still at an age to start over. I am searching for depth and direction as to what would be on the other side after being married for over three decades and not having a regular 9-5 job. So if you are in a quandary, this book may help you to redefine the highest good in another person, but it may not help you to make a painful & necessary decision to end a long-term marriage."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Debbie Ford has accomplished a task that is seemingly impossible to do. She has used her own experiences, and written a book (Spiritual Divorce) that provides the reader a light during a very dark time, gently, logically and with great insight, guiding you from a place of despair to a world of wondrous and unlimited opportunity. I am not a religious person and, given the books title, I almost did not read this book that was presented to me as a gift during a very troubling time in my life. I am so thankful that I did read it. I have often referred to this book as the map that saved me by showing me the way out of a deep and dark place that I, and so many others, had found myself in. What I would say to anyone chancing to read this, is that as devastating as divorce can be to your life, and the many lives around you, it can also be used to set down the first block of a strong foundation to a wonderful and bright future. Let Spiritual Divorce: Divorce as a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life show you how to do this, and use this book as a map to find your way."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"After 17 years of being with my husband, this is just what I was looking for to help me move on."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Whether going thru a divorce, divorced, or in a happy, forever after marriage this book is a must read.It addresses relationship, marriage and family in a way that heals the deepest wounds as well as encouraging true happiness."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book is helpful for any type of split, separation, or end of important personal relationship. A great book to help you move forward."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This book is amazing. It allows you to heal and work through a lot of the issues you have surrounding your divorce. Even if you aren't getting divorced I would recommend this book because it's inspirational and exceptional. I'm now on my third Debbie Ford book and I love her style and ease of writing. She's fun to read and always get's me going ready for a new day!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I recently experienced betrayal in my life and was faced with divorce. This book helped me to survive the initial pain and begin to build a friendship with my wife. I was able to take the practical and spiritual advice of Debbie Ford and apply it to every part of my life and current situation. I dont know what I would have done without this book. It is a gift that I use in my daily life and also began using it with clients that I see in my psychotherapy practice. I plan on recommending this book to all I come into contact facing a divorce. It will make a difference in many live especially where children are involved. the days of drawn out legal battles concerning divorce and custody are over. It is now time to do these things in a mature and enlightened way and Debbie Ford's book is our blue print for this major paradigm shift. Highly recommended to any seperating or divorcing couples."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"It's never an easy thing to discuss. Ms. Ford does a brilliant job of avoiding the 'he said, she said', that regardless of outcome, we were 'meant to be' for awhile. And that we need to live and learn through having loved. The reading helps provide a platform for courageously moving on...and becoming who we are truly meant to be."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"When I picked up this book I had been unwillingly separated for 2 years and was two months away from a divorce I was emotionally fighting every step of the way. I had been in therapy and on and off anti-depressants for a year. I eventually became convinced that I would never be happy again if this divorce went through.In one month, this book did for me what a year of therapy hadn't-it gave me freedom and happiness through helping me understand how (and why) to let go. And, believe me, when I started to read, the LAST thing I intended to do was let go. A month later, I ended up sailing through my divorce hearing with a positive attitude and an eye on the future.We've heard a lot of what Ms. Ford says in this book before but, somehow, she says it differently. I'm not sure what exactly is different, but Ms. Ford's openness about her own pain and transformation fortifies her credibility and is what made this book unique and palatable for me.Believe it or not, through this read, I have come to realize that my divorce is the best thing that ever happened to me when it comes to personal growth. EVERYONE (not just divorc&eacute;s/divorc&eacute;es) who has ever had a hard time letting go of or forgiving others or themselves can benefit from reading this. Spiritual Divorce has helped me to understand how to be happy again. In fact, it has given me the strength to be TRULY happy for the first time in my life. You won't want to go back after this one."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This is a great book for someone who has never been aware of their spiritual nature through out a divorce. I found it redundant and a bit boring a slow read. I read alot of Deepak Chopra books. i got the impression she was trying to mimic his style - not possible. I then learned that she was a student of his. It may resonate with you I hope that it does. Best of luck to you in your transition to a good life."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Certainly not a &#34;spiritual&#34; book in the Christian sense. It has its merits and good, practical suggestions. A similar book based on Christian theology would be more powerful."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I love to read, and I read very well, but this book is difficult to follow. It is wordy, contains one analogy after another and quotes from various people, all of which confuse the point the author was trying to make. I started reading it thoroughly, then began skimming, then reading the first sentence or two of paragraphs that weren't describing the author's divorce, then I finally quit, and threw it away. I hate to throw away a book, but this one is blather."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"This is an excellent, slim little book. It's one of those books which improve every time you read it -- and you should read it more than once. If you're recently separated and feel as if your life is topsy-turvy, read this book. Then, read it again a few months later. Your perspective shifts and you get something else, equally valuable and meaningful. If you do proceed to divorce, read it again. Again, you will find something new which will help you go on to build a wonderful life for yourself.I agree that this book is not just for married people. It's for anyone who has felt betrayed in an intimate relationship of any sort. Debbie Ford stresses that it's your life and your spirituality which must be upheld, even in the darkest of times. This book goes a long way toward helping you do just that."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"After getting divorced, I was aimlessly wandering through the day so uncertain of everything. I then learned of this book from the Oprah Show. After reading it, I was a completely different person with a new attitude. Debbie Ford has done a great job in writing this from her own experience. It helps you to rethink the divorce process and how you think of your ex as well as yourself. It is uplifting and brings perspective to this troubling time in someone's life. If anyone out there is looking for a good book to assist you in your thoughts of divorce-this is the book for you!!!!! I have read it several times and it always has a positive impact on meeach time I read it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I have never been married but I've gone through enough painful break ups to really want this book. It's through this book that I finally saw a way to work through my pain, loss, and grief. I can finally say that since I've read this book my whole view on relationships has changed and transformed. I've never been more excitied and thrilled to engage in a brand new relationship. I 'm blessed that this book showed up at the perfect time in my life."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I've read several books on divorce trying to get through mine. This is one book that I just didn't get much out of. The author had not had a long term marriage when she divorced. She lived with one partner, then lived with another, got pregnant, married, and then divorced after a short time. This was just nothing like my situation so I suppose that's why I didn't finish the book. I'd been married 30+ years when I discovered my husband had been unfaithful most of the marriage. This book just seemed too New Age for my level of anger/betrayal. The book that most helped me so far is When He Leaves. However, I'm sure this book is helpful for lots of open-minded younger people."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Every once in a while a book comes along that changes and redirects lives in a new and empowering ways. Spirtual Divorce is one of those books. Whether you are currently going though a separation, experiencing a loss or suffering from carrying resentment from a previous break-up, separation or loss, Spiritual Divorce has the formula for healing your emotional wounds and giving you back an inspiring and powerful vision for your life. This book is a must read for anyone wanting heal from any emotional wound.This book no only healed my heart, it healed my children's hearts and gave me a great friendship with their Mother my ex. I use this book eveyday in all my relationships and it works.Read it and change your life forever."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I knew within a few short months that my marriage was in trouble. For 9 years I did nothing but let the pain and resentment build. Do I stay married and let the pain and loneliness continue? What would it do to my children? Or do I get a divorce? If I do, then what? What would happen to me? How would I be able to survive on my own?When I listened to my inner wisdom, I knew divorce wasn't for me. My husband wanted to make things work and so did I. But how? I wanted to find a way to grow from my mistakes. I wanted to find a way to bring more romance and fun into my life. I wanted an extraordinary marriage! Do you want this too?How?Read Spiritual Divorce and heal your heart.Spiritual Divorce was the turning point in my marriage and I avoided reading it for months because of the title. This book gives you practical steps to take to use your relationship struggles as a catalyst for an extraordinary life instead of your sturggles using you.By reading Spiritual Divorce, I realized that I co-created what was going on around me in my marriage. Once I came to this realization, my reality shifted. I realized that because I control my own destiny, I truly had the choice of being happy or being miserable.So it should come as no surprise that my favorite Spiritual Divorce Law is the Law of Choice. It states, \\"Having taken responsibility, we can choose new interpretations that empower us...\\"I could have easily chosen a Negative Interpretation of my marriage: My husband is only here on this earth to make me miserable. He gets a kick out of ruining my life! He is a horrible husband!But thankfully, I instead chose a Positive Interpretation of my marriage. And now, thanks to that very same husband, I can now stand on my own! Because of the turmoil in my life, I am now in a position to support others going through similar pain.What a truly powerful gift I received from my husband -- AND such a gift from Debbie Ford! Thank you for having the courage to write this book!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"If you've already got a pretty good handle on your divorce or separation, skip this book. I was expecting to discuss how to use my divorce as a springboard for an authentic, self -actualized life; instead I got lessons in how to put myself in my spouse's shoes, and other words of advice useful in salvaging what's left of the relationship with my spouse. I've done that work, I've agononized over this decision and see my present/future relationship with my spouse as business I have to attend to, in a professional way, as we raise our son. I'm past my spouse, and wish him nothing but the best as we continue to co-parent our son. Divorce will be the catalyst for my extraordinary life, but it will be a life I forge without the help of this book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I was given this book by my daughter. I had been divorced for over 20 years ... I thought I don't need this book. But at her urging I read it and what I discovered was it allowed me to heal old wounds and resentments that I had been caring for 20 years ... many of which I am sure lead to my heart dis-ease. This is a book about finding your spiritual connection no matter what caused you to get disconnected in the first place.I am forever grateful to Debbie Ford and her vulnerability fo sharing her own life wounds in this book to help us all heal."},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"Entering into my second divorce, I was clear that I did not want to repeat the same mistakes that I had in all of my previous relationships. Debbie's book guides the way to begin to make peace with your past, heal your heart and begin a new life. As someone who has spent a lot of time being a victim and blaming my partner, I was able to see my part in the downfall of the relationship and to take responsibility for that (without feeling shame - WOW! That in itself is extraordinary and worth the price of the book 100 times over!) There is a quote that Debbie uses in her book from Virginia Satir, \\"Life is not the way it's supposed to be, it's the way it is. The way you cope with it is what makes the difference.\\" That is the profound thing about this book. If you do the exercises at the end of each chapter and you truly do what she recommends, I can pretty much guarantee you that you will come out of your divorce with a renewed sense of purpose, joy and gratitude for all that has happened and some great coping skills that will help you with all of your relationships!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Divorce: Divorce As a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I have been divorced for 6 years, and found this book to be an amazing gift to my life. The exercises, the shifting of my perspective, the healing of my emotions....I never expected to have such a transformation from Debbie Fords insightful guidance. I have no doubt that I will attract a wonderful mate into my life as I continue to put into practice the insight I received from this and The Dark Side of the Light Chasers. Thank you Ms. Ford!"},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"No writer in the last half of the 20th century was better at character development than McMurtry. In &quot;Terms&quot; he introduced us to Aurora Greenway; here he he expands and burnishes her character while he folds in a supporting cast of almost equally fascinating lesser characters. This was one of those rare tomes I wished would never end. You don't have to like her, but if you finish this book unaffected by la Greenway, you'd best read it again. Aurora's successful plan to ensure her young Grandson would never forget her is one of the most moving sequences I have ever read. Two years after first reading this novel and I still well up just thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"The continuing saga of Aurora Greenway, her friends, and her family is a random, lengthy read without much purpose and very little direction. Most of the 637 pages vacillate between Aurora's selfish, laughable, and audacious behavior, and that of her strange, absurd family members. Because there is so little emotional development, it is difficult to sympathize with any of the characters being presented. They fall in love quickly but somehow do not seem to really care about anyone but themselves. This makes the reader less inclined to be concerned about how any events will affect anyone else due to the cavalier attitude toward others or their plights.Unlike other McMurtry books, I was not drawn into the world being portrayed and did not enjoy the quirky behavior or the stories being presented. McMurtry's normally masterful story-telling did not find fruition in this book. Aside from the last 80 pages or so, most of the book seemed random and non goal-oriented, without any sense of mystery or tension or even curiosity as to what will happen, making the story and the people sort of lifeless. I was happy to be done and generally disappointed with the book.But not all was vapid, for some of the characters did grow through their experiences and improve their own lot in life. Aurora was a complex person and it was fun seeing her adjust through the challenges of life's battles and deal with the aging process. I still laugh when I try to figure out why she won't sing while stopped at stoplights! Many of the minor characters were introduced through their odd past and their current reactions to the situations in which they found themselves, and many were quite enjoyable people and very funny at times. The pervading sadness of the book, the deaths and the tragedies, was balanced with personal victories and positive circumstances, making Evening Star a fascinating study in people's motives as well as the bittersweet realities of life.Not my favorite McMurtry book for sure, but enough redeeming qualities and interesting people to make it worth reading."},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"McMurtry's characters become so real to me that I can barely stand to let them go at the end of his books. I am so glad that I got to see what happened to the people from Terms of Endearment."},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"In typical McMurtry style, there is a good deal of humor and whimsy in this novel. For the first 400 pages or so I felt it was a bit overdone, but once I saw where the novel was headed, it made perfect sense. About the ultimate destination of the novel: it packs quite an emotional punch. Rare indeed is the novel that can make me cry, but this one did it."},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"Larry McMurty gives us another masterpiece of humor and tears in the continued saga of Aurora Greenway"},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"I loved this book, I read Terms of Endearment first and I cried at the end of both of the books. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"Somewhat of a disappointment when compared against other McMurty books. Slow at times but gets better toward the end. It does not compare to Last Picture Show."},{"Title":"The Evening Star","review":"This book deals with many of the issues related to aging, regrets, impact of one life and legacy one leaves behind. It is humorous at times and deeply moving at others. I read this when I was younger as a sequel to \\"Terms of Endearment\\" but rereading it at this stage of my life has placed this book on my top ten list."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"I can't understand why John Christopher isn't better known. Since discovering him in the last few months, I've searched for and read everything I could find. His best books should have made him as well-known as some of his contemporaries like Richard Matheson and Ray Bradbury.This book is one of his best. A group of people snowed in to a small resort while something alien takes them, one by one. There are moments that frighten as well as a movie. The story builds with a quiet suspense, just under the surface, and pays off with a plausible, strong ending.I like gory, flashy Stephen King novels a lot. But John Christopher's English, stoic, thoughtful horror/science fiction is a great change of pace. This one will stay with me for a long time.Other great John Christopher books include No Blade of Grass, if you can find it, and Wrinkle in the Skin."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"I have never read this book for myself. My father read this story to my brothers and I when we were younger. I cannot stress to you the profound impact this book has had upon me. The fear that John Christopher creates, the very fight for ones own identity is gripping and terrifying. To think that these possessors can take all that you are and shut it away so powerfully that nothing you do can change that, or unlock it, or ever communicate outside of yourself again, is one of them ost frightening concepts that I have ever seen or heard in printed page or word.John Christopher creates believable characters, not all of them very nice people. As they try and cope with the horror that descends upon them, one cannot help but iagine that you ytourself are transported to that Swiss Chalet, cut off from all humanity, from all aid. And there are people out there waiting to take you. I have found this book in my thoughts and in my dreams many times. This is not one that will ever leave you once yo have read it. It is truly unforgettable. It will possess you too.Do not read this book unless you are willing to change yourself forever."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was a teenager and I have been looking for a copy of my own ever since (I had forgotten the title and finally tracked it down). The story with its vivid characters has stayed with me for thirty years. The author made me feel as though I was in the lodge with the trapped guests and staff, feeling the dread they feel, sharing their helplessness. Find this book and read it!!"},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"yes yes I know i rate a lot of stuff highly. The thing is I bought these BECAUSE I had already read them and loved them. This one gave me gooseflesh. I think of this book whenever I see snow now. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"This novel creeps up on you. It's rather a take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and has somewhat the feel of an sf B-movie. In other words, it's flawed but frightful fun. Some of the usual tropes: a snowed-in group of ski vacationers; a kid who finds something in the snow, drops dead, then miraculously revives... but changed; the one-by-one recruitment of individuals from the group into becoming like the boy; the slow realization of what is happening; the siege mentality and the need to save the world from this encroachment. Sounds like a lot of sf movies you've seen, doesn't it? Paranoia mixed with an undue confidence in man's ingenuity and resilience. And this book pulls it off with some real chills (pun intended). That's its best characteristic. But the major flaw comes from the characters. First off, the story shifts across the perspective of four of the main characters, thereby losing some of its force. Does it thereby gain in scope? I don't think so. Douglas, the first person we meet, is an utter bore who never rises to the crisis in any meaningful way. As it turns out, none of the characters is very gripping. Rather a dull lot, really. We get inside their heads alright, but yawning all the way. This is a major weakness in the story. I can see that the author may have been correlating the emotional deadness of the people with the total depersonalization effected by the \\"possessors.\\" There's some art in that. But not much excitement."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was a teen and remember loving it then. About a year ago my younger brother had purchased the tripod trilogy dvds (The Tripods as it's known, a bbc production I believe) which is based on the four books also written by John Christopher. I watched them and realized suddenly that I had forgotten about all the excellent works John Christopher had so I bought this book, as I seem to remember thinking it was the best one I had ever read outside the Tripod Trilogy.I anyone was a fan of the \\"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers\\" idea this book is for them. The story opens with the near extinction of the Possessors, a race of beings who have no physical bodies of their own except that of a strange blue glowing orb that houses their seed. One of they're seeds floats though space for eons only to arrive on Earth where it waits for more eons encased in ice and snow to be discovered, of course, by a small boy vacationing with his parents in the Alps after an avalanche traps them and several other guests at the local chalet. So one by one the guests, who are trapped and isolated there until the snow is cleared, are possessed by the possessors whose goal is to ultimately take over the whole human race.John Christopher develops the characters very well in this one I think. The only thing about this book I didn't care for is the amount of seemingly padded scenes that comprised the segments between the action sequences. I realize the author did this for character development, but it was excessive. The other drawback with the book that doesn't hinder the story much is the fact that given the book was written in the 1950's or 60's, and in another country (England I believe) the slang and terms used a lot in the book are harder to understand if one is younger and American or other. That aside, great book for nearly all ages and worth reading if you like classic type science fiction."},{"Title":"The possessors","review":"An exciting and well written novel even if you're not a fan of science fiction.

Recognizing the healing effect of journaling, The Remembering with Love Journal gently guides the reader through the experience of grief and healing.The journal covers fifty-nine weeks and is designed with some initial structure for identifying one's thoughts and feelings. Each page contains an affirmation for support, along with suggestions for reflection and journaling. The journal is divided into five sections, beginning with \\"The Early Days\\" and \\"The Early Weeks.\\" One theme contained within these sections is A Changed Life. The reader is provided the following statements for reflection and response:... a vivid, positive memory I have of the two of us.... what my loved one's life meant to me.... another time in my life when change was painful.The next sections, \\"The Uneven Path\\" and \\"The Continuing Journey Towards Healing\\" are intended to address the concerns and struggles of working to heal and survive.The last section, \\"Beyond the First Year,\\" recognizes that grief does not end at the anniversary and provides avenues for continued support. A theme within this section is Drawing Strength, which is clearly expressed in the following affirmation, \\"The death of my loved one has changed me. I will draw upon my loved one's legacy of love for strength.\\"The journal contains quotes from those who are grieving the death of a spouse, parent, child, relative and friend.

Through delightful personal anecdotes and voyages ranging from the nature of the creative process to voice spectograms illustrating the difference between a good speaker and a weak one, Underhill provides the reader with a brilliantly written, wise, and funny book about the nature of public presentation. The book is amply illustrated with woodcuts and sketches driving his points home. As a teacher I cannot stress how useful this book is. I have recommended it to a program designed to teach teachers how to teach (better). Many books of this nature are deadly to read--this one is great. His chapter called &quot;The Morning After&quot; alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Khrushchev's Shoe and Other Ways to Captivate an Audience of 1 to 1,000","review":"Think of selling this show to network, even PBS, executives. One walks into the office and says, &quot;I have a great idea for a TV how-to show where a guy goes out and cuts down a tree, then he teaches you to use traditional hand tools and make it into a replica of the chair in which Jefferson sat while he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Once you watch it, you can go out and do it yourself! Whaddya think?&quot; One would have to expect as ungraceful an exit from the producer's office as the construction worker who found the singing frog in the classic Warner Bros. cartoon.Well, that is exactly the show, The Woodwright's Shop, that Roy Underhill has been able to keep on television for more than 20 years. Of course, if most hobbyist woodworkers are going to watch a &quot;how-to&quot; show and make something presented by the host, they are more likely to follow Norm Abrams' measured drawings and run to Home Depot for the lastest tool to really make the sawdust fly. But, audiences watch Underhill's show not only for the extreme mastery he shows of his craft, but also his mastery of captivating an audience with a great storytelling approach.This is the essence of Krushchev's Shoe. Roy Underhill takes what he has learned in demonstrating a craft totally foreign to modern audiences, both on his television show and at Colonial Williamsburg, and shares it with his readers so that we may become better communicators.This book is helpful to anyone who dreads standing before a crowd and opening one's mouth. It is particularly helpful though to those of us who train others to be effective communicators. Museum professionals, theme park managers, teachers, etc, may all find some use in the suggestions Underhill makes in Krushchev's Shoe."},{"Title":"Khrushchev's Shoe and Other Ways to Captivate an Audience of 1 to 1,000","review":"There are so many dumb books on the communication process this one is really great and different.

No woodworking, but still packed with wit, wisdom and his entertaining style of writing which always captures the reader's attention."},{"Title":"Whisky and Scotland","review":"This book feels like sitting with Neil Gunn and sharing a wee dram as he relates the history of whisky and extols its virtues. The reader learns how the manufacturing of good whisky is fundamentally at odds with modern means of production. This is a delightful read and a must for anyone with an interest in whisky, especially Single Malt Whisky. Gunn's writing is fine, though the conversational tone of the book may put off some fans of Gunn's fiction. The beautiful prose of Highland River is replaced by a warm and inviting conversational tone.

Unfortunately the over-emphasis on Networking to the detriment of other objectives and tortuous use of terminology to explain, more terminology, don't make this as accessible as it could be. You'll also find several mistakes and a number of holes in the content vis-avis the actual exam. It's best not to rely on this as your only resource. At the very least purchase some self-test software, ... and fill the gaps.If like me however, you are heading for the master CIW Designer route, am experienced in web design and the Internet, but need bolstering in the networking dept., then this could just be the wake up call you need.

A lot of the information about servers and networking goes way over your head unless you already know about the topic, and about half the info on networking is just touched on superficially on the exam. If you use this book to study, you're going to spend way too much time on networking and you won't know about a third of the other things -- HTML and JavaScript coding, for example -- that you need to know for the exam."},{"Title":"CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410)","review":"I just took the exam today and I know first hand this book doesn't have a clue about what they are talking about.

But HTML 4th Edition by Elizabeth Castro is extremly helpful"},{"Title":"CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410)","review":"keep this book from being as useful as it could otherwise be.In particular, the sections on the OSI model and DNS contain contradictory information, and a number of the sample questions patently record the wrong answers (i.e., you can tell because the answers in the questions don't correspond to the explanations provided). The section on subnet masking would be inadequate for anyone who doesn't already understand how to generate subnet masks. The book's discussion of HTML includes patently incorrect markup - don't rely on the book for any HTML coding. Finally, the book goes into intricate detail on many areas covered only very superficially on the exam, and leaves out some areas the exam requires (i.e., don't worry about most of those command line discussions for various programs, but do seek out additional information on, say, hacking and evaluating security risks).Taken with a grain of salt - and read critically and carefully, checking all important sections against tutorials available on the web or other reference materials - this book can help you structure your study for the Foundations exam. At present, it's the only thing out there on the exam, and it does provide a systematic overview of many exam topics. Under the circumstances (since it's the only book on the market) I'm not unhappy to have bought it - but if I were planning to take the exam a few months from now, I might well have bought something else instead..."},{"Title":"CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410)","review":"I bought this book, read it easily within ten days and passed the exam. Exactly 15 days after this book came to my door from Amazon, I became a CIW Associate.I think this is a relatively well-written and organized book. It has some errors, as do all books, but for the most part it is quite accurate for being the first book dedicated precisely to this topic.This book covers the network fundamentals relevant to CIW quite well. I had least experience with the network aspect of the exam in comparison to other portions prior to studying, but after this book and after my exam I scored highest on the networking section. I do think it did a good job with the other sections as well. I did see some questions on the CIW exam I didn't expect. So I would advise you to study some very basics of JavaScript as well (such as writing to a browser and prompting for user input).This book has about 10 questions after each chapter (15 chapters total) so that you practice topic-relevant material. The questions not only explain the right answer but also the reasons why other choices are incorrect. I liked this a lot. There was also a full exam at the end (another 60 questions) and hence a total of more than 200 practice problems in the book.Some of CIW's exam questions (in the real exam) were really ambiguous and hence almost anybody will get one or two questions wrong even if you know the question topic very well. I was disappointed with the exam makers for this. So, the best thing you can do (even if you may be ready for the exam) is to get a book or study reference to go over the material again and make sure you'll pass the exam on the first try, especially if the exam costs $125 and you can get this book for around $25 at amazon. I hope you found this review helpful. :)"},{"Title":"CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410)","review":"This book does provides a good overview of networking principles (IP addressing schemes, net masking, OSI layers, etc.) and other topics beyond memorization of HTML tags.

While a network engineer may scoff at the networking chapters, it does seem to cover the topics required for the exam. From a programmer's perspective, the HTML and programming chapters are poorly done. According to the author's bio, this is a book written by a person with networking experience, but very little programming experience, and it shows.This book is useful as a review of information you have learned elsewhere if you approach it with the goal of finding all of the errors.

I've looked at the ones currently out there, and this book unfortunately, does not meet many of the mapped objectives. For example, the over emphasis of Networking seems to be about an introduction course the the Cisco CCNA rather than the book trying to give an overview of the CIW objectives. Subsequently, because of the undue weightage, the other objectives suffer, and notably, the HTML section which is briefly skimmed through.While this book might give some additional info for those who have an added interest in networking, nevertheless, I feel that there are other books out there that give much more networking info and cost the same."},{"Title":"CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410)","review":"If your thinking of doing self-study alone to pass the Foundations exam, this book is certainly helpful.

This book combines history and adventure with the result being a novel that blows away any dry history textbook like a frontier rifleman at a turkey shoot. Thom brings us back to a forgotten chapter of the American Revolution as a group of desperate Virginians and Kentuckians launch a daring attempt to end the bloody border raids by the Ohio Indians.

Mr. Thom please give us more!"},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"I believe this was Alexander Thom's first novel, and it certainly reads like a first time effort. It's not half as good as his later works like &quot;Follow the River&quot; or &quot;The Red Heart.&quot; In &quot;Long Knife&quot; Thom recounts Patriot George Rogers Clarke's epic march during the Revolutionary War to destroy British power on the western frontier. Thom is only partly successful in relaying this powerful tale into a moving work of fiction. The weakest element is a cliched and poorly developed romantic subplot involving Clarke and a Spanish commandant's sister. Pretty amateurish stuff. However, the strength of the novel is, of course, Clarke's army's 240 mile epic winter march, including long stretches through icy waist-deep water, to attack the British fort at Vincennes. It's here where Thom really shines bringing immense detail to the agony and fatigue faced by those men. (It's actually very reminiscent of Kenneth Roberts' description in his terrific novel &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; of a similar march by the famed Robert Rogers and his Rangers during the French and Indian War.) Unfortunately, Clarke's march is just a small part of the book and, although it's historical fiction writing at its best, it does not completely atone for the weak parts of &quot;Long Knife.&quot;I would recommend this book to Revolutionary War buffs and Alexander Thom fans. However, if you're new to Alexander Thom then I would recommend you check out some of his later books before reading &quot;Long Knife,&quot; his first attempt at a historical novel."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"I read this book years ago, but the story of George Rogers Clark has stayed with me. Thom is one of those rare authors that can paint pictures with his masterful weaving of words. A fictional presentation of a real-life hero, a man who accomplished amazing things and lived and outstanding life - and he is one that has long been overshadowed in the history books to a degree by his younger brother's feats (William Clark, famed adventurer of the Lewis &amp; Clark team).Thom has done a superb job of showcasing George Rogers Clark in this book. It's an outstanding read and could well set the reader on an adventure for more historical fiction from this fine author. Be sure to check out 'From Sea to Shining Sea' as well."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"What an incredible tale! Most people focus on the campaigns east of the Appalachain Mountains when it comes to the Revoultionary War...but very few are aware of the details of the campaign by George Rogers Clark to take the Nowrthwest Territory west of the mountains.And nobody tells such a tale better than Thom.Despite recruiting a far smaller force than desired, George Rogers Clark set out to do the impossible, displace the French, to defeat far superior British forces, defeat or pacify far superior numbers of Indians, to control as big as the thirteen colonies...and to succeed with less than 200 men.This is a story of the classic American spirit overcoming all odds to win for liberty. Sadly, it is also a tragic tale about how a true American hero was forgotten by the country that should have hailed him alongside Washington in so many ways.If you are interested in American history, and want to read a finely researched piece of that history presented in as compelling a fashion...read Long Knife."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"this story shows how the efforts of &quot;george rogers clark&quot; contributed to the growth of this country. we are used to hearing about the exploits of the revolutionary war but not often do we get a chance to know what was going on in the northwest territory. this is one of the best books i have ever read that covers how important a part was played by what was happening there. i recommend this book as an excellent read and most informative."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"This is the second book I've read by James Alexander Thom.

Thom does a superb job in his research. I read the book over the Christmas holiday when I was travelling. After the holidays I happened to catch a History Channel presentation on George Rogers Clark. To my surprise, Thom was included among the experts that they interviewed. I would recommend that anyone who likes to read about history and have it brought to life in the story read this book. I can't wait to read another book by Thom."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"Thom's biography of George Rodgers Clark is a must read for those interested in the old Northwest. If you enjoy the work of Allen Exckert or John Sugden you will enjoy Thom. There is a military toughness and awareness to Thom that I appreciated. Obviously, Thom is a man familiar with greatness. There is also a tenderness to his writing, seen in the story through Clark's courtship of his beloved Teresa, and the care Clark shows toward his men. Thom is an insightful writer, avoiding irreverence, subtle manipulation, or a need to see things the way he wants them to be. He is a man who tells a good story. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"The third book of James Alexander Thom that I have read this year. They were all great.

Nobody places you better than Thom, he has the ability to describe a scene so vividly that you can close your eyes and transport yourself.

If you don't just want to read history but live it this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"Many reviews will tell you of the content of the book but the writing is simply superb. All of Thom's works have a transportive quality. Perhaps its his study of Amerian history or maybe his lectures of the smae or maybe there's just something about living in the rolling hills of Southern Indiana that simply inflame the senses of those willing to learn the tale of those that trecked there. Bottom Line: Thom has an incredible gift for telling the tale of the American Frontier.George Rogers Clark becomes the timeless hero, willing to work and sacrifice all he has in order to save the aspiring freedom of a young America."},{"Title":"Long Knife","review":"I loved it! We never learned about George Rogers Clark in history class, unfortunately. What an inspiring hero from our American past! Colonel Clark was a great leader and in fact a true study in leadership. When I finished the book I found myself wanting to learn everything about his whole life. In the end his life proved rather tragic, but still inspiring. Also, I liked Thom's writing style and his ability to \\"draw a picture\\" of his characters. Some of them you can almost smell. The book is full of characters that come to life. Colonel Clark was not only a great leader but he led men who were giants themselves. The conquest of the Northwest Territory, during The American Revolution was a huge strategic benefit to the armies fighting in the east and the initial conquest was accomplished without shedding any blood! Colonel Clark and his army's march across 240 miles of flooded and near-freezing terrain to recapture Vincennes is just amazing! Talk about strong and determined men of great character!

Along the way he meets his true love. The ending is a real wrencher. Are you a history buff or into genealogy? Find out what life was like in the late 1700s.

He's been compared,in his inventiveness, in his playfulness, in his freedom from the ordinary bonds of fiction, to Joyce, Kundera, Nabokov, Borges, Bellow.But comparisons to the contrary, Leviant is an original. He's hard to categorize. He is a wildly mystical writer -- and more. He is a wildly comic writer -- and more. He is a deeply learned writer -- and more. He is an experimental post-modernist -- and more. This multiplicity of gifts makes his books rich and dense and rewarding."},{"Title":"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Original Music of the Hebrew Alphabet and Weekend in Mustara: Two Novellas (Library of American Fiction)","review":"I agree completely with the other reviews. The only negative is that I would like the stories developed much further (a novel)."},{"Title":"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Original Music of the Hebrew Alphabet and Weekend in Mustara: Two Novellas (Library of American Fiction)","review":"Curt Leviant, author of critically acclaimed novels that include \\"Partita in Venice\\" and \\"The Yemenite Girl,\\" has written two engaging novellas. The main character, Dr. Isaac Gantz, a musicologist, suspensefully narrates the discovery of the music of the Hebrew alphabet in the first novella, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Original Music of the Hebrew Alphabet.\\" While traveling in Communist Budapest, the fledgling Doctor feeling the pressure of the college's publish or perish paradigm needs something worthy for publication. He meets Ferdinand Friedman, perhaps a madman, who holds the fabled Holy Grail of Jewish music history.Leviant holds your attention without any apparent effort or unbelievable scenes to move the plot forward. There is no hyperbole present here despite the novella's fantastic theme of sacred music that dates from the first man, Adam. And the ending, although not tying loose ends, is satisfying.Leviant's writing throughout is often poetic and bountiful with numerous crisp images and humor for such a slender book. The second novella, \\"Weekend in Mustara,\\" begins \\"I found the craggy zigzag peaks, visible everywhere in the city, both awesome and disconcerting, a kind of pressure on the soul.\\" The author is the protagonist as he searches the fictional island Mustara for the writings of 11th century Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi. A fast-paced tempo quickly entraps the reader in Leviant's obsessive thoughts to procure any material on the poet. He says, \\"My life's work. For years I've been studying his songs and poetry.\\" Of course the island and its cast of offbeat characters becomes an obstacle for Leviant's search. Several plot twists keep the reader's attention, but the ending leaves one frustrated after the 80-page buildup.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Someone Like You (Great Mystery Library)","review":"I read this book ten years ago on a trip to Spain (it was the only english book I could find at the place where I was staying). I forgot to write down the author or the title before leaving, and it killed me when I got home and I remembered all these wonderful stories almost word for word, but couldn't for the life of me find the book.Well, after ten years of casually searching I finaly decided to buckle down, do some hard research (should say something about the book that it stayed in my head for ten years), and I ended up finding it. Who would've thought, classic children's story author Roald Dahl was capable of writing such twisted, engaging stories as those contained in &quot;Someone Like You?&quot;Anyway... I love it, and I'm so glad I finally have it. Hopefully you'll enjoy it too!"},{"Title":"Someone Like You (Great Mystery Library)","review":"Since I was a ten year old book worm falling in love with Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, the BFG, Charlie... I have had but the greatest respect for a storyteller capable of such utterly captivating, magical, darkly delicious stories. As an adult, many years after the passing of a legendary author, it is a treasure to find a collection I didn't get my hands on when I was younger. May the strange, sometimes disturbing and very odd works of this author never get lost in the shuffle. I was fortunate enough to come upon a 1954 hardback version which is what my rating is based on. Overall majestic, captivating, this collection of schort stories is a treat to read. Highly recommended for any fans of Roald's other works.A breakdown of the stories and applicable comments and summaries (without giving away any plot):1)TASTE- 4/5. A famous gourmet and wine expert is a guest for dinner at the home of an eager man and his family. A satisfying twist ending sets the stage for the type of stories that are characteristic of Roald Dahl's short stories.2)LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER- 5/5. A husband comes home from work and delivers some unpleasant news to his wife. Events unravel that include a dead body, whiskey, an investigation, and a hot home cooked meal. This is right up Alfred Hitchcock's alley (and turns out, it is!)3)MAN FROM THE SOUTH- 5/5. An old man and a young boy place a hefty wager on a silly bet. This one had me gasping in suspense.4)THE SOLDIER- 4/5. A definite Twilight Zone feel. A soldier dealing with some post-traumatic issues. Leaves the reader wondering what was real and what was not.5)MY LADY LOVE, MY DOVE- 4/5. A little more freaky than some o the others, a pushover husband is convinced to wire a tap to their guest bedroom. A game of cards and an interesting ending leaves the reader wondering.6)DIP IN THE POOL- 5/5. Genuinely funny in a twisted way, a man bets more than he bargained for when his bet isn't as sure as he thought it was.7)GALLOPING FOXLEY- 2/5. Odd and disturbing. A man on a subway car recollects memories of physical abuse as a boy at boarding school. A satisfying ending, but too graphic and disturbing for my tastes.8)SKIN- 5/5. A tattoo from a drunken night in younger years turns out to be nearly priceless when the man is in his older years and is offered a tempting proposition. My favorite ending of all the stories in this collection.9)POISON- 3/5. A man fears there is a poisonous creature in his bed. Certainly not Dahl's best work. Entertaining, but lacking substance.10)THE WISH- 3/5. A scab, a young boy's make believe game, a birthday, a wish, and Mom. Fascinating how Dahl can begin and end with scenes so seemingly unrelated to the middle and yet make it flow. Although it doesn't make sense in the conventional way, this story is intriguing and beautiful in Dahl's carefully constructed descriptions.11)NECK- 3/5. A man is a guest in a large mansion with some eccentric characters. The reader is kept wondering how much about the characters we really know.12)THE SOUND MACHINE- 4/5 The oddest by far of all the stories in this collection. A man creates a machine to hear high frequency sounds that are ordinarily out of human decibel range, including those made by nature.13)NUNC DIMITTIS- 5/5. Personally my favorite story of this collection. A man is irked to find that a woman he had been dating said some unkindly things about him to his friends. He engages in an intricate plot for revenge. A delicious, lip-smacking ending!14)THE GREAT AUTOMATIC GRAMMATISATOR- 5/5. A genius creates a machine that uses mathematical principles to create an automatic story generating machine. Dahl reveals a little of his own experience and point of view in this one. Very intriguing and expertly written.15)CLAUD'S DOG: The Ratcatcher- 4/5. A ratcatcher shows a customer his methods of catching the rats, and a skin crawling outcome of a bet.16)CLAUD'S DOG: Rummins-2/5. Bails of hay, a farmer, rats, a dog, and a mystery ending. Overall failed to captivate.17)CLAUD'S DOG: Mr. Hoddy- 4/5. A man attempts to impress (much to her dismay), his girlfriend's father with a unique business plan.18)CLAUD'S DOG: Mr. Feasley- 3/5. The longest of all the stories in this collection, but not the best. Many descriptions of animal abuse in dog racing. A competition, a trick, and a lesson."},{"Title":"Someone Like You (Great Mystery Library)","review":"Roald Dahl is of Norwegian parentage but grew up in England and wrote extensively in English. Over the years he has published a number of collections of short stories, a genre in which he excels. His stories are not always macabre, but they invariably have a twist, making them unforgettable many years later.Some of them, it is true, may have you writhing slightly, but even so, you will appreciate the intention, as well as the finesse. There are so many good writers around, it's hard to get to them all, but it's worth finding \\"Someone Like You\\" for a number of reasons. First of all, you might like Dahl, in which case you'll be set for quite a while (as long as you can find his books). Secondly, he is a technical wizard (in one of his stories, concerning a wordsmith, he discusses some of the aspects of the very wizardry he practices) and you should have a look at that side of him. He should not be out of print - he deserves better. There's no doubt in my mind that we'll be reading Dahl for many years to come, if we've got any sense."},{"Title":"Someone Like You (Great Mystery Library)","review":"These short stories range from good to great. They are often dark with a twist that is not always predictable. Although this is a good set you can buy Dahl's short stories in a larger omnibus style, so look for a big collected volume of his adult short stories to get better bang for your buck."},{"Title":"Someone Like You (Great Mystery Library)","review":"I struggled to stay with this book. Down through stories, I checked the story titles page to see how far I had progressed toward the last. I felt like I was stuck in a Twilight Zone episode inside the head of the main dysfunctional character. Most folks would hate to be stuck inside \\"Someone Like Me\\" as well. I would have given it fewer stars but Roald Dahl is a gifted storyteller and I do respect his work. My kids enjoyed his children's books and his early autobio book, Boy. I understand why some people don't like Roald Dahl, but I can relate to his warped imagination and value his contribution to the book world. I am glad I read it.Added later: The last story in the book stays with me weeks later. It was the story about the dog races. I learned more than I really wanted to know about how owners in those times and places abused their dogs to make them run faster..or slower to fix a race. Dahl is a great story teller and I see now that this particular story really made an impression on me.On another note: I saw the 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' animated movie recently. The original story was written by this brilliant man, Roald Dahl. Loved THAT movie, still lukewarm on most of THIS book."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This is the story of two Irish families who, over time and distance, find their destinies intertwined. This novel is a love story in an old-fashioned sense and is also imbued with magical realism and religious mysticism that seems not at all out of place. The characters hear voices, see spirits, and the scents of roses and eucapyptus suddenly spread across an entire island! There are visions, especially of droves of butteflies and flocks of doves. One of the main characters sees laughter flying out of someone's mouth in white ribbons. The natural and the supernatural exist side by side. But this all works, and I swear, I could hear the lilting Irish voices as I read the book.All of the characters are exquisitely described, even the most minor ones. We first encounter William and Isabel when they are about 12 years old, living on opposite ends of Ireland, when both have a life-shattering event occur in their lives. We follow them for the next 10 years, waiting for their lives to intersect, knowing that it will happen. Destiny, not choice, drives the lives of the characters in this book and &quot;signs&quot; are given great consideration, even though the &quot;mere mortals&quot; may not understand the decisions of a higher power.I would like to relate some of Williams' wonderful phrases:&quot;After my mother died, thick grey drapes of silence were drawn inside our house.&quot;&quot;She had crossed the chasms of her hesitations.&quot;&quot;Without kicking or screaming, love sank into madness and died.&quot;&quot; ..she cried...letting the salt of years run free from her.&quot;&quot; She fired the question and left the room before he had even begun picking the shards of it from his face.&quot;His father was ...&quot;touched by something, an impression furthered by the blueness of his eyes and the fewness of his words.&quot;"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"As a former English teacher, I have been obsessed with good stories and wonderful language. This book was a precious gift to me. I have never read such beautiful writing and the story, which is excellent in itself, is pure heaven! Imagery, symbols and metaphors abound, and to journey through this story is like rolling in sweet smelling heather on a sunny hill in Ireland."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"When I read Niall Williams I realize that there is no need to write a book.

He has the insight to capture the human love spirit in all its complexity and sheilded honesty."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This carefully crafted book intertwines the characters lives in a way that made me know how close our lives pass to people who are special, fascinating, and human.A very special and gentle book."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Previous reviewers have described this book as \\"life changing\\", and I don't know what I'm looking for in a book to change my life but it wasn't here. Yes the writing is beautiful at times, but at others didn't anyone find it sappy? There were white doves flying everywhere for crying out loud! I didn't feel I actually got in touch with any of the characters in a way which made me fond of them, with the possible exception of Sean and the lady at the post office bizarrely enough, and although to be positive I found the ending unique (it never actually ended, which I think may have been the point), this technique didn't do much to reward the reader for investing time and care into the pages. It is stereotyped to presume that novels set in Ireland are depressing, but if this is made a movie there'll be a lot of slow moving landscape shots with people standing alone in blowy jackets. About three letters too many, for mine, and if I was rude I'd say I'll give you four letters. 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Ireland forever. Although this story of love and faith has universal appeal, the story could only have happened in Ireland. Niall Williams is a new Irish voice. I want to hear his voice over and over again. I prayed for a happy ending to this story. I think you will too."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Four Letters of Love is not a perfect book - there are points where I, as reader, was a bit bored or thought the point was pushed a bit too far. However, parallel stories of a boy scarred by imperfect parents (first person) and a girl filled with guilt over her brother's illness (third person) are each interesting in their own right. Eventually, how the plot will finally pull the two threads together becomes a sufficient puzzle to keep you reading.The brilliance of the writing is in what the author does not disclose. The boy's father leaves the family in order to paint - following God's instructions. The author leaves it to the reader and the son to discern what that means - it is presented simply as another fact to place in context. Similarly, the brother's illness (or accident) is never given a cause, diagnosis or prognosis. The sister is left to grapple with her guilt over an unknown without knowledge to justify or assuage the guilt. The boy and girl fall in love - but neither their meeting nor their choice of each other are in the text. Rather the effects of their meeting are shown. And a single paragraph informs the reader of their eventual choice of each other.The result is a book that mirrors the ambiguities and unknowns of life. A book that allows for the miraculous, the spiritual, the concrete, the insane ... all the while depicting the best and worst life has to offer. The book follows several love stories with all the messiness of real love rather than a romantic, picture-perfect, happily-ever-after, sanitized and insured for life love.This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I loved this book. I have read it 2 times so far. If you like heart warming stories, Niall Williams really presents a touching story here. It is a curious read all the way to the end, and even then the author leaves you a bit to imagine."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I challenge anyone to read this novel and not feel a restless ache echo in their hearts!Niall Williams invites us to visit an island of deep, rich emotional landscape. Buffeted by winds and driving rains, his characters are stripped to the essence of their souls; Williams reveals the anguish, pain and desire that wrench his characters into the unknown. The world in which these characters struggle is terrifically wild and raw (like Yeats) but sweet and stirring as the feckless sun.A lifetime on these stony shores hardens the residents to the bittersweet blows of life, but never sweeps away the hope and belief that redemption is possible. To various degrees, Muiris and Margaret Gore, Bette and William Coughlin accept that their place in life is set by their master. Their hope is transferred to their children.As they each leave home and set out to find their lives, Nicholas and Isabel represent the innocence, desire and possibility of youth. \\"Four Letters of Love\\" can be seen as a love of life, pursued through a contest of wills -- can the Gores guide Isabel and Nicholas to the \\"right\\" outcome, or do the two young lovers have a chance of defying the odds? Throw in some magical (or mystical) realism, and all bets are off ... these mortals stumble in the presence of an all-powerful God, who alone determines the outcome of each invdividual life.Through evocative prose and fantastic imagery, Williams transports his reader to a place of intense truths and ethereal possibilities. This blend of life's grit and life's promise exactly mimics the twist in Irish nature; it's lovely to read a work of modern fiction that embodies that essence so well.Against the backdrop of the alluring and unruly sea, I also enjoyed the intuitions Williams reveals in regards to love. To know love is to know its failures; to embrace love is a fool's choice, but one we have no power to resist. Hurling headlong into love means risking everything, but wanting more.Unfortunately, the end of this novel does disappoint, and I want to ask Williams to go back and give us the ending that matches the dynamic turmoil of the novel. I was desperate to hear from Isabel again; an ending without her presence leaves a terrible void. Even if the idea is that, in the end, all choices are made for us by God, I think we at least need to hear Isabel's reaction. Knowing that she kissed Nicholas, and her mother is overcome with \\"sudden foreknowledge\\" that Isabel will return home is just not enough -- our strong-willed heroine should not end the story bound and mute.Overall, I would suggest this book to anyone who would like to massage their imagination with the lush, sensory stimulation of Ireland ... a balm for the bruises that come from our awkward and clumsy dance with the sublime nature of love."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I read this book 3 years ago, and it has remained in my mind ever since. The writing style is so beautiful that it draws you right in to the story and the characters. You feel as though you are right there with them, experiencing their story.

I recommend this wholeheartedly,it is a beautifully written text,poetic in its depiction of a love affair: a wonderful first novel."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"What makes &quot;Four Letters of Love&quot; so outstanding is Niall Williams' love affair with the English language and the art of communication. His descriptions are not long or labored but carefully crafted and succinct and pierce directly to the heart of the matter like those of a very skillful songwriter. They are not used merely to impress or create a flowery prose; instead, they transcend the ordinary to the level of extraordinary and enhance character and the themes of fate, love's destructive and healing powers, and man's futile struggle to comprehend and control both fate and love. Williams' storytelling engulfs the reader and pulls him in to the tumultuous sea of love, much like the strong undertow of the North Atlantic does to the inhabitants of this little Irish island. You care about these characters, what they do, and how they are affected by the hand of God. If you love language, read this book!"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This is a beautiful story. It's so incredibly spiritual and uplifting. I was afraid that it would have a very predictable ending. However, the ending was not told the way I expected.

I came across this book by chance, and once I had it in my hands, was unable to put it down.

Williams portrays the intense emotionalism of the Irish with a flourish. The characters and problems are of the real world, the miracles are not, especially the miracle of love. Yet these two worlds drift and blend together in a world entirely Irish. I enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Niall Williams has a gift. He can describe eternity from the Irish point of view. Four Letters of Love is an eminently Irish story. It assumes a Catholic or Christian perspective of man as destined for eternity and guided by Providence even though it succumbs to fatalism. Mr. Williams aptly takes one through the journey of two similar souls that begin very much apart but converge towards each other in subtle, Providential ways. What distinguishes this book from many a story of two souls is the author's rare ability to describe life through \\"kairos\\" -- that Greek word for time signifying the convergece of time and place that resembles eternity -- rather than by \\"chronos\\" (or chronological events). And that, by itself, makes Four Letters of Love a truly poetic and human story. A story of love, true Irish love. By the end on the book one feels as Irish as the characters themselves, tossed by the tides of the sea much like the Irish coasts that play such an important role in the book. Mr. Williams' grammar is a joy to read and this book should be a must in the collection of ambitious writers and those seeking to understand the Irish a bit more. I recommend it for its rare purity and for its magnificent use of the English language."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE is a typical story of miracle. The most memorable message out of this debut of the Irish writer is \\"life is a mystery, we cannot understand it. Once you accept that, it hurts less.\\" In fact, the reading of the first few chapters does not seem to forebode any miracle or happiness. Miracle, after all, is a product of some circuitous events.Nicholas Coughlan's father decides to quit his job in the government, abandons his family, and becomes a painter - because God has spoken to him. He leaves Nicholas and his mother behind and takes up painting in Dublin. Nicholas' mother dies of brooding over the reason why her marriage has turned cold. The little boy loses his confidence and respect in his father. As he traces the footsteps of his father and tries to make sense of this ethereal revelation to which his father scrupulously abides, he realizes that happiness for his family is not meant to come simply, that in some inexorable way his family has been singled out. Nicholas is waiting for a miracle.When God speaks to Nicholas' father the second time he takes his life. He has sat in front of a heater and fed into it his canvases until the home burns crumbling down around him. Nicholas ponders that his father might have maddened himself with the thought that perhaps there had never been a voice from God and that the ruins of the life in which he finds himself has all been caused by his own folly. So the inconsolable truth about the Coughlans is that there has never been a call, yet nothing makes sense unless one looks at the occurrences in a grand picture. The now coming-of-age Nicholas resolves to recover the only painting that survives the fire - one that his father has given it away as a prize for a poetry contest. It possesses meaning for his life because it has not survived for nothing.Isabel Gore lives in persistent guilt that she is responsible for her brother's fit at the seaside. She feels a prisoner of what she has done (or has not done) as weeks stretch into months and then years - nobody can shoulder for her the baggage of her heart. It begins to seem as if what has happened on the shelf of rock by the sea has eternally robbed him of speech and movement and has given no reason. Isabel too, is waiting for a miracle.She never knows she will fall in love during the last year of high school and the love affair will have rendered her mindless about going to university. In utter insolence and insubordination the nuns at the covent school lose control of her - it is one of those moments in life when the plot jolts forward and understanding and planning vanish in a rash manner to an extent that she banishes forever the uncertainty of her feelings for the son of a Dublin tweed hat maker.But Nicholas and Isabel are made for each other. How would they have known? The series of events that develop around these two unrelated families somehow cross one another's paths and trigger the making of a miracle. All the open-ended threads slowly converge as strangers enter each other's spheres of living in a circuitous manner. While for most of the novel we see how lives shatter with the fall of one day's light, FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE is an unforgettable tale about the illuminating power of love. It's about affirmation of destiny, love, and miracle."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"With easy, almost casual, lyricism, Niall Williams spins the separate stories of two Irish families, then weaves them together to create his story of love. And like many other Irish writers, he conveys a love that is simultaneously both romantic and religious, though decidedly not ecclesiastical. When Nicholas was twelve, &quot;God spoke to [Nicholas's] father for the first time. God didn't say much. He told [Nicholas's] father to be a painter, and left it at that....&quot; Answering the heavenly call, the father leaves his family for long periods of time and spends the rest of his life trying to create masterpieces, finally succeeding, only to have virtually all his work destroyed by the most earthly of causes: cows. Similarly, in another family, a brilliantly musical boy, while engaging in an energetic, enthusiastic paeon of happiness is suddenly and mysteriously struck down, unable to move or speak. Both families must simply accept the seeming arbitrariness of what has happened.As Williams develops these stories, his focus is clearly on the earthly, mundane aspects of life with its hope, its humor, and its crushing disappointments, but he conveys a strong sense that a Higher Power is &quot;in charge,&quot; however unfathomable His actions might be to the mere mortals involved. In an ending which is part religious mysticism, part magic realism, and part pure romance, the ultimate resolution takes place, leaving the reader delighted by the happiness of some characters but uncertain at the costs to others. And we cannot help but wonder if that happiness may be only an intermission between disasters and hope that it is not."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I was in the Connemara when I borrowed this book for a read. The descriptions of the beauty there matched my incredibly unmatchable impressions. Niall Williams seemed to capture all that I had grown to know and love about Ireland and to relate it to universal truths in the twists and turnings life offers us all. The tragic poetry of loss in the over-reaching patttern of nature and life, culminating in the idea that things work out when least expected are exactly what I experienced there and what changed me forever. The prose captured me, and I savored lines, reading them over and over. There are so many different kinds of love explored and facets of each kind explored in depth: married love, love for a son, love for a daughter, for a parent, for a partner, a brother, a sister, for the land and the sea, for yourself and for the dead. I, too, could not put this book down and was luckily sick in bed and didn't have to. Thank you, Mr. Williams, for this treasure. I purchased it after reading my borrowed copy and have loaned it out twice already. I can't wait for the next one. The celebration of the power of art and music in our loves and lives cannot be expounded upon enough.

A must read for lovers of language."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Steeped in local Irish lore this brillianted crafted and flawlessly rendered novel is a deep meditation on the mystical nature of love and destiny. The dreamlike plot is leisurely paced, unfolding one small piece at a time as seemingly random acts and incidents build and accrue and lead to the the eventual meeting of lovers Isabel and Nicholas. FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE makes magical sense of how every moment is woven into a larger whole and that the inability to understand fate is nothing more than an inability to gain the proper perspective. There is a deep logic in this universe and everything is as it should be. There is so much in this multi-layered book. Engrossing, provocative, haunting, lyrical, wise ... and to top it off it culminates with a great payoff and a very satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This book is really more of an adult fairy tale; very dreamlike in its narration. It does, however, have beautiful prose and lyrics and is so well written by, I believe, a first-time author. It relates the bizarre relationship between a father and son, the strange behaviour of a young gifted girl and a painting that binds the characters together. At the beginning, the book was engrossing, it soon petered out towards an unsatisfactory conclusion. The book is extremely well written, but I'm not fond of one-dimensional characters and surreal storylines."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"With easy, almost casual, lyricism, Niall Williams spins the separate stories of two Irish families, then weaves them together to create his story of love.

This book does nothing to rebut that claim. I found myself reading and rereading paragraphs, trying to figure out how Mr. Williams could express emotions so wonderfully. This book is a must read- I distributed to family members, all of whom loved it. It's a strange little tale about love and love lost. Read it."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"A love story set in an Ireland full of signs and wonders, the book tells the tales of Nicholas and Isabel, seemingly separate tragic stories of love and love lost that illustrate the randomness of life's trials and tribulations. But is life really random? Their intersection, seemingly random, begs the question: Is anything random, or is every step measured, does every action count?Quite engrossing and compelling, I would have given it 5 stars but the ending, after so skillful and deft a buildup, is pathetic.Well worth reading anyway!"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"The book is almost in two parts: the first written beautifully but in a straight style (plus a few 'miracles'); the second drenched in magic realism. I wasn't hooked at all early on, but became more engaged and moved as the book moved towards a more magic realist style (perhaps the elementsthat CapricornGirl \\"Jam\\" found \\"surreal\\"?)I wonder if this is to do with how we each take in information best? I'm not a auditory learner/perceiver. I take in the whole through feelings and images. Thus the elements of the story that relied on magic realism--such as the birds that suddenly appeared from people's mouths, or the scent of roses that surrounded the Gore's house when Nicholas thought of Isabel-- were the very aspects that were so evocative for me. This helped me to experience the great anguish, despair, joy and hopelessness that permeated the story at different times, and made the book enjoyable and memorable.The author writes beautifully, both in what he says, and what is left unsaid. A deft touch.I also found the ending satisfying, only slightly marred by the telegraphing of the significance of the \\"four letters of love\\" of the title."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"The overall tone of this novel is melancholic, and in spite of the frequent long bursts of emotional exuberance it is meditative in the extreme. I brought this book with me on vacation, along with two other novels by American writers of the first water, reading the three books sequentially and in quick succession. This made it all too apparent -- to me -- that 4 Letters of Love is \\"foreign\\" to the American reader. It is like taking a break from American films to see a first rate foreign film occasionally -- stimulating and provocative but you don't want a steady diet of films with subtitles as it is too demanding.The writing is lush, prose written by a poet. There are undertones of traditional Irish writers like James Joyce, but this book is far more accessible. It is very, very Irish and it is very much worth reading. However, there is a lot of rain. The countryside and seaside is described in forbidding language, and this is reproduced in another mode, captured on canvas by the painter who made the break from his safe civil service clerking job. There is nothing \\"pretty\\" in this book, it deals with the tough parts of life throughout, along with the tough parts of the Irish climate and culture.True to the title, the body of the novel is taken up with examining love in great detail, or more specifically, the examination of \\"in love with\\". I was struck with how many of the women characters seemed to talk themselves into \\"in love with\\" in response to the more spontaneous \\"in love with\\" of the men who fell for them. Also how the older generation, how the parents of the youthful protagonists just stepping up to the plate, how they had fallen well short of that early promise of relationship. In the end, you can only wish the youngsters well. There is so much of life that comes after in-love-with, and that is the hard part."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I purchased this novel for Book Club.

In this particular work, he brings forth such imagery that the reader cannot help to be transcended to that particular moment and the feelings that he wants his readers to feel are evoked with these ease of master's paintbrush. The literary piece is truly masterful yet in some instances difficult to follow as the character's lives are interwoven like bits of thread in a gallant tapistry. Once immersed in the character's lives, a hunger emerges to read on and discover their outcome. I found it like lyrical prose in narrative form, he is truly an artist!! I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Many of the pages of this beautifully written book drew me into the moments of miracles which occured throughout. The island off Galway came alive for me as did the characters who eventually dispelled my cynicism."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I read the book in one day. I think I stopped only once towards the end, coz i didn't want to finish it, but could not help myself and finished it that same day. I was a bit disappointed by the ending. All of a sudden the story took on a fantastical turn. But no matter - this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. the short chapters also made it real easy to finish reading in one day"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I thought I was liking this book, but the more I read, I just wasn't sure. The reviewer who said the ending was \\"pathetic\\" was correct. For my taste - far too many words to say little."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I had almost given up hope of ever writing my first novel. Every book I read seemed to drill home the message that everyone else had something better to say and a more imaginative and interesting way of saying it. This book changed my mind. Never have I seen in print such a facile, obvious and clumsy attempt at storytelling. The characters are one-dimensional, and we can have no empathy whatsoever with the edge of their personalities that we are shown. The faux-drama in the book is worthy of any lovesick schoolgirl, and the use of language has the curious ability to annoy while remaining insipid, odourless and tasteless. And the dialogue - somehow every word in this book is spoken with the gravitas normally reserved for pronouncements of death. All that aside, this is a truly inspiring book. I mean if this is the kind of dross that's getting published nowadays it's time for me to dig out all those essays I wrote when I was 15 and had my heart broken by Audrey Toner and find myself a literary agent. Avoid this book."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Oh, how did I not find this book until now?I'll give the very FEW downfalls, first.It felt rushed towards the end, and I feel some of the most key events should undoubtedly been elaborated.Next, WHY?? (is this not a movie YET??)Incredibly moving, life changing.The characters are so very well fleshed out, the smells, sounds, sights... were all so very REAL, I not only could see, smell, hear it all happening, most often it felt even deeper than that!I felt like I knew the characters more than myself.A perfect blend of tragedy, transendence, wonder, mystical beauty, a bit of wit, and life changing philosophical prose.DO NOT~ pass this book up."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I am sorry to say this after reading some of the glowing reviews from other readers, but I felt this book took itself way too seriously. The author felt the need to over analyze every situation and turn every sentence into a imagery- filled masterpiece. All the author ended up doing was writing a boring book that I forced myself to finish. When done, I asked myself, &quot;Why did I waste my time?&quot;"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Rich with metaphor and hyperbole, \\"The Four Letters of Love\\" is a poetic novel which explores man's relationship with God, with the creative force within himself, and with a beloved. Most compelling is Williams' portrayal of the narrator's father: does he \\"hear\\" God speak, and does this voice compel him to leave his family and create his beautiful artwork, or is he \\"mad\\", driven by some darker force? The connection between man's spiritual self and his creative self is a large and meaningful part of this novel, as is William's decision to tell two parallel stories: one as told by the first person narrator, whose father struggles with the voice of God and his own art, and the other a third person narrator who describes the life and struggles of an island family. Masterfully, Williams' weaves together these two stories, in a way that is a tribute to synchronicity and to the power of art.The love story itself is a metaphor of how people can become enraptured in another and in the power of love itself. To counterbalance the tribute to love, Williams gives us an unforgettable character, Margaret Gore, who sees that her daughter has become the beloved of the narrator, and who knows that love, in her experience, means trouble. She is both good-hearted and cynical at once: will her thwarting of this love prevent the two lovers from connecting? Williams prose is intensely poetic in addressing love, calling to mind jani johe webster's collection of poetry \\"sound of a shadow\\" and the philosophical novel \\"Written on the Body\\" by Jeanette Winterson.A most beautiful and powerful example of Williams' prose is this description: \\"He was burned to the very rim of his soul, his fingers tingled, his hair stood on end, and he moved from teh studios that was already alight with the beckoning of God. At last ther He was again. God had come to him. The immensity of the rapture and vision beggared everything, and momentarily my father flew through the air. He cruised on the immaterial lightness of the spirit world like a moth and arched esaily across the hallway, the thinness of himself now see-through and clear .... The heavenly chariot was stalled outside in midair above the garden, the steeds breathing the August air, their flanks rising and falling in recovery from the speed of the long journey and their swett falling in the form of apple blossoms.\\"Williams' prose and this novel are unusual: he combines poetry with straightforward prose: \\"There is no such thing as chance\\"; he weaves togther two stories and also poses philosophical questions as he writes on. To read this novel is truly to be on a literary and poetic journey."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"One may judge the characters and the events of the separate sub-plots and how they come together in this book any number of ways. I enjoyed the creativity and the spiritual implications.But what I found extraordinary about &quot;The Four Letters of Love&quot; was the insight Williams has into human beings - the emotions and the sensations in particular, but also the choices we make in living every day, as a result of hundreds of moments (split second events) that occur all the time, which test and shape our character. For reasons we rarely understand, these moments open and close doors which have huge consequences on our lives.I found myself going back and re-reading certain sections, either to enjoy them again, or to make sure I understood. The &quot;quality per square inch&quot; (I just made that ratio up) is about as high in this work as any I've ever had the pleasure to read.Anyway, I thought the book very well written, each page a justification in its own right. My thanks to the author."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I've ordered lots of books from amazon.com, but this is my first review ever. I commend Mr. Williams for his attempt to make every sentence perfect. In my eyes, he succeeded. I savored each word, taking time to absorb the emotions and scenes being portrayed. Thank you for a completely absorbing, beautiful story."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I am not generally comfortable with magical realism but I am capitivated by evocative language and inventiveness. Niall Williams manages--because of the beauty of his prose--to make the magical realism quite so integral to his story that I cannot imagine it otherwise; it is as lovely and acceptable as if we translated our experiences into images or metaphors; it it not so strange for birds to soar from our mouths, or for dead people suddenly to appear and guide us. Miraculous recoveries, strange scents communicated across space,odd family relationships sometimes with tragic consequences, the imaginative use of physicality to express a mood--all these make Four Letters of Love a triumph of sound and thought. One does not have to believe in the supernatural to understand that perhaps, just perhaps, the contingencies that occur in all our lives somehow fit together in an unexpected pattern and so transform us also in unexpected ways.But I keep returning to the language and the images; rhythmic, recurrent,unexpected and the characters who are sometimes odd but also real and affecting. I can see them, touch them, and feel with them even when I cannot imagine my own life ever going quite that way.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys words well used and the magic of the unanticipated, of characters whose lives are anything but routine and those whose lives reflect the repetitive days on the west coast of Ireland.In contrast to the LA Times reviewer, I did not find the language overblown but rather mood setting and mood inducing. Let yourself slip into that mood, feel it seep into you along with the mist and fog, the tea and the sea. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This is the best book of my life. Maybe in your life you'll wrong love or friends, but when you'll give up hope, you'll find the essence of your life. Reading this wonderful book, you'll also learn to love this beautiful Country that's Ireland. It's a book plenty of real/magical life and peace."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"If the Irish soul did not exist it would be necessary to invent it...The tenderness, variety and fragility of love can only be depicted by people who truly understand it. The author is one such person.Through his eyes one sees Irish love - a luminous martyred butterfly - battered by circumstances, leaving its trail of perfumed love dust floating in the wind of our senses.Divine."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"This book reminded me why I love reading! I frequently had to put the book down to let the delicious metaphors sink into my soul. I cannot wait until his next book."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Similar to &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, this novel speaks of the power and necessity of love. Simply brilliant."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I was lucky enough to read this book while I was in Ireland for the summer, and Niall Williams's beautiful language made me love his country even more than I already had begun to love it. I cannot remember the last time I read a book that left me feeling the way this one did."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Although Mr. Williams at times seemed disconnected from his character's pain, I was consumed with how he brought Isabel and Nicholas together. I was angered at the way Nicholas was abandoned by each of his parents. I wished that Isabel could see how worthless Peader was and how much better she deserved. And by the end I physically ached with Nicholas' pain as each heart wrenching love letter was tossed to the flames instead of into Isabel's expectant arms. Mr. Williams' gift of expressing that tortured first love brought me back to my own delicious agony of 1970."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I had tears in my eyes reading this book. I did not want it to end, and loved the descriptions of both the landscapes and the characters. Anyone who has been in love and knows the passion of new love will identify with this beautiful book. More please."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Quite simply, this is one of the finest novels I've ever read. Read this book and have your heart massaged."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"What an incredible book! I first picked up Four Letters because of its stunning cover and from the first line found myself lost in it. Williams is a talented novelist, and while I didn't want Four Letters of Love to end, I couldn't put it down. The characters and plot are rich, the story well-developed. Though the stories are all different, this book would be idea for anyone who enjoyed The English Patient or Remains of the Day. (This rarely happens for me with a book, but as I read I could see the story on a movie screen. Let's hope Hollywood treats this one well!)"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Four Letters of Love is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. It has the eloquent mysticism of the ancient Irish legends with the clarity of the twentieth century.Your hopes are dashed and lifted to Heaven on the same page. Anyone who's ever been in love will understand this story. Anyone who has been compelled to follow a dream will have lived this story. Anyone who IS in love will love this story.While I wait for Niall Williams's next novel I will be spending my time reading the books he and his wife have written about living in Ireland."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Niall Williams admits in the interview he tried to make every sentence perfect in an attempt to get this book published. As I writer myself, I know that you can try too hard and rewrite too many times. Williams' writing and sentence structure taken in small doses are dazzling but grouped too closely together, the shine is lost. The plot and characters are also veiled by the flowery, gem-like sentences one after another. As for the ending, it lacked a strong finish to satisfy the imagination."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Wonderful characters, stories within stories.

Clare. The brief description of the author's live convinced me, so I gave it a try. While the book has many things to commend itself, I felt that some of the situations were forced; I appreciated the attempt to creat a kind of mystical realism (a la Gabriel Garcia-Marquess, et. al.), but the voice didn't quite ring true; there seemed to be a lot of unanswered questions that ultimately left me unsatisfied. I think Niall is certainly talented, and I look forward to reading his next work, and wish him all the best in supporting his Life in Co. Clare."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"The most beautiful love story ever written. Williams provides everything a good story needs: suspense, a few miracles, wonder, some life philosophy... Packaged as a love story, which few know how to write without getting sobby, Niall William's book has been one of my most enjoyable reads of recent time. Awesome!!"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I've bored the pants off people about this book and purchased numerous copies for friends just because I want to share the genius of this novel. I cannot reccommend it highly enough. The reviews on the cover are a bit misleading because they tend to describe it as a \\"romance\\", in fact the two star crossed lovers never really meet! But it is a story of great loss and love. Love between family and love of self. This book IS a heartbreaking work of staggering genius!!! If you're not a sodden wreck after reading it, you must be made of stone. Buy it, buy it, BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"A beautiful storty. Four Letters of Love is filled with sorrow and grief, love and romance, and the overwhelming power of destiny. Williams has given me hope that someday, I too, will meet my soul mate."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"For risk of repeating what has been said in other reviews, simply one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. You just want to keep reading it and see how it ends, when it does you want more to know what will happen afterwards. While reading the book I just kept thinking of all the people I want to share it with. Absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Part of my reading discipline is to keep an ongoing list of titles recommended to me by friends or reviewers, and keeping this list with me at my library and bookstores. Irish writer Niall Williams Four Letters of Love appeared on this list some time last year, and I somewhat hesitantly checked it out of my library when it last became available. Given the title, I thought it would be too much of a &quot;women's book.&quot;What a delight!! This is a story of a young man (Nicholas) whose father is told by God to quit work as a bureaucrat and paint. Off an island of Ireland, a young boy (Sean) falls mute and lame while playing with his sister, Isabel, and Isabel goes off to the mainland for school and, it seems, a loveless marriage. Through serendipity, Nicholas comes to the island to recover the painting of his now-dead father given as a poetry prize to Isabel's father, somehow cures Sean, then falls hopelessly in love with the now-married Isabel. Although Isabel's mother destroys the love letters written by the pining Sean to the unhappy Isabel (the &quot;Letters of Love&quot;), William's vision -- sort of a combined Irish folklore and magical realism -- makes clear that the love of Isabel and Nicholas is inevitable, and nothing her mom (or anyone else) might do will keep them apart.Every sentence and paragraph of this fine book is a gem. William's powers of description and characterizations are so strong that I believe he would make a dictionary interesting. That he applies these formidable skills to this beautiful story redounds to the reader's great pleasure. Savor this book, its language and characters, and its most satisfying ending!"},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"Instead of another depressing book about the Irish troubles, Williams has written a beautiful and hopeful story about love in a world that is terribly flawed. Faith is the only way to find this love, and by the end of the book you believe that it really is possible.Several stories of hard, hard lives in tumultuous Ireland that eventually bring together two young people whose entire lives have been preparing them to love each other. It sounds cheesy but for some reason it isn't--instead it is blissfully perfect.Niall Williams has endeared himself to me forever for the beauty of his language in this work, both in the service of good things and the heart breaking. The most memorable line says, of Peter and Isabel, that the moment she fell in love with him be fell out of love with her."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"I loved this book. After reading two or three more novels, I still go back to remembering this one while the others have faded."},{"Title":"Science in crisis: Science policy in Russia and the Ukraine after the August coup","review":"The decision to pursue art is made by William Coughlin, a grey suited civil servant husband and father.William feels he has been called by God to paint. His choice affects the lives of his son Nicholas and his wife Bette. The first three pages sets the scene for the rest of the book.A second story about the effect of blame for the fit causing Sean to be mute and lame is interwoven. His sister Isabel accepts misfortune in love as her justice for her brother's afflection. Life happenings are shown as not be choice but by destiny.Events such as the cows destroying all the paintings except two, the buring of the house, the trip by Nicholas to buy back the only existing painting by his father, Sean's cure, the trip to greet the honeymooners and the fourth letter of love lost at sea are regarded as signs.The author has written a very vivid descriptive work about choice and destiny. The sense of smell of roses, eucuylypus and juniper creates a supporting atmosphere. The reaser is stimulated to consider the probability of divine diredtion. Belief in a supreme being is presented as a spiritual experience ratner than a formalized religion. William telle Nicholas-&quot;God does not live in red-brick churches in subburbs.&quot; The concept of angels on earth is convincing.This book is recommended for readers who have considered fate or the force of destiny.Current science shows some indication of the presence if genes receiving divine communication.

I did not expect to find it to be a \\"page turner\\", based on the subject matter, but it was. The research for this book was outstanding, with all the supported documentation cited.

This is a must read for any aspiring lawyer and for any lawyer who may have forgotten why he or she went to law school in the first place.

This is a great book to learn about wolves and their actions and the relations they have with humans and other animals.

Enjoy a pleasent read."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Julie's Wolf Pack, by Jean Craighead George, is a well-written, detailed story about a wolf pack's adventurous life throughout the tundra. This is an excellent book because the author writes with great detail about every aspect of an ordinary wolf pack, while including an interesting story about the danger that wolves face in their lifetime. This publication is about the many hardships that the Avalic wolf pack faces including being hunted by hunters, scoured by doctors for good reason, surviving with all of the other deadly animals, and much more. But what happens when Kapu, the Avalics alpha-male is abducted by outsiders to the wolves? Will Kapu survive? And what will the hopeless pack do without him?This book is being recommended because of the superb detail in this story, and the point of view of this book. This book is in the perspective of the wolves, as if one is with the wolves or even is one of the wolves when reading the book. This allows the reader to understand the situation of the wolves better, whether it is danger, hunger, or even love. The incredible detail in this story is shown often throughout the book. When Raw Bones, a rebellious member of the Avalics tries to overcome the alpha-male Kapu, the facial expressions, feelings, and actions are brought out so well that it puts a clear picture of what's going on in the reader's mind. The wolves' appearance before and after the skirmish, and at other times in the book are also conveyed perfectly. This is an outstanding book because of the way certain things are described, and the wolf point of view to help the reader understand exactly what's happening in the book.Some people might not find this book so great because they think that books about animals are boring. This is not a good enough reason why not to read this book because even if someone doesn't like animal stories, the plot is so brilliant that that it wouldn't matter. The story creates a thriller that the reader can't put down because of how well this book is put together. This recommendation is influenced by the exceedingly well-written words by George, and the perspective of the book, which makes a fascinating book worth reading."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read.It was the first book in this series I had ever bought. I will now buy Julie,and Julie of the wolves.It is an thrilling book.Jean Craighead George really puts descrition in her story.If you have not read this book and you are a wolf-lover,this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"I read it all the way through in one day, twice in three days, and three times in one week. The most perfect, beautiful, adventure-filled, poignant, exciting, true story ever. My favorite book of all time. Join bthe wolves as they battle rivals, rabies, famine, the loss of their leader, and more. READ IT or regret it!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Out of all of the three books of this series, this is the very first one I read- and the very best. The book does a fantastic job in describing wolf life- and making the reader fall in love with the characters. The book keeps your attention well throughout the whole book- and you really care about what happens to these amazing wolves. This is a must read for any young reader."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Its been awhile since I've read this series. And for some reason, when going back, I decided to start with the 3rd book in the series. This may have affected my view on everything, but I think that this is a decent story overall, just not as good as some of the others.Julie's Wolf Pack is just about that, a wolf pack that a young native woman named Julie had lived with for a time. After the death of their original Alpha, Kapu has taken over as leader of the pack. He is challenged at every turn though, by humans, other wolves, sickness, etc. But despite this life continues as best as it can. It celebrates new pups, triumph over death, a good kill. Everything that is good for a wolf pack is part of their life.Since this book is about wolves I think it did a great job of describing wolf like. It ranges for alphas to the other pack leaders and each has their own place and personality within the pack. You can describe them in terms of people, but it doesn't really fit the wolves within this book.The writing is for children, and as such, there really isn't anything offensive in the book. However, there are some scary parts when bad things happen to the wolves, and this may be a little much for some children. For other parts of the book, while I admire the writing I also get bored with it. It seems like it is very repetitive and while I enjoy wolf life, perhaps more detail could have been used to change it up a little bit.Its a good series, and while this isn't the best of the series, it is still a good book for animals lovers. It can open up imagination in children and have them view wolves as an integral part of the world, and special in their own right.Julie's Wolf PackCopyright 1997192 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"The wolf pack that saved the life of a human girl, Julie Edwards (Miyax Kapugen), has seen many changes since her return to her human family. So has Julie, who's grown up enough now to plan marriage to her beloved Peter, an Inuit from Siberia. While Julie formally studies the subjects that will enable her to live on the tundra and study her wolves first-hand, as her life's work, the pack's new alpha wolf learns to fill his dead father's role despite his extreme youth for bearing that responsibility. Among the challenges Kapu faces: Raw Bones, a former alpha from another pack who wants desperately (and tries repeatedly) to seize leadership for himself; Ice Blink, a female who carries the deadly rabies virus; and famine caused by caribou herds that fail to migrate south through the Avlik Pack's territory.Wolves, like humans, are social animals who communicate verbally as well as in other ways. Julie learned their language during her time among them, and the friendships she formed then remain strong enough so she can rescue two famine-born pups who would otherwise starve to death as their mother's milk fails to sustain them. But what is the eventual outcome of that rescue? And just how much do Julie's teachers really know about wolves, and how much do they assume incorrectly?In this third volume of Craighead George's trilogy, Julie comes of age as the Jane Goodall of Alaskan wolves. If you're as sentimental as I am about babies of any species, you may find some of the brutally honest passages it contains hard to read; but without that honesty, this would not be the thoughtful tale that it is. It's suitable for readers of any age, and I recommend it highly.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of HIGH PLACES and 2005 EPPIE winner REGS"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"The best out of the three Julie books, in my opinion. This one is focused on the wolves point of view, showing the same lessons that humans face but from a wolves point of view. Love, rivalry, interaction with different species, and disease. Recommended to anyone who loved the other Julie books."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"I always wanted to read \\"Julie\\" and when I did I had to read \\"Julie's Wolf Pack\\" and I'm really glad I did.

Now I try to get all my friends to read it!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Julie and her wolves return in the stunningly wonderful, \\"Julie's Wolf Pack.\\" This book centers mostly around the young and powerful leader of the Avalik wolf pack, Kapu. Kapu's father, Amaroq, has since passed on, and it's up to Kapu to lead the Avaliks through caribou famines,and diseases. Along the way,he also has to defend his leadership from a rebel pack member named Raw Bones, who was once the leader of another wolf pack. Things start to get tense when a wolf named Ice Blink joins the pack. One problem is that the wolves seem almost too human. They also seem to have too exellent senses. For example, one wolf named Sweet Fur Amy, can smell a disased caribou from quite a difference. Overall, however, this is a really good book you should pick up and read. You'll feel like part of the pack."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This book is the greatest out of the three. It shows that wolves don not run around eating grandmas and little red riding hoods. It shows that this are not heartless animals, but loving animals who depend on each other to surive our cruel world. It really shows the wolve's point of view."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"It was very good. It was very descriptive and i really couldn't put it down. It made me feel like a wolf sort of.

I had recently read Julie of the Wolves and was about to buy the sequel, Julie when the final episode in the trilogy caught me. I decided to buy both Julie and Julie's Wolf Pack. This proved an excellent choice. I loved reading about the wolf pack's struggle to survive against disease, hunger, and cold. In the end, I was almost in tears. It is a wonderful book worth reading, full of beautiful descriptions of a wolf's hard life."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"If you loved Julie of the Wolves and Julie you will love yet another sequel.

I cried when they sadi they were gonna put Kapu in a Zoo. I would reccomend that kids in the 6th grade and over read this book, it may be somewhat hard to follow. This book got me thinking of animal rights (when they caught capu and held him captive) i dont use makeup tested on animals. Or shampoo. You should read this book- It feels like you are there, part of the pack. You feel the emotions- its very strong. Every time i read this book i always cry when Kapu gets trapped! it ThAt good.

This really lets you know what a wolf thinks and how the pack obeys the leader. This book is so awesome!!!!!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This book seems as if it shows the life in a wolf pack. It has comedy, romance, drama, and action all in one book. It shows you how wolves communicate and what they sometimes do to keep each other alive. This book continues Julie's story, but in the eyes of Kapu. It shows how he struggles to keep his pack alive. He might be new to the whole \\"alpha male\\" thing, but he is a great leader."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is a great book-through the eyes of an animal, leastways.

I liked all the information they had about life in the Arctic Circle, and found these stories very believable. I liked learning about why dogs/wolves behave the way that they do. I would recommend these books to anyone. Hunter 10"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is by far my favorite book of the Julie trilogy. Even though Julie isn't in it as much, I love the way the wolves' lives are described down to every detail. Wolves are my favorite animals, and this is one of the few books that I have read that actually is showing the book from a wolf packs' point of view. This will definetly make the story more appealing and interesting to the reader instead of it being told by an observer. Kapu and Sweet Fur Amy are my favorite wolves, and they were described in detail throughout this book, which made the story even better for me! Any animal lover will truly adore this book!!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is one of my favorite books. My favorite part in the book was when Uqaq (a captive-raised brought back to the wild wolf) gives birth to nine puppies but she runs away from them because she doesn't know how to be a mother. Then the nine puppies go looking for her and when they finally find her, they swarm around her and Uqaq runs with the puppies hot in pursuit. ^-^This is a good book to read and I recommend all wolf lovers to read this book!:)"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It made you laugh, cry, scream, and sigh. It is a great story that I recomend to kids of all ages. I love Kapu and his family and often wish I was Julie, living with these wolves. Sadly, i'm not but this is a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This story take place at Alaska(The North) at summer that season is important because, at Alaska, in summer the sun never sets and she wants to go to San Fransico and theirs a bay at the North to lead her there but, since it's summer the sun is too bright that you can't see the north star to lead her to the bay.This book is mostly about a 13 year old girl name Miyax that married with a absurd kid name Daniel, and a pack of wolves with the leader Amoroq, Miyax ran away from his creepy husband and has only food for a week and there's a pack of wolves near her, she studies them of their language ten she learn how to communicate with them and that important because, with that language can tell the wolves to give her food and other things.Theirs a hunter name Roland and his wife found Miyax, and tell her theirs a good hunter that they are suppose to meet name Kapugen but, didn't came and they want her to find him, then she has to choose will she be part of the group or go find Kapugen?In my opinion in this story was it was out of this world!I like lots of part in this story like how they describe everyone and had good details it's heartwarming even tough it's in a cold area. I would recommend this book cause it has sad parts and a happy ending."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Julie's wolf pack was great! I couldn't put it down! My mom would call me to dinner but I would be so lost in the world of the wolfs I wouldn't even hear her.I read the other books in the trillogy, but this one was different. This one showed you the life of the wolfs through thier eyes. I almost cried when the pups died.Don't take my advice. Read the book for yourself. I am positive you will love these books if you like wolfs."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"\\"Snap! A trap has caught Cotton Grass's brother's foot! He tried to escape but it was no use. Cotton Grass stayed with him until the big snow machine came. Then she and her pack fled. The wolves sense Cotton Grass's brother died. Snap! Another trap has caught the Alpha Male (wolf pack leader), Kapu's foot.In the book Julies Wolf Pack written by Jean Craighead George, the protagonist, Kapu, has to deal with life or death conflicts. For example, when his pack almost starved to death and when many packs become rabid including Kapu's, dangerous animals and hunters kill his pack members. Kapu also has to deal with a maverick, Raw Bones, who wants to be the Alpha Male. Raw Bones conspiratorially tried to improve his position by using underhanded attacks, which always failed.A young girl named, Julie, who was lost in the frozen tundra was rescued by Kapu's pack. They adopted her for a time and they named her Wolf Pup. Since her name is Julie they called her Wolf Pup Julie. She grew to understand their body language and growls. Can you imagine?Later, an outside wolf joins Kapu's pack. Her fur was white as snow (if she laid down you wouldn't know the difference). Her pack died from rabies and she also had rabies. Will Kapu's pack die too?Another scene that kept me at the edge of my seat is when Kapu has a gang of hunters chasing after him so they could give them to a scientist. The scientists will do so many tests that he would probably kill Kapu. The hunters have the luck of a fisherman using a hook with no bait. But they finally catch him. What will become of Kapu?Ladies and Gentlemen, I encourage you to read Julie's Wolf Pack. It's a fasinating and adventurous book about how wolves live."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"Do you want to know the adventures of Kapu and his pack? Well, if you do, check out the book Julie's Wolf Pack by Jean Craighead George. When the caribou migrate to another place the wolves must find them or starve. Read this book if you want to learn about wolves.One of my favorite events is when Kapu gets hit with a dart after trying to run from the big white helicopter and is taken to a lab to be studied because I could imagine him running as fast as he could to escape. The second one event I liked is when Sweet Fur Amy becomes the new alpha because Kapu couldn't be found.This story is told in a third person view with a setting of snow like polar bear fur and grass like a miracle for caribou. Kapu is also the son of the greatest alpha. But he dies in battle. Kapu's mother died too.In conclusion, when Kapu got back to the pack, he and his wife went to live alone. Sweet Fur Amy had pups and the pack was helping her. All the wolves were together except for Kapu and Anka because after Kapu was not the alpha he left the pack and Anka followed. If you want a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat the book Julie's Wolf Pack is just for you."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This book is one of the most incredible books I have ever read. I had never read Julie of the Wolves, or Julie, but I had read this one. It is about a wolf pack wit hthe alpha male (Kapu), and their struggles with rabies, dying, Julie, studies, humans, and other things. Julie is a Inuit living in alaska. She had raised Kapu when she was trying to survive in the wild. She is friends with all the wolves, and she is treated with respect. I have read this book over twenty times (and i am NOT exaggerating. I REAlly have read the book twenty times.) And you know what? Its good whether you read it once or 1000 times. Try this book out for yourself."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This book was the best of the 3! Although it is sad, I still liked a lot!It is mostly told in a wolf's point of view, but there are a couple parts when it's a person's point of view.I read it in about 1 hour, it was that good! A cant put down book! A sad part is when Silver dies and Kapu and Aaka's pups die (not all of them though) but some happy parts are when Silver's pups survive from being too small. This book was the greatest book i've ever read! A must read, but read: Julie of the wolves (#1)and Julie(#2) before you read this book!!hope this review was helpful!"},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"My favorite part of this book is when Sweet Fur Amy played a wolf joke on Raw Bones.Amy lead the pack to a sick caribou and when Raw Bones thought he had the scent of the caribou, He ran ahead of Amy.

Raw Bones did not care for that to much."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"I read Julie of the Wolves and Julie but this is the best one!

I liked the book too because my uncle had a wolf before and it reminded me of that wolf. I liked it too, because it was really interesting. The best part was when the lady let the wolf go to its family pack. The reason I liked this part the best was because the wolf needed to be with his family instead of with humans. Wolves have to have their own family and protect their siblings.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about wolves."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is a very short review since all I am saying about this book is words.WONDERFUL!!ADVENTUROUS!!THE GREATEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!I hope for all you kids out there who are looking for a good book this was enough to chose Julie's Wolf Pack."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"This is a very short review since all I am saying about this book is words.WONDERFUL!!ADVENTUROUS!!THE GREATEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!I hope for all you kids out there who are looking for a good book this was enough to chose Julie's Wolf Pack."},{"Title":"Julie's Wolf Pack","review":"I loved this book!

KEEP ON MAKING SEQUALS, JEAN! :)"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"This book was way too long. The beginning and ending were action-filled and interesting, but the middle section just dragged along in a very frustrating direction.As a modern woman, I immediately admired Kitt for her rebellion against her society's oppression towards women - she was intelligent and lively, not to be owned or dictated to by a man. She was found a perfect mate in Clay, who encouraged her free way of thinking, and rather than hold her back, he went along with her on all her adventures. Even the bickering between them, something I usually find very annoying in a romance novel, was appropriate - probably b/c it was short-lived and basically the two did show great respect towards each other. Having been raped as a teenager, Kitt was afraid of sex, and Clay was incredibly patient and tender towards her regarding this, slowly gaining her trust and helping her to understand her sexuality.It's no wonder these two fell deeply in love. So then, why did Kitt leave Clay after just a few weeks of marriage, right after discovering that physcial intimacy was a beautiful way to express their deep love? Her reasoning 1) that he didn't really love her b/c he never said it in words, despite his every action showing how desperately in love with her he was - and 2) that one woman would never be enough for him, and eventually he would stray and she couldn't bear to share him - were ridiculous. And then when she finally came to her senses, Clay had heartened his heart in bitterness towards her. This conflict was so unnecessary, and torturously dragged the story down. A little communication, which would have been expected from two such outspoken characters, could have avoided this entire mess.The action packed ending, when their lives were threatened by an enemy from their past, brought them to a greater understanding of their love for each other, and redeemed the story."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"This book was everything I could have wanted in a love story. The hero Clayton is a strong well-written romantic hero. He's handsome, attractive to women, and strong. Kassandra (Kitt)begins as headstrong, stubborn, and reckless. She later becomes a strong and mature woman.There is romantic and sexual tension between these characters from the beginning of the book!! It actually begins in Heartless and carries over into their story. I read Heartless first, and I couldn't wait to read The Fire Inside to find out what happened. I was not disappointed.Kitt leads Clay on a merry chase before a \\"compromising\\" position forces them to marry. Kitt has a secret from her past that threatens her marriage to Clay and forces her to decide whether or not to trust her husband. Clay hopes that by marrying Kitt he can control her recklessness as well as the burning passion he has for her. As each of them soon finds out, they both must find a way to come to terms with the undeniable feelings they have for each other.This book captured my interest from the first page. The sexual tension is believable. The plot is just as believable, with many twists and turns. I didn't want this book to end. I wanted the story to go on and on.My wish is that Adam Hawthorne, Lord Blackwood, will get his story next. He played an instrumental part in several scenes in the book, and he is begging to feel the snares of passion like Clayton and Kassandra."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"I thought this book was just lovely unlike most romances that always make us feel all the tension even before the characters developed i thought this had a little of everything although Clay and Kitt love each other and don't really acknowledge it the way the story is written it makes us understand why it is difficult for them to love and i have to say most of the time in most books it is hard to actually understand why the characters find it hard to commit but in this case we do understand i like Kat Martin but i think this is the best book by far.i feel confident in giving her all five stars."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"Although I have not read the whole book, I just had to make a comment. This book is a page turner. This is the first time I read a book by Kat Martin and I love it. The characters are fun and the author always gets from one exciting scene that you're into, to the next scene, without making you wait for five chapters. I'm used to reading novels from Rosemary Rogers but became very bored because I probably just read too many of her books and they are becoming passionless. Anyway, the story between Clay and Kit is just plain fun. The love, the fear, the passion, the anger. I just cannot wait till the end. I love a happy ending, and I hope it is. Although the main character Kit can be annoying with her doubts, it doesn't distract from the rest of the story. It's fun the way the author allows you to catch both sides of what each character is thinking as well. I go home to my hubby feeling so warm and loving inside from reading this book. I can't wait to pick up another of her books. If they excite me, I'll probably have a collection full. :)"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"This book gets a grudging 3 stars from me. I would normally give it only two, but Clay is such a great guy, I have a soft spot for him. First and foremost there was no plot to this story. The little suspense we do get, happens at the end of the book for about 30 pages and is extremely predictable. Where this is obviously a character driven book (verses a plot driven one), I found the characters weakly drawn. Katt seemed like a lot of clich&eacute;s tied together. She has some issues, and I think the way Clay deals with them as being the only saving grace of the story. I got very bored reading about Katt's fear that Clay would never be faithful to her. Every other page for the first of the book had this fear flit through her mind. Meanwhile, Clay did nothing to deserve this fear. If anything the poor guy went out of his way to gain Katt's trust. (For such a rake, Clay had the patience of a saint.)Katt and Clay knew each other before this story started and I liked that they had a background together. They were always at odds with each other in the beginning, but that chemistry quickly wanes and I was sorry to see it go. The \\"philandering\\" hero was the only reason I kept reading, and to be honest, I thought that by the end of the story, he would have been better off without Katt. He walked a fine line of getting too sappy in his feelings and deeds.Ah well, Ms. Martin obviously left it wide open at the end for Adam's story, I just have serious doubts as to whether I will buy it or not."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"What a romance! It was my first KM book to read and I look forward to more. There is tension from the very beginning of their story and it grows! Kitt and Clay go way back. Clay is the typical hunk of a hero- a regency rake all the way. While Kitt is strong willed, beautiful, independent, and reckless. There's always been some taunting going back & forth between them. But Kitt goes too far dressing up like a boy and sneaking off only to get caught and locked up in her up in her room by her father. He declares either she gets married or he is sending her away. So Clay and Kitt are forced to marry due to being found in a compromising position. And instead of things smoothing out for them the tension just gets stronger. Clay is hoping to settle Kitt down by marriage but Kitt (in her mind) feels that Clay could never be happy and faithful to only one woman. Kitt has a secret in her past that keeps her from giving herself totally to Clay. But Clay is willing to wait- the sexual tension just gets stronger now. Actually it has been strong all the way through the book. ha, ha!!! There are twists and turns all throughout the story. And the story drew me in from the very beginning. I really enjoyed it. It's a keeper for me."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"That says it all. I like many others read this book out of sync in the trilogy. I started with Fanning the Flame and then this one and still have the first one to go yet. The characters are terrific with the bantering and then the love that develops. I too was slightly disappointed with Kitt's sudden departure. After she was able to stand up to her domineering father, you'd think she had enough gumption to stick it out with Clay. But alas, that is what makes romance novels. Girl meets guy, they fall in love, huge misunderstanding, and then the huge reunion. Always have to make the readers want to fight for the characters. Give this one a try. I'm not upset that I read it out of order, heck I didn't even realize it really until after I read the other reviews. I did see cross over characters, but it doesn't hurt the continuity of the books."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"I read this second book of the trilogy out of sync - unfortunately - but found myself to be totally enchanted once more by Kat Martin's plots, and characters. Of course, this book, does stand quite well on its own merits and if you do read it out of sync with the other two, no matter. But seeing as how I had read Heartless first, I was already, waiting ANXIOUSLY for Clay's story, because he was such a drop dead gloriously handsome guy, even if he was the worst sort of rake. Of course we all know that rakes do make the best husbands once they've been caught.It took a little hellcat, like Kassandra (Kitt) Wentworth to first capture his attention and \`light his fire' she most certainly did although he was loathe to admit it. Kitt and Clay were the original oil and water mix.They had known each other for years and Clay did admit a grudging admiration for the little spitfire who created one scandal after another. He even found a certain enjoyment in goading her on. It was one such escapade, where they found themselves in a very high stakes game, in which she recklessly won then lost a fortune. Her father hearing of this latest scandal, laid down the law, by first locking her in her room for two weeks and demanding she select a suitor to marry within two months or she would be sent to a convent for the next four years.Clay hating to admit it, found himself thinking of her more and more often and enjoying his other female conquests less and less, so when the opportunity to trick her into a wedding - she vowed never to wed - arose, he conspired with her father and managed to wed her. Clay was so in love that he agreed to not push her into consummating the marriage until she was ready. With great care and pain on his part he was able to break through her defenses after discovering her tragic secret - and if nothing else she began to trust him and to her great horror, she realized she had begun to love him.Where this story broke down for me, was when Kitt, realizing she loved Clay, ran away because she didn't want to have her heart broken when he tired of her and would surely take a mistress. Kitt being the spitfire in the beginning, became a wimp! I was very upset that she didn't realize that the tenderness and care he gave should have shown her how much he cared. I confess I was not happy here.The fight back to regain Clays trust and love was quite good and then when Clay almost lost her to an old enemy, he finally was ready to admit his love and begin to trust again. The introduction to Adam Hawthorne, Earl of Blackwood, and inclusion of him as a secondary character is wonderful and sets the stage for the third book of this trilogy - Fanning the Flame. All in all, this is a great series, well worth the read and highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading the love story of the two characters, Clayton Harcourt and Kitt Wentworth, from Heartless, where the two are presented in an intriguing way as secondary characters. What I expected was much more of the witty reparteeing that I saw in the previous romance, but alas, the squabbling rarely gets to the witty level, though there is romantic tension between the two in this story.This aside, my main problem with this novel is the way Kassandra is characterized. I realize that the tragic incident in her past leads her to behave as she does, but this story relies too much on her so-called \\"headstrong\\" nature without showing too much of it in a interesting, positive or believable light, particularly her fleeing when she does to the continent. It was hard to suspend my disbelief in that portion of the tale.This creates a problem in the love relationship for me, since I really loved the character of Clayton and felt he deserved so much better! That is what he himself thinks of course, but the point is for us to see his mistake in perception and root for the lovers to get back together. Clayton carries the day, nonetheless, in this story, with his sexy warmth--a nice break from the preternaturally cool hero--and his reasonable responses, which made him more realistic and likeable than many a silly hero who just doesn't \\"get it\\" in reacting to the antics of their love interest. I just wish the story had done more justice to him, and even her--there was more promise to her character in Heartless than panned out here.Finally, I found the plot a bit thin, which made the romance blander than it should have been for me.Still, it was enjoyable to read in a low-paced kind of way, and I recommend it for a leisurely read!"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"Setting: Regency EnglandThis is one of those love stories that has thrilling characters that you'd love to meet just to see them in action. Kat Martin has always had the ability to breath life into her characters and makes them so vivid that it only enhances your desire to read their stories. Her stories are usually very sensual, and interestingly filled with some of the most dangerous and devastatingly delicious heroes imaginable. Of course, Ms. Martin finds some intelligent and feisty heroines to give the men something to worry about. &lt;Grin&gt;THE FIRE INSIDE brings together a rake of the first order in the drop dead gorgeous Clayton Harcourt, a man with a past, and the highly volatile redhead Kassandra (Kitt) Wentworth who doesn't want to marry at all, and is constantly getting herself into trouble with her curiosity and penchant for trying something different. Her father is at his wit's end and is ready to send her to a convent for God's sake. Will Clay let this happen to her? It's all very exciting, and sooooo tempting too.Kitt and Clayton have known each other for years and are like oil and water together but in spite of it they are attracted too. Kitt has her own reasons for not wanting to marry, and Clayton has his reasons why he might like to marry her. The two become entangled after a misadventure and things take off like magic as they try to work together, but the biggest problem is learning to trust one another. Will they be able to divulge their secrets and build a firm foundation to their new relationship? They have a wonderful collection of friends that adds fire and color to the story, especially the tall, dark, and handsome and enigmatic Adam Blackstone, whom I hope we will be hearing from in the future. Add to this some gypsies, a devious man who harbors a vengeance and you have a humdinger of a romance.If you are intrigued by the Earl of Greville and his lady Ariel, Kitt's best friend, then look for Kat Martin's HEARTLESS, May 2001. You won't be disappointed!Kat Martin always gives you something to shout about with her sizzling plots and extraordinary characters and she sure has a smoldering love fire going in THE FIRE INSIDE. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"In 1805 London, the Ton concludes that Lady Kassandra \\"Kitt\\" Wentworth is too reckless for any respectable man to marry even if she is the daughter of a viscount. That is fine as far as Kitt is concerned as she refuses to bow to any male including her father just because society rigidly insists she must. Duh! Kitt believes that is all a female can expect from a nation ruled exclusively by males.Clayton Harcourt, heir to a dukedom, has no plans to wed in the foreseeable future until he meets Kitt. He finds her wild behavior intoxicating, but he also sees beneath the veneer to her vulnerability. Clayton wants to hold her until she realizes that whatever her secret is that has forced her to don a mask of not caring what others think, his hugs will always be there. Though they fall in love, he worries about ever cracking the shell that keeps them from a lifetime of happiness.Kat Martin, one of the top authors of Regency romances, enhances her high esteem of entertaining the sub-genre fans with her latest novel, THE FIRE INSIDE. The story line is exciting as Clayton sets his strategic goal, mounts a campaign, and deals with setbacks by revising his plan without losing sight of his mission. Though readers will want to adopt this caring hunk, Clayton's actions tend to limit the strife between he and Kitt. Still as only Ms. Martin can induce out of her audience, readers will feel Kitt's obvious defenselessness in spite of her shield, and hope she can finally open up to her beloved.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"\\"The Fire Inside\\" turned out to be one of those romance novels that managed to both pull me in (and so engage my interest), as well as making me sigh with exasperation. What I liked about the novel was the first two-thirds of the novel which dealt with Clayton's pursuit of Kitt, as well how their relationship developed after their marriage. What exasperated me was Kitt's reckless and foolish behavior throughout the novel.Kassandra 'Kitt' Wentworth, our heroine is supposed to be one of those rebellious free spirit heroines that seem to be all the rage in Regency England right now -- you know the ones that gamble, and dress up as young men in order to be able to do the kinds of things that 'proper' young ladies don't. Part of the reason for her wild and reckless behavior happens to be her hurt at being pushed out of her niche within her own family by her father's much younger and much pampered second wife; another reason is that Kitt suffered from a traumatic experience (which is revealed third way into the book) that has really scarred her. But mostly it's because Kitt is headstrong, stubborn and believes in her right to act as she chooses. As such, Kitt is a rather complex character, with quite a few sides to her. So, it should have been easy to take to her and to see things from her point of view. Unfortunately, for the first third of the book, she comes across as a sniveling reckless brat instead. ... And foolish heroines are not admirable at all, no matter what anyone says. And that she never ever actually got into any kind of real trouble (save being discovered by both her father and Clay) just beggared belief!And then, just as I was about to give up on \\"The Fire Inside\\" completely, Kitt changed. With her marriage to Clay, and his easy acceptance of her concerns and his care for her safety and well being, Kitt became a the mature and engaging heroine that she was obviously meant to be -- until that it she started obsessing about the probability of Clay's being unfaithful to her. Where this notion came from and why she was so sure that he would betray her bewildered me. I mean, here was a historical romance hero who, contrary to alpha-male mold, is patient and understanding about his wife's fear of sexual relations, and actually waits for her to indicate she is ready to embark on a sexual relationship with him. This was when I became really sure that Clay, who turned out to be a rather decent Regency romance hero, deserved better. And that feeling never went away, even with the 'all's well that ends well' ending.Another thing that niggled was the entire matter of Clay's inheritance. Without giving anything away, I'll only note that I'm fairly sure that what happens could not have taken place in actuality in early 19th century England -- aristocratic titles cannot be willed off willy-nilly at someone's whim, and not within a two week period anyway.On the whole, \\"The Fire Inside\\" was saved from being a total loss because of Clay Harcourt. Kitt's behavior was consistently illogical, but since I've come to associate illogical behavior with feisty heroines, I didn't feel too shortchanged. An engaging 3 star read."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"This is a true story of love. The Fire Inside perfectly depicts what a person goes through and what they feel when they are in love, and when their love might not be requited. Kat Martin writes accurate descriptions of this, and such realistic dialogue and situations.I could not put this down. It moved slow at first, and I was not sure if I was going to like it.

Her heroin in this book stuborn and willful, which what I like for a romantic novel heroin.

Although later on he behaves like a jerk just because Kit left him and came back to beg for his love and forgiveness!? But in the end it all work out for them....!?

This one I finished in less than a day! She kept me entertained with all the characters in this book.This book would have gotten five stars from me if she had added a little more fire from Kitt, the herorine. She started out with a lot of spunk and although she didn't lose it, I expected her and Clay, her husband, to have a few more battles and a lot more adventures. I expected Clay to have to get Kitt out of several more scrapes. It was a very sensual book and made you love them anyway. They had a lot of tenderness and love throughout and I enjoyed hearing from the characters in her other books. I love sequels!I am looking forward to following Adam in his story that comes out in August. I hope his Jillian will give him a run for his money."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book. It was very predictable. It just seemed to drag on and on. It seems like Kat Martin took ideas from other books and put them into this one. It gets boring to read the same old stuff written over and over again."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"I must admit that this is a good book but it could have been better. The characters are likeable and this is a sequal to Ms. Martin's Heartless so there are charcters from that story as well included here. The problem with this story is that it became rather tiresome at the ending due to the fact that there was a complete lack of communication between the hero Clayton and his headstrong wife Kitt. Although this could be a way to move a story along I felt that both characters being stubborn and unwilling to speak of their feelings for each other bordered on the unbelievable. It almost seemed as if Ms. Martin was tring to fill up a page quota. The end result was that I did not care much what happen between these two characters and only completed the book since I had invested so much time reading the previous 300 pages. The fire may have been inside but it lacked heat needed to be combustable."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"Reading Kat Martin again was a real pleasure.

However, the characters in Hot Rain did maintain great chemistry, which unfortunately was not the case for The Fire Inside.

The chemistry dies off about halfway through the book, and to make it worse, the heroine is a complete [...]. I had to throw the book down when Kitt came breezing back to London expecting Clay to simply forgive and forget the fact she had left for months on end without an explanation.

If you're in the mood for a coookie-cutter romance, go ahead, but I felt compelled to warn everyone..."},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"&quot;The Fire Inside&quot; is another sure hit by Kat.

I stayed up way too late one night to read the finale.Kat successfully pushes the emotion buttons so hard that I actually had tears in my eyes in one scene - a rarity for me in a book I know has a happy ending.I missed &quot;Heartless&quot; but I'm going back to read it next.I missed &quot;Heartless"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside","review":"I was surprised at all the bad reviews. I really loved this book. To me Clay and Kitt really were an intense couple and they grabbed me from the very beginning. I loved the way Clay managed to get Kitt to have to marry him, what a switch that was. And of course she had no idea until much later when it really impacted how she felt about him and their troubled marriage. She had some difficult issues for them to overcome but Clay was amazing through that and you just had to love this guy. Shocking that it is Kitt that leaves him and he is devastated. Of course these women just were always afraid of those mistresses back then. But Clay had given her no reason to worry. It was great seeing her come back and have to prove herself to him. That was rather a switch from the usual the guy having to prove themselves. For me this was another winner by Kat Martin.

I bet if reduced to the more narrow typeface of the main novels, these would be less than 75 pages each. These are short stories, and they go quite quickly.2) you are going to pay for these short stories - even at the amazon price (34 bucks for both) you are paying more than you would for the first 4 in paperback, and we are talking about maybe 2500-3000 pages of story there versus a converted equivalent of maybe 150 in BOTH of these.3) you are going to finish them FAST, as in a couple of hours.all that considered, they are entertaining for what they are, with Blood Follows being the backstory on the origin of Emancipor Reese and how he came to be in the employ of the necromancers. There is a sub-plot involving their doings in the city of Moll, with some focus on a character leading the investigation of the murders by (surprise) Korbal Broach.I did not include price in my star rating, but it is worth considering how annoyed you will be when you see the size of what you are buying."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"If you have read Steven Erikson Books of the fallen you will love this account of his two anti-heroes involved of murder and magic of the worst kind.

This book was a signed limited edition and I was lucky to get hold off it but I believe that a limited edition reprint (of the paper back) is coming up May '04 so if you want to read this I would strongly recommend pre-ordering."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Another great story from Steven Erikson.This is a short novella (121 pages long), but don't let the size fool you. It contains the same quality of story telling that fantasy readers have come to know and relish with this author's \\" Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" series. (in fact the story itself takes place in the Malazan sphere of influence)I really like Erikson's descriptive narrative abilities; he has such a natural way of making the words on the page transport you to another place and make you feel a part of the surroundings. In this instance, it's a sombre mood with a chilling atmosphere in a town called \\"Lamentable Moll\\" (don't you just love the name). A place as seedy as they come, where there has been murder, multiple murders in fact, and the local gendarme has been charged to find out what is going on. And what he finds out is...well, lets say, unexpected.All in all, a wonderful read; if you like the \\"Malazan\\" series you'll love this. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"This novella is a nice little story, but common to Erikson's style in that it takes a while to really get going. By the time he's really gotten things to a point where the reader is engrossed, the novella is almost over. Still, an excellent work of fantasy, and a fun diversion whilst waiting for the next Malazan book."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Steven Erikson's series \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" is widely considered one of today's Great Fantasy Series and he is often listed at or near the top of the list of the best fantasy authors writing today. He's good, but it'll take a few more books until I'm willing to anoint him above a certain George Martin. Thus far only three of his Malazan novels have been published in America and I'm waiting for the third volume, \\"The Memories of Ice\\", to come from the library. It's possible that Book 4, \\"House of Chains\\", is out, but my library certainly doesn't have it yet. Anyway, along with the primary Malazan series Erikson is also writing a series of novellas set in this same world/universe, but featuring secondary characters which may or may not appear in the main series. As the Malazan books progress we'll see how they tie together or if they even do. \\"Blood Follows\\" is the first of these novellas and it is described as being \\"A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach\\".Who? I don't know, either. Maybe they show up in \\"The Memories of Ice\\", but I can't say for sure yet. The story of \\"Blood Follows\\" touches up this Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, but the story the novella is telling is two fold. First we have Emancipor Reece, a former coachman for a local merchant who was just killed by this serial killer who has been eviscerating his victims one a night for the past eleven nights. Reece is now out of a job and his wife is commanding that he not come home until he finds one. He does, of course, and it is in the employ of a Bauchelain as his manservant. There is also a sergeant of the city watch who has been ordered by the King to stop the murders and bring the killer to justice. The sergeant is good at his job. Since Reece's last three employers all have ended up dead he is someone the sergeant first talks to, but his investigation also takes him to the foreigners Bauchelain and the so far unseen Korbal Broach.The novella is only 120 pages or so and Erikson does not have the space to indulge in slowing teasing the reader with little bits of detail across hundreds of pages and \\"Blood Follows\\" reads easier than the main Malazan books. It doesn't have the depth of satisfaction or richness as the Malazan books but it does add something to the world, that there is something else going on that may eventually tie in to the main story and how everything may connect. I'm actually looking forward to the novellas as much as I am the novels, if as much because the novellas are less of a time commitment. Finding out more about Bauchelain and Korbal Broach will be interesting and now that Reece has left the city with the two I can only wonder what darkness comes next."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Superb storytelling which sucks you in in the first page and actually makes you feel sorry for the manservant but almost jealous at the same time.Amazing characterization, but only to be expected as he set the highest standard possible with the Malazan series, short but 'always leave them wanting more'.Along with 'The Healthy Dead' well worth the money for a fan.I hope for more of the same but in a much expanded format."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Steven Erikson, Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach (Night Shade Books, 2005)Discerning readers of martial fantasy-- that stuff that focuses more on the troops, the battles, and the strategy of fantasy campaigns instead of the fairies (Tolkein's Return of the King, Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and Moon's The Deed of Paksennarion are all excellent examples of the form) should take every possible chance they have to visit Genabackis, the fantastically detailed world in which Erikson sets the books in his Malazan Book of the Fallen series. The tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach are nonesuch tales, silly little side stories where Erikson can indulge an obvious predilection for base, somewhat infantile humor that's just as black as anything to be found in the main series.This story centers on the pair's long-suffering manservant, Emancipor Reese, and tells the story of how he came to work for the lovably evil necromancers. Reese, drunk, answers an ad on a post in his hometown of Lamentable Moll, a nasty little place that is currently inhabited by a serial killer who murders, with increasing amounts of violence, one person per night. It's somewhat predictable (come on, you have to know who the murderer is, don't you?), but then, the murder mystery isn't the focus here. Emancipor's early encounters with Bauchelain (Broach, as usual, rarely emerges from the shadows in which he's most comfortable), and how the two of them form the bond that makes Reese both more valuable and more intimate than your usual manservant, are the focus. As always, Erikson's characters are perfectly drawn, and he uses no emotional shortcuts; despite Blood Follows being a fifth (or less) the length of the typical Malazan book, Erikson still builds everything the right way, so that the reader can genuinely empathize with, and enjoy, the characters Erikson presents, and the situations in which he puts them.Another winner from Erikson. If you haven't yet encountered, him, start off with Gardens of the Moon and Deadouse Gates, and then slip these stories in somewhere between two of the later novels. ****"},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"I picked this up at the library because I needed a break from the 900+ page doorstop fantasy novel I'm reading and I was struck by the production values of the book itself. (In true pulp tradition, the cover has nothing to do with the contents.)My main response to this work is to say something I never thought would ever be said about any work set in an epic fantasy world: it's too short. For the most part, I really enjoyed reading this rich mess of characters in the city of Lamentable Moll (Moll --- as in droll). The word \`Dickenesque' comes to mind to describe the odd collection of characters that populate this city. They are so much fun --- especially this hen-pecked working class husband who seems to have made a wrong turn on his way to casting for a suburban sitcom --- that you don't really care too much about the plot, which involves a serial killer on the loose. [No cliche there!]In reading this piece, you're enjoying the indulgence of getting to know the characters and figure that the whole murder thing will eventually take shape. But then a shift occurs around page one hundred. The author seems to have realized, \\"Oh dear! I've written 25,000 words and I agreed to not go over 30,000!\\" Things start happening fast. The detective who hadn't been making much progress suddenly figures out what has been happening, and to be honest, I'm not exactly sure I understood the barrage of events over the last twenty pages.Personally, if I were to do this again, I would instead seek out _Bauchelain and Korbal Broach: Three Short Novels of the Malazan Empire, Volume One_. This novella is the first story in it. I would only hunt down this particular volume if I were a collector as this is a pricey limited edition."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"As a big fan of Steven Erikson's work I was very interested to try his novella Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. This is essentially an introductory book that gives you part of the origin of these three characters that appear in Erikson's 3rd (or 4th depending on how you like to count them) Malazan novel. As I've come to expect, the characters are well developed, interesting, flawed and compelling. The story is not quite as interesting as it might be although using a shorter format keeps background and secondary information to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's a very entertaining read with the higher quality prose that Erikson is known for. My only complaint would be that this should have been a full length novel."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"If you enjoy Erikson's main series this little, and I mean little, novel will only wet you appetite for more of Erikson's writing. This book looks short and is deceptively shorter, so paying full price might not be the best idea. If you like Erikson's style without having to juggle multiple storylines, you will definitely enjoy this novel. It lacks action but the town of Lamentable Moll comes to life without it. It basically gives you a back story to Bauchelain and Korbal Broach and their manservant Reese. I found the novel enjoyable even without the action. Overall I found it worth my time."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"while this novela was well written and entertaining it lacked a lot of what the malazan series gives the reader. i assume by intention it was short and basic however a little too much brevity and simplification was taken on behalf of the author. The entre book was roughly equivlant to one chapter in the malazan series but without the interaction between alternate storylines and multiple characters. Overall an entertaining read but i'd finished it in just over an hour and felt slightly cheated. However it was a entertaining hour."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Blood Follows is a must read for fans of the Malazan World created by Erikson and Esslemont.The only drawback to this novella is that it is ...a novella, it could have been a few hundred pages longer!It is the story of how Mancy (Emancipor Reese) comes to be stuck working for Bauchelain and Broach, a couple of off kilter people with way to much power.If you like this then you need to pick up The Healthy Dead (by Erikson) and Night of Knives (another Malazan novella, this one by Eriksons co-creator Cam Esslemont"},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"I was thrilled when I realized there were extraneous books about Bauch and Broach as I find them creepy and amusing at the same time within the original series (which I love).

The book was good, nice history of the pair, especially in regards to Emancipor's hiring, but look for a deal.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Much as I love Erikson's novels, this first novella was a bit of a disappointment. Bauchelain, Korbal Broach and Emancipor Reese were fun characters in Memories of Ice, and it's good to learn a bit more about them. But the story is weak - it might have been good as an element in a full-size novel, but isn't strong enough to stand on it's own.Hopefully Erikson will get things right in the next novella. Not to mention, hurry up with the next novel."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Steven Erikson's epic series _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ features perhaps the most detailed epic fantasy setting ever put to paper. With the popularity this saga, Night Shade Books has reissued two Erikson novellas set in the same sprawling world, featuring two characters from the third Malazan book, _Memories of Ice_: the necromancer Bauchelain and his companion Korbal Broach._Blood Follows_, the first of these novellas, takes place in the lamentable city of Moll. Despite the book's subtitle as a tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, the story actually focuses on the hardscrabble family man Emancipor Reese and the city guard sergeant Guld. The pace drags through the early sections as Reese talks politics in a tavern, then trolls the city looking for a job. Guld investigates the latest in a string of grisly killings. Meanwhile, Reese takes employment with Bauchelain and wonders if his new master might be involved in the murders.Despite their title billing, Bauchelain never emerges beyond a supporting character and Korbal Broach appears only at the climax. This leaves Reese and Guld as the main characters, and they can't fully hold the reader's interest. Reese's tavern session and drunken wandering fill the first quarter of the novella, but hold little value for the plot. After he joins Bauchelain's employ, Reese does suspect his new master, but never acts on that suspicion. As such, he ends up merely being an observer. Guld encounters many colorful suspects in his investigation, including undead spirits, a seller of dolls sewn from skin, and two rouges who telepathically train rats to explore barrows. Yet these suspects provide more background information than any misdirection or clues to develop the mystery. Without a series of deepening clues or any entanglements for the characters, the murder mystery falls flat.Erikson's supreme strength, the vividness of his fantasy setting, dominates _Blood Follows_. The odors and the grit of Lamentable Moll are palpable. The scope of the world feels limitless.The novella ends with Reese accompanying Bauchelain and Korbal Broach to sea. The lack of focus on these title characters and the new expectations in the ending make _Blood Follows_ feel more like an introduction to these characters rather than a full tale about them. As such, readers looking for a short but complete story set in Erikson's world may be disappointed. However, Erikson does continue the tale of these three companions in a second Bauchelain and Korbal Broach novella, _The Healthy Dead_."},{"Title":"Blood Follows: A Tale of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach","review":"Battleaxe perhaps better than necromancy.When a man, whom we discover later is an old veteran, has something unfortunate happen to a previous employer he has to find a new job.First a few beers though, which is maybe not the best thing beforehand. His new employers turn out to be anything but ordinary, and he soon finds himself mixed up in a serial killing investigation led by the King's best investigator.Starts off in a lighthearted manner, and descends into something nastier, as our protagonist, Reese, is in way over his head.Apparently part of some backstory of his Malazan series, although I am not sure this is good enough to make me want to read 7000 pages of that, as yet."},{"Title":"Dr. Chase's recipes;: Or, Information for everybody: an invaluable collection of about eight hundred practical recipes","review":"Dr. Chase was a traveling physician who compiled this book of \\"recipes and information for everybody\\" including a wide array of information and home remedies for families.

If you only have one or two pieces of series ware, this book will help you identify them and let you see the whole spectrum of items that would complete your collection. While a terrific reference, this book is not a price guide and no prices are included. The only thing I wish this book had was more color photos. The china is so beautiful it deserves more color. That is the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars.

And what was the first book that actually got a hit? Nexus spanking porn! Purely in the interests of testing the tech, of course, I borrowed it, downloaded it, got it synced to the ereader, and went to town. I wish I could say the first part of that sentence was meant sarcastically, but spanking porn has never really been my gig. Worse off, the book's written in memoir format, and I loathe memoirs. Still, \\"Ms. Birch\\" does at least manage to attach a bit of humor to her subject, if often at the cost of such trivialities as continuity.The book centers around the perverse pleasures of one Percy Ottershaw, whom we first meet in British public school (where floggings are, of course, the in thing, or at least in every novel I've ever read about British public school) and then follow at various points along his life as a wine merchant with a penchant for the spanking, caning, and otherwise reddening of the backsides of nubile young things. Yes, that's the entire plot. One bit of interest: each of the chapters is narrated by a different woman acquainted with Percy, which at least puts a bit of a fresh spin on things, and Birch does have enough artistry to avoid the worst of the repetition, but when it comes right down to it, this is still vertical-market stuff; it's not going to titillate you unless you're a spanker-wanker. If you're not, you can safely give this one a miss. **"},{"Title":"Straight to the Top: Beyond Loyalty, Gamesmanship, Mentors, and Other Corporate Myths","review":"It's a shame that this book is out of print. Written in 1990, it preceded the web and therefore the possibility to influence a business audience via the additional word of mouth of thousands --in forums such as this.Paul Stern was a CEO of 4 multi-national companies (Unisys, Burroughs, Braun and Northern Telecom) before the age of 50! His insights into the ethics and discipline of rising to the top on one's own accomplishments, should be required reading for all who would aspire to top management.These lessons have not changed in the 11 years since it was written and are fundamental enough not to change for several more decades. Because the core concepts repeal pieces of myth like company loyalty, gamesmanship and mentors, the clear writing reveals a different kind of &quot;how to&quot; and a good amount of &quot;don't bother to's&quot; as well.I can truthfully say that if you want an insider look into the mind of a CEO, no matter what your current occupation or management tier, you will come away with insight and inspiration, if not a course to set-- on your own way straight to the top. Good hunting."},{"Title":"Straight to the Top: Beyond Loyalty, Gamesmanship, Mentors, and Other Corporate Myths","review":"This book is absolutely one of the best books I have read on career planning and navigating the corporate world.

A few weeks later, I was feeling miserable. Nothing my fellows recommended to lift my mood helped. The hopelessness was overwhelming. During a weekend locked in my self-imposed cell, I opened this book. Somehow, it pulled me through.To me, it is spiritual, but not religious. It talks about what we are seeking, how to do it, and problems we face along the way. There are about 2 quotes per page. I returned the book but one stuck with me I'll paraphrase. \\"Until you have great control of tthe mind do not focus on it.

I am not, and indeed have a suspicion of most writing described as \\"spiritual.\\" Yet I am moved and fascinated every time I dip into Shafts of Light--a book to dip into rather than to read straight through, modest in its ambitions but at the same time quietly assertive. When I first read around in this book, it gave me comfort following the death of a close friend. Now I can open it and find new treasures each time, suiting different moods. The writing and the thought are invariably fresh and precise. Sometimes the book is funny.

Yes, I could see some of the things that were coming from a mile away, yet others not so much. Holt shows an adept talent in this novel, moreso than the first I read, to twist and turn her plot enough to keep you glued and to care about Suewellen and the intrigue around the Mateland clan with their highly desirable castle estate.True, there are similarities between this book and the first one--that being someone hanging themselves in a barn, identity swapping, and living among island natives, but the story itself moves quickly, and this is a huge asset.Can Suewellen pull off the ultimate hoax and claim the Mateland castle for herself by posing as her deviously wicked half-sister, or will she be found out, resulting in a domino effect of disaster? This book is so delightful I don't want to give too much of the plot away, so you'll just have to read it for yourself. A thoroughly enjoyable read regardless of its flaws, I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good and involving novel of suspense."},{"Title":"The Mask of the Enchantress","review":"After fleeing England with her newfound parents, Suewellyn grows up on an island in the waters surrounding Australia.

It's necessary for them to flee because her parents are unmarried lovers: Suewellyn's father is actually her mother's counsin's lawful husband.

I enjoyed the different locales and customs and some of the conflicts arising out of culture clashes.

Keep in mind that I am new to welding, so the book looked pretty good to me. Personally, I could care less about the history of welding and the blacksmith in the very begining of the book, but from there, Richard Finch shows the reader how to set up a good Farm Welding shop and also tells the reader what tools are needed. He too goes over saftey in the next Chapter. He then talks about the different farm welding processes such as oxyacetylene, arc (stick) and MIG (wire fed). Finch also covers how to identify metals on and around the farm. Chapter 5 covers oxyacetylene cutting, heating and plasma cutting. From there on, he pretty much goes into all of the processes I prevously mentioned only in much greater detail. He also concentrates on some \\"hard to weld\\" metals such a cast iron and aluminum. At the end of the book, he has writen a very good referance guide on where to buy welding tools and acessories.Over all, this is a very good book, especally for the farmer who does not know too much about welding already."},{"Title":"The Farm Welding Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I didn't find much useful information in this book.

Right beside &quot;Clicker&quot; in climes and place that I myself have visited, without all the excitement of course. The one thing that struck me first was my inability to put the book down, I haven't felt that since high school when I went through Forgotten Realms' novels like a termite in a toothpick factory. Besides reading Sniper One at a racing pace, I could not miss the attention to detail and accuracy put into this book by an author that obviously wrote on firsthand experiences and had a wealth of &quot;snipers&quot; of quality at his disposal for information.

Every night we read three books, and this is always one of them. It's not like the other Berenstain Bears books, which I personally find a little wordy and preachy. But this one is done in poetry form, with a very natural cadence that's fun to read aloud and easy for little ones to memorize... and believe me, we have! It's a pretty simple tortoise-and-hare story, where \\"Little Red\\" (driven by Brother Bear) \\"putt-putt-putts\\" along while the bigger, louder, arrogant cars foil each other with their meanness and over-confidence. Red eventually wins the race, to the great delight of the bears and my son.I've used this book to teach all kinds of things, from rhyming to colors (the cars are red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) to counting (\\"four big cars\\") to prepositions (\\"over, under, around, and through\\") to social concepts like persistence, kindness, fairness, and self-assurance. And it's got some great vocabulary that your little ones are unlikely to encounter anywhere else.

I wanted to be there, I felt Tom's thoughts, I knew why Cassy was internally angry, and I wanted to help. I wonder if this book changed the conscience of society in the way it shifted my thinking. Harriet Beecher Stowe would be amazed with the improvements America has made. There is still a tremendous amount of hatred, racism and prejudice occurring today. Tom's morality gave strength to those around him. Close to one hundred years later Dr. King's anti-violent moral deliverance gave strength to those around him!

As a bit of a history buff, I was somewhat surprised at how radical this book must have seemed when first published. I could not put it down. Delving into an often forgotten aspect of that embarrasing chapter of American history, Ms. Stowe forcefully reminds the reador of the horrors associated with the break up of families under the institution of slavery. The courage and faith exhibited by Uncle Tom is diametrically opposed to the action oriented Charles.

I was especially moved by (1) the Biblical references and (2) the description of the agonies of the slaves as pertaining to the separation of families: husband from wife, wife from husband, wife from children, the children from their parents...Highest in the number of all-time book sales (short of the Bible itself), President Lincoln himself credited Mrs. Stowe, by her writing of this outstanding work, with providing much of the impetus for the Civil War.

Stowe only implies the horrors of violence and rape without directly describing them, but I felt that took away from the honesty of the depiction. She did effectively illustrate the tragedy of families being torn apart for a profit and the unfairness of people being treated like objects instead of human beings. Between Stowe's compassionate Christian commentary, and Tom's unwavering devoutness, it was a little too pious for me. There were long stretches that lacked momentum, not to mention the tedium of translating the vernacular of the dialogue. There were aspects I did like about it, like Tom's stay with the St. Clare family (how could any reader not resist Eva's innocence and charm?). There were some very well-written, memorable characters and some incredibly moving scenes, but the book as a whole was a chore. As a piece of 19th Century American Literature, it is mediocre, but its endurance throughout the ages is a testament to the impact it made on society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Saw this one on a sale shelf at a store a few weeks back, but it wasn't untilsomeone recommended it to me that I took the plunge and bought it.

Being authentic, deep, and thoughtful, Stowe shows all sides of the various kinds of people who lived during the time that slavery was legal in this country. She is not formulaic nor trite. The characters are complex. Most characters are neither all good or all bad. Stowe is sarcastic and snarky, very tongue in cheek...a lot. Why is this book banned by the public school system these days? Is it because it contains \\"the N-word\\"? No. It is because that the true reason that slavery no longer exists: Stowe shined a light on the false reasoning for slavery and the true corrupting effect of slavery on the master and the slave. Stowe showed the way out of slavery by skillful using the Bible as the proof text...and THAT is why the public school has banned the book...it contains the biblical road to inner soul freedom and social freedom. This book moves people to action. Abraham Lincoln claimed that this was the book that started the Civil War. Many years later, it moved me to start an educational program that has changed the lives of teenagers.

It is now only available on cassette tape and costs a small fortune. I searched a year for a cheaper copy without success. This needs to be shared. I wish someone would produce it on CD or mp3 so it can be purchased by others.

The main story along with the side stories were compelling and heart-rending. This book masterfully encapsulates what slavery in 19th century American was like. The author does this in a way that is not heavy handed and overly accusatory towards the South. She even takes some shots at those in the North whose actions regarding slavery were not without guilt. Another key aspect of this book is its treatment of religious themes. Throughout the book, especially through the character of Uncle Tom, the Christian message is blatantly preached. Uncle Tom is partially a \\"type\\" of Christ in that his character traits mimic those of the \\"suffering servant\\" Christ. In fact, the Uncle Tom character is so full of strength, integrity, love, and mercy that it is an absolute shame his name has become a pejorative term.

Certainly a book that caused movement in history. Should be required reading."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book that offers a glimpse into the institution of slavery. The storyline depicts the lives of plantation farmers and their slaves during the Antebellum Period.Mr. Shelby, a Kentucky farmer has accumulated a large sum of debt and is in jeopardy of losing most of his assets. He and his wife have a very good relationship with their slaves, but are forced to sell both Uncle Tom, their loyal servant, and Eliza's son, Harry. Eliza decides to runaway with Harry northward using the Underground Railroad and tries to convince Uncle Tom to join them. Uncle Tom instead remains and subsequently is taken to a boat on the Mississippi River heading to a slave market to be sold. While traveling down the river, Tom meets up with a man and his daughter, who befriend him, and the daughter persuades her father to purchase him. When they return to their home, Tom becomes a priceless addition to the household. When the little girl dies, Tom is sold to an evil plantation owner, Simon Legree. Tom's faith is constantly being tested and a surprising turn of events finishes out the remainder of the story.The book displays many of the hardships of slavery. The author was able to show the humanity of the African American as well as the inhumanity of the slave owners. The narrative captures the brutality of human enslavement during that period in our country's history, while reinforcing the belief that faith will overcome these travesties. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a sense of adventure as well as an interest in the Antebellum Period leading up to the Civil War.By: Connor Miles1-13-10"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is a vivid, extremely moving, dramatic adventure story based on accounts the author heard from escaped slaves and the missionaries who helped them. Unfortunately, it was written by a white woman and has a lot of references to Christianity in it, so you sure as heck will NOT be given it to read in a college classroom, at least, not in my state (California). On the contrary, the book has been branded as racist, as the other reviewers note. So avoid being excommunicated from the intelligentsia! Don't even pick it up!....But if you haven't been scared away yet, let me tell you a little to whet your curiosity: the story begins when a Kentucky plantation owner, who has speculated unwisely, finds he must sell two of his slaves to pay off debts he owes to an unscrupulous (obviously) slave trader. One of the slaves is Uncle Tom, the plantation's highly competent and honest overseer, and the other is a handsome, clever little boy who will make a good house servant. The plantation owner's wife, a good woman who has taught the slaves to read, can't believe this is happening - didn't her husband promise never to sell any of them? - and when the little boy and his mother escape, the wife and everyone on the plantation cooperate to slow the trader's chance of catching his prey. But the slave trader is on horseback and the woman and her boy are on foot. Ahead of them also is the wide river, half-choked with ice. How will they cross?Meanwhile, Uncle Tom has decided not to flee: if his being sold will prevent the sale of the other slaves on the plantation, then it's his Christian duty to go along quietly, he feels. The plantation owner's wife makes a solemn promise to find Uncle Tom again and buy him back, and her young son, galloping in at the last minute, even more vehemently promises the same. Will they ever make good on their promises?Luckily, on his trip down river to the place where the slave auction is to be held, Uncle Tom meets up with another plantation owner and his little girl, who takes a liking to Tom and asks her daddy to buy Tom. And so Tom ends up, for a while, with this family. This plantation owner is a highly sensitive, honest man, who nonetheless owns slaves. How is this possible? We learn about it, and his rationalizations, as time goes on. He is bringing home with him his sensible Methodist northern cousin, who of course abhors slavery but who, nonetheless, is in some ways more prejudiced against blacks than the southern slave-owners are. She has taken on the task of getting the plantation's household in order, because the man's wife, a spoiled, selfish beauty, has no time for anyone other than herself. How will the Puritanical northern lady cope with a household of \\"shiftless\\" southerners? And whose - northern or southern - way of doing things is really better? This is one of the more amusing parts of the story.I don't want to go too farther and give any spoilers. Suffice it to say there is lots of excitement, including shoot-outs and (supposedly) haunted mansions. The characters are NOT two-dimensional but are quite satisfyingly lifelike, and there are many more than I've mentioned here, including the infamous Simon Legree, the brave but tragic Cassy, teetering toward insanity, and perhaps the most attractive to anyone who loves children, little Topsy. The plot may seem extreme and melodramatic, but the most of the incidents, such as the crossing of the river hinted at above, are taken from true life. Stowe gives us an exhaustive, contemporary survey of the institution of slavery, describing the laws of various states at the time, how the auctions were conducted, and what life in the Antebellum South and North was like. I found her depiction of the Quaker settlement especially interesting.Stowe lists all the arguments not only of those who favored slavery but also of those who thought it must be tolerated for the sake of the Union, and she rebuts these arguments without insults but with moral truths based on Christian law. She does not spare the Christian pro-slavery faction: on the contrary, they are her primary target. This is religion in one of its finest uses.Uncle Tom is not a dupe or a character written to encourage black people to submission: his reasons for submitting, when he does submit, are morally admirable. Towards the end, he means to escape from Legree's plantation but, after having a vision of Jesus on the cross, is so transformed that he chooses not to abandon the other slaves, but to stay and offer what aid he can to them. He is, as many have said, a martyr or \\"Christ figure.\\" This implies that we are to see him symbolically and I'm sure there are many who don't think such people really exist. This is not true, as history shows. I myself know two people who might very well die for their ideals the way Uncle Tom did: one is a Christian and the other follows the principles of ahimsa as taught by Gandhiji. And, unless we a cynics, don't we all in our hearts wish that, in similar circumstances, we would die bravely for our fellow man?Stowe is not a racist. She makes many of the observations that appear later on in 20th century black literature: that it's foolish to call grown black men \\"boys\\" and that black and white southerners lived together and were codependent in a way that northerners can't really understand. It's true, she makes many quaint references to the differences between the races - she contends that Africans are morally superior and better Christians while whites are more active and assertive - but that was a common way of looking at things in those days, and who among us doesn't still compare, for instance, the French character with that of the English, or red-heads with blonds? Although the mulatto slaves were described as better-looking, this was given as the reason they were sold at a higher price. Stowe in no way suggests that the fully African characters are stupider. Uncle Tom is, once again, the plantation's overseer, and Topsy, the little, abused, fully-African girl, learns to read very quickly, and can memorize with near-perfect recall.And may I say, it really is unreasonable to apply modern standards of political correctness to all of past history. Who among us has lived through anything comparable to what these people lived through? They were familiar with hardship, and death, and grief, to an extent few of our pill-popping, screen-mesmerized generation are. Who are we to so lightly dismiss what they held to be a work worthy of great love and respect?(Actually, this is a review of the Books on Tape version of Uncle Tom's Cabin, read by Rebecca Nicholas - a really excellent reading.)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I know this story has gotten a bad reputation recently but it should be viewed in the context in which it was written. It was really a brilliant idea by Harriet Beecher Stowe because she came up with a setting and characters that people could easily relate to. At this time caucasians couldn't even acknowledge that African Americans were human. The author showed the humanity of the African Americans and the inhumanity of the slave owners in such a deeply moving way. I found it so touching that I cried through half of the book. Give this story a chance and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read Uncle Tom's Cabin a few years ago, and was genuinely touched. I saw immediately why it became one of the most influential books in the history of our country, and possibly the world. The story of Uncle Tom is sure to leave you changed, whether you are black or white, racist or humanitarian. It really explains how different people viewed the institution of slavery. After reading this book, many die-hard proponents of slavery gave up defending it. And abollitionists were fired up more than ever before. If you read only 5 books this year, let Uncle Tom's Cabin be one of them. You'll never look at slavery, US history, or the plight of black people the same!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I bought this book on CD for my son who is reading it in class. It really helps to comprehend the book when you have a really good reader like on these CDs. They had a good idea in cutting the chapters into 1 or 2 minute tracks, so you can easily skip ahead. Unfortunately, when you're trying to find the beginning of a chapter, it's almost impossible because they weren't careful to put the beginnings of chapters at the beginnings of tracks."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book was a refreshing antidote to modern day bias. During a time when ideology and mechanics take precedence over truth and objectivity, it is refreshing to read about slavery's impact on various levels of society; from clergy with political agendas to blacks who also profited. Few today would disagree that slavery is a terrible blot on American History, but Mrs. Stowe's book does a great job of portraying people as \\"people\\". Black or white, clergy or not, humanity has inherent weaknesses - and strengths - that are not confined to any one culture or society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I wasn't ready to enjoy this novel and the first 60 pp reinforced this prejudice. The beginning is filled with Stowe's rendition of slave's speech--\\"ah's gwyne ter make corn pone fer Mas'r\\"--which most modern readers will find demeaning. Fortunately this tones down.As a non-religious person I have a low tolerance for preachifyin, but it bothered me less as the novel progressed, as it became obvious that the most effective argument against slavery at the time was righteous Christianity. The issue was not the equality of the races, though Stowe does allow for that (not bad for 1850!), but that a Christian should not own humans, period. Whether the slaves were happy-go-lucky, sentimental, childlike, superstitious--all these supposed attributes of one race or another--all these were irrelevant to her.Through the character of St Clare she argues that the greater sin of slave owners was their hypocrisy rather than the ownership per se. That owners might claim justification from some obscure passage in the Bible was an outrage. Better to simply admit that you hold slaves because you have the power to do so, and it makes your life easier. If you are to be wicked, admit it at least--don't hide behind some nonsensical religious rationalization. If the slave owners could be honest about their reasons, then there might be hope of winning the moral argument.The characters are one-dimensional--pure good, pure evil, not much in between. Most are what we now see as stereotypes. They merely function as tools of the plot and the point. What I didn't expect was that the story itself would be as exciting as it was. It moves right along. This overcomes the preachiness and the simplicity of the characters, and is the reason so many read the book. Even for all its patronizin and preachifyin, it's a page-turner.As others have noted it is amazing to see how \\"Uncle Tom\\", portrayed as noble and saintly, has become such a term of derision.Finally, if you are going to read this, don't read the Introduction until after you've read the novel, as it gives away several plot points that you are better off encountering for yourself in the novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This particular book was recommended by a past professor that I consider my mentor. As I am studying to be a Professor of Literature, I thought surely this book would satisfy some of the historical questions I had about the plight of the negro slave. While the book can connect contemporary readers with knowledge of the antebellum south, the writing itself was way too pious. Stowe was the daughter, wife, and sister of preachers and it is easily seen in her writing. While the book has many redeeming qualities, it seems too much like a 700 page church sermon...NO THANKS. While it was good enough to finish it was still TOO tedious."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or Life Among the Lowly was a profound fictional, yet real account of slavery in the deep South. I thought I knew the horrors of slavery, but I was sorely mistaken in that regard. After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, I felt I had a new knowledge of the Pre-Civil War South.Not only was the story both uplifting and heart-wrenching all at once, it was extremely well-written. I thought I would have an immensely hard time reading and comprehending this nineteenth-century best-seller. Much to my surprise, however, I got into the writing without much difficulty. Because of this, I was able to fully understand (without totally believing) what pains were inflicted upon those of African American blood in the days of slavery.Stowe's characters are almost implausibly good or evil. This extremity helps to make her point more clear to the reader, and helps them to relate to Tom, Eliza, Harry, George, and all the others all the more. I also thought interesting the way that Stowe speaks to the reader directly, asking them what they would do in such a situation. The fact that the author would express her passions in such a time of national turmoil makes me respet her tremendously. It is one thing for one to write a book on the tragedy of slavery today, when all is said and done, but quite another for one to tell such a tale when friends are fighting friends, families even dividing over the very same issue.Uncle Tom's Cabin, or Life Among the Lowly is a novel that is most definitely not novel. I would highly reccomend it to anyone with the capacity to feel for the poor people, who, had their lives not been chronicled, may still be enslaved and part of such a terrible system. I don't think anyone's collection of knowledge of slavery or that era in general would be complete without knowing of the triumph of Eliza, George, and Harry and the story of Tom's physical defeat, and spiritual prevail."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is about the evils of slavery from many different sides of the issue. The main character (Uncle Tom) is a good, always obedient, Christian slave that's master has to sell to pay off a debt. He has several masters, one very kind, one just normal, and one very brutal. It reallly shows how horrible slavery was. After reading it, it became obvious to me why there was a war to put an end to this terrible atrocity. Uncle Tom shows us how it is possible to do the right thing, face horrible punishments (being beaten almost to death), and still love everyone, including his evil master which he also forgave. It was one of the most memorable books I have read. I recommend it to everyone and I think it should be required reading for all schools. I think this book definitely deserves five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

The &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; connotation has a whole different meaning to me now. It means resilience, strength, long suffering and peace, not the &#34;yes me&#34; it is known for today. Slavery will forever be the sad, destructive reality to not be repeated."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is an epic novel about the horrors of slavery as an institution and as a destructive element to the body, soul, family and faith of the individual being held bound.It has been said that Abraham Lincoln once met Harriet Beecher Stowe and said: \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.\\" After reading this book, I believe \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" did more than nudge this great nation into taking action against such an inhumane institution.This book should be mandatory reading for all children in our great public schools. But, alas, we no longer have the guts to teach our children the truths and the horrors so well described in this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I don't give this book five stars, only because of three things: 1)It is rather overtly preachy, which is understandable, given the subject matter, but is still a source of potential improvement; if there were fewer asides to the reader, overtly making the point that the story makes quite adequately on its own, it would have been better; 2)the typical nineteenth-century style is occasionally ponderous, although less extremely so than most novels from that era, and 3)the author does, occasionally, reveal herself to be a woman not unaffected by the prejudices of her time, in spite of her good intentions; there are occasional references, offensive to modern ears, to &quot;inborn traits of the African race&quot;, which are actually the author's comment, not that of a character. Admittedly, the traits in question are never negative ones; still, any suggestion that there are personality traits inborn and shared by an entire race ought to be an idea of the past, even if it isn't.In spite of all that, this is a very impressive work on many levels: purely as a story, it is a fine, compelling story peopled with many compelling characters, and if some of those characters are too one-dimensional to be true, either purely good or purely evil, that is understandable in a novel that intends to be a tale of good and evil, and at any rate, not all or even most of the characters can be said to be so. Most are surprisingly well-balanced for a novel of that time period, particularly one with the sole purpose of teaching a moral lesson.Further, the novel is important as a historical piece; it is extremely worthwhile for everyone who is in any way affected by the &quot;race issue&quot; (which is to say, just about everyone) to be reminded of just WHY we still have a race issue in this country, 150 years later. Granted, no white person alive today has ever owned a slave (as a friend of mine comments, &quot;You've obviously mistaken me for someone much older&quot;,) but it is useful to be reminded of just how much hatred was sown for white, mainstream society by the institution of slavery, and just how understandable it is that those who are still, generations later, at a disadvantage from the criminal treatment of their ancestors would be resentful and bitter. At the same time, while it would do little to lessen that bitterness for blacks to read this book and be reminded of just how brutal that institution was, it might be a worthwhile reminder for those who exaggerate the current level of racism as to just how much HAS changed in those 150 years. Society may be far from just, but it would be a mistake and an insult to those who suffered slavery to suggest that &quot;nothing has really changed&quot;, an idea which the more vehement occasionally suggest.All in all, this is a very important historical novel of a time that we as a country should never be allowed to forget, and the fact that it manages to do so while still being a remarkably readable book is merely icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is a horrible Kindle edition.

This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Of course, as a junior high school student, I found endless ways to avoid reading the classics...What a waste! Since getting my Kindle as a present (by the way, one of the best gifts ever received!!!)I've began to read and re-read many of the books that make reading worth while..This is no exception. I am about half way through the book and Stowe is absolutely amazing! She boldly creates and expertly displays her unique point of view. She takes the time to reveal the many facets of her characters. I'm in love!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with the novel. Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book touched my heart. I loved it! Uncle Tom was such a strong character. After all he went through, he managed to keep his faith andknow that God had bigger plans for him. I give this book my highest score and wish that I could give it more. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1850 after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed. Stowe was very well aware of the plight of these people and she wanted to make a change. She wanted to make her feelings about the evils of slavery known to the public. She wouldn't allow people to ignore the tragedies surrounding them because it was socially acceptable at the time. Although this novel is a work of fiction it accurately displays the lives of American slaves in the 1800's. In fact, the main character, Uncle Tom, is based upon the autobiography of Josiah Henson, and other slave narratives. She also appeals to the reader through emotional pulls that are easy to identify with, as if you were experiencing what the characters were. In all, I enjoyed reading this book and I think that Stowe created a very impressive message that is still important for us to look at today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I recently finished the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and I thought it was a great book. It was a bit confusing at times however I still enjoyed it because it had a great message. It is a great book even today because even though the main message of the story was slavery it still shows us now how horrible it is to discriminate against any race of people.Uncle Tom's Cabin is the story of a slave named Tom. The story follows Tom through his life as he is bought and sold from master to master. In the beginning he is sold from the Shelby's because they need the money. He is separated from his wife and other people who love him. He is sold to Master St. Clare after he saves the life of St. Clare's daughter Eva. He grows very close to Eva over the years until Eva dies. St. Clare begins to free Tom however he is killed in a fight and so Tom is sold to a horrible new master named Simon Legree. Tom has to suffer through many difficulties with his new master...The book also has many small stories of slaves that add to the effect of the novel. For instance, the story of the run away slaves Eliza and George Harris. They run away to escape the terrible idea of their son Harry being sold to a different master. There are many other stories of slaves being treated horribly or running away.Stowe's novel is an amazing tale that was one of the causes of the Civil War. It showed how horrible slavery was. It showed that Negroes were humans that had feelings and were also deeply religious. Many people at the time viewed slaves as objects that were good only for labor. Uncle Tom's Cabin is an amazing novel that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I began this book thinking that I would just breeze through it in a few weeks.

This compelling story is about a pious and strong-willed man named Tom and his journey in the slave trade. He goes through immeasurable pain and suffering yet he still tries to see the best in people. As he travels from master to master his faith never waivers.

It was hard to put down, and while thankfully there is no more slavery in the US, still the lessons in this story do apply in many different ways today, and I think that every person 10th grade and up she read this book. (It would be fine for younger readers, but I think it would make a deeper impact on someone a little older.)While slavery was still alive and well in the US, the author used her story to provid insightful perspectives and arguments to the people of her time, north and south, regarding the various issues surrounding slavery. She makes an amazing, logical, unbiased and indisputable case for why slavery was wrong and had to stop, as well as effectively showing that people of color were no different or less human than white people.Through stories of triumph and beauty, horror and tragedy, she brings to life all the facets of slavery and through these stories, based on real life experiences of people she knew, she is able to confront and address views, attitudes, ideologies and practices regarding slavery in a very fair and pointed way. In her story not all slave owners were cruel, and not all Northerner's who proclaimed to be against slavery did anything to help them, in fact she points out that many didn't want to be around people of color at all. She shows that Christian's themselves were also divided among those who believed it was God's will for them to own slaves, and those who believed Christianity forbade slavery, and shows the different beliefs among white people as to whether or not people of color were animals or humans just like them. This story does a beautiful job of showing just how human the slaves were and how wrong slavery was, she does a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life so that you laugh and cry with them and you don't want the story to end."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book is interesting in that it does not tell what often happens, but of what could happen.

A must read if you are trying to remain well rounded in US history, or history at all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I recently read Uncle Tom's Cabin for the first time after hearing remarks in passing on NPR that Uncle Tom was a very different character from the stereotype that currently exists. Harriet Beecher Stowe is an excellent writer. She is vehemently anti-slavery and sprinkles her story with editorial pleas to the reader. But I tried to understand who Uncle Tom was, and found my thoughts evolving as I went along. The book contained characters who were \\"Uncle Toms\\" but he was not one of them. At first I thought he was just a simple minded person who \\"went with the flow.\\" But as the story evolved, I could see that he was more than that. He was kind and thoughtful to whites, and tried to see the best in them. But he was also kind and thoughtful to blacks, and tried to see the best in them as well. He was, I realized, kind and thoughtful to other human beings in general.But as I read further, I came to see that the key to Uncle Tom was his powerful faith in redemption through Christ. He believed that whites, blacks, slaveholders and slaves should reach out and accept the Grace of God through Christ. Interestingly, although Uncle Tom's Cabin is an anti-slavery philippic, Uncle Tom himself does not denounce slavery. He would like to be free, but even more important is the embrace of Christ. Once Christ has been truly embraced, slavery becomes a non-sequitur that fades like mist before Christ's shining light.My view of \\"Uncle Tom\\" had undergone quite an interesting conceptual evolution. However, the transfiguration was not yet complete. Thinking further about the course of events, I realized that Uncle Tom was worthy of beatification, if not canonization. His profound faith converted and saved unrepentant sinners who were on the tortuous road to Hell. At the end of the novel, he fell into the clutches of a slaveholder who was the devil incarnate. The devil tempted him as he had tempted Christ in the desert, but here, rather than mastery of the world, the promise was of better treatment (if you become my overseer you can drink whiskey with me and lord over the other slaves.) As with Christ in the wilderness, Uncle Tom replied, \\"Get thee behind me, Satan!\\" For this, he was delivered up to Satan's minions where he suffered abuse, torture and death.In death, Uncle Tom imparts his final grace. His injuries were cared for by a slave woman who had been horribly abused by Satan, lost all faith and turned to the path of darkness. She risked her life to do this and in the process rediscovered her faith and her salvation. In effect, she was reborn. The minions who delivered the blows cowered before his grace and were converted, like the Roman soldiers at the foot of the Cross. Finally, Uncle Tom was found on death's door by the son of the kind master who was forced to sell him \\"down the river\\" at the beginning of the book. He had come to purchase Uncle Tom back and return him to his slave wife and children, back at home. In Uncle Tom's dying words, this young man came to see that even kindly treatment in slavery is wrong. He freed all the remaining slaves on his return home, and set upon a new path of Christian righteousness.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a remarkable book that can be read and interpreted on many different levels. The book should serve as an important touchstone for discussions of race and religion even today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I started this book slowly because it was definately more of an intense read than the usual sci-fi, fantasy or romance I enjoy, but soon I could not put it down! This book was a great read, I would recomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Read this, this is enlightening and very good.I don't like the minimum word thing. I said what it wanted"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is frequently criticized by people who have never read the work, myself included. I decided I finally needed to read it and judge it for myself. And I have to say, that for all its shortcomings (and it does have them), it is really a remarkable book. The standout characteristics of this book are the narrative drive (it's a very exciting, hard to put down book), the vivid characters (I don't know what other reviewers were reading, but I found the characters extremely vivid and mostly believable - exceptions to follow), the sprawling cast, the several completely different worlds that were masterfully portrayed, and the strong female characters in the book. The portrayal of slavery and its effects on families and on individuals is gut-wrenching - when Uncle Tom has to leave his family, and when Eliza may lose little Harry, one feels utterly desolate.As for flaws, yes, Mrs. Stowe does sermonize a fair bit, and her sentences and pronouncements can be smug. Yes, if you're not a Christian, you may find all her Christian references a bit much. (But the majority of her readers claimed to be Christian, and it was her appeal to the spirit of Christ that was her most powerful tug at the emotions of her readers). Yes, she still had some stereotypical views of African-Americans (frankly, I think most people have stereotypical views of races other than their own, they just don't state them as clearly today). But in her time, she went far beyond the efforts of most of her contemporaries to both see and portray her African-American brothers and sisters are equal to her. The best way she did this was in her multi-dimensional portrayal of her Negro characters -- they are, in fact, more believable and more diverse than her white characters. Yes, at times her portrayal of Little Eva and Uncle Tom is overdone at times -- they are a little cardboard in places -- but both, Uncle Tom especially, are overall believable, and very inspiring. The rest of the Negro characters - George Harris, Eliza, Topsy, Cassie, Emmeline, Chloe, Jane and Sara, Mammy, Alphonse, Prue, and others, span the whole spectrum of humanity -- they are vivid and real.The comments of a previous reviewer that the book actually justifies slavery (because \\"it says it's no worse than capitalism\\") and that it shows that Christianity defends slavery are due to sloppy reading of the book. No one reading the book could possibly come to the conclusion that it does anything but condemn slavery in the strongest and most indubitable terms. This was the point of the book. The aside about capitalism was just that, an aside on the evils of capitalism. It did not and does not negate the attack on slavery. Secondly, another major point of the book is that TRUE Christianity does not and could not ever support slavery. Stowe points out the Biblical references used to claim that Christianity defended slavery merely to show how the Bible can be misused by those who wish to defend their own indefensible viewpoint. It's ridiculous to say that the book \\"shows that Christianity supported slavery\\". It shows that some misguided preachers abused certain Bible passages and ignored other ones to support their view of slavery.There is an overlay of the tired \\"Victorian women's novel\\" to this piece - that must be granted. For literary perfection, it will never take its place beside Tolstoy, Dickens and Austen. But it is a piece entirely of its own category. Nothing before or after it has been anything like it, and it IS a great, if flawed, novel. I highly recommend it. I give it 5 stars despite its flaws because it's utterly unique, and its greatness is in some ways is related to its flaws."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Since this was a free Kindle download, I was prompted to finally read this classic book.

I doubt I would go to the library and check out Uncle Tom's Cabin, but I would and did read it as a free Kindle download. I am glad that I did!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I too was surprised by &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin.&quot; I'd expected a poorly written melodrama with (at best) a tepid commitment to abolition and a strong undercurrent of racism. I was wrong. As a novel, I consider it to be better than many of its rough contemporaries (including &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; and &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;). As an attack on slavery, it is uncompromising, well informed, logically sophisticated, and morally unassailable. It's also exciting, educational, and often funny.The book has flaws, of course. The quality of the writing is variable, as it is in the works of many greater talents than Stowe. Herman Melville is one of my favorite writers, but I'd be hard-pressed to defend some of his sentences--or even some of his books--on purely literary grounds! There are indeed sentimental passages in &quot;UTC.&quot; So what? There are plenty in Hawthorne, Dickens, Ruskin, and the Brontes, too...and lord knows our age has its own garish pieties. There are also a couple (only a couple!) of unfortunate remarks on the &quot;childlike&quot; character of slaves, but nothing so offensive as to render suspect Stowe's passionate belief that blacks are equal to whites in the eyes of God and must not be enslaved. (She also says that differences between blacks and whites do not result from a difference in innate ability, and argues that a white person raised to be a slave would show all the characteristics of one). By contrast, Plato wrote reams in defense of slavery and racialism, and yet people who point this out are considered spoilsports, if not philistines.The reviewer who claimed to have learned from Stowe that &quot;slavery is no worse than capitalism&quot; has totally misunderstood Stowe, who says that slavery is AS terrible as capitalism. To be precise, Stowe equates the horrors of wage slavery under Victorian Britain's capitalist system of production with those of chattel slavery in the American South. Her definition of capitalism agrees perfectly with that of Karl Marx, who was a pro-abolitionist correspondent for the New York Daily Tribune (and was familiar enough with Stowe to have written a piece on her). Marx said that true capitalism is defined by &quot;the annihilation of self-earned private property; in other words, the expropriation of the labourer.&quot; Marx did not consider America a capitalist state, because American workers had at least theoretical upward mobility and could acquire property. This was not at all true of the British working class when &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; was written, as Stowe well knew. And there was nothing idiosyncratic about her opinion; contemporaneous books such as &quot;The White Slaves of England&quot; made the same connection between American chattel slavery and British wage slavery. The cruelty of both systems is what led Stowe to claim in an essay that the Civil War was not merely a war against slavery, but &quot;a war for the rights of the working class of society as against the usurpation of privileged aristocracies.&quot;As for the claim that Stowe says Christianity justifies slavery, this is either willful misreading or wishful thinking...she says the opposite so many times, and at such length, that to remove every expression of it would probably shorten the book by half (to the delight, apparently, of most of our nation's English students).Not sure who to believe? If you're interested enough in \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" to have slogged through this meandering review, why not read it and see for yourself what Stowe does, and doesn't, say?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This version of Stowe's classic text includes reproductions of orginal historical documents at the back, literary criticism of the text, and some of the original illustrations. The book is well-made, stands up to the stress of reading (paper is thin but not too thin, like some anthologies).As for the text-- this is the book that some say caused Abraham Lincoln to write the Emancipation Proclamation. An \\"Uncle Tom\\" has come to mean a black person who sells out to the white system-- but in so many ways, that is not at all what Uncle Tom does in the book. Stowe wrote the book to change what she saw as an unjust system, an evil system-- and at times, the text is very didactic (teacherly) and very preachy about religion. It's a fine \\"sentimental\\" book-- and a fine historical document. It's also a pretty good story. Yes, there are some places where we could just get a tooth ache from the syrup of the overly dramatized scenes (you'll see when you read about Little Eva). But it's a certain style of writing that accomplished Stowe's goal of getting the women who may not have owned slaves but who benefitted from the system (white, northern, wealthy ones) to realize the problems and move to CHANGE them.Much of what people think about Uncle Tom's Cabin actually comes from the later \\"Tom shows\\" that travelled the country-- the minstrel reviews that were not very flattering either to blacks or to Stowe's original texts. Read the book that has everyone all stirred up and make your own judgements. You might not like it-- but don't let someone else make the decision for you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"(This is a review of the print edition, not the e-book version. I cannot comment on the electronic formatting of this edition.)A few coworkers and I started an informal book discussion group, where we'd read a couple chapters then meet over breakfast or lunch to discuss. None of us had ever been in a discussion group before. We had a quite diverse set of viewpoints and backgrounds among us, and were looking for something that would be enjoyable to read, but also provide material for discussion and debate.After a lot of searching and voting, we settled on Uncle Tom's Cabin as our first book. It ended up filling the bill perfectly.Knowing that it's taught in many schools, I expected a heavy literary \\"masterpiece\\" full of symbolism and arcane references. Instead I found it to be a fast-moving, easy to read page turner, and almost all of us in the club tended to read far ahead of the \\"assignments\\" for our meetings because we couldn't put it down. Yet it also prompted some great discussion about morality, social and personal responsibility, identity, religion, etc. Mrs. Stowe does not simply convey that \\"slavery is bad.\\" She explores the ways in which all Americans were complicit in the institution by \\"turning the other cheek;\\" by claiming not to approve yet investing financially in companies that relied on slavery for profit; simply by not speaking out against it or supporting those who did. Again, great topics for group discussion.As a group we've read a half dozen other books since Uncle Tom's Cabin, but none have provided the same combination of simple enjoyment and fodder for good discussion."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, which is set between 1840 and 1850, is a novel that brought the cruelties of slavery into American homes. It unveils how slaves, like Uncle Tom and Eliza, were treated by slave owners, like Simon Legree. Throughout the novel there's a strong contrast between good and evil, which is personified by the different slave owners. First, Tom and Eliza serve a Christian family. Tom embraces Christianity through his compassion for others, honesty, evangelism, humbleness and his obedience without compromising his beliefs. Eliza, a beautiful Christian mulatto, shows her courage and love for her son. This love becomes strongest when she escapes with him to Canada after he's sold to pay debts. In the meantime, Tom is sold to Simon Legree. Simon displays evilness in his strength, greed and brutality. After Tom's friend escapes the plantation, Tom is blamed. The plot thickens when in Eliza's journey to Canada, she literally skates over thin ice as her son's master is close behind. Overall, the book was well written and the introduction omitted need for further research. Ms. Stowe is outstanding at exposing the severity of the slavery atmosphere without today's Hollywood gore. The historical accuracy is shown throughout the novel as The Fugitive Slave Law is mentioned and Harriet provides parallels between actual people and the story's characters. However, as the introduction states, Stowe claims both that slavery is evil for exaggerating differences between races and denying similarities. Overall Stowe is noteworthy and her book should be read because it influenced attitudes towards slavery, and embeds historical events interestingly."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of those books that I had always heard about since I was a child but had never read. I finally read it in my 60's and am glad that I did. It was not only interesting from an historical perspective but also from a Christian perspective. You can see by what the author says at the end of the book that it was written primarily to the Christian Church to inspire them to do something about the deplorable condition of slavery in the United States. I checked to see if there was a movie made from the book but found out that there was only one silent one from the 1920's. I can understand why this is the case because of the heavy emphasis on Christianity. As a born again reformed believer I would highly recommend this book but would also understand if not everyone enjoyed it because of the religious emphasis."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"im a 14 year old girl and this was one option for a summer reading assignment i have to do for high school. history being one of my favorite subjects, i chose this book. in knowng the US's history before the civil war it gives a more indepth and disturbing look at slavery in the south. harriet beecher stowe took a chance to try to show people a new look at the brutality and cruelty behind slavery. after reading this book, i was courious is to what inspired her to write this book. it turns out she witnessed a slave named tom being beaten to death nad ran home to write about it. its a great book and i believe its a must read.enjoy!*keep in mind it was written before the civil war so its language is sometimes difficult to understand*"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The legend goes that when Abraham Lincoln met Harriett Beecher Stowe, he said to her, &quot;So you're the little lady who started this great big war.&quot; The impact of this book cannot be overstated. By showing the kind and compassionate slaveholding families, as well as the horrors inflicted upon Uncle Tom by Simon Legree, Stowe illustrates that the institution, by its very nature, can never be kind or compassionate despite the actions of the individual slaveholders.The book begins as Uncle Tom is sold to a slave trader. Though Mr. Shelby, his master, hates to sell him because he has been loyal and Christian, he recognizes that he has no choice based on large debts he has accumulated. Simultaneously, Mr. Shelby decides to sell a three-year-old boy, Harry. Learning this, Harry's mother, Eliza, escapes with this boy and heads north for Canada. Stowe continues to outline the diverging fates of Eliza and Tom throughout the novel.Tom is sold to a kind family with a nearly divine daughter, named, aptly, Evangeline, who convinces her father to free his slaves. Before this can happen, her father is killed and Tom is sold to the brutal Simon Legree.Stowe has been criticized for her racism, which does come through in her storytelling. She often refers to the steadfast faith common to people of African decent and makes other sweeping generalities. However, this story cannot be taken out of context and one cannot disregard the era during which it was written. Stowe was heroic to depict the gamut of possible treatments of slaves, and portray slavery as nearly equally cruel no matter how kind the master. The fact remains that no matter how kind an individual slave holder was, slaves were still subjected to having their families ripped apart when dictated by economic need or by death of their masters. By not depicting all masters as ogres, Stowe's abolitionist message rings more truthfully and convincingly. Lest we ever forget just what it meant to own another person, in all its various vestiges, every high school student in America should be required to read this novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The book Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe was written for a purpose; it was not meant to be merely entertaining for its readers. Stowe wrote it in order to show its readers how awful and degrading slavery is to people and mankind. Harriet Beecher Stowe hated the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; and she wanted others to see why she hated it. It is an entertaining and exciting book that causes readers to feel as if they are a part of the story. The way it is written allows readers almost be able to relate to the slaves and feel the torture and pain that they felt in the story. The slave owners were portrayed as heartless devilish men, and the slaves were portrayed as their victims. Readers are able to feel emotions towards many of the characters. For instance, readers end up hating Simon Legree, the cruel slave owner. They feel pity and sadness when he treats Tom, the good, unfortunate slave, cruelly. Another example is of the feeling of love and pity that readers tend to feel towards the saintlike child, Eva. Though Stowe's writing came across as preachy at times, I found the book to be very well written with a clever plot. It is educational to its readers by helping them to see the way life was for different people in the time period in which the book took place. The book was a bestseller when it was first released to the public. It caused much conflict and uproar over the subject of slavery. In many cases Stowe's reason for writing the book served its purpose. Many people became supporters of abolition because of this book. It was interesting for me to read it knowing that it was one of the causes of our country's Civil War. I could understand why it caused so much controversy between the North and the South when I read it. Uncle Tom's Cabin is definately interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"For anyone who is picking this book up in the interest of learning about lives and conflict during the times of slavery, you'd be better advised to read &quot;Roots&quot; if you haven't already done so, or perhaps some historical non-fiction. That said, it's a moving story and grips the reader with its pain and anguish. But it's also rather poorly written, and were it not for its subject and the time period it came out in, no one would dare call this a &quot;classic.&quot; The author's tone and perspective is muddled and the &quot;Christian&quot; themes she promotes in her characters seem rather ludicrous to me. &quot;Good&quot; slaveholders are warped into demigods filled with &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;refinement,&quot; and it's easy to see why the title character has become such a source of resentment for many people. But, on the other hand, it is what it is and has influenced a great deal of readers and our society in general, and that alone makes it a necessary read. But it can't compare to something like Alex Haley's novel, because she simply isn't on the same par as a writer."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Everything was great except for the cover was different than what they have shown here. Still the same great book though."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"....Being a child of the 60's and the civil rights movement, for many years I held the prejudiced view of this book as being one that cast the main character, Uncle Tom, in a negative kowtowing role to his white slave owners. When I finally actually read the book in my late 20's I discovered that despite what I had been told, Uncle Tom was a character to be loved for holding onto his gentleness and humanity in the most difficult of circumstances. It is well written, and you will love it if you have even a scrap of empathy in your soul.....The book I read in my twenties contained a foreword that talked about Harriet Beecher-Stowe's meeting with President Lincoln sometime around the start of the Civil War. He took her hand and said something to the effect of \\"So this is the little lady who has started this great war\\", which brought the book completely into perspective for me. The author hadn't written a book that was trying to show the slaves as animals who should held in a permanently subservient position (as I had been led to believe). She wrote a book that was used to inform the people of the nation, and especially those in the non-slave states many of whom had never seen a slave, of the tragic plight of the southern slave. She chronicled their day to day struggles all while emphasizing their humanity and highlighting their intelligence and dignity.....In the Civil War days of our nation, books were basically the only way to influence people on a large scale. This was a time when there was no TV or radio, and articles in newspapers and magazines were regularly falsified to suit the publishers' purposes. Books were shared by many and would go even into the wilderness with travelers after being passed around by the people in towns. The role books had in influencing public perceptions cannot be overemphasized for this time period. This book was probably the only way people in non-slave states could connect emotionally to plight of the slave. It went a long way towards helping to show people why the slaves had to be freed; even at such a terrible cost as waging war against other Americans. I believe this book truly influenced the development of our nation's soul in a way that no other book has or probably ever will again.....This book is truly a must read if only for gaining understanding of it's influence on the development of our country's unique identity, that of seeking to provide equality for all. Be sure to keep in mind the political landscape when the book was written as you read and you will find it enlightening."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I thought I knew everything I needed to know about Uncle Tom's Cabin. I've read the history books. I know it first appeared as a serial story in an abolitionist magazine in 1851. I know it appeared as a novel in 1852. I know it is credited by many with having pushed the nation into the Civil War. I know that it is the best selling American Novel of the 19th century. I know it is the 2nd best selling book in America in the 19th century, second only to the Bible. I know it is recognized as one of the most influential works of literature in America and set the stage for many political works that followed for quite some time. I know many of its images and terms have since served to themselves become stereotypes over the years seen very differently today, than they were in the days before and even shortly following the Civil War.So, when I saw that the novel was available on the Kindle as a free download, I wasn't sure I needed to read it. But I went ahead and I'm glad I did.There's always a temptation in reviewing a book critically, that the more popular a book is, the more tempting it is to adopt an elitist attitude that serves to further, not the value of the book, but rather the size of the ego of the reviewer. I was tempted while reading this to adopt some of this attitude.The book plays out as a Victorian morality play and it sermonizes in true Puritan and Calvinist form to seek to bring shame on both the North and the South for their direct and indirect support of the institution of slavery in America. Many of the characters are, from the perspective of a 21st century reader, contrived representations which seem very unrealistic and are designed to tug at the emotions of the reader.However, the measure of a book is not how it is read by those removed from its time, but rather those of its time. In spite of myself, as I progressed through the book, I found myself grudgingly in places, entering into the story and spirit of the book. In some ways, the effectiveness of the book, even with the elements mentioned comes from Stowe not painting things as negatively as might have been her temptation. With the notable exception of Simon Legree the main characters of the book, in the South of the slaveholder class, are presented in a somewhat sympathetic light. \\"Good\\" masters are shown for their benevolence and care for their slaves and in come cases it could be argued that these servants are better off than they might otherwise have been as free. But this works its way clearly to the conclusion that even with good masters the system itself is evil and there is no guarantee that benevolent circumstances will continue. Good masters can fall on hard times and be pressed to sell their property.I found myself, despite resisting and recognizing the in places heavy handed methods used in the book to appeal to emotions, entering often into and sensing the humanity and emotions of the characters. There is in places almost a Dickensian appeal to social justice that works quite well and makes it evident why the book had the impact that it did.In short, I enjoyed the book and feel now that I know, not only about the book but have entered into the book and seen America as it was before the Civil War. The final afterword of the author that appeals for action of all Christians (the primary target of the book) is quite effective and the arguments presented against some of the common defenses of slavery of that age are laid out and shown for the rationalizations they were.5 stars.

Really shook me up. I think everyone should read it at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"There can hardly be an American who does not know Uncle Tom's Cabin's historical importance, and the same goes for millions worldwide. It did much to solidify Northern anti-slavery sentiment and has been seriously credited with making the Civil War inevitable - supposedly even by Lincoln himself. However, though America's greatest bestseller ever on release, it now seems as if fewer and fewer people actually read it. This is unfortunate, because its significance alone makes it essential, but it is also an incredible story and well worth reading in itself.Those reading for historical perspective will have many assumptions confirmed but also be very surprised. Most obviously and importantly, it is easy to see why the book moved so many and emboldened abolitionists. It is easily one of the most profoundly emotional and pathos-drenched works ever; only the truly inhuman will not be moved, and many will cry. The characters seem supremely real, and we care for them as if they are our intimates. Harriet Beecher Stowe writes accurately and precisely of slavery's many evils. Much of what she says is so gut-wrenching as to be near-unbearable. Reading it is emotionally distressing and even at times almost physically painful; when something is this hard to even read, we simply cannot imagine what it must have been like to live. To think such suffering and inhumanity existed in America barely a century and a half ago truly astounds. There are many accounts of American slavery, from ones written by slaves to meticulously researched historical accounts, but perhaps no other is as deeply stirring. Even now we cannot read Uncle without being strongly moved; how much stronger must the effect have been when the evils described were current! I re-read it shortly after Barack Obama was elected, as many others doubtless did, and was affected more strongly and deeply than ever, moved almost to tears by the striking contrast and how far America has come.All this is if anything even more moving than inevitably high expectations would suggest, yet much of the book surprises because it is rarely or never mentioned in popular accounts. The biggest revelation may be that the story itself is excellent - not only moving but deftly plotted, superbly executed, and often thought-provoking. There is even a surprising amount of humor amid all the tragedy, St. Clare's wife being one of American literature's greatest comic creations. Deeply engrossing, Uncle pulls us in immediately and never lets go despite being a long, winding tale with a plethora of characters and many substantial subplots. Stowe's ability to handle and tie them together in a well-executed conclusion is truly stunning, especially in that this was her first novel. Indeed, inconceivable as it is, Stowe was no artist in the usual sense but an activist writing for practical ends. Such works of course almost never have any real literary or even entertainment value and are inevitably short-lived; this is why virtually everything else she wrote has been forgotten. However, Uncle is an astounding exception; unlike nearly all other such works, it does not come off as a hopelessly dated, artless tract. Though written without an eye to literature - nay, many would say, without literary skill - and for no purpose other than to reach everyday people, it remains an immense literary monument that has earned the admiration of uber-literary writers like Leo Tolstoy and Henry James. It has had many critics, quite a few of them scathing, but survived them all. Its many admirers still cannot pinpoint just what makes it so successful, but successful it certainly is.I submit that its greatest virtue is moving verisimilitude. Characterization is a big part; even minor characters - indeed even evil ones - are drawn so well, with such individuality and lifelikeness, that we will remember them long after reading. Many - Tom, Simon Legree, Little Eva - have long been archetypes. However, the realism is stunning throughout; Stowe made the Southern slavery system that few Northerners had seen come alive as if they had known it all their lives, and the same is still remarkably true for us though such a world cannot now be even imagined. She is very visceral, sparing no pains to show just how hard and demeaning slavery was mentally as well as physically; much of Uncle's immediacy comes from this central fact. However, she goes considerably beyond this to vividly convey all aspects of the Old South; everything from landscape to dialect is detailed believably and memorably. This is all the more incredible in that Stowe saw very little of this herself, and it gives Uncle great historical value even aside from the perversely fascinating slavery peek.This last, though, is certainly noteworthy. Popular slavery depictions now imply that slavery was homogenous in the South, but there were great differences - generally speaking, the farther South, the harsher and more ubiquitous. Many works focus on only one or a few aspects, but Stowe made sure to include all. Uncle begins in Kentucky, where slavery was most mild, and shows everything from its darkest Deep South facets to its New Orleans base where millions of slaves were brought and sold. We see the great diversity that existed in how slaves were treated and thought of as well as how they worked and interacted among themselves. Almost as importantly, Stowe makes clear that those directly involved in slavery were far from identical. Some truly thought of themselves as humane and even pious, generally treating slaves relatively well, others thought them subhuman and treated them accordingly, and most fell somewhere between them. St. Clare symbolizes this last; such a person probably never existed, as Stowe surely knew, but he is important for showing how one could have slaves while being as aware as anyone of slavery's evils and treating slaves as well as conditions allowed - could indeed even have them for a basically philanthropic purpose. Very few actually did this, but St. Clare is extremely valuable because he in many ways sees slavery more fully than anyone else in Uncle and criticizes accordingly.Here we get a good idea of just how thought-provoking the book is. It of course has many anti-slavery arguments - from theological to philosophical to political, a nuanced depiction of slavery's varying effect on politicians being one of its many overlooked strengths -, but they are now thankfully moot in America. However, though almost never credited for it, the book goes far deeper. For instance, St. Clare's critique goes well beyond slavery to include capitalism itself; so diverse is Uncle that Marx could easily be added to its long, varied admirers list. More fundamentally, very few works are so fully aware of human evil. Stowe believed all acts were forgivable and should be forgiven but was as starkly cognizant of humanity's inhumanity as any existential pessimist. Uncle presents human life as a near-unbroken series of miseries brought on mainly by avoidable cruelty and lack of empathy. Stoe indeed thought this force so strong that it could not be overcome; all one could do was piously submit. Death is the only escape and heaven the only redemption; this seems distinctly unfair on earth but is worth it in the end, as the latter is eternal, the former but a passing phase. This was the main Christian strand until the Renaissance, and it is all too easy to see how a sensitive, pious soul in a slaveowning country could turn to it. Thus, though somewhat paradoxical in that it looked to the past, Uncle was very far ahead of its time philosophically - far more so than in regard to slavery, where it only fanned flames. Such a bleak view of human life was not even remotely common in art or philosophy for several decades, becoming standard only after World War I. Stowe essentially saw worldly existence just as existentialists, nihilists, and other despair agents later saw it, but firm Christianity allowed her to bear it. This faith of course disappeared, opening a vast, gaping abyss that she managed to keep closed - an abyss that shows no sign of closing, leaving millions pining for a relative tranquility that seems nearly as unimaginable as American slavery. The character of St. Clare himself is also extremely forward-looking, seeming to step out of a Wilde or Shaw play forty years before one existed.As this suggests, though the fact is otherwise perhaps most stunning of all, Uncle has no hint of anything like a Civil War. Stowe of course wanted slavery ended but was Christian in the true and rare sense and had no taste for violence, whether it a Civil War or a slave uprising. She in fact wanted slaves to freely, piously, and - as much as was possible - uncomplainingly submit to slavery's evils and wanted abolitionists to appeal to Southerners' hearts and minds rather than attack or even force them to end slavery. Though clearly an unflinching realist in that she saw slavery for what it was and was unafraid to say so, she was startlingly optimistic and had a very positive view of human nature. This is clear even in the Preface, where she boldly states that she has no hard feelings toward those who uphold slavery, even saying they are often some of the best people she knows. She actually thought they were simply misled and did not see their unintended evil and that, if they could be made to, they would voluntarily end slavery.All this is clear in many ways - not least in the ending, where she allows the young, quick-tempered George a short act of violence that nearly everyone will find justified but in which she closes with an appeal to end slavery non-violently. Indeed, she does not even seem to conceive of violence as a solution. This is also present in innumerable references to God's Providence, Christian piety, eternal reward in heaven, forgiveness, refusal to judge, etc.; though rarely noted, Uncle is perhaps the most truly Christian of all novels. In contrast to the Apocalyptic, fire and brimstone streak that has sometimes flared up in Christianity and has now reached a fever pitch, Stowe and like-minded abolitionists focused on Jesus' essential message of mercy, pity, peace, and love. Conservatives have of course monopolized Christianity, especially in political terms, but Uncle is a stunning reminder that it was until very recently American liberalism's driving force. Jesus constantly said that the poor, weak, meek, etc. are blessed and under God's special protection, that they will be rewarded eternally for earthly trials, and that they should endure such trials peacefully - resisting not evil, turning the other check, etc. Very few Christians now point such things out, or even seem aware of them, but they epitomized Christianity for Stowe and her ilk and are Uncle's very essence. World wars, genocide, biological terrorism, and a host of other horrors have made such thinking seem near-laughably nave, and other parts of the book - especially the Victorian sentimentalism of which Little Eva is the apotheosis - also seem somewhat dated. Even so, Uncle remains of immense importance for showing how strict Christianity was not only the underpinning that let the book speak so powerfully to so many but also the prime mover of liberalism itself.Uncle Tom himself of course epitomizes this gap between expectations, the book's reality, and later history. He is Stowe's ideal slave; that he is also a master's ideal slave - at least in theory - may be ironic, and Stowe's treatment of blacks throughout is perhaps best described as condescending. Perhaps most offensive of all is that she thought it impossible for blacks to integrate into American society, assuming that a Christian republic should be made for them in Africa if they were freed. This comes across in the novel, though more subtly than other beliefs. All this infuriated many twentieth century black authors and intellectuals, and \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a byword for blacks thought to have sold out to whites. This in many ways makes Uncle more worth reading than ever and certainly more interesting. Needless to say, such reaction was absolutely unthinkable at the time; the book was almost liberalism's height, and anyone told it would some day be condemned as conservative would have likely been too shocked to laugh. This issue is far too complex to even outline, much less decide, in a review. Suffice it to say that these later views have great legitimacy, whether or not one agrees; this is the kind of thing all must decide for themselves. However, it is important to realize a few things. First, Tom was a genuine hero to Stowe; she certainly did not mean to be degrading or stereotypical but made Tom the exemplar in a book with many white characters. Many others thought the same. That later blacks would prefer a Malcolm X-like revolutionary is very understandable, but precious few whites of the era - certainly not Stowe - could have even conceived of one. It is also worth noting that the book would not have had the success and impact it did - and may even have backfired - if Tom were otherwise portrayed. There may be much to regret in his depiction and Uncle's presentation of blacks overall, but this is arguably best seen as proof of society's liberalizing rather than a fault of the book or Stowe.Stowe's Preface looks forward to a time when \\"sketches similar to these shall be valuable only as memorials of what has long ceased to be.\\" Uncle is certainly that, invaluable historically both for what it shows of a thankfully long-past era and for its own significance. In addition, it has achieved a transcendent importance that probably no one else could have foreseen; more than just a literary landmark, it is a towering Americana monument - socially, culturally, politically, and otherwise priceless. Every American should read it, as should anyone anywhere who is at all interested in slavery's dark history, Americana, or the few books that have quite literally changed the world.As for this edition, it has Stowe's Preface, a short bibliography, and a scholarly Afterword. This last is particularly excellent and all the more valuable for being written in the 1960s at the civil rights movement's height. It gives substantial background on Stowe, the novel, and the historical context but also examines Uncle in terms of current events, which makes it all the more interesting a century later. Other quality versions exist, but anyone who comes across this will have a great one."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I believe this book should be a mandatory read For high school history class.

Yes, Miss Stowe did portray the inhumane cruelty of the early 1800s and, yes, she provided a quality storyline to bring these concepts to life. But, that being said, I strongly feel that her depiction of the slave holders tilted to both polar extremes. One the humanistic side she showed two sets of slave owners who, for the most part, treated their charges as nearly being part of the \`family'. In some instances the attention and care that they received even outstripped family members. This, I am sure, is the manner in which the author would have treated slaves if, indeed, they were in her charge. On the other extreme Miss Stowe depicts Simon Legree as the incarnate projection of pure evil. A cotton farmer, who by all accounts is monetarily quite successful, treating his slaves as a few steps below that of mere disposable waste. If such were the case, Mr. Legree would be forced to take most (if not all) of his profits and use them for the continual repurchase of replacement slaves for the ones he presently is mistreating. For they will soon be dead either through his own direct hand or by his continual abuse. Yes, I understand that the author did have a statement to make that literally screamed against the recent passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. She, likewise, felt it her mission to embolden the Northern States to take action against the dehumanizing actions of the Southern plantation owners. By using these extremes and ignoring the norm, her mission was successful. Reality, on the other hand, was slightly different. Yes, the African race were treated as mere chattel and, yes, they were subjected to a fully dehumanizing set of circumstances. But, no they would not normally be treated such that their adult life span was reduced to a few years. Regardless of the location and output of the plantation, they would not be treated to the demonized actions shown by Mr. Legree. They were simply too expensive to replace if the owner placed any value on his profits! And by being so they had little chance of being killed on the arrogant whims that are shown in this novel.The other interesting concept that is shown in this 1852 publication is the overwhelming influence that the Christian religion had on Miss Stowe's life. While I am certain that the slave population did cling to this religion as a source of comfort due of their circumstances, I doubt if it had the strong influence on other non-blacks that it had on the author. The black slaves were purposely taught by the slave holders, through various means, the full scope of Christian redemption. But they did so not for the slaves salvation but, rather, for their own selfish purposes. It provided for them a more placid, yet hopeful, group of indentured workers that would neither rebel nor disobey their owners. Without concept of an existence of a continued life after death from this horrendous existence, where all things would be completely rectified, slave owners could not have controlled such large mass of people. Rebellion and revolution would have been the rule and not the exception. Miss Stowe, on the other hand, made no mention of this form of manipulation on the owners part and, instead, saw Christianity as being a universal religion that all persons should embrace as she did.Please, for your own sake, pick up this important work and actually read it instead of merely remembering the slight reference made to it while sitting through 5th grade American history class........"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had read this book as a teen.

Stowe enthralls readers with her vivid depictions of various scenarios relating to the wretched, corrupt establishment. Her knowledge and application of Biblical Scripture is refreshingly interwoven throughout the story, and serves to expose and convict the hypocrisy of human merchandising. Amongst the plethora of characters is my personal favorite, Augustine St. Claire, who ultimately succumbs to the crushing realization that even a \\"good\\" master is plagued with the inherent wickedness of the horrific business. Of course, the novel's title character, Uncle Tom, is a gem; enlightening the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord and ours, Jesus Christ. Though this \\"fictional\\" work stands brilliantly on its own, it is imperative to mention that one year later, in 1853, Stowe released a non-fiction explanation, through her publisher, entitled \\"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin - Presenting the Original Facts and Documents upon Which the Story Is Founded, Together with Corroborative Statements Verifying the Truth of the Work.\\" It seems to me an absolute necessity for posterity to own this companion piece, lest we ever forget the veracity & relevence of the original."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I never read this book until now. Having recently visited the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, I became interested in why she wrote such a book, and the more I read, the more I understood the terrible conditions of slavery that our country allowed in the years leading up to the Civil War. I can see why this book incensed so many people to rebel against the practice of slavery and why they fought so hard to rid this country of it. According to something I read in her home, it is said that President Lincoln, upon meeting her, said: \\"so you're the little lady that caused this great war...\\" After reading this book, I can agree - it surely upset and angered many people to fight for the abolition of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"MY 6TH GRADE TEACHER READ THIS TO THE CLASS BACK IN THE DAY.

Finally, upon retiring, I had time to start reading those many books I had put off for so long, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" being one. I find it to be a powerful anti-slavery tract, extremely empathic to the suffering of the slaves and fascinating for the language and characters of the time. I am enjoying it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is a classic book. It is very well written but because of the language used it is at times very hard to read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I can't imagine that I have never read this book, even though it's been on my to-be-read list for years. I thought I had a pretty good idea about what it was about, but I wanted to read it because of its historical significance--Abraham Lincoln credited it with leading to the Civil War. However, I didn't expect it to have the powerful impact on me that it did.Since \\"Uncle Tom\\" today refers to a subservient, obsequious person with no courage to stand up to evil, I was surprised to read about the character of Uncle Tom. He was no weak-willed, servile person, but a devout Christian who lived the way he understood the Bible said. He didn't rebel against his earthly masters because he believed in turning the other cheek, as Jesus preached and practiced. However, when ordered to whip another slave, Uncle Tom sacrificed his own life by refusing to carry out the evil order. He would not take part in violence against another person even though his refusal lead to violence against him. Uncle Tom is an example of how Christians should live and die. I would consider the highest of honors if I were called an Uncle Tom!The other thing that really struck me about the book was how people who considered themselves good Christians owned slaves and/or approved of slavery. They felt that if they treated their slaves well, they were doing their Christian duty. They didn't see that the enslaved people were created by God in His image, just as they were, that the slaves deserved to live their lives in freedom, just as the slave owners did. From today's perspective, it's easy to see how evil slavery was and how much those Christians who participated in it were violating God's will.As a society, we pride ourselves on being so much better than the generations before us that perpetuated such an evil institution as slavery. Yet today, we have a class of human beings who are, like slaves, considered less than human; a class of human beings who have no right to freedom, indeed no right to life.Those who are denied the right to life are the unborn, the most innocent and most vulnerable of God's people. A mother can murder her baby legally, just as the slave owner could murder his slave legally.Ending slavery meant that thousands of uneducated men and women with no experience at making the simplest of decisions were suddenly responsible for themselves and their families. The whole structure of society had to change, and that process has taken more than a century.Ending abortion is much simpler. Pregnant women simply carry their babies to term rather than discard them like garbage. The mother may find that a temporary hardship, but killing the baby results in permanent death. If the mother is not able or willing to raise the child, the baby can be adopted by a loving family. Because of the huge number of abortions each year, it will probably take time to have enough adoptive parents for all the new babies. However, today many families are unable to adopt a baby as they would love to do because there simply aren't enough babies. Finding loving homes for babies will be much easier than changing the whole structure of society after the elimination of slavery.I can see why Uncle Tom's Cabin awoke the conscience of the country regarding slavery. Thanks be to God for the advocacy of abolitionists who believed that every human being is made in the image of God and deserves life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm praying that the advocacy of Christians who believe in the sanctity of all human life will bring about an end to abortion."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a very melodramatic book. I have read it several times over the past twenty years and must say that it has something new for every decade or even for every generation. When considered for our time, Uncle Tom's stands out as a classic prose that hits directly at those turbulent times before the Civil War, and reflects issues of war and principles today. Harriet Beecher Stowe had a great cause to write about and wrote a work that still is as relevant today as it was during his time.The author's masterful story summarizes the conflicting attitudes of a nation on the brink of civil war. It comes with the depth of stories like Of Mice and Men, Disciples of Fortune.Melodramatic though it is, it was written in the style of the times and for a situation that required it. This is a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I think the saddest thing about this book is that everybody remembers Uncle Tom, even if only as a particularly ugly byword, but nobody remembers George Harris.\\"I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his property. But now I'm a free man, standing on God's free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine... You can come up, if you like, but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man.\\"He is a hell of a character, and one of the few here that could exit the pages of this book and stand his own ground in the pages of another one.That's the difficulty with Uncle Tom's Cabin, at least for me: if you judge it by our modern sensibilities about what a novel should be and do, it doesn't hold up at all. The characters are mostly one- or two-dimensional figures, often exaggerated past all believability, who are sketched out to serve an obvious purpose: Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote every page of this book to rail against slavery, and although she skewers her subject from a hundred different ways and angles, that is really her only aim. For us in the 21st century, for whom slavery has melted away in all but a few of the darkest and most backward corners of the world, this is pretty much preaching to the choir.Let me tell you why it's still an amazing book.You might know that it was written in 1852 - a time in which the issue of slavery was boiling over in Congress and at dinner tables across the nation, but still almost ten years before the breakup of the United States and the start of the Civil War. In 2012, it is still FRIGHTENING to read this book, to listen to the author decry slavery by every means imaginable - from sarcastic narrative whispers to naked, screaming invective - and to almost hear the desperation in her voice as she throws herself bodily against this massive, monstrous evil, which for her *has no imaginable end*. In the last pages, she talks with faint hope about Liberia, where she imagines American slaves could go to construct a nation of their own, but that's it: at the time when she put pen to paper, she went to bed at night and rose in the morning knowing that human beings were still suffering and dying by the millions. 160 years later, we've long since ended slavery in America, but that fear and anger and almost-hopeless despair is still fresh on the page.So I guess what I'm saying is, absolutely do read this book - and when you do, read it less for the plot and more for the real, non-fiction people who inspired it.And also for George Harris, 19th-century action hero."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This story shows how prejudice shapes peoples thinking. It moves one to think of how they view and treat others. You cannot read this with an honest and open heart and not see how God has made all men equally with the ability to love, fear, overcome predjudices and have faith and courage. It shows the good sides and bad sides of both blacks and whites. I love how this shows the hypocrisy of religion, and how the bible in the wrong hands is misinterpreted to justify wickedness. The first half of the book is riveting. The last half, while very imporatant in the aspects of the characters and showing the evil of slavery, is too preachy. It virtually saintizes Tom and Evangeline, with all its talk about heaven.

This book figured prominently as it was responsible for opening the publics' eyes to the real conditions of slavery and, it could be argued, fanned the flames that led to the Civil War. Though there is a that certain amount of the melodrama that one would expect in a 19th Century political statement, it still makes as powerful a statement today as it did in the late 1850's.

So downloaded it free to our Kindle and was engrossed for two days. I found the book very insightful into life in the U.S. in the mid-ninetheenth century. Stowe had obviously done her homework regarding life in Kentucky, Ohio, Vermont and Louisiana. From the postlogue, she had verified stories of slavery from around the country that she brought together in the book, so that it was not just fanciful accounts. I found the writing sentimental, of course, but engrossing and I enjoyed very much how the author would comment directly to reader at various points in the book. Also, I found the argument and conflicts pro and con about slavery that Stowe imparts in the dialogue to be fascinating, giving us a glimpse as how men and women rationalized their actions and beliefs.The book was also inspiring to me as a Christian, for one of its tenants is not just to end slavery but to incorporate one's faith into every decision one makes. Uncle Tom is a hero in that he puts his faith before his situation. He doesn't sell out to the slave-owner as some accuse him, he sells out to Christ -- inspiring all of us. Eva too is an inspiring character and the book, while drenched in pathos around these two particularly, lifts up the ideals of Christian character.Considering that this book is reportedly the second-best selling book in the world in the 19th century (the first being the Bible), has never been out of print and may have influenced the start of the Civil War, it seems to behoove all who are interested in the history to enjoy the insight and inspiration that Stowe brings to us."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The unabridged audio of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is excellent in every way. This is a classic that should never be forgotten , and has more theology in it that most theology books. It also fairly portrays slavery and the arguments for and against. The real thing that makes this book so outstanding as in many audio editions, is the narrator, Buck Schinder. I don't believe I have ever heard a better reader who could make every character come alive with the correct personality. His mastery of the Negro dialect is amazing. This book is heartwarming as well as heartbreaking, and is full of truths, as Harriet Beecher Stowe did much research and many interviews with escaped slaves while writing it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"An openly critical novel in respect to slavery in the US that stereotypes the main characters to provide an overview of the situation, Uncle Tom's Cabin provides insight into the definite cruelties and suffering involved with slavery, and surprisingly they not only affect the slaves themselves. Uncle Tom finds himself passed on from trader to trader, and indeed the only thing that keeps him safe is his master's character. His abrupt change from caring, respectable masters like Mr. Shelby and St. Clare, both of whom struggle with their consciences, to Simon Legree, the representation of all evils, play on the emotions of the reader. Even his two early masters are stereotypes of their age: one is a kind master who would treat his slaves well (unless, of course, money issues would press him into letting go of his most valuable possession--Tom). St. Clare, although both kind and fair, lets his slaves run free about his plantation because he does not want to begin controlling them, lest he will never know when to stop when the slave begin to build up resistance to the pain. Days before gaining his freedom, fateful circumstances lead to Tom's transfer to the perilous care of the reckless Simon Legree. But in spite of his experiences with the wrongs committed on the plantation, Tom finds a way to cling to his morals and follow his heart, eventually dying a martyr, but at the same time influencing his peers, (and \\"superiors\\"), in such a way that his spirit is kept alive through the positive outcomes that resulted. A poignant, inspiring novel that urges men and women all over the world to continue believing in the right through thick and thin, Uncle Tom's Cabin will forever keep the memory of the honest hearts of men and women all over the United States who suffered through such prejudice and overcame."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Each chapter has a number of words or phrases, usually obscure, noted with an asterisk.

This novel is a graphic description of the horrid life of slaves and the strength it took for them to endure it. Many scenes in this book contain horrible gory things although I believe it takes a story with this kind of violence to really show what it was like to be a slave. The author does a good job at making the reader feel the pain of the victim and understand the things these people had to go through. Uncle Tom's Cabin is about a slave who uses his faith in God to help other slaves throughout their excruciating journey. This story portrays many different versions of attitudes towards slavery also. It contrasts the difference of treatment of the slaves in different areas. The story shows that in many parts of the United States slaves were treated with a lot of respect, but in the other half they were treated like animals who should be starved and beaten.Personally I really enjoyed this book in all aspects. This is a story that could change ones outlook on life completely. Some of the description in the scenes made me cringe at the thought, but it made me realize that if I am cringing at these words on a page of paper I could not possibly imagine what it must be like to actually be there experiencing it.I think this is a book that everyone should read at some point in his or her life.

This book taught me so much about what it was really like for slaves in that time. It was not one of the easiest books, but it was worth it.

I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is interested in slave trade and the great guilt that follows it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Yes slavery was wrong, but it is still going on today, even here in America the greatest country in the world. Don't really believe all the negatives she writes about slave owners and their cruelty, NO first hand experience/observance of what she wrote about only second hand information. Felt sorry for the slaves it isn't usually told that it was their own kind that captured them in Africa and sold them to the slave traders. She neglects to expound about the many slave owners that were themselves Black. On one of the Cane River plantations in Louisiana was told to have been owned by a negress."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I just read Uncle Tom's Cabin for the first time, and I fell in love with it right away. I am not a strong reader, so I found it difficult at times. But, to me, it was worth every minute of my time. The story is filled with unforgettable characters that you will teach you a lesson about how to live life as you read about them. Harriet Beecher Stowe is an amazing author and makes each and every event mesmerizing and unique.I have never read a book of this genre that kept me intrigued throughout the whole novel. I normally find historical novels boring, but the author pulled me into the story and really made me realize the horror and cruelty of the treatment of slaves at that time. The message of this novel by a true abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe, was clear to see...Slaves needed to be free, treated equally, and able to live their own lives!Uncle Tom's Cabin starts off with Eliza (a slave-mother) overhearing her master and a slave trader talking about selling Uncle Tom (one of the most loyal and reliable slaves on the plantation) for a large sum of money. The trader is reluctant to the deal because he doesn't believe that any slave is worth the amount of money that was offered. But when a slave boy comes in (Eliza's son) he asks if he can buy both Uncle Tom, and the little boy. The plantation owner agrees, and Eliza is very worried.When the plantation owner tells his wife that he sold their best slaves, she is not at all happy. She even suggests telling the trader that he had changed his mind and no longer needed to sell two slaves......but he assures her that she is wrong, and that even though Uncle Tom is the best slave that they have on the whole plantation, he needs the money to pay off the debt he owns to the trader. She informs him that the little boy has a loving mother but, he just acts as if he doesn't care and assures her once again that he needs the money.That same night Eliza, tells her son that they are running away and finding Canada, because the plantation owner is trying to sell him. He quickly agrees and they run off, hours after their escape when they are reported missing, a search is sent out for them, and they are seen for a few minutes but then are lost again. This is just the beginning of an amazing adventure with a life changing impact. Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the best novels I have ever read in my entire life! I encourage you to read this thrilling and fascinating story."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is a famous work of American literature, because of its historical context and its political importance as a piece of anti-slavery propoganda as much as for the story and quality of the writing. The phrase &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; has even gained some currency as a derogatory term in modern usage. The book captures and condences much of the worst elements of slavery in the south as it recounts the trials of several slaves, their owners and their families. The story is enthralling and the crossing of the ice flow remains one of the more famous scenes in literature. The story unashamedly promotes the anti-slavery position and promotes its activists Apparently this book had considerable impact in its day and although to some extent some of the thunder has since been stolen by blockbusters such as Roots, is still a powerful book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I do respect and embrace the historical significance and effect of this novel in it's place and time. I applaud the author's goal, courage and tenacity. I loved the main character, Tom.That said, the writing style is not for me. I'm too spoiled by modern authors' constraints of being direct and succinct.I understand that in the culture of the time, a female author would find it necessary to obviate, to beat around the bush in making her (socially activist) point in order to comply with expectations of politeness and humility, to include occasional flattery of the opposition to make the novel more palatable to a wider audience and thus further her underlying goal. Unfortunately, these elements also make it very hard for \\"modern-me\\" to endure the book.All-in-all, a profitable read for the historical relevance."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This classic is a must read. It reminds us of our US history's darkest moments."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Considering that Uncle Tom's Cabin was at one point banned (of course in Southern states) I was expected a gritty, horrifying glimpse into the lives of plantation slaves. Not so. Uncle Tom is the honest hard-working slaves of two kind 'owners', Mr. Shelby and Mr St.Clare. It is not until Tom is sold to Mr Legree that his life is filled with cruelty and ultimately death. The majority of the book, I feel, is an observation of how Christianity is a proponent or opponent of slavery depending on who is doing the interpretation. Although, Stowe's admits dramatizing (fictionalizing)the story lines off of 'real' events, I find it hard to believe the \\"happy ending\\". PBS had a great show called \\"Slavery and the Making of America\\", their website also gives a list on NON-fiction books on slavery. The truth is far more compelling than fiction."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had no problems with delivery of the book. It arrived in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Richard Wright - Uncle Tom's CabinThese stories are sad, and at times, hard to read. The injustice makes your heart flip-flop and raises your blood pressure.Lord that Black Americans survived is unbelievable. Do y'all know that it was predicted by white society in the late 19th century that we would naturally die out. We fooled them. We are still here. Like a phoenix from the ashes, we rise!I recommend this book. I think it is good to remember the pain of the ancestors, and how we benefits from it today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Throughout history, few books have garnered more controversy than Harriet Beecher Stowe's UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. When he met Mrs. Stowe in 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed, \\"So you're the little woman that wrote the book started this great war.\\" That may be a bit of an overstatement, but the book certainly had enormous social and political consequences.In the social structure that has evolved since the emancipation of slaves in this country, few labels have a more derogatory intent to the black person than being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\". We hear it repeatedly used to indicate a black person who chooses not to follow in lockstep with the direction of radical black anarchist leaders. For the life of me, I can't grasp that concept. What greater compliment than to be referred to as a man who faced such immense adversity yet who remained steadfast in his faith.I realize the argument is that Tom did as he was told and refused to stand up for himself, but that argument only portrays the shallowness of a society that has been more and more anti-Christian as time goes by. Those who would make that argument fail to see the strength and courage it takes for a true Christian to resist temptation and consistently put personal challenge into the Lord's hands.This book, today, receives a tremendous amount of criticism for Stowe's constant Christian \\"preaching\\" throughout the book. Stowe, born in 1811, is of the founding daughter generation. Her strong portrayal of Christian virtue is yet another reminder that America was founded on Christian principles. People today, in our society where Christianity is under constant criticism, hate to admit that America once was, and was intended to be, a Christian nation. At the time of its publishing, Stowe's work was criticized for being biased towards anti-slavery, but was never criticized for its expression of Christian virtues.For me, and I'm sure others, the book does have one great flaw. Mrs. Stowe was well known for accurately depicting the vernacular of a particular region. While that may add authenticity to a story, it also creates a painfully tedious read. That is the case here. This is not a book that most people could pick up and read at once. For me, it was a long daily process of 10-20 pages at a time.Here is an example of what I'm referring to;\\"I'm thinkin' my old man won't know de boys and de baby. Lor'! she's de biggest gal, now, -good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She's out to the house, now, watchin' de hoe-cake. I's got jist de very patern my old man liked so much a bakin'. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin' he was took off. Lord bless us! How I felt, dat ar mornin'!\\"I'm sure there are readers who appreciate such authenticity, but for me, and I'm sure untold masses of high-school students who once found this on their \\"required reading\\" list, that is just plain tedious. My only other knock on the book is the \\"happily ever after\\" ending which Stowe gave to several of the main characters. For those once trapped in the bondage of slavery, I don't believe too many of them lived out that kind of scenario.That said, if you've not read this book, do so. Find a way struggle through it. Stowe gives portrayals of both sides of the slavery coin. By that I mean, she managed to portray that many slave owners considered their slaves as family members and treated them with respect and kindness, while there were also other owners who viewed slaves as mere possessions to be abused and defiled.This book may not have started the Civil War, but it most certainly had a profound effect upon society like few books in history have ever had. That fact, in and of itself, makes this book a must read for everyone.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I really like this book.

My son had to read it for school, however, the book on CD was a huge help."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book seems quite modern in its style and content. I have heard that it was the best selling novel by an American author in the 19th century. The book was written and distributed before the civil war occurred and was read by Northerners and Southerners alike, also by Europeans. Many of the characters seem like stereotypes but It is written for the thinking person. Many of the problems of families of undocumented workers and the people that help them are being faced or ignored by society and government today. Today it is hard to imagine a slave child being sold and separated from his mother, but it is not so hard to imagine the desperate mother going to extraordinary measures to protect her child."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The reason why Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin was to let the North know what was going on in the South with slavery . Black families were broken apart and sold, young girls and women were taken advantage of by white owners, some were beaten to death by their owners and slaves could be treated anyway the owner wanted because they were not citizens. The white women characters cared more about the slaves than the white men. They didn't want to sell or break up families.Uncle Tom was an uncommonly good and honest man and devouted Christian. He was sold when his owner needed money. At first he was sold to a man who was ok, but then he was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a mean man. When Tom was a slave for Legree he was beaten to the point of death. Everyone should read this book because it gives you an idea of what happened at the time of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Wow! I must say this book is just...really amazing. I would reccomend it to anyone especially anyone who is studying the civil war or slavery in school."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a powerful novel that vividly illustrates the cruelties of slavery. The book tells of how the slaves in the pre-Civil War South, were often treated like they were less than human, and were taken away fom their loved ones and then bought and sold to be someone's property. It also tells of the gruesome and sometimes shocking treatment most slaves received. While telling of the many inhumane things endured by the slaves, Uncle Tom's Cabin also tells of some of the few slaves that had good masters and were treated kindly. But the novel goes on to explain that even a slave whom was fortunate enough to be \\"purchased\\" by a kind \\"master,\\" still prayed for his or her freedom; because just knowing what it felt like to be free, was in the hopes and dreams of every slave.The main caracter in Uncle Tom's cabin is a slave named Tom. Tom is sold and taken away from his family and friends. In the posession of his new master, Tom, for the first time, is subject to some of the worst brutalities of slavery. His religious faith is his only consolation. Tom is able to have faith through even the toughest times. The presentation of Tom in the book helps give it its meaningful influence. This well-written antislavery novel has had a huge impact on readers everywhere and will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a compelling novel of the powerful thoughts and feelings of Harriet Beecher Stowe during a time when slavery was the main aspect of life for many and the intolerable and unaccepted thoughts of others. This story is a true American classic delving deep into the hearts of citizens and challenging the authority and government of the United States in the mid-1800's. Telling of a kind, elderly slave by the name of Tom, this tale told of Tom's adventure through slavery and the cruel people involved with the practice. Concluding the novel, Tom comes to a devastating end.I thought that in this book, Harriet Beecher Stowe explained slavery in America better than anyone could have. This is partly because she lived during the time period and the war and conflicts that followed the publication of her timeless account."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a touching book about the evils of slavery. In the story Tom, a slave, is sold to various masters who have very different personalities. One master is a very nice person who cares about his slaves. Another is a horrible man who beats his slaves and doesn't care about anyone but himself. Even though Tom goes through many hardships, he is still forgiving and follows the word of God. The novel also talks about a runaway slave named Eliza and her son. She tries to escape when she finds out that her son is being sold and desperately flees.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a great book that tells how horrible slavery is by examples of a few slaves. It showed me how hard it was for slaves to live back in times of slavery. This is a great book, but it was a little hard to follow. Harriet Beecher Stowe sometimes gets a little too descriptive and it is easy to become confused. Even so, I still think that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a terrific book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is definitely a great classic. I enjoyed the story plot of this book. I especially loved the chapters on Eliza and her boy and how they ran away from their master.

The story plot is that Eliza and her boy, Harry, are running from their master and the trader because their master sold Harry to the trader. Eliza is just trying to save Harry from the trader taking him away from her. Eliza's husband, a slave for another master, is also running away from his master.

With courage and insight unprecedented in her time, Stowe uses moving family tales of a number of black and white families to pillory the violence and hatred to which blacks were subjected prior to the American Civil War and thrills the reader with convincing philosophical debates that reveal the astonishing hypocrisy and weak-willed rationalizations that the white population used to justify their actions.But, as a novel, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is unsatisfying, overly long and poorly edited. Stowe's insistence on writing her dialogue in a faux black English dialect is unconvincing at best and is actually often irritating and distracting as it becomes more and more difficult to decipher what her characters are actually trying to say.Her insistence on preaching and using Christian church teachings and the bible as the primary basis for criticizing prejudice, racism and slavery frankly grated my sensibilities. There is plenty enough wrong with slavery and its history in America from a purely humanist point of view without resorting to what would be categorized as \\"bible thumping\\" today. (That said, I will admit that it may have been an appropriate approach to convince what she saw as her potential audience at the time).The white characters she uses to support and convey her message of understanding, compassion and her political agenda of abolition are so sugary sweet as to be positively cloying. A scene in which her primary white character, Evangeline St Clare, gathers her family and her family's slaves around her death bed in order to distribute locks of her hair to one and all was so melodramatic and pointless as to approach the level of bizarre.I would never say to any potential future reader that I enjoyed \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". I didn't! In fact, at times, it was even a struggle to finish it. But the message, the history, the overwhelming importance and the power of the arguments conveyed by the story are more than enough reason to read it anyway. If enough people take the message to heart then perhaps the world has a possibility of avoiding repetition of events like the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, the rape of Nanking or the slaughter of the Muslims in Bosnia by the Serbs.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is an OK book. There are several reasons why I did or did not like this book. First of all, I liked it because it showed details of what a real slave life was like. It had an interesting plot too. On the other hand, it was disturbing to read some people's views about slavery. Also, there was some hard vocabulary in this novel, making it hard to read. Another reason why it was hard to read is because it was written over one hundred years ago. The dialect is confusing and takes a while to process. The end of Uncle Tom's Cabin is very surprising. I won't spoil it for anyone, but I didn't like the ending of the book. You would never expect it. This book, in my opinion, is very sad and disturbing, but it teaches me how lucky I am to be living in this time period. If I was asked to read this book again, I probably wouldn't. Even though it is one of the more interesting history books I have ever read, it is depressing, and I hate depression. If you're looking for an interesting history novel, read Uncle Tom's Cabin.

The book was obviously intended to reach a very wide audience as it is very easy to read. I give the book a low rating because the reader can predict every next step in the book, and at times it seems that Mrs. Stowe was trying too hard to evoke emotion from the reader-audience. The plot is quite simply too far fetched (with many fantastical reunions and unreal characters).

I'd always been told it was, but this book demonstrates why with so many vivid details. I don't know if I'd been mature enough as a kid to really grasp it all as well as I did now, though. The book is beautifully written, flourishing with descriptions often lovely and occasionally horrible in detail. The few slow parts are more than made up for by the overall greatness of the work.

Important details from the story are given.Uncle Tom's Example of \\"Christ-like\\" CharacterUncle Tom showed exceptional \\"Christ-like\\" Character by being willing to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others. He follows Christ's perfect example of laying down his life for others, as seen in John 15:13: \\"Greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends,\\" and we see this manifested in Uncle Tom's life in four ways. First, he said he'd rather be sold individually than to risk the security of all the plantation slaves. Also, when Uncle Tom was offered his freedom, he surprisingly turned it down out of spiritual concern for his master. Third, he also showed great self sacrifice by helping a slave named Lucy although he risked punishment in the process. Lastly, he gave his life to protect two slaves named Cassy and Emmaline who were being mistreated by his master. Let's look at each of these examples individually.First, Tom showed Christ like character by being willing to be sold instead of all the slaves on the plantation. His master, Mr. Shelby, made some bad investments and incurred some debt. In order to pay off this debt, Master Shelby had to sell his best slave. Uncle Tom had been with him since Mr. Shelby was a baby and throughout that time Tom had been a very faithful slave. Mr. Shelby had given him a large amount of responsibility on the plantation. Because of this, Tom was more valuable than all the other slaves and was the only single slave of enough worth to pay off the debt. Although master had promised not to sell him, Tom responded in a self-sacrificial way: \\"Mas'r always found me on the spot-he always will. I never have broke trust... and I never will. It's better for me alone to go, than to break up the place and sell all.\\" Uncle Tom was sold and sent away from his wife and children.He was purchased by a man named St. Augustine who promised as well to free Tom. Tom showed his Christ-like character by not taking his freedom unless his master Saint Augustine got saved. St. Augustine's daughter, Evangeline, had just died. St. Augustine wanted Tom to follow him wherever he went, because Tom and his daughter had been close friends, and St. Augustine was reminded of his daughter when he was around Tom. The benefit to this particular situation was that Tom had more close contact with St. Augustine, and he was able to talk to him at a much closer level. It even got to the point where St. Augustine almost thought aloud to Tom. Tom was, therefore, able to speak much easier to his master about spiritual things. When St. Augustine told Tom would be set free in a few weeks, Tom replied, \\"Not while Mas'r is in trouble, I'll stay with Mas'r as long as he wants me, so as I can be of any use.\\" Earlier Tom had shared how valuable being free was to him; nevertheless, he was devoted to his master and cared about his spiritual condition more than his own comfort. Sadly, Saint Augustine died suddenly and Uncle Tom lost his opportunity to be freed. He was sold again except this time his master, Simon Legree, was a cruel and harsh man.When Tom was at Simon Legree's place, he showed tremendous character in a number of ways towards a slave named Lucy. While picking cotton, Tom helped Lucy, a feeble slave who was bought at the same time as Tom, by putting extra cotton in her bag while harvesting. Simon Legree gave orders for Tom to beat Lucy even though she had enough cotton in her sack. Simon Legree planned to teach Tom to be a slave driver. Tom refused to beat Lucy, saying \\"I beg Mas'r's pardon, hopes Mas'r won't set me at that. It's what I an't used to, - never did, - and can't do, no way possible.\\" In reply his master beat him several times, then he asked if he would do it again. Once again Tom replied \\"This yer thing, I can't feel it right to do'; - and, Mas'r, I never shall do it, -never!\\" Tom was severely beaten for his refusal.The final way that Uncle Tom was able to show his \\"Christ-like\\" character was by giving his life to protect two slaves who were being mistreated by his master. The slave named Cassy came very close to killing her master because she was being mistreated. She asked Uncle to escape with her. He refused to escape, but he told Cassy and Emmaline to do so if they had a chance. They needed to make an escape, if possible, because they couldn't handle the oppression in a Godly way. In a sense, Tom was protecting his master. A chance for Emmaline and Cassy to escape eventually did come. It was not easy for Uncle Tom now that Cassy was gone because she was the only one that was keeping Simon from killing Tom. When Simon Legree asked Tom to give information about Cassy and Emmaline's escape, Tom would not speak. As a consequence, Simon became very angry and beat Tom to death. This shows Godly character by Tom; for he followed Jesus' perfect example of remaining Godly even to his martyrdom.Through these examples we see exceptional \\"Christ-like\\" character by Tom. I think Tom's character in this book really shows the benefits and peace that a true Christian takes part of in his walk with Christ. This really motivates me to take the Bible seriously, and to follow its commands, to grow stronger every day, as well as to follow Christ's perfect example as Uncle Tom did."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"If you haven't taken the time to read Uncle Tom's Cabin, then you have missed out on a compelling book about the horrific events that took place regarding slavery in America.

Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the slaves' dialogue (as it is written in the dialogue of the times much like Mark Twain's novels) hard to read. The book covers the lives of two slaves: the pious and faithful Tom and the beautiful and loving Eliza. The descritions of the punishments slaves endured make the novel all the more important-- underscoring the inhumaity of such a system. This is a book that once read is not easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel that touched many people's lives including my own. It made me realize just how lucky I am to be living like I am today. Harriet Beecher Stowe takes us through the lives of two slaves, Tom and Eliza. We read about their triumphs and hardships that they go through in order to get one thing. Freedom. There are just a few things that I didn't enjoy about this book. The dialogue that takes place in Uncle Tom's Cabin was a little more difficult to understand than what I am normally used too. Another thing that I didn't really like was all the details about the punishments that the slaves had to endure. Overall, I think that this book is a book that everyone should have the opportunity to read. I am very glad that I read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"We can't forget WHY this book was written in the first place. It was a ...tool used by Stowe to light a fire in an apathetic society. Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, George Harris, Eliza, and etc were examples of all sorts of bits and pieces of stories and legends that Harriet Beecher Stowe had heard or experienced. Yes, Uncle Tom was too good to be realistic. But, Stowe chose to portray him as almost Christ-like. (and definitely a martyr.) A martyr for the black race in this novel. That is why Uncle Tom is so pious and so spiritual. He can die for the cause because he uses Christ and his crucification as his (Tom's) inspiration. Little Eva was almost like a biblical prophet. She certainly did not express herself as a normal 5 and 6 year old would. But in this case, Stowe uses Eva as a source of conscience for the white southerners. Each character was not just simply a name. Each character was a manifistation of eithor: 1.good 2.evil or 3.public perception at that time. Yes this book by todays standards is considered prejudiced or racist. I believe Stowe was doing her best to motivate the public and to cause an otherwise apathetic nation to overturn the common practice of slavery. This was not a novel that tried in any way to proove absolute equality between the two races. This may make the book racist to some readers, but we must remember the time and the reason this novel was written."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This was the second best-selling book of the 19th Century (next to the Bible) and this is the book given the credit for turning the tide of public opinion against slavery in the United States. In fact, it could be argued that this book set in motion the events that eventually led to our Civil War - still the bloodiest conflict in U.S. History (including WW2). Those facts alone make this an important book to read and it should be a part of any serious library.In order to fully appreciate this book, you must try to view it from the standpoint of the average American in 1850. It is hard to believe today but back then, slavery was still an acceptable way of life for many. Even many of those who were morally opposed to the concept of slavery adopted a \\"live and let live\\" approach to the matter. This is because many viewed the black race as inferior and they did not understand that they were people just like us who were devastated by the evil institution. Imagine having your children and spouse ripped away from you and sold to others like they were heads of cattle. This was a fact of life for most slaves. This is a very powerful book that humanized the black race and exposed the evils of slavery to those in the North who otherwise turned a blind eye towards it.Critics of this book say that it is more about Christianity than it is about slavery. I did not get this impression. Granted, the heros of this book were pious Christians without exception, but viewed through the prism of the times in which the book was written, it is understandable. Religion was far more prevalent in those times than it is today and it was just assumed that good people had to be Christians (just as it was assumed that blacks were an inferior race).There is not much to say about this book that hasn't been said already. But I would like to mention about the main character in the book: Uncle Tom. In today's vernacular, the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" is a derisive term applied towards black people (by other blacks) who are perceived as being deferential and/or servile to white people. So when I read this book, I expected Tom to be this subserviant fellow who bowed down to his master and did his bidding. This was clearly not the case! Tom stood up to his evil master and refused to let him get the better of him, maintaining his dignity at all times. No matter how much his \\"owner\\" tried to break his spirit through enormous physical abuse, Tom remained strong and unbroken. On top of that, Tom frequently went against his master's wishes and helped make Christians out of his fellow slaves and even helped a couple of them escape to freedom. In the book, Tom is a credit to his race and is the strongest moral character in the book. So after reading the book, I have determined that the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" is very unappropriate as it is used today.This is truly a great book. The writing is superb, the dialogue is razor-sharp and the exposure of the evils of the slavery that once existed in America (not all that long ago)should be read by all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Without a doubt, one of the GREATEST BOOKS I have ever read, and certainly one of the most historically significant literary works of this nation! In the beginning, we find a young Negro mother, Eliza, who learns that her son is to be sold the following day. So on that cold, winter night, she takes her infant son into her arms and runs away. She runs with her child into the darkness of the South, hoping to save her son from a horrible fate. She comes to a river and knows she must cross it. But the river is only partially frozen. So with her child in her desparate clutches, she leaps from ice patch to ice patch. Meanwhile, her attempt to escape has been discovered, and the &quot;trader&quot; to whom her son is to be sold is off to re-capture her. As Eliza struggles to bring herself and her child to the opposite side of the river, with the slave trader hot on her trail, your heart is pounding and your eyes are racing through Harriet Beecher Stowe's masterful prose. You can't help but cringe with each leap Eliza takes, as her battered, bare feet stain the ice with blood. From beginning to end, Ms. Stowe puts you in the old South, and you cannot help but feel for the characters, both good and bad, honorable and flawed. A true classic that holds a mirror to the human soul.

The Penguin edition, edited by Ann Douglas, has a high rate of transcription error. So it is not suitable for serious study.I listed a selection (over 100) of the transcription errors in the Penguin edition for a presentation at the 2007 American Literature Association conference. For example, the Penguin edition on page 619 (in the 4 copies that I've examined) has the following line:\\"If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master could [it]now and then[/it] torture an apprentice to death, would it be received with equal composure?\\"In the 1852 Jewett edition (the first printing in book form), the sentence included an additional clause:\\"If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master could [it]now and then[/it] torture an apprentice to death, without a possibility of being brought to justice, would it be received with equal composure?\\"This error--the omission of \\"without a possibility of being brought to justice\\"--diminishes a key theme in Stowe's work. I encourage scholars, teachers, and students to purchase Ammons's or Sklar's editions of UTC. Among editions that I've examined, those editions have more reliable texts. I have not examined the new Bedford edition (Railton) or the new Norton edition (Gates and Robbins).If you choose to buy some other edition, perhaps your choice will encourage Penguin to publish a corrected edition.

My research on the Internet kept bringing me to a term \\"an Uncle Tom\\" which was always spoken with utter contempt and the alluded-to concept of a traitor. I was not satisfied with what I was finding and my dictionary afforded no relief.So I turned to the public library and checked out a copy of the book Uncle Tom's Cabin: or, Life among the Lowly. The library had numerous copies and I chose one with the original text and without the usual literary critic's additive and alterative remarks.Wow, what a treasure!This Tom character was not in the least what others had alluded to. I can only assume that those who spoke derisively about dear Tom had not actually read the book themselves but merely seen or heard some altered rendition of it which was misunderstood by the listener or the teller or both.I found Harriet Beecher Stowe to be an excellent author, carefully weaving her sentiments and historical matters into the various characters of her adventurous novel. As was probably the only way a woman could be heard broadly in the mid 1800s, she spoke passionately through her characters. I'm not surprised that her novel was a hit in its day, exposing to daylight the evils and regrets of a system that was entirely accepted and protected by law, along with the poignant moments of love and caring that existed amongst those same evils.The way Mrs. Stowe writes, it is easy to see and understand all the many aspects of that portion of American history devoted to the ownership of other humans as chattel. Also a delight was reading all the varied viewpoints that people held (pro and con) of such a system and even the enormous magnitude of what it would take to overcome that stubborn system. What foresight!If you've never read this book and would like a good read (keep the tissues handy because you'll need them), I highly recommend you read this book.What a delightful story it is!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Being a suburban, male, upper-middle class WASP, educated in Kansas City's public school system I had never completely understood the conditions that surrounded legalized slavery in the middle 1800's. I had watched Gone with the Wind as a kid and that was my image of plantation life and slavery. Uncle Tom's Cabin gives the reader the whole story and Stowe does an excellent job of presenting arguments from all sides of the issue (brutal slave drivers, gentleman farmers, abolitionists, slaves accepting their lot in life, slaves longing to be free). I was so moved. Only Grapes of Wrath and To Kill a Mockingbird have had that same impact on me in the past. I would give this book 6 stars if that were an option. The U.S. History books always made reference to Uncle Tom's Cabin for its historical importance. It did open the eyes of so many who didn't realize what was happening in their country. Public education should go further though by making this required reading. It is so much more than a mere footnote. It is a slow-starter, it took me about 10 days to get through the first 100 pages adjusting to Stowe's mastery with dialects, but the last 350 pages moved 3 times as fast. Wow! The power of reading. It's amazing."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book is truly a FORGOTTEN CLASSIC! Harriet Beecher Stowe's mission in this book is to show that the black slaves are truly human, and consequently deserving of the freedom and equality that whites enjoy. She certainly does this! But it's her unique method that transforms this potential mid-1800s timepiece into a timeless classic! Stowe demonstrates what it means to love ALL people in 2 very powerful, moving, and complementary ways. One, she paints a picture of a black person who is able to unconditionally love his white enemies along with the blacks who suffer with him. And two, she illustrates how a few white people truly love and recognize the humanity of black people - society's powerless ones. The bottom line - she shows what it means to be a RADICAL follower of Jesus!Uncle Tom is a pre-civil war black slave, routinely trodden on due to his non-human status. Even with the luxuries he is given, he is continually reminded that his status before the law is only property-he has no rights, no freedom. Yet he always manages to unconditionally love his owners: the Shelbys, the St. Claires, and finally even Simon Legree. And in the course being sold and purchased, he changes the lives of many people around him. One moving example of Tom's love is toward Cassie. Once a beautiful and sophisticated woman, she is mercilessly abused as a slave and stripped of all her dignity. Through Tom's witness and sacrifice, her deep bitterness and hatred are melted away so she can love and be loved again.On the other side, some of the whites did understand that the enslaved blacks are worthy of love, dignity, and freedom. Emily Shelby, Augustine St. Claire, and Eva all show love to Tom by providing him education and limited freedom. The Quakers demonstrate love to Emily and George Harris while putting themselves in danger. And Ophelia learns how to love Topsy, a personal growth experience for both of them. All of these stories are different and intriguing, yet all show weaknesses in the white people who are in some way products of the slavery system they live in. Of these, the most moving example is little Eva, a child. No wonder Jesus calls us to become like children!There are a few stereotypes, and the book is somewhat long, but don't let these minor points deter you. The book will CHALLENGE you to love all people, of all cultures and colors, those who hurt or oppress you, and especially those who are oppressed, marginalized, and powerless. Indeed, that is what Jesus did! \\"Uncle Tom\\" shouldn't be a label used of a black person who willing accepts a white person's oppression, and I know I can't change the negative connotations that this label carries. But it SHOULD indicate a person who unconditionally accepts and loves all people - a TRUE saint. I know I would like to gladly accept that label.This book really deserves to be 6 stars! Read it (or listen to it); it will change your life and your sensitivity to oppression forever!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin makes you want to cry for what happened in the past.

Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe's classic novel about Uncle Tom and the evils of slavery in the United States is perhaps the greatest novel ever written.

At first I thought it was historical fiction but the author's end notes detail the true stories that were included in the work. The story was really an education for me on the history of slavery in the mid 1800's, filled with dramatic story lines and events. I laughed, I cried, and in the end came away with a better feel for the difficulty of bringing about emancipation. The author has written this book as an appeal to Americans (from North and South) to take responsibility for allowing the horrors and tragedies brought on by slavery to continue. I absolutely loved this book. I wish I would have read it years ago. It has a strong thread of christianity throughout which is maybe why I was not required to read it in my public high school literature classes 25 years ago."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"After hearing about this book for decades, finally read it on Kindle. The book is WAY more than I expected, and would suggest that it be recommened reading. It is an eye opener."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This story is the most personal account of living in the time of slavery that I have ever read, and I thought it was phenomenal. It was poignant and well written, and it really tugged at the heart strings. What I enjoyed most about the story was how it looked at the point of view of so many players during the slave owning era (Northern compassionates, Southern slave owners with and without guilt, slaves, mothers, husbands, families, etc.). Since I am not from the South, I had a little trouble with the southern dialog, but it didn't keep me from understanding the flow of the story.I am very glad that I read this book considering history classes don't really delve into the emotional and personal history of slavery in the South. School just treats this period of time as a \\"stain\\" on our history and doesn't like to confront it for what it was.When I look back at the time this book was written, it must've blown people's hair back. For those people of the 1800's to see that slaves were not merely \\"property,\\" but had the capability of having the same family values, religious beliefs, and sense of social insight as themselves must've made them think twice about the way they treated these people. No wonder why this book was one of the catalysts to spark the Civil War.If you don't look at this story from the point it was written, you'll lose something in the translation. But if you imagine someone reading this before the Civil War and imagine what they are learning about the human soul, the equality of it whether it is white or not, you'll feel enriched.I recommend that everyone read this story. It is full of so many valuable life lessons (content of character, faith, compassion, loyalty) that you shouldn't pass it up."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"In trying to get a perspective on today's racial issues, I felt it a good idea to get a fresh look at the institution of slavery in America, and so I read Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book written by Harriet Beecher Stowe that helped foment the Civil War. She was a daughter of a famous mid-19th century preacher, and she was an abolitionist who was very familiar with the personal stories of many slaves. I wanted to see slavery on a very personal level through the day-to-day lives and philosophies of the willing and unwilling participants. What were the kind masters like, the cruel masters, the various types of slaves, the bystanders, the North, the South? I wanted to see the motives and the rationales for slavery from these various perspectives and how Christianity fit into the picture.I thought that the book delivered. It had a flowing, elegant style. The characters were well-drawn and seemed real, the stories were intricate and believable, and the plots fascinating, especially regarding the attempted escapes. It was a painful to read, at times, when you saw the slaves up close, their plight, their dreams, their families broken-up, as well as the astounding depravity of some of the owners. Some of characters were noble in the face of extreme suffering, such as Uncle Tom, and some were cruel beyond measure, like Simon Legree, the slave owner. Others tolerated slavery and rationalized it as a service to a race not prepared to take care of itself (because of what slavery made them into). All aspects of slavery and slave-owning were addressed and rationales explored in fascinating stories that were composites of corresponding real-life dramas. It was clear that all but the most wretched of owners had a troubled conscience about the state of affairs, and well they should. It was also clear that slavery was so settled-in and ingrained that the culture was taken for granted by most people. From the perspective of our time, it seems unbelievable that it ever took root.Christianity, of course, was also a major theme in the book. The verses of Scripture are directly and indirectly woven into the fabric of the book throughout, in direct quotes, partial quotes, and paraphrases. Also, the power of Scripture is shown in the noble witness of Uncle Tom who was after the character of Christ, one \\"of whom the world was not worthy\\" according to the Book of Hebrews. He was painted as a patient and loving \\"suffering servant\\" whose testimony was love and the spread of the Gospel even towards his enemies in the midst of his misery. Scriptures are also referred to in defense of slavery, but the case was not strong at all. How could God be in favor of slavery when much of the Old Treatment is about freeing His people from physical bondage in Egypt and much of the New Testament is about freeing God's people from their sin? A rhetorical question for sure!Uncle Tom's Cabin was haunting to say the least, and should be convicting for our present society in general that it took a book like this and the subsequent Civil War to end slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is an outstanding book of penetrating insight into the evils of the \\"peculiar institution\\" of slavery.

Written as a response to the fugitive slave law, the book brought the institution of slavery into the parlors of the Northern reading public. The book is critical not only of the Southern institution of slavery but also, surprisingly, of Northern racism.

Please read it for YOUR sake."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Many times, one can find themselves not reading a book because they have heard so much about it over the years that they feel like they have already read it. That was the case with me and Uncle Tom's Cabin. I had never read it but felt like I had from everything I had heard. In my History of the English Language class, I had a chance to really read it. Did I learn a lot!Much of what I had heard over the years about the Harriet Beecher Stowe's book was close to accurate, but the picture in my mind that had not read it conjured up something way different. I finally got to read the work itself and found myself glued to the book until I was done.This is not a book that shows only the horror of slavery. Yes, there is much that is horrific in these pages. The treatment that many slaves met with is beyond anything a human being should ever encounter. Ms. Stowe describes the beatings, starvations, and cruel deaths while not getting into the worst of descriptions. She alludes to them while not getting too graphic. But the author does more than recount horrendous treatment of slaves. She looks into the heart of the slaves, the owners, and those around them.I think this is what impressed me the most. Not all slaves had a good heart. Some of them were greedy and as mean as their owners. They would rat out each other in an attempt to look good to a master. Others just tried to keep their heads down and make it alive to another day.The slaves were very interesting in their varied personalities. Uncle Tom is, of course, a main character whose heart is so pure that anything and anyone held up against him seems dirty and dingy. Despite being sold from his family and good master, he keeps up hope and his faith in God. Even death facing him does not have him giving up hope.The lives of the other main slave characters show the struggle within them for freedom and the ability to feel like a true man. A woman is willing to give up everything she has as a slave which is a very good life for her to keep her child by her side. Even being treated kindly is not enough to make a person feel like....a person. It takes the love of their family and the sense of independence.I couldn't help being drawn to the each of the slaves who sought their freedom through escape or through just simple faith. I kept putting myself into their shoes and wondered if I could have the strength to do what they did and survive. I honestly couldn't answer that. It's a situation that few in America find themselves in today.Another aspect that really stuck out was the various white people in the book. There were the kind slave owners who knew that the slaves they owned were their property but were treated as part of the family. They were up against an institution that they alone could not fight. Instead, they loved their slaves and gave them more than many slaves ever had. Yet, it was not enough when death entered the scene before the slave owner could free them. They typically found themselves facing much of the hell that many slaves lived in.The torture found in those that used slaves yet found the act repulsive was something I had not expected to find. There were many who tried in their hearts to reconcile the act and the accepted practices to what they felt in their souls.Looking at the act of slavery from today's eyes seems so easy. We have a view of it being wrong, period. Yet, when one reads this book that helped bring the topic of slavery to the forefront of America, you can't help but see how it was not so easy during this time. Slavery was something that was accepted as part of life by the white man and the black for so long that the voices that stood out against it were getting lost in the wind. It took life changes events and the perfect opportunity for many to see the error of the institution and the logical way out. Just freeing the slaves could have been more harmful than preparing them for a life of freedom. It was a situation that really had no perfect ending.If you think you know what Uncle Tom's Cabin is really about but have never read it. I highly suggest that you pick up the book and read it for yourself. Never make assumptions or take anyone else's view as the gospel. I did read the free Kindle version which has many formatting problems, but the text is accurate.This is one book that I think you should read. It will give you a new perspective of slave-holding America and give you a little more depth into the lives that were affected by it. Let Harriet Beecher Stowe take you into a world you only thought you knew.Note: I purchased this book on my own for a class."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" for the first time a few months ago and was amazed at its powerful message. I had learned about the book in school as a kid, but only as the short answer to a simple question such as, \\"What book written by Harriet Beecher Stowe had a dramatic impact on the public regarding slaver?\\", or maybe, \\"Who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin?\\" Too bad I wasn't encouraged to READ the book and understand why it was so influential in the the time leading up to the Civil War!The reasons the book is not read directly are plain. Some of them are: frequent use of the N-word, very heavy evangelical Christian message(as a reason that slavery is evil), and a few generalizations about the black race that would not be politically correct today (as if generalizations and anyone who makes them are evil and dangerous to society! rather than simply what they are: one person's generalized view of a group.)Harriet Beecher Stowe was like a fearless biblical prophet, using plausible (and no doubt frequently actual) storylines to expose the dreadful evil that slavery was, regardless of the relative morality or immorality of the slave holder. Unexpected and uncontrollable events like death or debt could remove slaves from a good and kind master to a harsh and cruel one. This trading of slaves due to the death or debt of their masters would inevitably separate husbands and wives, parents and children forever. Stowe shows the effect that these events could have on these HUMAN BEINGS. She appeals to the white mother's affection for her children or husband, showing that slavery often breaks these bonds between families.But Stowe doesn't stop there, but also exposes the hypocrisy of northern abolitionists, who railed about the evil of slavery, but would not begin to agree to take those dirty black slaves into their communities, to live and work among them and their children, or to be patient with the dehumanizing effects that slavery had produced in the blacks.In the end she pleads with both north and south to see these people as human beings with no less feeling or value than their own white children. She uses Christianity, which all of these slaveholders and abolitionists professed, to convince them that if Christ died for these people, how can we possibly place so little value on them? If Jesus would take them into His arms and receive them to heaven forever, how could those who love Jesus abuse and oppress them, separating mother and baby, husband and wife?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Reading about the horrible experiences of the slaves in this book makes my heart beat fast.

Of course, everyone knew it was a publishing phenomenon with, arguably, an enormous historical and cultural impact. But the smart or fashionable assumption was that it was an artless piece of melodramatic propaganda with only historic importance. Eventually, moved by Edmund Wilson's Patriotic Gore and the Library of America copy sitting unopened on my shelf, I was moved to give it a try and amazed to find that it is a fascinating novel that far exceeded my (admittedly) low expectations and was well worth the time and effort.First, it should be understood that it is not a perfect or even great work of art. It is melodramatic; it certainly has an \\"agenda,\\" though I'm not sure it is propaganda; it is often long-winded and Stowe delivers a few too many sermons (Christianity is doled out rather heavy-handedly here), rather than allowing the actions to speak for themselves; it is hard for a modern reader to believe some of the characters, at least some of the time (like Tom's incredible Christian forgiveness in the face of Legree's evil); it is somewhat awkwardly shaped and the two main story lines diverge for so long that one is almost forgotten, only to reconnect and culminate in a virtual miracle of coincidence; Ms. Stowe indulges in some well-intentioned but curious (and non-PC) racial stereotypes, and so on. That being said, however, UTC is an entertaining book, written with a remarkable amount of verve, that reveals much about its time, develops some memorable and believable characters, provides some pretty believable dialect, and, most surprisingly, through its characters expresses a number of varied, intelligent and well developed theories or even justifications for slavery that prevent it from being an out and out diatribe against the south and slaveowners.UTC has been widely reviewed here and elsewhere, so I will only comment upon this latter characteristic--the various viewpoints about slavery. Make no mistake, we are NEVER uncertain where Ms. Stowe stands: Slavery is an evil institution. But it is the institution, not the people involved who are really at fault, north and south. For example, the book begins when the Shelbys are forced, through dire financial straights and the total lack of business sense of Mr. Shelby, to sell two slaves. The Shelbys are not evil. They are in fact benign masters. However, they appear to have no choice in the matter and are almost appalled at what they must do. Through this circumstance, Ms. Stowe emphasizes that it is the system itself that is evil because it can compel even the good and thoughtful to sell off their chattel, separate families, and possibly condemn even their most valued servants to a living hell. Similarly, Tom's subsequent master, St. Clare, is intelligent, thoughtful, kind to his slaves and highly critical of the institution itself, albeit unable to see what one slaveowner can do to work societal change. Again, however, when he dies, the same points are made: his frivolous, spoiled and hateful wife (the St Clares are quite excellently drawn and two of the best characters in the book) sells everyone off and Tom falls to the loathsome Simon Legree, the most odious slaveowner imaginable, who is, in fact, a northerner. Through the Shelbys and St. Clares and Legree, Stowe does a remarkable job of developing and contrasting various attitudes to slaves and slavery, and this alone makes the book worthwhile.All in all, UTC is enormously better than one might expect--which is not intended to damn with faint praise. If you have any interest in America of the mid 1850s, the institution of slavery. the Civil War, or even what constituted an enormously popular novel at the time (albeit more inspired than artful), I would highly recommend UTC.The LoA volume is typically well done and contains two of Ms. Stowe's other novels should you be captivated by this one."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I don't think I have ever \\"felt\\" so much during a reading of a book!!

It deals with the tragedy and emotion of slavery in America in the 1800's. This book is famous throughout the world, dealing with political, emotional, moral, and spiritual opinions on conflicts throughout Earth's history.It begins with a slave named Uncle Tom, who is under the rule of a kind and gracious master who treats him very well. Due to his master's debt, Tom must be sold down-river to a heartless trader named Haley. Also sold is Harry, the only son of a woman on Tom's plantation named Eliza. She takes her son and runs north to keep the slave traders from taking her child from her. Tom is a very loyal and righteous man who trusts that his master will buy him back as soon as he can raise the money, even as he is being sold down-river. Tom finds himself under the care of St. Clare, a secular, yet moral man. St. Clare has a young daughter named Eva, with whom Tom builds a strong friendship. However, Eva is constantly weakening, due to an unknown disease, and slowly succumbs until death claims her precious, loving heart. Tom is again sold down-river to a stricter master who puts him in charge as overseer. When Tom is ordered to discipline another slave through whipping, Tom refuses and is whipped to death by his unmerciful master.This book is exceptionally written, dealing realistically with a cruel system of one group of humans enslaving and demoralizing another group. This book deserves its standing as a classic, having been instrumental in ending slavery itself. This book so deeply analyzes aspects of slavery that I loved every minute of its intellectually-challenging text. This is a great read for anyone wishing to know more about history, while at the same time challenging the mind and watching a breathtaking story come to life."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a powerful antislavery novel written in the late 1800's. The novel helps the reader understand what it was like being a typical slave in the pre-Civil War south. Slaves were treated like they were less than human; had cruel \\"masters;\\" and were often beaten and whipped, sometimes to death, for the slightest mistake. They had absolutely no rights, and many slaves wished that they were dead, rather than be the \\"property\\" of a cruel monster who called himself better than them. It also conveys how unconstitutional the slave system was, since the Constitution clearly states that \\"All men are created equal.\\" Family members were often split up and never saw each other again. The main character in Uncle Tom's Cabin, a slave named Tom, is separated from his family and friends but he is able to somehow maintain his religious faith even after witnessing and experiencing the brutalities of slavery. The novel had a huge impact on many people's lives when it was first published, and it stills does today. I believe the book is well-written and has great character descriptions. It is very thought-provoking and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had always heard of the controversy surrounding this book. I really could not imagine that it would also be a good story. I picked up the book to satisfy my curiosity - Could it really have been that controversial to have a remark from Abe Lincoln about Harriet Beecher Stowe starting the civil war?Yes you will see why this was the case. I am amazed that this book was written at the time that it was. I can not get over that. The book is easy to understand - Has excellent plot, characters - and kept me thinking about it long after I had finished reading it.You feel Harriet Beecher Stowe's strong feelings on slavery. She used her talent for story telling - to share this important message.One of My Favorite Books! Would actually reread it - and I have never read the same book over again :)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"While Harriet Beecher Stowe set out to tell a tale of the evils of slavery, we find in the modern world, her story remains as compelling as it was 150 years ago. Through rich characterizations (Tom, St. Clare, Eva, Topsy, Ophelia, Cassy, Legree, etc), we discover a book about people. Beecher Stowe examines slavery by making it very much a human issue, not only through the main characters, but also the stories told by those who pop up for a page or two. At times, the book is formulaic. You can bet each time, for example, that a mother and child face being sold, they will be separated, despite pleas to stay together. And another way this book may seem out-of-place today, is the accidentally patronizing view the author may present of Africans. \\"The Negro is inherently\\" she'll say from time to time; a flaw that is difficult to forgive for a book that otherwise does such a moving and successful job of creating real people for the reader to know. These flaws aside, the book is compelling in its case by showing how despite the best wishes of people (two of Tom's three owners are good people who want him to be be freed), slavery was inherently evil, and that free states were duplicitous for allowing laws to permit slavery and to prosecute those helping slaves seeking freedom. And while the phrase \\"Uncle Tom\\" has taken on a different meaning, a stereotypical \\"yes man,\\" don't overlook the strength in the actual character, or the strength and richness of Eliza and George Harris, surely two of the most non-stereotypical African-Americans to ever grace the pages of literature."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I am quite convinced that I can write nothing about this book which has not already been written. However, I would like to leave subsequent readers with a couple of impressions which may be valuable. First, if you read most books cover to cover as I do, I urge that you make an exception here. If you have never read this book before, the introduction by Ann Douglas is a bit too revealing and can spoil the story for a first time reader. In my strong opinion the introduction, in striving to be poignant and intellectual, underplays a monumentally important and simple message of the book: true strength and dignity are found in self-sacrificial love. Reading the introduction after reading the book (or skipping it altogether) would be a more profitable use of time. Second, it is a sad commentary indeed that the term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; has become a derogatory one, according to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: &quot;a black who is overeager to win the approval of whites&quot; or someone who is &quot;overly subservient&quot;. To accept this usage in our own daily parlance is to deny another central and not at all subtle message of Uncle Tom's Cabin: Tom is subservient above all else to God, through his faith in Christ. His faith and relationship with God guide his life, not his earthly masters. To the extent that he cannot exhibit God's love by doing the bidding of his master, he kindly but firmly refuses to cooperate. I see in this sort of Uncle Tom a man of integrity, strength, courage, love, and tenderness. If this is what it truly means to be an Uncle Tom, &quot;to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God&quot; (Micah 6:8, the Bible), then I would humbly and gratefully accept the label."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is a book that I have read numerous times and with each reading come away with something new. It is written in a plain style, the story is very easy to follow, and the message Stowe wants to relate is very simplistic, but the novel is such an emotional and powerful portrayal of antebellum life that it is a must read. I would not necessarily rate Stowe as one of the great writers in American literature, but she certainly is one of the best at developing characters and emotional scenes, which more than makes up for any of her shortcomings. If you have not read this book before or may have once years ago, it is certainly worth reading again."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"....about her being the woman who started the Civil War; she did not, of course, but her vivid storytelling and character portrayals, whatever the controversies in her handling of the pain of people she did not know, began to get the country imagining at least some of the horrors of slavery. She cracked the complacency of a people who preferred to go about their business in ignorance of the price paid for their comfort and luxury; and yet, to quote her own view of what she'd written, &quot;Nothing of tragedy can be written, can be spoken, can be conceived, that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly acting on our shores, beneath the shadow of American law, and the shadow of the cross of Christ.&quot;"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I'm a bit late in reading this classic as my high school and college English classes were probably too afraid to have us read it. I think reading it now, in my twenties, that I have a better understanding of the content. I am aware of all the criticisms for this book, but I think that the essence of its story is all too true. I think the aspect of the story that deals with interactions and treatment is probably true. After reading this book it's apparent why, at least in America, we have such social strife today. I believe how we treat each other is handed down from generation to generation, and if we treat certain people a certain way then they begin to have no choice but to behave in a certain way. This book is a strong, but sad testament to this theory. I would definitely recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read this book with a group of other eigth graders at my school this spring. At first I was very skeptical because I thought that it would just be another boring history book. It turned out to be one of the best books I have read.

I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading and likes to read GREAT historical fiction books, of a unique variety."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I think this book was the best book I ever read!

The term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; that has been bandied about as long as I can remember, is only now,(after reading the book) a reflection of the ignorance of those so cavalierly throwing about such terms.

I enjoyed it so much and feel so strongly that people of all races should read it that I plan to donate an audio cassett to my library. So many of the characters' names are a part of our vocabulary, but, too often, with a distorted meaning.

After reading it myself, though, I am amazed at the power and passion Beecher-Stowe was able to embue her characters with.She loves each one of them, from saintly old Uncle Tom, to the sordid and disgusting Legree.And rather than a shuffling &quot;Yassa Massa&quot; stereotypical slave, Tom is one of the most pure-hearted, righteous characters ever written. His strength is in always doing the right thing.This one is a masterpiece and a must-read!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have heard of this book growing up though I never took the liberty of reading it upon myself until recently. I'm very glad that I have. I can't say that I have read a book quite like this, and I read a lot. I personally am one to search for good in the world in all that I do, as I feel without good there is nothing. This book is good. It describes the feelings and opinions of the people during the times of slavery, both Northern and Southern white, and the slaves themselves. The characters are great, from the christlike Evangeline to the devil sold soul Legree. And the messages of the book are so simple, as the messages of the Bible itself. If you are one with a good heart and an open mind, this will touch your heart and influence your life as it has mine."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Having just completed this book, I am astounded--both by its(underserved) racist reputation and its sheer force. No doubt, Stowe was unable to write free of the influence of her own racism. But, this book deserves to be read--especially now, at this time of year, when Christians celebrate Easter and Jews Passover. Personally, it has given me an idea, in as much as a white woman living in 1999 may have, of the pure montstrosity of slavery. As a Jew, I am gratful to have finished this book in time for my Passover Seder. I do not think I will ever think of the Exodus story in the same way again. I think the entire country should be reading and discusing this amazing book. I'll be talking about it at my Seder. I would welcome e-mail from other readers. Maybe we can start a campaign to have Oprah choose the book as one of her book club selections."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This novel portrays the unjust and cruel accounts of slavery through the lives of some very unique characters. The reader goes through some vauable life experiences with each one of the characters to see how slavery affects them personally. By doing this,Stowe, makes the reader aware of the effects that slavery can have ona human race dealing with the themes of family seperation,motherhood, religion and social cruelty. This easy-read novel provides a valuable learning experience for the reader on the instituion of slavery. I would recommend it to students from ninth grade up to adults who are willing to become educated in a vivid way on this topic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I loved this book! I'd been hearing how good this book was from my mom and then I had to read it for a class and I was so glad. The character of Uncle Tom is so godly and truly an inspiration.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I loved this book as soon as I got into the novel I couldn't stop reading it. It teaches you about what beasts this country did to the blacks in the 1800's and before still to this day what they must face the racism and I think they have come long way I love how she writes so eloquently and descriptive! BRAVO"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Praise Harriet Beecher Stowe! I can't say enough about Uncle Tom's Cabin. At times, it is difficult to continue reading due to the long winded conversations. But if you force your way through these parts of the novel, it will be one of the best novels you have ever read. I am purchasing the book so that I can read it again and as often as I please. I would recommend it to anyone. The plot is genius."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written in an empathetic tone, forcing the American public to view black slaves as human beings, at least for reading the novel. A Southern slave owner who read the book would be compelled to slip into the lives of his slaves, perhaps unwillingly, and view the institution of slavery from the viewpoint of a slave. In this respect, Stowe was successful. She appealed to the maternal emotions of her readers and characterized the blacks with qualities that were similar to those of innocent children. Black characters were also portrayed as being overwhelming loyal, clever and pious. For the most part, many of the white women in the novel act as a moral authority, compensating for the &quot;sins&quot; of their husbands, fathers, and brothers. Both sets of characters were exaggerated which helped to arouse the emotions of the novels readers. Characters were either exceedingly virtuous or awfully depraved. Paragons of Christian values can be found in Uncle Tom and the angel-like Little Eva. While the moral opposite of these characters can be found in the less agreeable characters of Simon Legree and Mr. Haley. These characterizations made for a powerful argument against slavery as Stowe had created a tone of victimization. The novels tone was important because at the time many people did consider slaves to be an inferior race, most readers had never before realized that these plantation hands were actually victims of a primarily white society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read this book originally to understand what was meant by the statement: &quot;He's an Uncle Tom.&quot; This was usually said as a derogatoy statement. After reading the book I don't think this statement has been used correctly. As a Christian who loves the Lord I have to rate it as one of the best books that every Christian should read. I guess the derogatory statement comes from what looks like a black man being in willing submission to his master. From a Christian's point of view it is actually a man of God being in submission to His God.As it was originally written to expose the life of slavery the book obviously does that very well. I heard that Abraham Lincoln said to Harriett Beecher Stowe upon meeting her, &quot;So, you're the women responsible for starting the Civil War.&quot; Her account of slavery is vividally brutal.With these two aspects in mind I can say that this book has a tremendous affect on my thinking. The horrors of slavery along w/the reality of God working in the lives of both 'slave &amp; free' are what remain in my thoughts. After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin I'm reminded that we Christians are to have the heart of a servant following Jesus' example."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is one book that I just never got around to reading during my younger years. This is an incredibly good Christian novel, which it is never described by anyone as. But that is what it is; a novel lessons in what it is to be a strong Christian. It is ironic the the term, \\"Uncle Tom\\" has been fixed in our American stereotype as an African American that is a traitor to their own culture. But the term is anything but that, Tom was a man that had strong Christian values. If anything, it should be considered a complement to be called an \\"Uncle Tom\\", there just is no other conclusion to come to after reading this book. And I am African American. Harriet Beecher Stowe did an excellent job of writing this novel, it has multiple plots; each having their own consistent Christian values described. Once you start reading this novel it is hard to put it down. Some times the dialect used is a little difficult to understand the meaning ...so I also purchased the children's version to read as a reference (both where free Kindle versions). This is a book that every person should read, it helped to start the Civil War and was translated in a number of different languages and read across the globe. It is a very, very good book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"It is one of the most interesting books that I've ever read.

It's a shame that this book isn't as popular any more. If it was, people would understand how things were during that time period. Some people doesn't realize how cruel slavery is and think it as no big deal. Those people would definitly feel differant after they read Uncle Tom's cabin. Plus, it's a wonderful book about Eliza, a slave that was treated well by her master had to run away with her little boy named Harry because her master was about to sell Harry and Uncle Tom to a mean slavetrader that had no respect. Uncle Tom on the other hand, had no choice but to be sold to the slavetrader. Then he was sold to Mr. St. Clare on a ship to somewheres. If it hadn't been for Mr. St. Clare's daughter Eva, Uncle Tom would of never been sold to such a nice family since Mr. St. Clare treats his slaves really well and let them where his clothes.

But I must admit, the style of writing was... well... let's say less than professional. I guess the style of writing back then was much different than today, but there was too much &quot;He said. She said.&quot; or &quot;Tom said. St. Claire said.&quot; There is no need to put &quot;[whatever] said.&quot; after each sentence of dialog.I think what I liked the most about this book is that it is TRUE and ACCURATE. It is noted that the characters are based on real people, the attitudes and way of speech are based on the reality of the time... since it was written by a person during that period of time, the accuracy cannot be matched.

Ms. Stowe tries to tell about slavery in the South from tails she has heard. The book was written nine years before the War Between the States and sold 300,000 copies the first year. The book hurt the South and caused people from the North and Mid-west to believe every word she wrote eventhough Ms. Stowe had never been to the South. Even President Lincoln when meeting her said,&quot; So you're the little lady who started this war&quot;.All of Uncle Tom's Masters treated him better than most of the slaves were treated with the exception of one Master. The book takes you from one Master to another with you wondering what will happen next. The book is chocked full of colorful and interesting characters. It's a book that will make you laugh and also make you cry.I think this is a book everyone should read and it will make you ask yourself what's wrong with being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I realized recently that I needed to read this book. I was woefully ignorant of its role in the U.S. anti-slavery movement until I attended a talk last summer by filmmaker James LaVeck, who recounted the tremendous influence this book had when it was published. Hundreds of thousands of readers in 1852 got the clear message that better conditions for slaves would not suffice--rather, that slavery itself was inherently wrong.Cruelty and family separation and compassion and sacrifice...Uncle Tom's Cabin is a tear-jerker, even though I'm not Christian. Or perhaps *because* I'm not. (There's a lot of talk by the protagonists of the comfort of the promise of heaven...)I see now how unfair it is that \\"Uncle Tom\\" came to be an accusation of subservience. To the contrary, Stowe's hero, Uncle Tom, refused his cruel master's orders to harm other slaves.I wish I'd been assigned to read this book when I was in school, and taught about its role in history! Can parallels be drawn between the idea, back then, of \\"Christian slavery,\\" and the idea, today, of \\"happy meat\\"?At the time when Beecher Stowe was writing Uncle Tom's Cabin, people calling for slavery's abolition were few in number, and were considered radicals. Extremists. Today, people who boycott meat and animal products are viewed similarly. But I take heart from the fact that attitudes change...and now, our society looks back upon the institution of human slavery with horror. Future generations may look back at our institution of raising animals for food in a similar way."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Reading this book opened my eyes and heart.

It also gave me a glance of the way the Underground Railroad worked. It was truly amazing. Don't wait until you reach my age to read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I was a history major, an avid reader of American fiction and yet I turned fifty without ever reading \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" Since I'm now engaged in a review of American literature, I thought it was time to right this wrong.This is not a literary review. If I were to look at this book from a writerly perspective, I would find much that is wanting. The narration is wobbly and strangely third and occasionally first person, the sentence often poorly crafted, the tone changeable - overheated one moment and listless another. Yet or maybe because of these writerly problems, the novel comes across as a historic document, the story of a white northern woman who ached to convey the horror that the American white nation had denied, ignored or excused. And here the novel succeeds masterfully, making the reader feel the suffering of families torn apart, lifelong relationships shattered and a people degraded, humiliated and disregarded.These aren't great, deep literary characters but they convey an often subtle understanding of how slavery was so damaging to everyone it touched and that was all of America at that time. There is Mr. Shelby a kindly slave-owner forced to sell his long-time slave and butler, a man he grew up with and in the sales transaction with slave trader Haley, you see that the way slavery turned humanity into cold, calculating profiteering. We get a portrait of northern arrogance and racism with Miss Ophelia. She overcomes it but we understand that while many in the North abhorred the institution of slavery, they didn't necessarily want to come in contact with black folk. George, Eliza's husband who escapes before she does, articulates a black pride and a courageous sense that his life as a slave isn't worth the risk of dying escaping to freedom.But the character who occupies the heart and soul of the book is Tom, the Christ-like slave. He is a noble, dignified, spiritual figure who does accomodate his white masters but only up to a point. Tom refuses to obey Simon Legree's call for him to whip fellow slaves. He loses his life in that refusal and yet that character's inheritance is one of spineless accomodation. Blace men who don't stand up to whites are characterized as Uncle Toms and yet he lost his life standing up to a white man. Was that revolutionary message too much for people to bear?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The book is in great condition, but it's not the same edition as the one in the picture.

But I learned and enjoyed this book like it was my first time reading it. It has been something like 15 years since my first read through, I read deeper into the story know a days.Uncle Toms Cabin is a very well written book, and a must read. You can not go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"To really understand history and what the blacks went thru, this is a must read, esp. in the schools."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had never read this book as I always assumed it was just too \\"classic\\" to appeal to me, I have applied this logic to several other classics and am now realizing I am completely wrong.Several of the reviewers have listed the Christian views put forth within this book by Mrs. Stowe and the fact that she does get a tad preachy at times. They also mentioned the character generation and the depth she created. I'd like to delve into a different aspect of the book though.Why is this book continually on the \\"banned\\" book lists? Written 5 years before the Civil War, Mrs. Stowe puts to paper the life and treatment of slaves during that time. In the biography of the book she states that while the character names are fictitious, the situations and events are real as witnessed by her, her husband and others of that time. Uncle Tom is an amalgamation of several slaves she had known. So why is this book \\"banned\\"? The only reason I can think of is the abundant use of a now socially unacceptable word, in news media it is only referred to as \\"the N word\\". If that is the sole reason for banning this book then, I put forth that whomever is \\"banning\\" this book has not actually read this book with any attempt at looking beyond the words. The spiritual message is obvious, as is the notion of hope carrying one through life. But, should the reader look just a bit deeper one will find the contrast of human nature, black and white.Uncle Tom carries himself through each owner as a proud family man. His thoughts are never far from his wife and family he was forced to leave behind at the beginning of the book. His treatment of others, regardless of age, race, color or social standing is a testament to the goodness in his heart. Throughout the book it is the black slave that is portrayed as the more humane than the white owner. The black slave that identifies the truth behind the egocentric behavior of his master. The black slave who perseveres when all others would give up hope. Even during his time with Simon Legree (who is without a doubt the template for evil characterization), Uncle Tom is able to hold to his beliefs, defy Simon, instill hope and humanity in his fellow slaves and assist in the escape of two slaves. Uncle Tom is so solid in his belief it even effects Simon Legree and the reader is left to decide if it was enough to soften his position, even if just a little.In contrast, it is the white owner that believes the slave cannot attain any higher place in life than what they are so graciously supplying. The white owner who believes that educating the slave is pointless as they would not know what to do with the knowledge or that they would just parrot back the information to please their masters. The white owner who believes the means of the economy and standard of living justifies the end result of slavery. Throughout much of the book Uncle Tom is treated fairly well but the white owners cannot see past their own socially accepted idea that the black race is meant to be owned and they are doing them a favor. The horrors of a slaves life is only lightly touched on until Uncle Tom is sold to Simon Legree. From this point, Mrs. Stowe hold nothing back in description of Legree's opinion and treatment of the slave. His true belief the slave is no more than an animal destined to perform manual labor for his master. And in the case of female slaves, of course Legree believes the more attractive females are for his personal pleasure as well.Uncle Tom's Cabin should be read by everyone as a great piece of literature, a source of inspiration, and an example of what humanity was and what it should be. The reader must flick the switch to turn on his/her brain and capacity for thought before reading this book, if that is done then the reader will find an enjoyable first rate story to read and share with others."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book took WAY longer to finish than it should have simply because the first half was terrible reading. Mrs. Stowe held to the conventions of 19th century popular reading by making everything overly melodramatic (half the time I was asking myself what all the crying was about) and making dialogue incomprehensible by trying to imitate southern accents in her writing, which flopped horribly. Not to mention that some passages and characterizations regarding slaves were so offensive that I honestly thought about not finishing this book. But around page 200 or so, things began to change. I started to pierce through the dialogue and characters started to become interesting and tragic. Truly, the fulcrum by which this book turned from bad to good was in the tragedy of the little girl Eva, who dies at such a young age, but is so Christ-like in those pages that I challenge anyone not to get even a little misty-eyed once she passes on. After that, things began to pick up, characters, like Uncle Tom, began to take on a nobility of character that made the uphill climb through the first pages worth the effort. This certainly won't be a favorite book of mine anytime soon, but I now see how this book had such a huge impact on the thoughts and deeds of the Northern U.S. prior to the Civil War. In short, get past drudgery of the first 200 pages and you will find a gem of a book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was not a good read for me.

This can be overcome while reading with the use of highlights."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"In her abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe appeals to the humanity and faith of her audience in order to communicate the appalling nature of a slavery-reliant nation and advise opposition to such a system. She frequently departs from describing her characters' plights to comment directly to the reader on her intended moral message of the particular passage. Over the years Uncle Tom's Cabin has remained an extremely popular and controversial work due in no small part to Stowe's unique writing style, although the readers she addresses in her heartstring-pulling asides have changed.The primary message of Uncle Tom's Cabin is a heavy-handed suggestion that the enslavement of another race goes against Christian ideals, constituting a vehement reprimand of the entire system of slavery. This system included not only the plantation owners of the deep South and the domestic slave-owners of the more northern slave states, but also the whole of the nation supporting the slave trade. She appeals to everyone from political proponents of the new Fugitive Slave Act to northerners claiming abolitionist sentiments who failed to actively oppose the institution subjugating their fellow Americans. Her rebuke is reiterated throughout the text, varying in tone and candor. Secondary moral pronouncements appear with lesser frequency in the course of the novel, augmenting Stowe's anti-slavery campaign with implications of a need for fair treatment of blacks whether slaves or not, as well as consternation for those who do not share the religious sentiments of the author. However, these supplementary assertions cannot compete for the reader's attention with the omnipresent call to end slavery, recapitulated in nearly every scene and with every character pondering the morality of slavery or bemoaning the conditions of a slave-based society. Her call to arms to combat slavery rallied thousands of her compatriots to join abolitionist societies, vote against pro-slavery measures locally, and even name their daughters after the book's young heroine of the slaves' cause. International readers were similarly enthralled by this hard-hitting personal account of the evils of slavery in any form.The author's tendency to break away from her story to lecture her audience directly constituted an explicit moral compass pointing towards a proper course of action in efforts against a terrible system of which they were supporters, whether it was through participation or inaction. She deliberately plays on the emotional weaknesses of her intended readership as if \\"it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie\\" (page 46), and in another case reminds a different segment of her audience that \\"good brother of the Southern States... we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better\\" than an Ohio senator who purportedly supports the Fugitive Slave Act but cannot help assisting a fugitive mother and her son (page 81). Her use of the second person is nonstandard for a work of fiction, and introduces a form of politically charged literature that retains a gripping narrative alongside its activist agenda. She mobilized readers who would have otherwise ignored abolitionist writings by appealing to them on a personal level, inciting a desire to take action against slavery rather than tacitly accept it as a necessary evil. Evidence of the work's persistent significance in today's society is abundant in the many thousands of high schools where it is now assigned reading and the fact that it has been translated into thirty-seven languages since its publication in 1852 (according to W.W. Norton and Company).Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel has affected its readers deeply from the time of its appearance, first contributing to the instigation of a massive change of popular opinion on slavery and as the years have passed serving as a reminder of where we have come from as a nation. Her unique style of blatantly instructing empathy and preaching morality have added to both the work's widespread impact and the controversy surrounding it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The story flows well thoughout this book.

I am enjoying it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a very good portrayal of America in its pre-Civil War Slave Days. Stowe writes her characters to be believable and covers each archetype of thought/attitude toward slavery that existed. There are those today who read her book and call is racist and prejudiced, but this controversy is unfounded. I came across a letter penned to Stowe by Charles Dickens in which he tells her his regard for the book but that she possibly \\"seeks to prove too much\\". Read IN CONTEXT, it is not racist at all, but a VERY good eye opener to general thought and sentiment during a dark part of American history....Stowe writes her characters well, in all their humanity, makes you love them, hate them, feel for them.... There will be times when the reader may laugh, and times when the reader will cry, but it is a VERY worthy book of reading time, no matter what your penchant is for reading.....This version is good.

This book is about the life of slaves in the 1800s. It was very heartbreaking and eye opening to read the hardships of the African American slaves.

It was fun to read, even though the message that it sent was heavy. I recommend it to anyone. Powerful and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"&quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is not an uplifting book to read; however, it is very interesting. The book is an historically accurate look of what conditions could have been like for the slaves during the 1850's. The characters are not embellished and the plot is somewhat believeable. The slaves are portyared as people, unlike what they could have been described as during this time period. The story also describes how the South and the North had some different ways of treating people whether they were slaves or not.The points I found not enjoyable took me out of my comfort zone and showed me a darker side of how slavery could have been. Stories of families being broken up and seeing a person beat another for little reason did not give me pleasure in reading. The book gives both sides in just about everything: good slave owner vs. bad slave owner, North vs. South, black girl vs. white girl, black family vs. white family. The whole story has a deeper, darker meaning of American history.&quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is a very good book because of its examination of America's dark secret of pain and suffering. When it was first published, this book was a wake up call for the country. By reading it at the millennium, we are helping keep the memory alive, so that slavery does not happen again in the U.S. I highly recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, and if you have the chance, study it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had heard of Uncle Tom's Cabin all my life and finally decided to read it.

I read this book after reading a discussion of UTC and Huckleberry Finn in Harper's magazine. All of us are aware of such epithets as &quot;he's such an Uncle Tom&quot;, but I am astounded now at the ignorance and prejudices that abound about this book and the legacy it left. Not only is Uncle Tom not a mindless yes-man to the whites, he actually is beaten to death because he will not beat the other slaves in his appointed position as overseer. Reading this book was an incredibly enjoyable eyeopener. Yes the language and some of the attitudes are dated, but it is only the richer for this... it lets us into the mindset of the era and in a way that is passionate and compelling. I was completely swept up in the narrative whereas I was expecting to read for my literary and historic edification.It was also news to me that this book was such a runaway bestseller of the times, selling I believe millions of copies when such a thing was unheard of. It apparently swayed millions of households, and especially women, who of course did not have the vote, in favor of abolition. So it is a sort of prefeminist achievement as well as a political coup, which led to the civil war and the end of slavery. We can look down all we like on the supposed &quot;women's hyperbola&quot; of this book, but any novelist of this day wouldnt dare dream of writing such an influential book.Next to this book, Huckleberry Finn, which I read about the same time, is merely a boyish adventure novel, incredibly racist to boot, and completely falling apart plotwise at the end.Read this, for sheer pleasure as a novel, to counteract all the misconceptions, or to delve into history. But do read it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Although a slow beginning make's Uncle Tom's Cabin seem boring, the story soon picks up when Tom's kind-hearted owner is forced to separate him from the only home he has ever know to fulfill a debt to a cruel slave driver. As you follow Tom through his travels, the horrors of slavery are revealed: Tom is seldom allowed to be out of sight of his new &quot;owner&quot; with out shackles. Stowe has written a wonderful book with real, believable characters. This is a definite must-read!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The copy I received of the Norton Critical Edition was missing pages 111-142. Instead, pages 79-110 were repeated. I contacted Amazon but they said it was too late to get my money back. My advice is to count all the pages in all books your order from Amazon, and don't buy the Norton Critical Edition of Uncle Tom's cabin. Buy the book from another publisher instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"What can I say..Uncle Tom's Cabin is the most important and influential book ever written by an American. It should be a part of every serious reader's library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, I think that i now have seen slavery in a totally different way. the hardships that Uncle Tom faced were awful, and I can see why a Civil War was started after people read this novel. I give Uncle Tom's Cabin a four, because it clearly showed the difference between the fate of someome who rebels against the system, and someone who sits back and goes through the system. It is not a five however, because i believe this book is severely flawed. Little Eva, is about five or six when she is introduced, and then later passes away. She seemes to look on death as a good thing, which is totally unrealistic for a child of that age. Eva says things like \\"the time will come soon, when i will have to leave you, I will leave, never to return.\\" and \\"I am not nervous- I am not low-spirited, and I know I am going, before long. If it were not for you Papa, and my friends, I should be perfectly happy. I want to go- I long to go\\" Now these are not things that come out of a childs mouth, so this part of the book is not believable. Also, I think a good book should have well rounded characters. Characters who are flawed. Uncle Tom is too good, he is whipped tourtured, and beaten and all he thinks about is wanting to save Simon Legree's soul. I believe that every person has a little bit of good in them. This is not shown in Simon legree which makes him also, an unbelievable character. The book was by no doubt a well writen book, and I look up to Harriet Beecher-Stowe for having so much courage, that ever when she recieved death threats from slavery supporters, she went along and kept writing this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"When I had to choose a historical fiction book for class, Uncle Tom's Cabin came to mind. I had started the book before, but I had gotten bored with it and abandoned it after the first chapter or two. This time, when I put down the book, it was after I had finished it. There are not many books that can move me to tears, laughter, fear, and satisfaction. This book has combined all of these qualities and made me experience a broad range of emotions. The story follows the life of Eliza and Tom, two religious slaves. One day, their master being in debt, a slave trader comes to take Tom and Eliza's child away. Eliza chooses to run away, while Tom chooses to stay and meet his fate. From there, the paths of the two heores diverge into two emotional stories. Eliza is ever pursued by slave catchers on the run to Canada, and Tom learns more about life and Christianity as he is sold to different owners. The most striking aspect of this book is the surge of emotion behind the words. Vivid images take you back in time, and inside each character is a beautifully-portrayed soul. Uncle Tom's Cabin is, overall, a tale of sin and redemption, prejudice, faith, and love, woven intricately in the lives of many during the pre-Civil War era."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I wasn't sure about reading this book and initially found it very difficult. After finishing the book I found it to be very moving, informative. It is amazing that this book was written so long ago and by a woman."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I always heard my mother talk about \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" when I was a child and wanted to finally experience the book. It was written in the old south slang when starting the book and a little hard to follow. However, I got used to the slang and got into the book big time. The story was based on true characters and gave me a much better understanding of how slavery worked, the limitations and abuse placed on women as well as men. The information told about compassionate plantation owners and ones that were in it strictly for profit with no feeling for an individual needs. I finished the book with a much better understanding and more compassion for the black people.I still do believe the black individual has been given many opportunities to achieve a better life in America, that it is time for them to step up and stop using the \\"race card\\" whenever something happens. I do not believe many people have prejudices against them anymore, but I do believe American people experience much abuse from the blacks due to the \\"race card\\" being used."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"EVERYONE should read this book.I love that these are classics are available for Kindle free on Amazon. That is primarily why I bought the kindle for my son--to give him a fun new way to get all of the timeless classics. Thanks Amazon"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I knew this was a very important book; apocryphally the book written by the little lady who started a big war. I knew it was a response to the (dreadful) Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and that it sparked increased abolitionist feeling in the North. I knew about Eliza crossing the frozen river (shown in The King and I) and about the evil Simon Legree. But there were still some surprises.Firstly this is a melodramatic novel featuring very cardboard characters who represent specific types of the period. For example there is the evil slave owner (Legree); there is an angelic little girl (who made me think of Nell from The Old Curiosity Shop which I've never read but I've seen an adaptation); there is a slave owner who is conflicted about the system of slavery; there are Northern anti-slavery people who have slavery brought to their doorstep. Nothing that happens is particularly surprising and none of the characters have any depth or growth.Secondly I just realized a plot might be helpful. Uncle Tom is a slave on a farm where he is about to be sold because his owner is profligate. A little boy named Harry is also about to be sold away from his mother Eliza. She is terrified about this prospect and so runs away, accumulating family and escaping to Canada along the way. Uncle Tom however submits to his fate and is first bought by an ambivalent slave owner who ends up dying before freeing him, leaving him to be sold to the vile Legree which leads to his death.Some of the major parts of this book are evangelical fervor; pretty much every page has Christianity references and it can be overwhelming because even modern Christian novels I've read are not so steeped in my opinion. The morality of women and their ability to influence their husbands from their proper domestic sphere also occurs. Stowe's solution for post-abolition seems to be colonization of Liberia using ex-slaves as missionaries to spread Christianity which seems impractical to me and obviously did not end up happening. It is also interesting to look at her racial attitudes which are awful in our times but were actually among the most liberal for the 1850s! I read this for class and my professor called it \\"romantic racism\\" where Africans are recognized to have a soul but aren't as good as Anglo-Saxons.It is also interesting how the use of Uncle Tom has changed. Now he is considered a subservient simpleminded slave but here he is actually very responsible and devoted to his Christian faith. When Legree demands Uncle Tom betray his slaves who have escaped, he refuses and is protected by his faith so that he dies secure and protected by God. Actually the representation of Uncle Tom as bowing and scraping comes from ministrel shows where Stowe's story was twisted to actually promote slavery.Overall: I'm very pleased that I've read this very important book now. While there are some crazy coincidences a la Dickens, they come together rather well. The only bad thing was the flowery language which meant I usually could only read one chapter at a time with lots of breaks. So I will rate this 4/5 and recommend it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This work of art evoked every emotion I have in me. From sympathy, to ire, to joy. This opened my naive eyes to what evils humans are capable of, but at the same time proved to me what spiritual and god-like creatures we have the potential to be. The plot follows several lives, all affected by slavery. The hero of the story is a simple minded Uncle Tom who sticks to his righteous christian ways through all the adversity he encounters as a slave. The symbolism and satire in this book make it all the more interesting and meaningful. I am only sorry I don't know more about the politics and characters at the time because Stowe makes reference to incidences in her time period. Stowe's views on the issue of slavery are excellently expressed. She doesn't come off as preaching, or arguing, merely objectively stating the facts.(Yeah right) By using sarcasm, satire, symbolism, and religious teachings, she kept the book interesting and to the point. Every word she wrote further supports her beliefs. In the end the overall mood gets a bit gloomy, but the finale is magnificent."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Tolstoy said that, I didn't. And I don't give stars away lightly. This book is a real humdinger! A sort of primer on slavery in the modern age with a lot of Christian moralizing thrown in, the book is nonetheless powerful, at least as involving and occasionally as violent as &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; and every bit as unrelenting. Besides a ripping good story, what can today's reader find? A haunting case made for never assuming you are in the right. Just look at all those people back then who said slavery was a natural thing. How wrong they were. That much is obvious to us now. But what about today's controversies? To future generations how obviously wrong can we be (1) about abortion, (2) about Clinton's impeachment, or (3, my favorite) how we are turning our back on injustices in Rwanda, Kosovo, and Chechniya. What will history say about us if we turn out to be on the wrong side of any of these issues? Oh, and please meet the real Uncle Tom -- what nobility, and not a shuffle in sight. And find out where &quot;shiftless&quot; really came from. Another reader suggested this book be required reading for all American citizens.

Great characters and heart warming / heart wrenching stories."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I think this book deserves the status of a classic due to the issues it addresses and the impact it has had on society. However, from a literary standpoint, the novel is merely average. Stowe is to be admired for her boldness and willingness to write a novel that deals so honestly with the evils of slavery. My critique here is that Stowe's mechanics and style are weak and make for clumsy reading. This book is one that I recommend, but don't expect a masterpiece in terms of literary prowess--do expect a moving depiction of the reprehensible abuse and mistreatment of slaves that will stay with you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A central text in American Literature and History, January 7, 2005Reviewer: Tony Thomas (North Miami, FL USA) - See all my reviewsUncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Simply put, this book is unforgetable.I must have read it more than 12 years ago and I still rate it as one of the BEST books I've ever read.I've read more than 100 books in my life-time.This book is ..........life personified.Love it or hate it, u can't ignore it.America and the world should be proud of this work."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This novel opens up on the Shelby plantation in Kentucky, before the Civil War. In the beginning of the novel, Mr.Shelby, a plantation owner, goes through some financial problems and goes into debt. The only way to get out of the debt is to sell some of his slaves. He's left with no other choice but to sell his most faithful and hardest working slave, Tom, and a little boy named Harry. While Mr.Haley, a slave trader, talks to Mr.Shelby at the Shelby plantation, Eliza, Harry's mother, overhears the fate of her son. Not wanting to be separated from her family, she decides to leave the plantation and runs away. Like many other slaves at this time, Eliza is determined to reach Canada. Along the way, she's reunited with her husband George and the family reaches their destination. Fortunately for Tom, he is bought by a nice man by the name of Mr. St. Clare. Unfortunately, Eva and Mr. St. Clare die and all the slaves are left in the hands of Maria, the wife. She always hated slaves and thought her husband was treating them too nicely. She ends up selling them down the river and Tom is bought by an evil man. He prides himself in being able to \\"break\\" his slaves and beats Tom from head to toe. Just before Tom's death, Master George, rescues him and brings him back home. Tom finally gets to return to the Shelby's, but cannot escape the death that's awaiting him. Before Tom dies, George grants Tom's final wish and emancipates all the Shelby's slaves.This novel talks about some cultural issues like religion, treatment of women, and of course slave trade. The book also uses a lot of Black Dialect, which is interesting to read because that's how the slaves talked during that time.I would definitely recommend this book for high school and up. This book is exciting, interesting, and fun to read. It's a little over 600 pages in length, but the pages seem to fly by quickly because you're so emerged in the book. It is a little difficult to understand at the beginning because the book mostly uses Black English. \\" \`Mose done, Mas'r George,' said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping in,-\`browning beautiful-a real lovely brown. Ah! Let me alone for dat. Missis let Sally try to make some cake, t' other day, jes to larn her, she said. \`O, go away, Missis,' said I; \`it really hurts my feelin's, now, to see good vittles split data r way! Cake ris all to one side-no shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!\\" (69) But once you get used to the language, it's very easy to comprehend and understand what the characters are saying. This novel opened up my eyes as a reader to many of the cultural and historical issues during the Civil War. Since many Black slaves could not read or write, there were many historical documents thatare not written down in history books. I feel that this novel helped me to see a lot of the things that went on during those times and it really feels like an important part of history that was not written down."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I don't like this book at all it's very boring and there's not much entertainment in the book to keep me wanting to read it more."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Had to read it for a class called American Women Writers.

It did much to solidify Northern anti-slavery sentiment and has been seriously credited with making the Civil War inevitable - supposedly even by Lincoln himself. However, though America's greatest bestseller ever on release, it now seems as if fewer and fewer people actually read it. This is unfortunate, because its significance alone makes it essential, but it is also an incredible story and well worth reading in itself.Those reading for historical perspective will have many assumptions confirmed but also be very surprised. Most obviously and importantly, it is easy to see why the book moved so many and emboldened abolitionists. It is easily one of the most profoundly emotional and pathos-drenched works ever; only the truly inhuman will not be moved, and many will cry. The characters seem supremely real, and we care for them as if they are our intimates. Harriet Beecher Stowe writes accurately and precisely of slavery's many evils. Much of what she says is so gut-wrenching as to be near-unbearable. Reading it is emotionally distressing and even at times almost physically painful; when something is this hard to even read, we simply cannot imagine what it must have been like to live. To think such suffering and inhumanity existed in America barely a century and a half ago truly astounds. There are many accounts of American slavery, from ones written by slaves to meticulously researched historical accounts, but perhaps no other is as deeply stirring. Even now we cannot read Uncle without being strongly moved; how much stronger must the effect have been when the evils described were current! I re-read it shortly after Barack Obama was elected, as many others doubtless did, and was affected more strongly and deeply than ever, moved almost to tears by the striking contrast and how far America has come.All this is if anything even more moving than inevitably high expectations would suggest, yet much of the book surprises because it is rarely or never mentioned in popular accounts. The biggest revelation may be that the story itself is excellent - not only moving but deftly plotted, superbly executed, and often thought-provoking. There is even a surprising amount of humor amid all the tragedy, St. Clare's wife being one of American literature's greatest comic creations. Deeply engrossing, Uncle pulls us in immediately and never lets go despite being a long, winding tale with a plethora of characters and many substantial subplots. Stowe's ability to handle and tie them together in a well-executed conclusion is truly stunning, especially in that this was her first novel. Indeed, inconceivable as it is, Stowe was no artist in the usual sense but an activist writing for practical ends. Such works of course almost never have any real literary or even entertainment value and are inevitably short-lived; this is why virtually everything else she wrote has been forgotten. However, Uncle is an astounding exception; unlike nearly all other such works, it does not come off as a hopelessly dated, artless tract. Though written without an eye to literature - nay, many would say, without literary skill - and for no purpose other than to reach everyday people, it remains an immense literary monument that has earned the admiration of uber-literary writers like Leo Tolstoy and Henry James. It has had many critics, quite a few of them scathing, but survived them all. Its many admirers still cannot pinpoint just what makes it so successful, but successful it certainly is.I submit that its greatest virtue is moving verisimilitude. Characterization is a big part; even minor characters - indeed even evil ones - are drawn so well, with such individuality and lifelikeness, that we will remember them long after reading. Many - Tom, Simon Legree, Little Eva - have long been archetypes. However, the realism is stunning throughout; Stowe made the Southern slavery system that few Northerners had seen come alive as if they had known it all their lives, and the same is still remarkably true for us though such a world cannot now be even imagined. She is very visceral, sparing no pains to show just how hard and demeaning slavery was mentally as well as physically; much of Uncle's immediacy comes from this central fact. However, she goes considerably beyond this to vividly convey all aspects of the Old South; everything from landscape to dialect is detailed believably and memorably. This is all the more incredible in that Stowe saw very little of this herself, and it gives Uncle great historical value even aside from the perversely fascinating slavery peek.This last, though, is certainly noteworthy. Popular slavery depictions now imply that slavery was homogenous in the South, but there were great differences - generally speaking, the farther South, the harsher and more ubiquitous. Many works focus on only one or a few aspects, but Stowe made sure to include all. Uncle begins in Kentucky, where slavery was most mild, and shows everything from its darkest Deep South facets to its New Orleans base where millions of slaves were brought and sold. We see the great diversity that existed in how slaves were treated and thought of as well as how they worked and interacted among themselves. Almost as importantly, Stowe makes clear that those directly involved in slavery were far from identical. Some truly thought of themselves as humane and even pious, generally treating slaves relatively well, others thought them subhuman and treated them accordingly, and most fell somewhere between them. St. Clare symbolizes this last; such a person probably never existed, as Stowe surely knew, but he is important for showing how one could have slaves while being as aware as anyone of slavery's evils and treating slaves as well as conditions allowed - could indeed even have them for a basically philanthropic purpose. Very few actually did this, but St. Clare is extremely valuable because he in many ways sees slavery more fully than anyone else in Uncle and criticizes accordingly.Here we get a good idea of just how thought-provoking the book is. It of course has many anti-slavery arguments - from theological to philosophical to political, a nuanced depiction of slavery's varying effect on politicians being one of its many overlooked strengths -, but they are now thankfully moot in America. However, though almost never credited for it, the book goes far deeper. For instance, St. Clare's critique goes well beyond slavery to include capitalism itself; so diverse is Uncle that Marx could easily be added to its long, varied admirers list. More fundamentally, very few works are so fully aware of human evil. Stowe believed all acts were forgivable and should be forgiven but was as starkly cognizant of humanity's inhumanity as any existential pessimist. Uncle presents human life as a near-unbroken series of miseries brought on mainly by avoidable cruelty and lack of empathy. Stoe indeed thought this force so strong that it could not be overcome; all one could do was piously submit. Death is the only escape and heaven the only redemption; this seems distinctly unfair on earth but is worth it in the end, as the latter is eternal, the former but a passing phase. This was the main Christian strand until the Renaissance, and it is all too easy to see how a sensitive, pious soul in a slaveowning country could turn to it. Thus, though somewhat paradoxical in that it looked to the past, Uncle was very far ahead of its time philosophically - far more so than in regard to slavery, where it only fanned flames. Such a bleak view of human life was not even remotely common in art or philosophy for several decades, becoming standard only after World War I. Stowe essentially saw worldly existence just as existentialists, nihilists, and other despair agents later saw it, but firm Christianity allowed her to bear it. This faith of course disappeared, opening a vast, gaping abyss that she managed to keep closed - an abyss that shows no sign of closing, leaving millions pining for a relative tranquility that seems nearly as unimaginable as American slavery. The character of St. Clare himself is also extremely forward-looking, seeming to step out of a Wilde or Shaw play forty years before one existed.As this suggests, though the fact is otherwise perhaps most stunning of all, Uncle has no hint of anything like a Civil War. Stowe of course wanted slavery ended but was Christian in the true and rare sense and had no taste for violence, whether it a Civil War or a slave uprising. She in fact wanted slaves to freely, piously, and - as much as was possible - uncomplainingly submit to slavery's evils and wanted abolitionists to appeal to Southerners' hearts and minds rather than attack or even force them to end slavery. Though clearly an unflinching realist in that she saw slavery for what it was and was unafraid to say so, she was startlingly optimistic and had a very positive view of human nature. This is clear even in the Preface, where she boldly states that she has no hard feelings toward those who uphold slavery, even saying they are often some of the best people she knows. She actually thought they were simply misled and did not see their unintended evil and that, if they could be made to, they would voluntarily end slavery.All this is clear in many ways - not least in the ending, where she allows the young, quick-tempered George a short act of violence that nearly everyone will find justified but in which she closes with an appeal to end slavery non-violently. Indeed, she does not even seem to conceive of violence as a solution. This is also present in innumerable references to God's Providence, Christian piety, eternal reward in heaven, forgiveness, refusal to judge, etc.; though rarely noted, Uncle is perhaps the most truly Christian of all novels. In contrast to the Apocalyptic, fire and brimstone streak that has sometimes flared up in Christianity and has now reached a fever pitch, Stowe and like-minded abolitionists focused on Jesus' essential message of mercy, pity, peace, and love. Conservatives have of course monopolized Christianity, especially in political terms, but Uncle is a stunning reminder that it was until very recently American liberalism's driving force. Jesus constantly said that the poor, weak, meek, etc. are blessed and under God's special protection, that they will be rewarded eternally for earthly trials, and that they should endure such trials peacefully - resisting not evil, turning the other check, etc. Very few Christians now point such things out, or even seem aware of them, but they epitomized Christianity for Stowe and her ilk and are Uncle's very essence. World wars, genocide, biological terrorism, and a host of other horrors have made such thinking seem near-laughably nave, and other parts of the book - especially the Victorian sentimentalism of which Little Eva is the apotheosis - also seem somewhat dated. Even so, Uncle remains of immense importance for showing how strict Christianity was not only the underpinning that let the book speak so powerfully to so many but also the prime mover of liberalism itself.Uncle Tom himself of course epitomizes this gap between expectations, the book's reality, and later history. He is Stowe's ideal slave; that he is also a master's ideal slave - at least in theory - may be ironic, and Stowe's treatment of blacks throughout is perhaps best described as condescending. Perhaps most offensive of all is that she thought it impossible for blacks to integrate into American society, assuming that a Christian republic should be made for them in Africa if they were freed. This comes across in the novel, though more subtly than other beliefs. All this infuriated many twentieth century black authors and intellectuals, and \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a byword for blacks thought to have sold out to whites. This in many ways makes Uncle more worth reading than ever and certainly more interesting. Needless to say, such reaction was absolutely unthinkable at the time; the book was almost liberalism's height, and anyone told it would some day be condemned as conservative would have likely been too shocked to laugh. This issue is far too complex to even outline, much less decide, in a review. Suffice it to say that these later views have great legitimacy, whether or not one agrees; this is the kind of thing all must decide for themselves. However, it is important to realize a few things. First, Tom was a genuine hero to Stowe; she certainly did not mean to be degrading or stereotypical but made Tom the exemplar in a book with many white characters. Many others thought the same. That later blacks would prefer a Malcolm X-like revolutionary is very understandable, but precious few whites of the era - certainly not Stowe - could have even conceived of one. It is also worth noting that the book would not have had the success and impact it did - and may even have backfired - if Tom were otherwise portrayed. There may be much to regret in his depiction and Uncle's presentation of blacks overall, but this is arguably best seen as proof of society's liberalizing rather than a fault of the book or Stowe.Stowe's Preface looks forward to a time when \\"sketches similar to these shall be valuable only as memorials of what has long ceased to be.\\" Uncle is certainly that, invaluable historically both for what it shows of a thankfully long-past era and for its own significance. In addition, it has achieved a transcendent importance that probably no one else could have foreseen; more than just a literary landmark, it is a towering Americana monument - socially, culturally, politically, and otherwise priceless. Every American should read it, as should anyone anywhere who is at all interested in slavery's dark history, Americana, or the few books that have quite literally changed the world."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Obviously, the text will be the same regardless of which publication you buy.

Stephanie, South Africa"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a classic which is essential to an understanding of the controversy over the slave issue in nineteenth century pre-Civil War America.It author is the famous Harriet Beecher Stowe who was the most notable member of the famous Beecher family of preachers and educators. Stowe wrote the book in the wake of the Compromise of 1850 which called for northerners to return slaves to the South ascaptured fugitives. Slaves were considered as property and thought to be inferior mentally and spiritually to Anglos. Stowe, the sibling and wife of a clergyman was outraged! She poured her heart, soul and considerable literary talents into making slavery real to many Americans who had no understanding or experience of the \\"peculiar institution.\\" Abraham Lincoln upon meeting her at the White House remarked, \\"Mrs Stowe you are the little lady whose book started this big war.\\" (or words to that effect). The novel was published in 1852 becoming the runaway bestseller of all Americans novels published in that century.The story begins in Kentucky where Uncle Tom lives in amity with his wife Aunt Chloe and their three children. He is sold down river because his benevolent owner Mr. Shelby has got himself into debt. Tom rescues little Eva on a steamboat and is purchased by the wealthy Augustine St. Clare who is her father. Uncle Tom is treated well by the St. Clare family but the saintly little Eva dies (a poignant death reminiscent of the death of Little Nell in Dickens \\"The Old Curiosity Shop and other Victorian fictional deaths). In his scenes with Little Eva and everyone he encounters Uncle Tom is a Christlike man of strength, faith and charity.St Clare's wife is a cold, egotistical woman so enamored of her own illnesses she care nothing for Eva. Miss Ophelia is a New England relative visiting the St. Clares who see slavery up close for the first time. She loves little Topsy an abused girl who is owned by the St Clares. Ophelia will eventually adopt Topsy taking her back home to New England. Topsy eventually becomes a Christian missionary in Africa.Uncle Tom is sold to the infamous Simon Legree a Vermont born slave owner who is one of the cruelest characters in all of fiction. He beats Uncle Tom to death but not before the Christian martyr has converted many of his fellow slaves to Christ. It is telling that Stowe made her villian Legree a New Englander. The curse of slavery was nationwide.An ancillary story features the escape of Eliza and Tom Harris to freedom in Canada. We see Eliza fleeing with her baby Harry across the icy Ohio river where she is befriended by Quakers enabling her escape to freedom. Tom and Eliza settle in Montreal and he travels to France with his family graduating from a university in that land. Stowe insists that Africa-Americans should have the right to read and learn as do whites.Mrs. Stowe indicts both North and South for the nation's culpability in the cruel slave system. Her great novel still has power today in a time when racisim and injustice still exist in our land. Who reading Uncle Tom's Cabin would have ever believed that a fine African-American gentleman named Barack Obama would sit in the White House as the President of the United States?Some will accuse Stowe of sentimentality but her storytelling abilities are profound and keep the attention of the reader throughout her sad and moving story. This book is an essential for every American."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I realize it is very easy to paint with a broad brush, but there is plenty of guilt to go around. From Southerners who justified their attitudes by appealing to the Bible, to Northerners who were opposed to slavery while keeping freed slaves at arm's length, to everyone who claimed to hate slavery but refused to do anything about it. This book has made me stop and think about the ways I might bend Scripture to fit my preferences and how my sins of omission are just a grievous as my sins of commission. This book moved me to tears at times and gave me a greater appreciation for the gospel. And like other reviewers, it left me scratching my head over why the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" has come to mean what it does in our culture. For me, Tom was a beautiful illustration of the Sermon on the Mount. I wish I would have read this book years ago."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Definitely a worthwhile read.In my opinion, Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beerch Stowe was a religious tract rather than a story. Her writing relied heavily on faith as interpreted by slaves, Quakers, and the mainstream population.This was an abolitionist view of the slave issue by a writer living in the era close to the problem. The story line was somewhat complex and at times convoluted, yet stayed true to the author's objective. It's not a novel meant to entertain, but to change the culture of the American south."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"There are some books which one gets to know by reputation before one actually reads them. \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin (or, Life Among the Lowly)\\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe is one of them. Whether from studying American History and slavery, and hearing the pejorative term \\"Uncle Tom\\", one gets a strong sense for certain aspects of the book. For whatever reason, I had not read the book until recently, when studying in more detail the history of slavery in the U.S. made this a necessity in my view.The history of how this book came about is important to the overall experience as well. The 1850 Compromise had seemed to settle the slavery question, before Stephen A. Douglas used its existence as a justification for his argument that the Missouri Compromise had been overturned. However, part of the Compromise included a slave-catching bill which created outcries from the abolitionist movement, and led a thirty-nine year old Harriet Beecher Stowe to write what would become perhaps the most important publication in the history of the Untied States.The change in public sentiment after its publication was dramatic. Its initial publication in the \\"National Era\\" as a 40 part serial, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue, did not draw a lot of notice outside of the abolitionist movement, but its publication as a complete book on March 20th of 1852 resulted in it being the most successful novel ever written up to that point. It was called by one critic at the time \\"The most valuable addition that America has made to English literature\\", and it has become a piece of history itself, as well as a classic piece of literature.In the initial part of the story there are three key slave characters to this story: the title character, Uncle Tom, Eliza (there is also her young son Harry), and George Harris. George is Eliza's husband and Harry's father, and is owned by Mr. Harris, who abuses George, mainly due to his being jealous of George's talents. Eliza, Harry, and Tom are owned by Mr. and Mrs. Shelby. The Shelby's are good to their slaves, yet due to some financial mishaps, Arthur Shelby decides that he is forced to sell off Tom, and is then talked into selling Harry as well to fully clear his debt. This is the opening scene of the novel, and it sets the tone for the rest of the book.Eliza learns of the sale of Harry and flees with her son in order to save him. She is also aware of her husband's intent to flee from his brutal master. George does also flee and both of them make their way into Ohio where they manage to unite. Tom, learns the reason for his sale, and decides that it is best for his master and the rest of the slaves owned by the Shelby's, and thus he obediently goes along with the sale. The fleeing slaves go north, while Tom is taken south.The three characters are very distinct and important. Stowe uses Eliza to show the perspective of a female slave. Her family kept apart by slavery, and threatened to be parted from her son, she flees in fear and in do so gains freedom and her family reunited. George is equally important, as by defying an abusive owner, he too gains his freedom and his family by not following the law. In his words we hear the echo of Patrick Henry when he says \\"I'll be free, or I'll die!\\" Stowe uses these characters to show the fallacy of the common belief of the time that slaves don't have the same sense of family. She also defies common belief by portraying George as smart and talented and passionate about his thirst for freedom. Of course, the comparison between the dire conditions for George in slavery as well as the broken family situation verses that which they have once they flee is significant. Stowe leaves George, Eliza, and Harry for a long period in the middle of the book, but she does return to them in a chapter near the end to finish their story.The other character, Uncle Tom, is the most controversial. His almost infuriating obedience and subservience to his masters in the story resulted in the creation of the derisive term \\"Uncle Tom\\". His character today reads as one who is not intelligent, and someone who blindly follows his master and his religion. In my opinion, it was important to have him as the central hero of the story and important that he act as the \\"ideal slave\\" would act. One key point is the contrast between what happens to an \\"ideal\\" slave who does what the master tells him to do, and the \\"bad\\" slaves who run away. Unlike Eliza and George, Tom loses his wife and children when his master sells him.Another important aspect of Tom is that he is always, by far, more moral than those that supposedly \\"own\\" him. Even the relatively benign Arthur Shelby allows his personal needs to not only sell Tom, but in doing so breaking his promise to free him, and beyond that, he fails to make a real effort to regain Tom, which he also promises to do. This contrast serves its purpose well. Tom is not dumb, and his faith is pure and true, unlike the faith of the slave-owners which they have had to twist to convince themselves that slavery is a moral good.Tom's second master is Augustine St. Clare, who inherited a plantation in Louisiana, and though he feels slavery is a sin, it is a sin he is unable to abstain from. His cousin, Miss Ophelia St. Clare, is from New England and argues with him to try to get him to give up his slaves. His response is to have her try to raise and educate a wild young slave girl called Topsy. Though separated from his family, Tom is still able to correspond through an exchange of letters, which gives both himself and his loved ones hope of being reunited. Tom's obedience again earns his master's trust, good treatment, and promise of freedom, but a tragedy results in Tom being sold again.Tom's third master is the infamous Simon Legree, a brutal master who trusts no slave, and who finds Tom too soft. At this point, Tom's separation from his family is complete, there is no communication at all. It is here where Tom refuses to do as his new master acts, and the reader learns that Tom has never really been a slave, that his actions have always been carried out because he believed they were the best course of action. He will not let Legree turn him into a Slave Driver, and he will readily sacrifice himself for others, as he has done throughout.Though the slang can be difficult to navigate, and there are certainly other weaknesses as well, such as a wrap-up which is a bit too neat and some ideas on Liberia which demonstrate the racism which was even there in those that were against slavery, this is a book which every American ought to read and experience. When initially published, the book did well not only in the Northern part of the United States, but in Europe as well. Stowe makes use of the current events of the time in her narrative. For example, in one of the narrative comments, Stowe makes a comparison to a runaway slave and a Hungarian defying the law and making his way to America, which is a clear reference to the Hungarian, Louis Kossuth, fleeing Austria and the hero's welcome he received when he came to the United States.The edition I am reviewing is the Penguin Classics which includes an introduction titled \\"The Art of Controversy\\" by Ann Douglas. It provides some good insight into Harriet Beecher Stowe's life and her writing of this novel, but I did think she somewhat oversimplified some of the historical context. Nevertheless, I would definitely highly recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Due to time constraints and long drive to and from work/other places, I opted to listen to the audio instead of reading the book. This turned out to be a great decision! The audio was clear with deeply enriching array of voices for different characters that served to deepen entertainment and enrich vocabulary and pronunciation.While the tracks are multiple [about 90 per CD]; they are short and easy to follow.I would recommend this audio book for anyone who would benefit from auditory language stimulation, vocabulary enrichment and a good old entertainment. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"For 30 years my only knowledge of &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; came through the awkward filter of a brief scene in the movie, &quot;The King and I.&quot; In that movie from the 1950s, Siamese actors present a beautiful but caricatured version of Stowe's book- like the minstrel shows of the nineteenth century which made Uncle Tom into an obsequious cliche. These dramatizations have probably done much to obscure the true value of this narrative. Stowe's characters are richly drawn and highly complex. The characters of Uncle Tom, Ophelia, and Mr. St. Clare are some of the most vivid, precisely drawn characters in literature.The conversations between Ophelia and her cynical, slaveholding cousin from the South encapsulated perfectly the heated debate in this country about the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of slavery. And, while Stowe attacks the South for its tolerance of this demonaical practice, she does not hesitate to point out the hypocrisy of the North. Northerners, she states, condemn the South for slavery, but they themselves want little or nothing to do with blacks or their rehabilitation. (Little Topsy becomes the perfect metaphor for the challenge of reconstruction.)This novel also reminds us of the dominance of faith and the Bible in the nineteenth century, making much of the text feel- to us in the twentieth century- preachy or overly didactic. It's an odd combination of story and moral jeremaid, but its ultimate purpose was to incite action, not to entertain. Utimately, it managed to do both."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it. In my edition at Loc 2416 appears \\"I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,\\". It then continues with something completely out of context and including the character Ophelia St. Clare. The correct continuation appears at Loc 2447, so that the rendering should have been, \\"I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,just now. I have not looked in the papers.\\" Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book.This kind of error is shameful.

I just finished it about half an hour ago and I don't think the impression it left on me will ever change. Being in a stage of adolescense, if ever-so early, I've got problems. And helping me through these is a person who constantly tries to help me look on the positive side and be thankful for what makes up my life. This book was an ideal aid. Here Harriet Beecher Stowe has put together a tale which is assumed to be based on stories of actual lives tortured by the cruelty of slavery. Legend has it that Abraham Lincoln referred to Mrs. Stowe as the &quot;little lady who started the big war&quot; upon meeting her, and the pages in this book are credible for having done so. Here a true view is given into the darkness of an American reality. Here we have to ask ourselves what we do to others directly and what we do by not doing anything in their defense. Here we have to ask ourselves, &quot;where are we going?&quot; For this nation, alive over a hundred years at the time, was betraying the very basis for which it was founded. And the life of Uncle Tom exposes it's cruelties clearly, as unwanted as they are. Tom is a strong faithed and God fearing man, a credit to man. What he endured has made my eyes moist and my mind churn over my values. But what sustained him was his faith in God. Upon reading this book, think about the nature of humans, and what will happen on God's day of judgement."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had always intended to read this book and finally ordered a copy from Amazon. As I proceeded to read it, I was often amazed at the quality of its writing and perceptions. I find it hard to conceive how a woman with the constraints of her day, including those of family, travel, and research sources could have produced a book that still shines forth with freshness and articulation. I was prepared to find it rather stilted and time-worn but found it a compelling and most enjoyable read instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Most of the classics you read are long and boring and definitely not easy reading. Uncle Tom's Cabin is not one of those books! It is a book you can read before you go to sleep at night, without your brain hurting from trying to decipher what is going on (Wuthering Heights anyone?). Bottom line, I really enjoyed the book, and I know others will too."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I usually don't expect 150-year-old novels of ideas (and this is the quintessential novel of ideas) to be page turners, but Stowe is to be commended for writing what is first of all a great story. Never mind all the political sermonizing she does here -- and there's plenty of it -- this is above all a gripping story. Every time I expected a chapter to head into tedious territory, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though everyone knows what will happen to Uncle Tom -- this being a slave narrative written by a Northern abolitionist before the Civil War, after all, -- I couldn't help but continue wanting to read on. This was the second best selling book of the 19th century not only because it was highly controversial, but also because it's a well-told story, and I say \\"told\\" because Stowe herself often claimed that God dictated it to her. And it seems to be more spoken than written, especially with her frequent direct addresses to the reader.While there may be something to Stowe's claim of divine inspiration, given its impact on American history, the book is certainly not without its faults. The character of Eva, for instance, is unlike that of any normal living child. She's a saintly caricature. And her never-ending conclusion drips with maudlin sentiment exaggerated to Biblical proportions. Similarly, Uncle Tom doesn't bear resemblance to anyone I've ever met. But most troublesome is Stowe's romanticism of the black characters. She lumps them together and stereotypes them in one way or another. Clearly she means no harm; just the opposite is her desired effect. But it sometimes comes at the price of preachy condescension. They may be positive sterotypes, but they are stereotypes nonetheless, and they weaken her story.Having read and enjoyed the highly-acclaimed and abundantly-awarded \\"The Known World\\" by Edward P. Jones, it dawned on me that Stowe really had a more thorough understanding of even the most subtle effects that the institution of slavery had on blacks and whites both northern and southern alike even with ideal slave masters. She even appears to foresee the differences of opinion that would later crystallize in Martin Luther King's brand of civil disobediance and the more militant versions advocated by the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers, juxtaposed in the diverging paths of the quiet, pious and tolerant Tom with that of the more directly oppositional George. She criticizes neither, though she seems to favor Tom's path, knowing full well that Uncle Tom is unique, and his abundance of Christian tolerance isn't likely to be found in the general population -- nor is it a path she desires for most slaves. She would rather that slaves simply escaped. She also seems to advocate their creation of a country of their own, taking Liberia as a model.Still, further, Stowe is an early feminist, and as a result, the characters that are most interesting here are the women. Ophelia comes nearest of all the characters in the book to walking off the page. And Cassie, a finely complex creation, though introduced only in the last 120 pages or so, nearly steals the climax.And what of the villains? They, too, are caricatures to be sure. To me at least, Simon Legree left something to be desired. He occasionally comes off as more of a buffoon rather than the Satan you know him to be deep down. But Marie St. Claire -- again, the woman -- is as clear a picture of selfcenteredness as Scrooge is of miserliness.Hemingway said that all modern American literature dates back to Huckleberry Finn, but I think he needed to look about 30 years earlier than Twain to Stowe. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a masterpiece of American fiction; if it is not the Great American Novel, it is, at least in terms of sales, impact and literary merit, the Great American Novel of Ideas."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"HOW DID A CHARACTER WHO PREFERRED TO FACE DEATH RATHER THAN TORTURE AND BETRAY OTHER SLAVES BECOME THE SYMBOL OF 'JUDAS-HOOD' FOR BLACK AMERICA ? I wonder how many blacks --then or now-- would refrain from going against other blacks if they knew it could mean their being beaten or killed ? In view of all the black drug dealers willing to sell drugs to black children and run away dads and other betrayers, I don't think many.The original character was a hero of non-violent resistance. But, militants have often seen the such as a weakness; not a strength --attacking Martin and others. And, they are wrong.The name Uncle Tom should be used for blacks of great character and not for blacks of no character.

Still, this book was a hideous experience. Once you get past the first hundred and fifty pages the plot picks up enough to give the sheer boredom a minor respite, but the characters are about as flat as anything imaginable. Little Eva in particular I was ready to strangle, with hair or without, by the time she up and died. It's historically interesting as a spark to abolitionism and to the beginning of the Civil War, but as a novel it's dreadful. I would warn you not to read it, but you probably have already or will soon for a U.S. history class, in which case please accept my deepest condolences."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I never read this as a student, so I was apprehensive.

You're probably thinking - what? How can a mere 544 pages help cause something that big?Before we talk about the actual book we have to take into consideration the time period. 1852 - two years after the Compromise of 1850 and the dreadful Fugitive Slave Act which forbade Northerner's to help runaway slaves from the South. Of course, the Northerner's saw the inhumanity in the act and, as shown in the novel, most refused to abide. One argument the Southern states made were that their own slave institution was not as bad as the Notherner's \\"wage slave\\" laborers in factory systems.The Second Great Awakening had recently swept through the nation, and religion played a big part in people's lives in that era. Harriett Beecher Stowe knew the big impact of religion and incorporated it into her works - there's almost no page in the book where God isn't invoked. Throughout the book, I even felt my own slightly agnostic views wavering in the hands of Stowe's pious characters and inspiring dialogues.The book shows two very different aspects of slavery - through the lives of Uncle Tom Eliza Harris. They both start off as slaves for the Shelby's, kind owners who have unfortunately fallen into debt and must sell some of their slaves. Eliza's beautiful and talented five year old son Harry and the pious, honest Uncle Tom are sold to a slave trader. This is where the two part ways - Uncle Tom bids a tearful goodbye to his loving wife and kids and leaves with the slave trader, while Eliza decides she'd rather risk it and run away with her son rather than let him be sold. The Shelby's, as they are very fond of their slaves, promise they'll buy Uncle Tom back when they can.We follow Eliza and Harry as she journeys up North to Canada where she can be free. Eliza's husband George, is also on the run from his abusive master. Now, they're both fugitives. Her journey is both physically and mentally challenging, as she struggles to keep her son alive while hiding from the authorities. With the help of many Northerners who refuse to comply to the Fugitive Slave Act, Eliza is on her way to freedom.Uncle Tom is first sold to a rich gentleman who treats his slaves kindly. His daughter, Evangeline, is the perfect emblem of an angel, a sweet, caring child who understands the plight of the slaves, but doesn't understand the evil in the world. She turns out to be too good to stay in this world, and she falls victim to a deadly disease, along with her father. Eva's death brings the end of Uncle Tom's luck - and he's sold once again, but this time it's down South - and the deeper South, the worse the slave life. Even through all his hardships, Uncle Tom remains Christian at heart, never losing faith.After reading the book, it wasn't hard for me to understand why it caused such a riot. Stowe shows how Southern slavery could never be a better system than a Northern \\"wage slave\\" - Northerner's aren't split apart from their families like Uncle Tom; nor are their futures dependent on luck or the whims of a master, but mainly, wage slaves can still try to reach the prospect of the \\"American Dream,\\" while Uncle Tom and Eliza never could.I've read many books concerning slavery and the 19th century, including Huckleberry Finn, and I've read many books that are so obsolete they seem irrelevant, like Ivanhoe. Uncle Tom's Cabin, on the other hand, struck a nerve in me; because, although we all haven't experienced the type of slavery mentioned in Uncle Tom's Cabin, we all go through hard times, and we have all been slaves to something at some point in our lives. Whether you're a Christian or an atheist, whether you read for pleasure or for the grade, whether you're a Northerner in the 1850s, or a tired, stressed teenager in the 21st century...this book is worth the 544 pages."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Excellent classic which take us to the core of the slavery in the US at that time.

Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is a classic of American literature and according to Wikipedia, the second most popular (based on sales) book behind the Bible in the U.S. during the 19th century. Published in 1852, Ms. Stowe's by turns heartbreaking and inspirational story of the evils of slavery in the first half of the 1800s opened the eyes of many to the moral perversity of the institution and steeled resolve to end slavery sooner rather than later.Sometimes conflated to be the story of one African-American family (that of Tom) and evil slaveowner Simon Legree, the book actually follows two heroic leading characters from separate families - the title character of field slave Uncle Tom and house slave Eliza. As the book begins, both are property of relatively benign master George Shelby in Kentucky. Unspecified economic troubles force Shelby to sell some of his \\"stock\\" - he chooses his two most valuable properties - the reliable and loyal Tom and Eliza's young son Harry. The buyer has no interest in Eliza and Harry as a package. Eliza learns of the transaction and plans her and Harry's escape, a courageous journey along the Underground Railroad to Canada. Tom, a deeply spiritual man, accepts his sale as God's will and leaves his family for an almost certainly more difficult live further south.During the journey, Tom's decency improves his lot. After befriending and rescuing a young girl from drowning on a riverboat, he's resold to the girl's father - well-to-do gentleman Augustine St. Clare, from New Orleans. St. Clare accepts the practical \\"necessity\\" for slavery while being uncomfortable with its moral implications, a discomfort that he reflects in his hands off treatment of his slaves.Tom becomes a valued member of the St. Clare household and a Christian soulmate to the sickly daughter Eva, the embodiment of a \\"pure\\" Christian view of evils of slavery. She convinces her father (with a dying wish) to free Tom, but before the paperwork can be completed, St. Clare is killed in an accident. St. Clare's callous wife Marie takes control of his estate including the slaves and promptly sells Tom a short ways back up the river to the dreaded Legree, a cotton planter in north Louisiana.As St. Clare is probably about the most benign slaveowner imaginable, Legree is the most wicked, in fact, probably one of the most infamous villains in literary history, though he only appears in about the last quarter of the book. He envisions Tom as a potential overseer, but Tom's inherent kindness of spirit won't permit him to perform some of the key duties of that position, most importantly whipping the other slaves. The reluctance eventually costs Tom his life, but his nobility and strong Christian faith allow him to accept his fate with his usual dignity, believing that he's being delivered into a better life with Jesus in heaven.In recent years, the character of Tom has drawn criticism, especially in the young African-American community, as a so-called collaborator with slaveowners. I see him as a more heroic and noble character along the lines of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who maintained his soul and refused to resort to violence. The strength of Tom's spirit, while costing him his earthly life, rescues his soul, and ultimately conquers Legree's soul. As a counterpart to Tom, Stowe also includes the character of George, husband of Eliza, who engineers his family's escape and emigration. While Stowe glories in Tom's moral courage, she in no way denigrates George's approach to his predicament.Stowe often steps back from the story to preach on a particular evil of slavery (the breaking up of African-American families being foremost), the hypocrisy of white Christians, who find justification for slavery in the Bible of all places, and on the true Christian message that all human beings are equal in God's sight and deserving to pursue their own destinies freely. She also rebuts anticipated criticism of the story that \\"very few\\" slaveowners acted like Legree, asking how many owners who treat their mechanical farm equipment better than their human slaves are \\"too many.\\" Of course, her answer is \\"one\\".As well as being an unrelenting condemnation of slavery, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is to this non-Christian one of the most compelling arguments for Christianity, at least the version practiced by Eva and Tom, I've ever read. For each, their faith provides a moral basis for kind action and the strength to deal with adversity. Many of Jesus' teachings about treatment of our fellow men are put into understandable contexts.Stowe has been criticized for the romantic and somewhat melodramatic tone of the book, but she knew for whom she was writing - the white women of 19th century America, for whom the stories of families torn asunder - husbands and wives separated; children taken from their mothers - would resonate at a deep level - deep enough for them to convince their husbands to reject the status quo and do something about abolishing the heinous institution of slavery.Uneven progress over the last 150 years has thoroughly discredited slavery as a sad chapter in American history, though we are left with vestiges of racial prejudice and the ongoing struggle for equal rights for African-Americans. That said, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" still has great value for modern readers as it replaces the idea of slavery as an abstract historical evil with vivid evidence of its human dimensions and costs.Five epic stars for all readers."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I grabbed this book, figuring I would try some of the classics.

Stowe's story is a classic and this CD is one I'm keeping!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"When Harriet Beecher-Stowe published Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852 it sold more copies than any book before, other than the Bible. It became a significant catalyst in the social movements of the time: abolition of slavery, and States' rights. It could be argued that her book was a major cause of the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation. That's one powerful book--especially for fiction.While the book was intended as an illustration of the evils of slavery, it ends up as more--specifically a study in racism with the conclusion that prejudice comes in infinite degrees. Even Harriet herself was prejudice. She occasionally takes the unorthodox approach of interrupting her narrative to preach to the reader, clearly stating her opinion that Blacks were a &quot;degraded race,&quot; but still worthy of humane treatment. As she wends her way through the story and reveals her large and varied cast of characters, she exposes the many forms of discrimination, some more forgiving than her own.She portrays her hero, the old slave, Uncle Tom, as a likeable, caring, Christian man deserving compassion and freedom. She unwittingly coined the Uncle Tom clich&eacute;, that of a complacent and passive black man resigned to his low station in life, kowtowing to white men. But she also delivers us the more savory George Harris, a hot-blooded and intelligent young slave willing to die for his freedom, a man with true &quot;American&quot; virtue. She introduces the reprehensible slave traders and run-away trackers, the brutal plantation owners, Southern apologists and sympathizers, Northern indignation and apathy, and the only color-blind people in her book, the helpful Quakers on the Underground Railway. Most important, she shows the tragic result of slave child ripped from mother, and husband from wife to be &quot;sold down river.&quot; A century and a half later, it's hard to imagine how this could happen.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a prime example of the power of the written word. It divided a nation and changed an institution. Its message remains relevant even today, and still manages to ignite passions. Beyond all that, it's actually one heck of an entertaining story. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I am glad I finally read this novel. It reads well on the Kindle; I mainly used the iTouch app and did not have any problems with the format or text.Of the story: sure, it sounds preachy sometimes. Sure, it has characters that are stereotypes. But the simple language and the occasional melodrama keep the narrative moving forward to include episodes that are very human and very believable. One disappointment was the theme of the angelic white child being cared for by Uncle Tom with little mention of how he might also care deeply for all of the children around him, regardless of race. Despite entreaties to treat all humans equally, there was still an undercurrent of whiter people having greater value and worth than people of color; however, I also understand the novel was directed at a white audience with the intention of changing attitudes and ending slavery. Knowing the history that followed its being published, I am glad the story was written and I feel I have benefitted from reading it. Human beings have far to go in race relations; this novel still has something to offer and should be read if you haven't already done so."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I just want to take a chance to recommend this book to all Americans-it's an integral part of our history and I think it would help any reader better understand our country. We all know about the book and its author, have perhaps read a page or two in our highschool US history textbooks, and have undoubtedly heard the term \\"Uncle Tom\\". But how many of us have actually read it? This was what I was myself wondering when I came across it by chance and absentmindedly threw it into my bag when looking for new books to read at the library a few weeks ago.I'm not sure I have anything to say about this book that other reviewers haven't said, but I just wanted to share how I, like others who read this book, was floored to discover that this book did not consist of a parade of one-dimensional, insulting black stereotypes who were sychophantic and devoted to their unjust masters. That's what we all thought it was and that's because people base their interpretations on the book on popular representations of it-not the actual text.It was actually quite touching, revealing, and amazing in a number of ways. Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge that certainly, Stowe had adopted some of the beliefs of her time-she seemed to think that Anglo-Saxons were \\"naturally\\" colder and Africans \\"naturally\\" more loving and open to religion. Although I do think that is a form of racism, and I reject the idea of qualities \\"inherent\\" to any human group, I think it's important to distinguish that her black characters were not intellectually inferior or lazy or naturally criminal-the most common forms of racist imagining you will find. In fact, she would just as easily subject a mediterranean to the same sort of stereotyping-which is not to excuse it, simply to say it was not a black/white issue. All mainstream ethnography of the 19th century was quite off-track in just about every way and has been currently discredited. But Stowe was advanced beyond many who subscribed to it in a number of ways.Another charge is that her book is melodramatic, and although it is far more sentimental than books we are used to in our own time, there's nothing wrong with that. And there are few things as melodramatic as sons separated from fathers, mothers from daughters, husbands from wives, or as people being whipped and starved to death with no recourse to justice, or as young woman raped and powerless to stop it. Inserting personal emotional comments may not be the style of today, but I think we have a lot to learn from it.Parts of the book will always hold emotional weight and I think it's impossible not to imagine the insight, sensitivity, and bravery of the woman who wrote this book. In many ways she is surprisingly progressive-more so than many supposedly enlightened people today. Her heartrending and realistic descriptions of slave families being separated and put to auction will never lose their power or become dated because that's what really happened. Furthermore, she does a very skillful job of demonstrating time and time again that it doesn't matter if individual \\"masters\\" are benevolent-the fact of powerlessness and lack of independence means that the system itself will always result in vast injustice. Contrary to what some allege, she is not saying that slavery is the same thing as capitalism or \\"wage slavery\\". Although she thinks that the exploitation of impoverished workers (who have no rights) in industrializing England at that time is abhorrent, she has her spokespeople explain that slavery is yet worse because at least these cannot be separated from their family. In fact she is rejecting those-and it is always pro-slavery advocates who made this argument-that say that slavery is \\"no worse\\" and in some cases \\"better\\" than severe urban poverty in industralizing countries, or than the lot of impoverished peasantry in the rest of Europe.The hero himself, Tom, is not an \\"Uncle Tom\\" in our contemporary sense. In fact, he does continually stand up to an abusive \\"master\\"-at the greatest personal cost. What he is, in fact, is a true Christian. It isn't about him believing himself inferior to whites-he certainly does NOT think that they are worth more than him. He is simply a profoundly religious man who will turn the other cheek-but he will NOT compromise with his intensely held morals, either for personal gain or in response to the threats of a violent master. People have here confused a powerful and moving0 interpretation of Christianity with weakness. Tom is actually the strongest character in the book.In addition, the book is not simplistic. The \\"north\\" is not good and the \\"south\\" is not all bad. One of the aspects I really liked is that the north is taken to task for assuming moral superiority the South because of their treatment of blacks when, in fact, in many cases they were on an individual level more racist. St. Clare, one of Tom's \\"good owners\\", is a southern plantation owner who is conflicted because he knows slaveholding is wrong-and he feels no personal disgust toward blacks or any belief that they are inferior. Out of personal weakness he keeps his slaves.In contrast, his yankee cousin Ophelia condemns his slaveholding but has a personal aversion to those of African descent that St. Clare never demonstrates. St. Clare brings her an intelligent but desperately abused slave girl-who later became a racist cartoon in popular representations of the text-and Ophelia discovers that \\"topsy\\" is an incredibly fast learner and capable of anything as long as she's given some love and not treated with disgust.Also, the book's worst character, who sexually exploits his female slaves and drives the others to death, is a yankee. This is Simon Legree.Another interesting aspect of the book is that although Tom is uneducated and speaks in slang, Stowe presented educated, and articulate slaves who had gotten more opportunities than Tom and were able to describe their plight in eloquent and moving words. One of these, George Harris, gives a very strong speech about his right to individual freedom, and is presented as being smarter and more innovative than his master-in fact an inventor of considerable intelligence-who makes his master insecure precisely because he is black AND smarter than him.So it's not a book filled only with \\"simple, corn-bread eating\\" slaves as some would tell you.I think those are all the really important things in the book, except that I was incredibly surprised at how powerful it still is after all these years and what an amazing message of Christian love it carries. Stowe has so much hope that humanity will abandon hatred and distinctions based on color and class-and that message continues to be more important than ever. I'm proud an American wrote such a book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"It will be found shocking to many African Americans (and educational for many Caucasians) to discover that Uncle Tom was the HERO of this classic novel, and not a \\"weakling\\" by any stretch of the imagination. \\"Uncle Tom\\", or its shorter form \\"Tom\\", has become a slanderous term within the African American community and implies a weak and Caucasian-controlled person, when in actuality Uncle Tom was a powerfully moral man who was willing to die for his convictions rather than succumb to the will of his worst oppressors.

What comes into play, though, is that we as a culture today are more demanding on investigative truth, documented truth, of situations described, not just the author's say so. So, although I personally believe in the evil of slavery, if I were a person who was not so convinced, the book could be described as just manufacture of the author's imagination and, therefore, not evidence of any mistreatment of slaves. So readers today could see the book as not convincing at all because it does not present investigative fact. The book tends to work on the emotions, not on the facts. It was effective in Stowe's day, but not as effective today. Also American English has evolved and the English of the book is verbose and dated and, consequently, it interferes with the understanding of the message of the book. In addition, the different understanding of Christian theology today compared to the the understanding in Stowe's day can also be a deterrent to the readability of the book. Christian fundamentalism can interfere with tolerance of any other message trying to be conveyed in a piece of literature."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The Shelby family owns a plantation in Kentucky, and within their plantation system, they own slaves. Yet these slaves see the Shelby's as loving masters. Having financial difficulties causes Mr. Shelby to sell two of his slaves, Tom, known as Uncle Tom by many, and young Harry, son of Eliza, a house slave. When Eliza hears of the plan, she takes Harry and escapes, in the hopes of making it to Canada. She is pursued by the slave trader who purchased her; eventually she is reunited with her husband and the family makes their way to freedom. Meanwhile, Tom is taken away and sold to the St. Clare family. The St. Clares are good to him, particularly the young daughter, Eva. After a series of family tragedies, Tom is sold by Mrs. St. Clare, and becomes the property of Simon Legree, a heartless and cruel master.This book is a difficult read, for various reasons. Written and published in the 1850's, the books subject matter and language both seem so foreign to me. The main theme of the book is the evils of slavery, and the potential redemption of the sin of slavery through Christianity. The book is credited with bring the issue of slavery into the national political spotlight. Part of the evil of slavery, as shown in this book, is the concept of ownership over another human being. The idea that one man can own another, and that the Master-slave relationship trumps all others. I cannot even fathom the idea of ones child or spouse not actually being their own, but instead being merely the property of the master. Women lose their children, men lose their wives, and they are expected to just accept it, because they are slaves.The masters portrayed in the book are varied; some treat the slaves well and eventually free them, while others beat their slaves mercilessly. It makes the subject matter complex, in that some slaves do not appear dissatisfied with their bonds. Similarly, one of the minor characters in the book, Aunt Ophelia, is an abolitionist, yet she appears to me as one of the most racist characters in the book. While she finds slavery to be evil, she also finds the black race to be distasteful. I find the complexity of this character, along with the complexity of the good Master-willing slave relationship, to be compelling, and find that it adds significant depth to the story.The language, I will admit, is a bit difficult. Some of the slave dialect was quite difficult for me to decipher, yet I found it to seem more real that if the slaves had spoken grammatically perfect English. The realistic dialog helped the characters come to life. The language and social morals are so significantly different from our own modern ones that I can see how this book might be intimidating or off putting to many readers, but I urge them to stay with it, and try to find the deeper message in the story.While this book is certainly not without its flaws, I have to respect it, and recommend it, if for no other reason that the important role it played in American history. We may not be proud of this portion of our history, but we have to acknowledge it in order to grow as a nation."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read this book because elsewhere I read that \\"the way slavery was really\\" is debated between this novel's portrayal and that within Gone With the Wind, with Uncle Tom's Cabin being the more widely accepted (and far less pretty) version. What I did not expect was to read a story that moved me so deeply and even strengthened my faith as a Christian. Literary scholars and historians and civil rights advocates all analyze and twist and discuss and corrupt the content to death, and that makes me very sad because I think that many people will hear everything they have to say and miss what I've found.I read it without any preconceptions about what stereotypes exist and the presence of allegory and already fully understanding and believing in the complete equality of all humans, and I fell in love with characters like George, who struggles through life and faith so honestly; and Topsy, who has more to her than she's ever been allowed to see; and of course Tom, whose love of his enemies, faith in God, and hope for his life yet to come can be too easily glazed-over by calling it only \\"Christ-like\\" (though such a description should have a much more powerful implication). I snarled at Simon Legree for his unrelenting cruelty and wanted to slap Mrs. St. Clare for her rampant narcissism. I celebrated Cassy and Emmeline's escape plan and cheered when the Quaker Phineas steps forward to push Tom Loker off the cliff. I looked on Augustine St. Clare and the Shelbys with a cautionary trust due to their obviously kind hearts but commitment and participation in an evil social institution.The scholarly approach is to say that many of the black characters are a heartless and demeaning characterization of black slaves; that Eva's kindness to slaves de-humanizes her; that Phineas pushing Loker demonstrates that Stowe thought only whites were capable of violence; and, most offensively to me, that Tom is, well, an \\"Uncle Tom.\\"I found none of that.

They work, work, work, and his policy was not to get them a doctor when they got sick - just work them to death and buy more. They lived a miserable life and had no hope.

He's treated with respect, both him and his family. He has helped work the Shelby's land for years. Tom loves the Lord, and serves Him all the days of his life. His heart is set on winning others to Jesus and serving the saved and unsaved. He is joyful. He has everything a slave could ask for.But Shelby has some debts to settle. Tom, the most valuable slave on the plantation, is sold, and sent with a trader named Haley to be sold. It is the beginning of one of the greatest adventures ever put to paper. It is an adventure of sorrow, broken hearts, and a love that is more redeeming than any human love.I was greatly impressed by this book. Before I was finished with it, I read in a curriculum that many writers and publishers were very critical of Stowe's work, that many did (and do) not like it. Even then I wasn't quite sure why, but at the end I was confused. How could anyone dislike this book? Even if the story is too sad for you - how can you not at least see the beauty of the characters and how Stowe formed each sentence? It was all careful, taking one step, one breath at a time. The book was like that. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. Methodical, like breathing. And what's the beauty of breathing? It keeps you alive without you even knowing it. In a sense, Uncle Tom's Cabin was like that. Every breath was perfect, I didn't even realize it, but it kept the story going in a way that I will never, ever forget.There isn't much else to say about this story...other than please, I beg you to read this book. I laughed, I cried my eyes out, I went numb with fear and hatred, I was captivated by the love of God.

Through her characters, Eva and Marie, Stowe presented to the audience the vast differences between legalist Christianity and Christianity as a lifestyle. Stowe proved that the legalist Christian did not reflect Biblical standards. The legalist Christian, Marie, treated people with cruelty and disrespect. She thought she was of a higher position being because she was white, and acted as if there was no one more deserving than herself. She did not go out and make disciples, because she was consumed with her social class and would not associate herself with those of a lower class.Eva portrayed authentic Christianity in this novel. She treated everyone fairly and with respect. Eva did not care about social classes and was friends with everyone. She shared her faith with everyone with whom she interacted and thus lived her life as a light for Christ."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The complete title alone will make you want to throw the book across the room. \\"Life among the Lowly\\"? This book was written close to 150 years ago which accounts for it's anachronisms....in part. It's overly sentimental in a gushing way. Stowe exudes prejudice against slaves throughout the book in the midst of fawning over them. Children parade as little adults, that is when they're not being angels. Slaves live to be good slaves. The really odd thing is there was something about her writing that kept me turning pages. There are so many old chestnuts to choke on, the drinking, clowning, obedient slave. There are slave owners who value their slaves so much they're part of the family, they just happen to be owned family members. The opening scene talks frankly, casually as a KY owner discusses selling Tom to a slave dealer, a dealer who was known to sell slaves down south where they would likely be treated worse than in KY. The owner agreed to sell a house slaves child and how best to get the child from her with the least amount of fuss. Of course I always knew our country had slavery but the very day to dayness of this conversation slapped me in the face. And it gets worse the further you read. Stowe made people re-think the slavery issue. For that reason alone there's value in this book, a purpose to read it.

A place where the masters of commerce and the workers were right there together, each keeping an eye on the other, over the shoulders of middle management. A time when the ruling class was within grasping space of the oppressed. Stowe might make you wonder what happened to a people that could create communities in the slave quarters. Places where horror reigned absolute. How these devastated people were able to birth such a person as Uncle Tom. A character who refuses to harm another black person no matter how much the evil slaver tries to force him. This is a work of fiction, but these types did exist. To be called an Uncle Tom is negative in the black communities, but if we had Uncle Toms in the institutions of the U. S. today, black people would not suffer so.

Of course books are supposed to make you feel. -"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"While known for its controversial portrayal of slavery, Uncle Tom's Cabin was actually a relatively tame representation of this type of literature. Stowe only implies the horrors of violence and rape without directly describing them, but I felt that took away from the honesty of the depiction. She did effectively illustrate the tragedy of families being torn apart for a profit and the unfairness of people being treated like objects instead of human beings. Between Stowe's compassionate Christian commentary, and Tom's unwavering devoutness, it was a little too pious for me. There were long stretches that lacked momentum, not to mention the tedium of translating the vernacular of the dialogue. There were aspects I did like about it, like Tom's stay with the St. Clare family (how could any reader not resist Eva's innocence and charm?). There were some very well-written, memorable characters and some incredibly moving scenes, but the book as a whole was a chore.

It is not what I expected. At first it was difficult to read because I found the inhumanity towards our fellow humans very upsetting. It is recommended for 9-12 year-old age. I don't think so. Not with that age group in today's society.It is a fast moving story that covers several persons. I have always know slavery was harmful to the slave. I have come to realize that it is also harmful to the slave owner and to society as a whole. The effects on the slave are clearly apparent. The degrading, the separation of families, and the empty life of servitude. With the slave owner, it degrades them also but many never realized that they were degrading themselves by their brutality.The story also shows mans good side of human being. The story of Eliza, George and their son, run away slaves to Canada and those that helped along the way. The Quakers and many others in the states and Canada where called to do a service and they did, to give aid and comfort to fellow human beings at risk to themselves.Uncle Tom was a Christian. His cabin is where the slaves had their Sunday service. His first 2 owners were kind masters, but it was still slavery. His 3 owner was a brute of a man. Tom was whipped for not whipping a young slave girl that didn't pick enough cotton that day. Tom stood on his belief. At the end he is whipped to death for not revealing where 2 run away slave women where.A short time after finishing the story well it was still fresh in my mind, I listened to a Pastor talk about Obama and how the press had 'forced' Obama to turn on his long time friend, Pastor and spiritual leader the Rev. Wright. My thought, Obama could never be called an Uncle Tom, a man who died protecting to other people. Just a little bit of criticism and Obama rejected his friend.This book was not at all what I expected. I had heard about this book all my life.

The edition was inexpensive and easily affordable for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"No work of fictional literature changed the path of American history more than Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. It pleaded for our nation to face its demons and ultimately thrust it into the Civil War.It is unfathomable to think that a country capable of such horrors would one day elect a black man as President. But, it has. And without this piece of literature, it may not have been possible."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book makes you gasp, cry, and have occasional tearful smiles while you read this story that shows you the unjust of slavery.

A must-read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I heard so much about this book when I was growing up and how it was so inflammatory, but I didn't find it anything of the kind. It really did paint a loving relationship between many masters and their slaves, and the cruel masters were not as prevalent as abolitionists would have you believe. It did discuss the viewpoint that many had that blacks were less than whites in intelligence and ability but also showed blacks who had remarkable abilities (like Uncle Tom). It wasn't a \\"must read until done book\\", but it was a \\"I really would like to know what's next so need to make a little time so I can finish this\\" book.

It has been by far one of the best books I've ever read. It is my understanding that this book was instrumental in the cessation of slavery in the South. If you did not read the book while in school it is definitely worth reading as an adult. This was an important part of our history that everyone should learn about."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I read Uncle Tom's Cabin several years ago and now I am reading it again. I love classic books, but sometimes I find them difficult to understand. However, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote in a way that is pretty much easy reading. While this is a long book, I am glad that it was not edited like a lot of modern books are. There is such a depth to this book that I believe will touch anyone's heart. Slavery is so cruel, and I am glad this book was written to bring to light many different sides of slavery. Since slavery is still going on today in many different countries, I suggest reading this. It is good to see different views. Different reactions. This book references Scripture a lot and sometimes the characters resemble those found in the Bible. I feel comfortable reading this book aloud."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This was one of those books that I didn't end up having to read in school, so once I got my Kindle and saw it was free, I figured \\"eh, I'll download it\\" and didn't think on it much after that.One day, I randomly decided to read it, and I am so glad I did.Some of it gets a little preachy--and I mean that literally, there is a LOT of Christianity in this book--but that's understandable in context, both story-wise and because of the period in history this was written.Some typos in the Kindle version, but nothing I couldn't get past."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Growing up I became aware of the atrocities that mankind can visit upon his brethren because of Harriet Beecher Stowe's book.

The sad commentary about forced slavery is that in 2011 it still exits in some quarters of the world."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"First Published in 1852.Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) sat down to write a book that would show the United States the evils of slavery. She wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly in response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, at the urging of her sister-in-law. She succeeded in fueling the debate over slavery and she pointed a finger of shame at the slave owners and at America as a whole.It created a national sensation. Within ten years, it sold two million copies, making it the best-selling novel of all time in the United States, in proportion to population, according to noted Civil War historian James M. McPherson. The book was so controversial and so powerful that there were attempts to ban it in some parts of the South. Pro-slavery authors attempted to counter the book with their own books with titles like Uncle Robin in His Cabin in Virginia and Uncle Tom Without One in Boston in an attempt to show that African Americans were better off in slavery. Abraham Lincoln reportedly acknowledged the impact of her novel when he meet Harriett Beecher Stowe in 1862 and quipped, \\"So, you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war.\\"Stowe uses two plot devices to successfully make her case about the evils of slavery. The first is the theme of the splitting apart of slave families and the slave-owning families throughout the course of the book. The second is Uncle Tom's unwavering adherence to Christian principles. The book was written to persuade Christians of the Second Great Awakening that slavery was a great evil that should be eliminated. The reader is continually assaulted with images and exhortations designed to shame the heart of a nineteenth century Christian into action.Stowe chose to focus on the rending of slave families and the abuse heaped upon the devout Christian, Uncle Tom, for good reason. If she had focused on the hard, forced labor of slaves in the field there would have been little sympathy. This was an era in which nearly everyone worked long, hard hours and many people worked for others and felt that they were forced to work or starve. For example, historian Harry L. Watson noted that the famed \\"Lowell Girls\\" of New England were forced to live in company-owned boarding houses and worked an average of 73 hours per week.If she had made a straight argument about the basic immorality of one human being owning another, she probably would not have swayed many hearts. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney summed up the feelings of many people in the Dred Scott decision when he said that African Americans were \\"of an inferior order...so far inferior, that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect.\\"I some states, it was even against the law for African Americans to reside within the state. In Indiana, for example, the 1851 state constitution made it illegal for African Americans to move into the state and fined anyone who hired them or encouraged them to remain in the state. The proceeds of those fines were put into a fund to re-settle African Americans to colonies in Africa.Rather than writing an essay or an editorial that lays out the antislavery argument, Stowe uses a much more effective method - she introduces her readers to the slaves themselves and inflicts the horrors of slavery upon these slaves. The reader is forced to get to know slaves as people (undoubtedly a rare occurrence for Northern whites) and then witness the rending of their families, their struggles for dignity, their flights for freedom and terrible physical abuse.From the very beginning of her novel, Stowe shows the fearful prospect that faced all slave families - the selling away of family members. The reader is shown, through these fictional characters, the impact of the selling away of a family member. The reader is witness to a slave auction in which a worn-out old woman begs to be sold along with her only remaining child.The fear of being sold away was not just restricted to cruel or greedy masters. Kindly masters could have financial troubles and be forced to break apart families. In what is probably the most famous scene in Uncle Tom's Cabin, the readers follows an escaping slave named Eliza as she flees a loving mistress in the middle of winter so that her only child will not be sold away to help cover family debts. Eliza is so desperate to escape the runaway slave hunters that she flees across ice flows of the Ohio River.The majority of the book deals with the title character, Uncle Tom, a slave sold away from his family and friends (including the master's son) in order to pay a debt. Uncle Tom's desire to return to his home in Kentucky is a constant throughout the book. The reader also knows that he would not have suffered his awful death if he had not been sold away from his home and family. By making fully developed characters of the slaves, Stowe shows that the reality of slave life was not like the comments of the white woman at the slave auction. She is asked,\\"'Suppose, ma'am, your two children, there, should be taken from you, and sold?'\\"and she answers:\\"'We can't reason from our feelings to those of this class of person.'\\"Stowe attacks that attitude by showing how \\"this class of person\\" would respond to forced separation from a child, and it was no different than the response of any other class of person.Stowe takes us on a tour of the South by way of the slave Uncle Tom. He sees good masters and bad ones. He lives in a mansion (as a slave, of course) and works in the most horrible conditions on a desolate plantation. Through it all, Uncle Tom is a perfect Christian. He is intended to be this way. He never deviates from the ideals of the Christian faith. He shares food while he is nearly starving. He rescues a drowning child while he is being shipped down the Mississippi to be auctioned and he does not complain when his hymn book is taken from him and his faith is ridiculed. Uncle Tom does not take freedom when it is offered by his master in New Orleans because he is concerned about the condition of his master's soul and wants to make sure he becomes a Christian. Tom even forgives the master who orders him beaten to death and the slaves who gladly comply with his commands. Stowe makes him an unbelievably perfect Christian, even a saint. She does this so that she can demonstrate the cruelty of slavery. If it can destroy this man who has done nothing wrong, how can anyone survive it? It screams at the consciences of the Christians who let this situation continue and questions the Christianity of the Slave-owning class.Harriett Beecher Stowe's goal was to reach out to touch the heart of America and demonstrate the evils of slavery. Coming from a family of evangelists, she created the character of Uncle Tom to reach out to Christians of the Second Great Awakening. He may have been a slave, but he was also a fellow Christian who lived the Christian ideals. If the readers could not sympathize with a slave or a black man, they could identify with his religious ideals and his faith. Suddenly, people who felt nothing for the plight of the slaves could see the evils of slavery.Truly an American classic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I'm glad I read this. Oh, it wasn't all that fun to read- it dragged on quite a bit, and the author's style of writing was frustrating. The story was often slow. Stowe was a devout Christian, and she often preaches directly to the reader; hardly a page goes by when she is not invoking Christ's name or quoting from the bible. Her prose is sensationalized and overwrought. Still, I was drawn in by the story to a certain extent. Also, I feel I learned a lot about slavery and about what it was like to live in a society that held slaves.The story focuses not only on Tom, but also on many of the other people he came in contact with. Often the focus is taken entirely off Tom as we follow the stories of the more minor characters. The book seems to very accurately portray society in the years before the Civil War. Many of the incidents Stowe describes really happened and the characters were based on people she either knew or knew of. The book is pretty straightforward in its condemnation of slavery, but I liked how Stowe portrayed so many different groups of people and showed both the good and bad in each group. There are decent slaveholders and evil ones, there are bad Christians and good ones, and racists exist even in the North. No group of people is portrayed as perfect or ideal, although slavery as an institution is condemned in the strongest possible terms and Tom is a true Christ figure who never falters in his goodness and courage. Among the slaves themselves, there are some who are noble and some who are just as cruel and oppressive as their masters.This book should be read by everyone, not because it is enjoyable or well written (I feel that it isn't) but because it reveals so much about how our country once was and was so historically significant."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I decided to read this book with quite a bit of trepidation, maybe even with a sense of duty to get it \\"over with\\". My impression of the book prior to reading it was that it would show slavery in a bad light, but by doing so would portray Uncle Tom and others as subserviant, happy creatures and the purpose of ending slavery would be hardly different than to stop being mean to a dog. Well, I was certainly wrong about that! It's just a fantastic book. Sure, there are some nitpicks that could be made, such as the holy character of Eva (about as subtle as a sledgehammer), but on the whole it is a page turner. I also was expecting the language to be a barrier in that it was written 160 years ago, but that was not the case at all. There is some formality to the language, but that is often used to convey sarcasm by Stowe, something very familiar to modern readers.It is entirely understandable why Uncle Tom was a phenomenon for decades. It is a book that takes you to a different world than most readers (even then) had experienced. I'm surprised that this book hasn't been made into a movie--then again the scrutiny of the project would be overwhelming, so I guess I am not so surprised after all. One last thing, like many reviewers I had a completely different idea of what Uncle Tom the character would be like. It's odd how culture works sometimes. The term of (being an) \\"Uncle Tom\\" is almost the complete opposite of the actual character."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This was such an amazing book! I can only imagine what black people of that day went thru, and because of Harriet Beecher Stowe's written account, though fictional, I was able to better realize some of their agony.

Their bravery and persistence and endurance beyond what any human should have to endure awes and inspires me. This book is interesting in that the author is able to write, it seems, in the diction from the time period, which adds to the authenticity and the reading experience. It can sometimes get hard to follow, though. The author also uses the \\"trick\\" of speaking directly to the reader at times when she wants to \\"instruct\\" or impress something upon the reader. At first it was impressive, then a little tiresome. Love the period details and the rich character development through mostly dialogue."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"It was interesting to reread this novel. As a teenager reading this many years ago, I didn't appreciate the strong anti-slavery stance. It showed the suffering of the slaves especially because of their separation from their families, and clearly described the beliefs of the slave owners, the slave sellers, and the anti-slavery movement.Though a bit preachy at times, it was a better read than most nonfictional accounts of slavery.Many of the characters make you want to root for them to get their freedom."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"How I ever got out of high school & college without being required to read this I will never know. But better late than never. It was perfect. Slavery is wrong no matter how kind the master.

SLAVERY WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL. I was surprised to find out that this book supported slavery. Of course, you have to wade through the melodrama and Christian speechifying -- about 95% of the book -- to get at Ms Stowe's thesis, but once you do it becomes clear. To Ms Stowe, slavery and capitalism are just different manifestations of evil human greed (St. Claire's speech, pp 239-241 in my edition). Old slavers who whipped their charges to death must be smiling now, knowing that they're being compared to the Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Bill Gates.Ms Stowe deems many factors that separate capitalism and slavery to be irrelevant. The fact that under capitalism families weren't separated is irrelevant. The fact that people could emigrate freely is also irrelevant. The fact that people were not forced off their farms and into the cities is irrelevant. The fact that proletariat, even in Ms Stowe's day, were protected by labor laws is irrelevant. The fact that life expectancy for the proletariat increased vis &agrave; vis farmers is irrelevant. The fact that the proletariat were not chosen for racist reasons is irrelevant. The fact that a worker could become an entrepreneur and eventually a capitalist is also irrelevant.2. CHRISTIANITY DOESN'T CONDEMN SLAVERY. Ms Stowe does a fine job (inadvertently) of showing that Christianity contains doctrine that supports slavery, and no doctrine that outright condemns it.3. AMERICA IS FOR AMERICAN INDIANS. Ms Stowe states at the end of chapter 43 that Topsy, after receiving a decent Christian upbringing, became a teacher in \\"her own country\\" -- Africa. Ms Stowe believes that Africa is Topsy's country because she is descended from Africans, and conversely that the United States is not Topsy's country. Of course, if one were to apply the same logic to everyone in the U.S., only native Americans would pass the test.

Perhaps too many sermons and extra words but the important points are there and brought out for all to see."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was a book I KNEW about, but only as a historical artifact--a story that helped ignite the Civil War....but little else. The trivial fact that it was the first American novel to sell 1,000,000 copies was tucked away in my mind, and the disparaging label of someone being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\" was about the extent of my knowledge of Stowe's masterpiece.Now, having read the entire book, I am ashamed at having never taken the time before. The power in the narrative and the characters in the story is enough to keep you turning the pages to see what happens next! To my surprise, even though it is more than 150 years old, it was not difficult to understand...UTC essentially tells two stories at once--two slaves are set to be sold from a Kentucky plantation/farm they have lived all their lives. One is the older, well-respected Uncle Tom, and the other is the young, pretty Eliza. Tom accepts his fate, confident in his faith that God will protect him. Eliza, fearful of losing her child (with good reason) decides to run away to Ohio, where she hopes to find freedom.Along the way, both of these good souls have trials and tribulations...times of fear, hope, friendships and pain. Nothing is guaranteed for them....and sometimes their travels through life are blessed, and sometimes they are shook by sudden, unexpected pain.Tom's journey from Kentucky is primarily south; to a land where generally slaves are subject to much rougher conditions than in his native border state. Eliza, of course, is going north to Ohio, and eventually, she hopes, to Canada. But fugitive slaves are still hunted in Ohio, so there are no guarantees.The most difficult part of the reading for me was getting acclimated to the style in which Stowe portrays the conversation of the slaves. Because the language is more coarse, uneducated and casual, it took a little while to completely understand what a slave was saying. At times, I had to stop and \\"sound out\\" what the words were, just to get the jist of what was meant. After a little while, though, this became easier.The most surprising aspect of the story...and perhaps this explains the current absence of Stowe's novel in the modern mind...was the unambiguous and unapologetic Christian timber replete throughout the pages. Stowe rightfully believed that true Christianity did not endorse the idea of one man being the property of another. In her day, some religious leaders excused slavery in the states by creating contrived arguments supposedly developed from the Bible. Stowe challenges those preposterous notions headon!UTC is filled with direct references to Scripture and Christian hymns. Even one of the most irreligious characters, a one-time owner of Tom, Augustine St. Clare, is able to see how the slave trade is altogether UN-Christian, though he also finds it difficult to give up his \\"servants\\".The deeply religious Quakers, who help run the fugitive slaves to freedom, are also portrayed as true followers of Jesus. Most touching is how they even tend to the injuries of an evil bounty hunter--a man who would have killed them if it meant recapturing a slave.Uncle Tom's faith is described in great detail, and his ability to endure in times of want reminds one of the Old Testament story of Job. He strives to maintain trust in his Savior.My review ends here; to give away the ending might discourage someone from picking up the story and reading it for themselves. The time spent absorbing Stowe's novel is well-spent. One can fully understand how it shook the conscience of the nation in the 1850s."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I think it would make an excellent movie or mini-series, if done correctly. This edition is the unabridged text, and it still resonates today as it did when first written in 1852. Sure, the N-word might be offensive, but no work of literature needs to be edited to conform to people's tastes, let alone a monumental achievement such as this 695-page novel. I highly recommend this novel.I am curious about one thing, though: Why did Mrs. Stowe only provide the initial letters of places and persons instead of spelling out the names?

This novel greatly contributed to the start of the Civil War and the anti-slavery or abolitionist movement.

There is an element of fantasy to the young, blonde, child who dies, and as is with many, many current television shows, the \\"gifted\\" are always Caucasian. That fact, in and of itself, doesn't allow for the development of most of the black characters in the book. However, on the positive side, Ms. Beecher-Stowe seems a steadfast abolitionist, of sorts, and the messages of Love, and Hope, and Equality (fairness), ring loudly, and she takes great pain to \\"detail\\" the negativity that prevents the Declaration Of Independence from meeting it's mission. As a side note: It was unfortunately that Abraham Lincoln died shortly after the end of the Civil War, as the decision as to what to do with Blacks had not been fully thought out, with no chance of actualization! ere in 2012, the decision as to what to do with Blacks, still has not been made!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have'nt read this book yet but i am really looking forward to it. i will probobaly type more stuff later when i finish this book. i hope i will like it. :)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had heard of this book all my life, but never saw it anywhere and always wondered about it. I knew the term \\"uncle Tom\\" is derogaroty (or was, 30 years ago)but who knew what/who it was referring to? Finally I bought a copy and read it cover to cover in a couple days. It's an amazing tale of the time of slavery, and I half expected not to like it, but I really did. It was riviting and heart wrenching and also just a great story, if extremely disturbing. If you think, like I did, that you might not like it because it was written 150 years ago, don't worry.

Although it measures up to its anti-slavery theme, it has another major theme which is, \\"No matter what circumstances you find yourself, the important things in life are knowing Jesus and treating other people properly.\\" Uncle Tom reflects his faith in good times and in bad, even when facing death. Although the book is fiction, Harriet Beecher Stowe reveals in her closing remarks, that all of the story-lines are true accounts of real people that she learned either 1st or 2nd hand.

Great condition!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book was the most popular protest novel against slavery of its time and the play adaption lived on for almost a century after its writing. It is the only work of fiction that Malcolm X read when he was educating himself. African American Studies professors will use motiffs from this book as a common understanding.It's still not a very good book. Stereotypical characterizations, badly drawn characters and an overall melodrama are good points. I will give some credence to the fact that a modern reader will be spoiled by today's literature and look for it in classic literature.However, the main weakness is what is always considered the strength of this book. It's preachiness had its place in the history of our country and there are many other books saying the same thing, but why should I have to read over 400 pages to learn that slavery is bad. It's kind of a given in this day and age - especially the slavery that happened in the American South which had that extra racism dimension.The only reason why I am giving this book 3 stars is because I didn't finish it (skimmed it after the first 100 pages) and there might be something worthwhile later on the book. But as Shaw said &quot;you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten&quot;."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Throughout history, few books have garnered more controversy than Harriet Beecher Stowe's UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. When he met Mrs. Stowe in 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed, \\"So you're the little woman that wrote the book started this great war.\\" That may be a bit of an overstatement, but the book certainly had enormous social and political consequences.In the social structure that has evolved since the emancipation of slaves in this country, few labels have a more derogatory intent to the black person than being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\". We hear it repeatedly used to indicate a black person who chooses not to follow in lockstep with the direction of radical black anarchist leaders. For the life of me, I can't grasp that concept. What greater compliment than to be referred to as a man who faced such immense adversity yet who remained steadfast in his faith.I realize the argument is that Tom did as he was told and refused to stand up for himself, but that argument only portrays the shallowness of a society that has been more and more anti-Christian as time goes by. Those who would make that argument fail to see the strength and courage it takes for a true Christian to resist temptation and consistently put personal challenge into the Lord's hands.This book, today, receives a tremendous amount of criticism for Stowe's constant Christian \\"preaching\\" throughout the book. Stowe, born in 1811, is of the founding daughter generation. Her strong portrayal of Christian virtue is yet another reminder that America was founded on Christian principles. People today, in our society where Christianity is under constant criticism, hate to admit that America once was, and was intended to be, a Christian nation. At the time of its publishing, Stowe's work was criticized for being biased towards anti-slavery, but was never criticized for its expression of Christian virtues.For me, and I'm sure others, the book does have one great flaw. Mrs. Stowe was well known for accurately depicting the vernacular of a particular region. While that may add authenticity to a story, it also creates a painfully tedious read. That is the case here. This is not a book that most people could pick up and read at once. For me, it was a long daily process of 10-20 pages at a time.Here is an example of what I'm referring to;\\"I'm thinkin' my old man won't know de boys and de baby. Lor'! she's de biggest gal, now, -good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She's out to the house, now, watchin' de hoe-cake. I's got jist de very patern my old man liked so much a bakin'. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin' he was took off. Lord bless us! How I felt, dat ar mornin'!\\"I'm sure there are readers who appreciate such authenticity, but for me, and I'm sure untold masses of high-school students who once found this on their \\"required reading\\" list, that is just plain tedious. My only other knock on the book is the \\"happily ever after\\" ending which Stowe gave to several of the main characters. For those once trapped in the bondage of slavery, I don't believe too many of them lived out that kind of scenario.That said, if you've not read this book, do so. Find a way struggle through it. Stowe gives portrayals of both sides of the slavery coin. By that I mean, she managed to portray that many slave owners considered their slaves as family members and treated them with respect and kindness, while there were also other owners who viewed slaves as mere possessions to be abused and defiled.This book may not have started the Civil War, but it most certainly had a profound effect upon society like few books in history have ever had. That fact, in and of itself, makes this book a must read for everyone.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"It's very good if you want to go back on history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut in 1811 and four years later her mother died leaving hear older sister, Catherine, to raise her. Catherine founded a college in Hartford, where Stowe received her education, and later became a teacher at the school. Stowe married Calvin Stowe, a minister at her father's seminary college, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Living there for eighteen years, Stowe was unconsciously gathering data and impressions about slavery. This information was the main influence for Uncle Tom's Cabin. This book is historical fiction, based on Stowe's real life experiences with slavery. &quot;The portrayal of slavery and its effects on families and on individuals is gut-wrenching - when Uncle Tom has to leave his family, and when Eliza may lose little Harry, one feels utterly desolate.&quot; . The way you feel when you finally realize, after straightening out all the details in your mind, that Uncle Tom has to leave his family and that Eliza may lose her son. This was the best part of the book, as you can see illustrated in two lines. Uncle Tom's Cabin has been deemed unbearably boring by many of its readers including myself. &quot;...absolutely tedious, over-wrought--morality tale one of those books they make you analyze to death in English class. not worth the money.&quot; That is not to say that it is a bad book, or that the reason for writing it is unjust and that it doesn't make any sense, I am just referring to the extensive detail used in creating, the sometimes, overly vivid scenes. The book could have been two-hundred pages long and still gotten it's point across just as well, or maybe even better. I didn't like the book, it was too long and drawn out, personally I like a writer to just say what they mean and not try to make you think something when they refer to something else. This book had a lot of religious reference, but it wasn't necessary for you to understand all of them because it was part of Uncle Tom's character to be somewhat of a preacher. One review I read stated that from reading this book, the reviewer discovered that this book supported slavery. I didn't get this impression at all. What I saw was that many slave owners were actually very nice to their slaves. The only reason for slavery was cheap labor, many plantations couldn't have survived without slavery, but for the slave owners to keep their slaves in line and from running away they had to develop a friendly relationship just as many managers do with their employees today. I saw this friendly relationship in almost all of the slave owners in the novel. You will see this specifically when Uncle Tom finds out he has to leave the Shelby plantation, he says he wants to be loyal to his &quot;Mas'r&quot;. So this book is not supporting slavery, it is just saying that all the slave owners weren't bad. All in all Uncle Tom's Cabin was not my favorite book and I wouldn't tell anyone to read it, but you may like it. It was too long and had too much detail much like a Charles Dickens novel except not quite as bad. The rating I would give this book on a scale of one to ten on the plot of the book is an eight maybe even as far as a nine. However, if I rated it on how well it kept my interest I would probably say a one or two, any Charles Dickens books being in the negative numbers. So in all finality, the book has its ups and downs, but it is still not as bad as a Charles Dickens novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book is an entire work of fiction by a person claiming it to be first hand experience.

This book also talks of compassion and respect that some owners of slaves had for their slaves. It does make one reflect about how we all treat each other. A really sad and good book"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written in 1850 when America was in the middle of a period of religious fervor with fire and brimstone preaching common. Among those leading this movement was Lyman Beecher, father of both Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher (see my review of his biography The Most Famous Man in America)Transcendentalism was in flower, telling Americans that there was truth to be found in an emotional relationship to the nature and the senses. Sentimentality was at a peak. The Civil War years dripped with it as much as they did with blood.Revivals were commonly held during which a Protestant Christian preacher would build up the emotional state of the crowd until it reached an almost orgasmic state. The kind of shallow effort at this that we see on TV these days gives no hint of the depth of passion experienced at these revivals when people could temporarily lose their minds in contemplation of the divine.Uncle Tom's Cabin is certainly an effort against slavery but reading it reminded me of a revival. The plot starts out on a farm in Kentucky where the slaves are well treated by the owner. Then as the novel develops, the emotional intensity does as well until, in the end, we have a Christ-like figure (Uncle Tom) offering up his soul and asking forgiveness for the evil Simon Legree even as Legree is beating him to death. Along the way, Biblical passages become more frequently inserted in the text. The reader is aroused to a peak of moral indignation - how could such a barbaric system exist! How could any Christian allow it to continue?This technique worked magic on the sensibilities of the time. This book was a huge bestseller that virtually everyone (in the North) had read within a year of publication. It is filled with characters that represent every point of view on the issue of slavery, pro and con. It frequently mentions the Fugitive Slave Act that required Northerners to help apprehend and return escaped slaves, a bitter pill for the North to swallow.Stowe is eager to promote Christianity as one would expect from someone with her upbringing. A repeated scene is of a character asking how God could be so cruel, absent or indifferent. In response a character will talk of the damnation that awaits those who do evil while paradise awaits the good. This fear of the Judgment Day is as central to the book as slavery and would appeal to religious readers while attempting to confound unbelievers.Stowe's characterizations range from the realistic, such as Augustine St. Clare and his wife Marie, to others who seem either simple-minded (almost all the black characters) or unbelievably righteous as is Eva, the fair haired and frail child who embodies virtue, self-effacement and goodness, played against the willful black Topsy who has no known relatives and claims she was never born.To a modern reader some of the dialog is almost nauseating in self-righteousness and piety but the plot is carried along seamlessly with the single exception of a short chapter near the end that serves to quickly jump to Canada to bring the reader up to date on escaped slaves Eliza and George, otherwise almost forgotten after being left in limbo early in the book.Black characters are almost cartoons and racial characterizations abound - \\"wooly headed\\", \\"sons of Afric\\", etc. It's clear that though Stowe believes blacks are just as human as whites, they are on a lower level mentally. For her time, even this was a big advance. It's easy to see how African-Americans can use the name \\"uncle tom\\" in a derogatory way - since Tom turns the other cheek with a regularity and predictability that meekly accepts the way things are.The book, like Christianity, is riven in this way. If Heaven is the only thing that matters then why should anyone care how people treat each other in this world? Why not just take things on the chin and smile until your time is up?Uncle Tom's Cabin is a good read. Though almost as verbose as the novels of Dickens, it should be no problem for modern readers. Like most classics, everyone has heard of it but too few have read it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with the novel. Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"By the time I had got to page 47 I was hooked!I found the language a little slower to read than normal, having to get used to the speech of the slaves being written as it sounded, but I actually got to quite like that.Harriet Beecher Stowe writes as if she's the narrator and I could almost see her at the side of the stage inviting us to see the next scene.As we follow the lives of Uncle Tom, Eliza and George, the many people they encounter and whose lives they touch, and whose lives touched them, I cried and I smiled and I felt very humble. This is a very moving book yet oddly without being sentimental and that is to the author's credit. She writes well and makes every character very real and their situations both heartwrenching yet uplifting. A book that not only gives a valuble insight into life at the time in 'Kentuck' and what it was like to be 'sold down the river'....but one that gave me a hope and uplifting that I'd like to stay with me for some time to come."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is the best book I have read during the first 34 years of my life. Tom, the symbolic messiah, manifests hope, love, patience and perseverance. He shares his soul unselfishly with all who will receive. He is quite possibly the strongest person of character I have encountered. In regards to the books commentary on slavery: it was a strong abolitionist paper in the 1850s, but now it is considered racist by some. However, I believer the characterization of African Americans was much kinder in this book than by the media and society as a whole now."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A truly inspiring story, told with humour, with keen insight, and passionate indignation at the plight of slaves in the United States. Earnestly demonstrating the evils of slavery, Stowe introduces us to a plethora of characters, all powerfully and humanly realized. Uncle Tom, Eliza, Topsey, Miss Ophelia, George, Simon Legree all come alive for us, and their triumphs and sufferings are all the more poignant for it. Stowe approaches the subject realistically. She never once makes clumsy generalizations - every situation between slave and master, and between environment and slave is evaluated according to its individual circumstances. One uniform idea emerges, however, and that is the slavery is morally wrong, and is therefore destructive, not only to the dignity, the integrity, and the very soul of the slaves themselves, but also to those who own them. The argument Stowe makes for this idea is as intelligent as it is powerful.The book has its flaws. The plot clearly indicates its origins as a serial, and Stowe does tend to belabour her point needlessly in some passages. Still, these flaws do little to hinder the flow of this powerful narrative. (5/5)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the best American novels written to date. It is a wonderful fictional tale about two slaves, Eliza and Tom, who follow two very different paths during their lives as slaves. They both live in Kentucky under the same master. As their master goes in to debt, he is forced to sell them to a slave trader. Fearful of loosing her child, Eliza takes the very dangerous path and runs away with fellow slaves leading to a bloody skirmish with a group of drunken bounty hunters. Tom on the other hand, chooses to follow his master's orders and get sold into the Deep South. By following his faith in God he believes God will guide hi through his life as a slave. Harriet Beecher Stowe uses her descriptive style of writing to capture the reader's imagination, and show them the horrors of slavery. One interesting topic the author brings up all throughout the novel is the idea of how can a southern slave holder feel right even after they have read the bible and how their slaves know passages that describe their right to freedom. Another great thing the author does in this novel is give a great ending by telling what happened to each of the different characters after they have ended their lives as slaves. I think this book is a classic American novel, however I believe its message is shallow and cannot compare to that of the Jungle's or even or some of Jack London's or John Steinbeck's works. For these reasons I giving Uncle Tom's Cabin a 4.5, but it still deserves five stars. This book is a must buy for every American."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Never has a fiction book brought me to anger, laughter, sadness, joy and tears as this book did when I first read it 10 years ago. 10 years later, I am still feeling the emotional impact of the story.This book is not only about slavery; it's about the relationships between people, the psychological mind of a person who has been taught that they cannot think, the innocent wisdom of children.The novel is an easy read. The themes are not simple nor are they easy to digest for some but the emotional power of the story truly carries the reader through a historical whirlwind of justice and ethics."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I wasn't going to read it because of the bad reviews I read about it.

Well Done Harriet!!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This year I have dedicated myself into reading more. This was the third novel I read. I was very happy to read this one. It was a very moving novel. I recommend this novel to all. Both for historical value and spiritual. (even though this book is fiction, similar stuff did happen in those times. that is why I say historical value) It was beautifully written as well. She took me in their world. By far one of the best novels I ever read, if not the very best. I can't wait to read this book again."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have, at long last, read this classic. You must remember that Mrs. Stowe uses the language that was common at the time. It is part of the story and how one group of people viewed another group of people.This story highlights the humanity of all people, regardless of race, creed, or culture. For me, the brutality of the bad owners really came alive. The fact that a slave owner could do anything he wanted with a female slave was brought home to me. I never really thought about it before. Now, I think I will never forget it.A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I had total misconceptions about this book. I assumed that it was a boring collegiate assignment that was probably going to read and feel so outdated and boring, that it would have no merit to me. I was so wrong. I wish I had not made such false assumptions about this book...as I was stunned at the Christian influence and inspiration in this story. Truly an inspiring story of character and faith. As someone else mentioned, the misnomer of \\"Uncle Tom\\" being a bad thing is totally incorrect. Uncle Tom is a hero. I wish I had not waited until I was 50 years old to read this. It has much to teach, so read it early and read it often. It provoked much meditation and contemplation, which is I'm sure, what the author hoped for. She accomplished it. This will be in my treasured books list."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"the first book i have read on kindle. i have always wanted to read it now finally have.

It gives you an insight into the plight of the slaves.You cant help wanting a happy ending for each of the characters"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I admit it, I got this because it was free and I had a brand new Kindle. I had never read it, and I thought, it's free, why not get it.But wow, was I surprised when I started to read it! I thought it would be dry and dull, like many of the books we were forced to read in school, but that is not what I found at all. The writing style is accessible even today, it is easy to read and fast-paced, and drew me in from the very beginning. I am sorry I missed this is school, but glad in a way because I will get more out of it now as an adult. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is a thought-provoking story, perfect for discussion and book groups. The moral issues are undeniable. Yet it is all that and a great read as well.You may have missed this in school, but don't miss it now! I give this a heart-felt 5 stars, and hope everyone will read it. It is a piece of our nation's history, and should be remembered by all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Not having read Ms. Stowe's classic until my mid-50s, I now better understand the powerful impact her novel has had on our society. I always wondered about the derogatory label \\"Uncle Tom\\" and now find the negative connotation confusing. The title character exhibits uncommon courage while also showing frustrating meekness. I was surprised the author clearly laid the blame for slavery upon the heads of Northerners and Southerners alike."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book has to be read to understand the impact it had on America. Words alone cannot describe the emotions one feels when reading it"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, is an intriguing, influential, and enlightening novel. This novel truly radiates the unfairness and injustice of slavery.The characters are very important to the theme and ideas of the novel. Most all of them, especially the main charcter, Uncle Tom, reaches moral reconciliation or a spiritual reassessment, at one point in their lives. Stowe's purpose and ideas presented in this novel inform the readers that slavery is wrong and immoral. Stowe's novel leaves us with a lasting impression, and the idea that God is the only one who can truly make right, the wrong of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book paints a clear picture of the forces behind slavery. It illuminates the way that the human race has justified slavery, not just the slavery of Africans in America. Part of what makes this book so wonderful, is that it fits most people. Stowe works on both the emotional and logical level to combat slavery. I believe that all Americans should read this book to not only get an insight into a gruesome part of American history, but to also realize how much we justify our actions without listening to our conscience."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The views of the cult of True Womanhood began in the 1820s and 30s as an ideology to create a contentedness for the woman in her domestic sphere. Uncle Tom's Cabin provides a humorous, yet true, take on womanly conduct, both correct and incorrect. Stowe takes the reader through a delightfully accurate historical path that diagrams not only relations between the races, but between the sexes as well. A must have for any well-read library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Our book club decided to read some old classics and we were all surprised to find that none of our members had read Uncle Tom's Cabin, except a French woman who had read it in school in French! A little hard to get into with the style of writing and the dialog, it soon became a real page-turner for me as I got caught up in the story and the characters. Stowe paints a very interesting picture of the times, and it provoked one of the best discussions that our book club has had. No wonder this book was a best seller, both in the US and Europe. Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"When I picked up this book at my school library, I was a little worried that it would be boring and hard to follow. I'm a teenager: what do I know about classics? But we were studying the Civil War in history so I thought I'd give it a try.I was amazed at how gripping the plot was, and how awesome the characters were. True, there were some very 2-D people, but you've got to give Ms. Stowe credit for the angles she took on about slavery.People who aren't Biblical might think the book is too preachy and stale, but I thought it had wisdom that would still be considered wise today.For being an old book, it's really something."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This book was incredible. Yes it can be racist, and extremist at times, but at it's core you're reading a piece of history. For a book to sell 300,000 copies during it's original publication in the mid 19th century is astounding. You're reading a book that had a part in the Civil War, the bloodiest war of our history. I did find while reading it that many parallels can be made between this book and \\"Black Beauty\\". Coincidence? Perhaps, but worth looking at in a review, or report. To read this and think that America permitted this slavery to go on for years, would be enough to disgust anyone. America's history is a bloody one, one that we need to remember, and reading this book will make you appriciate your freedom now, as an American. Please do keep in mind however, the slave trade is still going not to America, but places in Europe and Asia, even with the U.N outlawing it in 1953. I just cannot say how much this book made me think about the world past and present. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the 1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave, Tom. Uncle Toms Cabin shows you the hardships slaves went through to not get a beating from their master, though many endured that anyway. It opened my eyes to the reality of slavery, and the severity of it all. The book not only talks about slavery, but it also addresses the issue of religion. Although I did not get a chance to read Uncle Toms Cabin carefully, I enjoyed what I could of it and would definitely re-read it so I could get a better understanding.i would also definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading about the slavery issues of the 1800s."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The powerful novel that I have recently read, Uncle Tom's Cabin, has helped shaped in many ways my thoughts and beliefs of slavery. It helped me get past the thought of slavery as wrong, but showed real examples of how it really was wrong by things that happened in that time period. It went through the ups and downs of a slaves life, and everything Tom the slave had to endure. It starts off when Tom, like many slaves, had to leave his home along with Eliza and her son to be sold to Mr. Haley. Eliza heads towards Canada to meet up with her husband and to be on free land. Tom becomes dear friends with a young child named Eva, a young girl who he saved after she fell overboard. He was then bought by that family and learned to love them deeply. Eva and Tom would talk about everything, but soon their short time came to end when Eva became ill and passed away. Eva had made a deal with her father, that once she dies that Tom must be emancipated. St. Clare the father also dies before he finished freeing Tom. He is bought by a man named Legree who decides to teach him a lesson, and break him in. After letting another slave whip Tom, Tom is no longer able to work for a while. Tom's faith continues to be tested day by day and Tom tells his owner that he forgives him for what he had done. George, Elizas husband has come back like promised to free Tom and take him up to Canada, but it was too late. Tom had died a painful death. Through all the hardships that Tom went through, he remained a devout Christian and knew that God would save him, and that God would help him, and that God would love him. His faith was contagious, he helped almost everyone and anyone he could. All these slave owners claimed to be Christian, and would even use the bible to justify what they had done. This amazing novel must have helped change so many minds before and during the Civil War, just like it helped me want to put a complete end to prejudices everywhere. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a historical, thought provoking, well written novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"When I started to read this book the only thing I knew about slavery was that it was appalling to the society, but towards the middle of this book I began to realize the hardships that the slaves had to go through back then. I couldn't imagine if I was split apart from my family in a slave trade. Harriet Beecher Stowe helps everyone reading this book understand what life would be like if we were slaves. During the time that I was reading this novel I couldn't believe all the hardships that Tom had to go through, going from master to master and having to leave all of his friends. Stowe does a superb job describing the charters and their personalities in this book. At the end of this read it helped me think of what life was like then, and to be glad that we live in the time period that we do. In conclusion, if you want a book that makes a difference in peoples' lives then Uncle Tom's Cabin is the right book for you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is one of the greatest literary works that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The many different view points that are brought into action cause the reader to partially understand reasons of how the evil came to be evil, and the deprived came upon their lowly state.The story begins on a Kentucky plantation, where the owner, Mr.Shelby, has to sell his two more valuable slaves, Uncle Tom and Harry. Harry is five years old and his mother has to save him from his doomed fate. Tom stays to pay for his masters debt. The story follows Uncle Tom's life after his sale, and Harry's mother, Eliza's, new lives after this life-changing event.The story of Uncle Tom's Cabin is truly remarkable. What makes the story so powerful is that the views presented are the real thoughts and questions once brought up by people of the era. The story includes all aspects of the slave trade. Everything from the trader himself to the feelings of separated families is explained in detail. If you want a non-history book view of what really happened before the Civil War, it is unthinkable to miss Uncle Tom's Cabin."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Excellent work and easy to see why it is a classic, not only regarding the history of American slavery in the 1850s, but also as a testament of faith in adversity.

I had trouble putting the book down and felt sorry for the characters' fate through various chapters."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A classic read in the Literature class and practically an enthralling and touching narrative. Mrs. Stowe has portrayed the slavery and tied the characters with emotional bond. Mistakes made by ancestors are revisited and Americans find the way to knowing and correcting the fact which the book portray about the inhumane cruelty of the early 1800s. Mrs. Stowe has the influence of Christian religion and saw the religion as universal religion and others should embrace it. Slavery made them cling to it as a source of comfort and the black slaves were purposely taught by the slave holders, through various means, the full scope of Christian redemption. This and other melodrama writing and approach may not be accepted. A classic, the book touches the heart with the title character, Uncle Tom, who enlightens the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord, Jesus Christ. Reading the book makes one realize the inside turmoil and the anger for abolishing the Slavery. Indeed, a classic read and should be on shelf of every Library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A book that everyone should read! very touching, Tells us what horrors, we can get through with the strength of God"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This was a selection of a 3 person reading group.

Uncle Tom is the man we should all want to be. He is the true Christian model of life. What a glorious, thrilling, and delightfully melo-dramatic book. As a work of literature it has elements of the melodrama and elements of the Gothic as well as moments of out and out preaching, all of which may superficially seem dated to the cynical modernist or post-modernist (though they aren't at all). But as a work of prophetic and inspirational literature it is unparralleled in power and tender beauty. Who would have imagined that America had produced its own Tolstoy, and that we allowed her to drift into disregard simply through our obsession with the new and the anatomical and the fearfully, dreadfully, ironic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Didn't care for it.

It was not until the book was discusses on a Stuff You Should Know podcast that it entered my mind to pick up this book. I downloaded the Kindle edition and began reading before my Kindle even arrived. And I am glad I did.Stowe gives a different insight into slavery than what is taught in schools. It is not overly romanticized nor demonized. It is simply put as matter of fact in a way that prods the reader to use their own reasoning to understand this important period in American history. However, you do come away with an emotional investment in the characters. I found myself gaining a better perspective and compassion through reading this masterpiece.To those who state this book is racist, you obviously have not read it. This book should be required reading in all schools whether as a course on American Literature or on American History."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This is on the top 10 list of favorite books--I couldn't put it down--I was staying up until 2 a.m. to read it. Stowe is brilliant in her dialogue, as if she was listening to the conversations, the various dialects are amazing and the variety of characters she creates. At times you do have to read over, especially some of the slave dialect, but once you get used to it, it becomes easy. I can't imagine anyone condemning this brave woman (who had seven children by the way when she wrote this book) who spoke out against slavery and uncovered the ugliness and horror of it and vehementally condemned those, especially Christians in the South who condoned it by twisting the meaning of the Bible. Yes, it is written from a Christian perspective and don't all of us view the world from our own perspective? And that was hers; people need to remember that the majority of abolitionist were Christians. When I opened the book somewhere in the middle and read a bit to see if I was going to like the book--I felt I wanted to drop to my knees when she gave her description of Miss Ophelia--this is genius! I couldn't wait to begin reading. My only complaint was that there were places in the book that she was overly sentimental and it was an odd contrast to the tone of the book; a realism, which gave just enough details for you to see clearly with your own minds eye exactly what was happening--this is a definite read. She is no docile woman and another review I read I wondered at--as she has several strong women characters in the book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was mentioned so often in various Civil War era history books I've been reading that I'd decided to order it from Amazon!

Stowe steps out of the novel from time to time, for example, to express her hatred of slavery and of the slave trade, and to call upon all Christians to act to abolish slavery. As a polemic, it is masterful, and its shortcomings as a novel (too many coincidences, excessive sentimentality, some fairly wooden characters) fade away in the reader's mind.This is a period piece, a work of its time, and Stowe is not free from attitudes that we would term racist today. She holds many stereotypes of black people -- they are more emotional, more susceptible to religious belief, less cultured -- while at the same time declaring that slavery is the worst evil known to man. Interestingly, Stowe is as tough on Northerners who tolerate slavery or benefit from it as she is on Southerners who keep slaves.Highly recommended to Americans of all ages and ethnic backgrounds."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I usually don't expect 150-year-old novels of ideas (and this is the quintessential novel of ideas) to be page turners, but Stowe is to be commended for writing what is first of all a great story. Never mind all the political sermonizing she does here -- and there's plenty of it -- this is above all a gripping story. Every time I expected a chapter to head into tedious territory, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though everyone knows what will happen to Uncle Tom -- this being a slave narrative written before the Civil War, after all, -- I couldn't help but continue wanting to read on. This was the second best selling book of the 19th century not only because it was highly controversial, but also because it's a well-told story, and I say &quot;told&quot; because Stowe herself often claimed that God dictated it to her. And it seems to be more spoken than written, especially with her frequent direct addresses to the reader.While there may be something to Stowe's claim of divine inspiration given its impact, the book is certainly not without its faults. The character of Eva, for instance, is unlike that of any normal living child. She's a saintly caricature. And her neverending conclusion drips with maudlin sentiment exaggerated to Biblical proportions. Similarly, Uncle Tom doesn't bear resemblance to anyone I've ever met. But most troublesome is Stowe's romanticism of the black characters. She lumps them together and stereotypes them in one way or another. Clearly she means no harm; just the opposite is her desired effect. But it sometimes comes at the price of preachy condescension. They may be positive sterotypes, but they are stereotypes nonetheless, and they weaken her story.Having read and enjoyed the highly-acclaimed and abundantly-awarded &quot;The Known World&quot; by Edward P. Jones, it dawned on me that Stowe really had a more thorough understanding of even the most subtle effects that the institution of slavery had on blacks and whites both northern and southern alike even with ideal slave masters. She even appears to foresee the differences of opinion that would later crystallize in Martin Luther King's brand of civil disobediance and the more militant versions advocated by the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers, juxtaposed in the diverging paths of the quiet, pious and tolerant Tom with that of the more directly oppositional George. She criticizes neither, though she seems to favor Tom's path, knowing full well that Uncle Tom is unique, and his abundance of Christian tolerance isn't likely to be found in the general population -- nor is it a path she desires for most slaves. She would rather that slaves simply escaped. She also seems to advocate their creation of a country of their own, taking Liberia as a model.Still, further, Stowe is an early feminist, and as a result, the characters that are most interesting here are the women. Ophelia comes nearest of all the characters in the book to walking off the page. And Cassie, a finely complex creation, though introduced only in the last 120 pages or so, nearly steals the climax.And what of the villains? They, too, are caricatures to be sure. To me at least, Simon Legree left something to be desired. He occasionally comes off as more of a buffoon rather than the Satan you know him to be deep down. But Marie St. Claire -- again, the woman -- is as clear a picture of selfcenteredness as Scrooge is of miserliness.Hemingway said that all modern American literature dates back to Huckleberry Finn, but I think he needed to look about 30 years earlier than Twain to Stowe. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a masterpiece of American fiction; if it is not the Great American Novel, it is, at least in terms of sales, impact and literary merit, the Great American Novel of Ideas."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Often credited to helping start the American Civil War, Stowe's novel became influential for all Americans, whether willingly or not. She may not have wanted absolute war, but she made it clear that \\"The object of these sketches is to awaken sympathy and feeling for the African race...\\" (Stowe xviii). She made a brilliant attempt to fulfill this goal and the result was a novel that changed the course of history.The actual story is just one way that Stowe created compassion in her audience. The story starts with a gracious slave-owner, Shelby, and how debts have forced this kindhearted man to separate two families, one of them mother and child. The mother, Eliza, and child, Harry, flee to the north were abolitionists help them make their way to Canada and reunite with the husband and father. The escape is dramatic and moving and the people that help the family along the way are appropriately labeled as righteous humans. In contras, Loker, the slave hunter that hindered them, is deemed unethical. The conversion of Loker is a turning point for that part of the story and he is altered into a character favorable to the reader.As for Tom, he is sent to the St. Clare family where the master is moral man and he has a religious and flawless daughter, Eva. Because of her perfection, Eva cannot see the difference between blacks and whites. Soon afterwards, Tom is sold to a malicious slave owner, Legree. Tom helps two fellow slaves escape but is therefore severely beaten and then dies. In his memory, Shelby's son frees all of his slaves and Tom becomes a martyr. The seemingly real lives of Stowe's characters raise emotions and sway the reader to be sympathetic towards blacks.An important person who was the prime example to support Stowe's thesis was St. Clare's cousin Ophelia. She is a northerner who hates blacks but is opposed to slavery. She represents the intended audience that Stowe was writing for. What Stowe wants for the North is what happens to Ophelia: through contact with a suffering slave, she overcomes her racism. Ophelia insists that St. Clare legally give her the slave that she grew fond of and states that \\"\`Nobody but God has a right to give her to me; but I can protect her now'\\" (308).Uncle Tom's Cabin also happens to be incredibly biased. From cover to cover, there are narrations with reasons and opinions that Stowe created to draw the reader to a certain belief. One speaks of how the pleasant and caring masters in Kentucky were the best a slave could get but even there they were still sold, worked hard, and separated from family. Others told of why the immoral masters were so atrocious. The author described the characters with different types of attitudes based on how she wanted the reader to feel about them. For example, a Quaker named Ruth \\"...was decidedly a wholesome, wholehearted, chirruping little woman...\\" and therefore the first impression of this woman was positive (133). This worked for Stowe because the Quakers were placed into an optimistic atmosphere. On the other hand, the people that were created to be the \\"enemy\\" were portrayed as abhorrent creatures who weren't truly gentlemen. For instance, Tom's master Legree was said to be \\"...like some ferocious beast, that plays with its victim before he devours it, he kept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence...\\" (355).Religion played an enormous part in story as well. The characters that the reader would grow fond of were tremendously religious. For example, Tom \\"...would climb to a nook... and busy himself in studying over his Bible...\\" (141). In addition, Eva is perfect and extremely pious. The devout characters are also the ones opposed to slavery. The more religious a person grows, the more moral they become. For example, Loker is healed by Quakers and consequently found religion with them. Through this he is transformed into a man who is completely concerned with the well-being of blacks. In opposition, Legree was the true evil of the story and he is also the opposite of any religious person, especially Tom and Eva. At one point, Tom hears a voice that seems to come from the religious scroll that tells him not to be afraid. On the other hand, \\"...Simon Legree heard no voice. That voice is one he never shall hear\\" (336). The significance behind her strong use of religion is that Stowe was trying to create a hidden message in the story: that no genuine Christian would support slavery.Through the above types of communicating her argument, Stowe was tremendously successful in convincing any reader of the evils of slavery. The readers will most likely feel moved, emotional, and supportive toward any slave, which was the author's objective.The actual sources and research that Stowe used are unclear. From some research of my own I learned that much of her information came from her servants who were former slaves. While she never actually visited a \\"deep-south\\" plantation such as Legree's, she did experience some mild slavery around her. The last chapter of her book is basically her defense for her research. Unable to get an actual comparison between her version and others, it is hard to determine the accuracy. I believe that her research was very good for what was available at the time and generally accurate. There may have been some stretches from the truth, but she was overall fairly factual.On the whole, the novel was virtuous. As a piece of fictional literature, it is excellent and it is difficult to find a better story. As a historical book, it could be improved, especially in accuracy, but of course the historian reader has to keep in mind that that was not her intention. She set out to make an emotional story to convert people in the North to be compassionate and that was accomplished.I would highly recommend this book to anybody old enough to comprehend the meaning behind it. For AP students, the book can help them to understand the social situations before the Civil War. At the same time, it is not the best for a historical book review of this sort because it argues for something irrelevant today and does not look upon the topic from a historical point of view."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"For whatever reasons, I'm one of those who, over the years, never gave \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" much thought. I'm afraid I dismissed the book based on the derogatory cliche of describing a complacent black man as an Uncle Tom. What a pleasure to find how wrong I was.Although the style of narration, the punctuation style of the day and the evolution of contractions, compound words and other bits of syntax show this book to be from the mid 1800s, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is a modern novel. It is largely without the stifling level of detail offered in other books of the time, and it pushes the concept of omniscient narrator (perhaps along the lines of Vonnegut in \\"Breakfast of Champions\\") to a level that would likely be absurd in another story and purpose.And Harriet Beecher Stowe did have a purpose - a daring, countervailing, completely forward-thinking challenge to the complacency of the day. The action of the story concludes in the second-to-last chapter. In the last chapter, called simply \\"Concluding Remarks,\\" Stowe, referring to herself in third person, explains how she came to write the book, and in so doing pulls the reader beyond the realm of fiction in order to cap off her sermon. And a 500-page sermon is exactly what \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" was and is.To quote Stowe from the last chapter, \\"For many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,- when she heard, on all hands, from kind compassionate and estimable people, in the free states of the North, deliberation and discussions as to what Christian duty could be on his head,- she could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a LIVING DRAMATIC REALITY [emphasis the author's]. She has endeavored to show it fairly, in the best and worst phases. In its BEST [emphasis the author's] aspect, she has, perhaps, been successful; but, oh! Who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death, that lies the other side?\\"Within the narrative arts can be found a gray area between complete fiction and straightforwrad documenting. Within this area itself is a fine line of storytelling that sheds the fluff factor of fiction and the yawn factor of documentation. A story told along this line is not only compelling but offers to the receiver of the story a glimpse of what a life in the world depicted by the story must have been like. Or at the very least might have been like. This glimpse, whatever else it is, will be visceral, allowing the reader an actual emotional link. Finding this line is hard, staying on it harder and pulling off a finished work while remaining true to the line harder still. This is what Stowe did, a century before such a point of view emerged again in Americam media.As such, Stowe explains that many of the characters are based on real people - yes, there really was a man as horrible as Simon Legree - and that most of the events in the book were based on true events known to her personally or through trusted reporting. This novelizing of reality was so compelling the book would be translated into twenty-two languages.It would be relatively easy to take sentences and paragraphs out of context and reach the conclusion that Stowe decried slavery while holding the black race paternalistically. It's very possible to find any number of passages and label them as apologetic and paternalistic. There is, in fact, paternalism throughout the story, but this is a reflection of America ten years before the Civil War; and by the end of Stowe's \\"Concluding Remarks\\" this paternalism is gone.I would describe the main apologist, St. Clare, who is keenly aware of the state of his own culture, as more of a rationalist. By making this character so, Stowe is able to open our eyes, as she opened many eyes of the day, to the subtler forms of defacto slavry - not at all to excuse slavery in general as some kind of natural order, but to bear witness to those toiling in other forms of captured work.In 1851 the scullery maid of an English country home was not a slave, of course. Her employment was voluntary, after all, and at the end of a year she would have a few schillings to her name. But economically, perhaps even geographically, her freedom was largely unavailable to her, and so while not a slave under the law, the other side of her employment was the delivery of herself to twelve- or fifteen-hour days of scrubbing pots and pans. The delivery of herself to, at the end of any of those days, climbing three or four flights of a rear stairs to a garret; to a social life limited to the kitchen staff, which itself was a hierarchy that lorded over her; to little hope of marriage, if that's what she wanted, or to any sort of a life she might call her own. Why? To keep from starving to death.And think about this today. Are you watching a 27\\" color TV with full remote that cost $199? Do you honestly think that set could have been made, boxed, shipped to a port in Asia, shipped by boat to the US, shipped by train and truck to your local StuffMart and sold to you profitably for one or two day's wages while every worker along the way was treated fairly? Do you care?For the vast majority of those reading this review slavery is an abstracted and distant topic. It is a practice from a long ago past that might be given two meetings in a high school American History class, a cursory survey from which students might understand the concept of the economics of buying, selling and breeding human beings, from which they might be encouraged to imagine the suffering implicit to such practices.Stowe's great achievment in writing \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" was to belie the nuts and bolts, the mere logistics and schematics of slavery. She established for the reader the point of view of the slave, of a human life set against the legally sanctioned bureaucracy of slavery. She successfully depicted a person - an individual, a human being - sold as a product, warehoused as a product, transported as a product, and then set to use as an organic machine that was discarded and replaced when it broke. More to the point, she allows us glimpses into the inner lives, thoughts and prayers of those sold, warehoused, transported and used up while their ties to family and place, while their smallest hopes, are given credence only as an afterthought that may never coalesce. Only if, after having purchased a brother or a mother, there should be enough money remaining to buy the sister or the child. Only if it should be convenient and expedient for the planter to do so, only if it should strike that planter's fancy one particular afternoon butnot another.This book is as meaningful today, in new ways, as it was in 1851, and that is wholly remarkable."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I decided I should finally read this book. After struggling through Beloved and Lord Jim I feared I wouldn't understand a word of Uncle Tom's Cabin. But it read quite easily, and the story was pretty compelling.

First published in serial form in 1851 and 1852, UTC is, to a large degree, a book of its time. But it has a compelling power that makes it, in my opinion, an authentic classic that deserves the attention of today's readers, and of future generations.Yes, there are many valid criticisms that can be leveled against Stowe and her book. Is it sentimental? Emotionally manipulative? Is Uncle Tom a problematic character? &quot;Yes&quot; to all these questions. But Stowe also achieves a remarkable sense of balance in the book as a whole. The too-good-to-be-true, long-suffering Tom is complemented by the more militant George. And Stowe achieves some truly incisive cultural criticism. Particularly resonant is her analysis (often through the dialogue of her characters) of the use of both Christianity and the law as tools by which the oppressive slave system was supported.Stowe is up front with her anti-slavery beliefs. UTC is notable for Stowe's many asides to her readers; her omniscient narrator seems to be maintaining a continual &quot;conversation&quot; with the reader. Despite the book's flaws, I found it to be a gripping read, filled with some truly memorable characters. Despite its length, the novel is a very fluid read.I fear that UTC is regarded by many as more of a cultural monument -- a literary &quot;museum piece,&quot; if you will -- then as living literature that one would actually read. That's a pity; I think that Stowe's compassion, keen intelligence, and remarkable writerly skill make UTC a classic that is actually worth reading.Like James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; UTC is a flawed but monumental novel that represents a serious and thoughtful attempt to portray non-white American characters. And as with Cooper's book, I think that UTC should be read in connection with 18th and 19th century books by ethnic Americans themselves: as companion texts to UTC, I particularly recommend &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;One other note: a number of authors adapted UTC for the stage in the 19th century. One such adaptation, by George L. Aiken, can be found in the excellent anthology &quot;Early American Drama,&quot; edited by Jeffrey H. Richards. My final comment: If you haven't read this novel, toss away any preconceptions you may have, and read it with an open mind. &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is an extraordinary achievement."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"At 59-years old, I've crossed paths with this book my entire life. This year, I finally decided to sit down and read it. Harriet Beecher Stowe's writing style is typical of her era and might be considered awkward over 150 years after she wrote this book. Still, the story is powerful and its message will continue to endure the test of time. Closer to the horrors of the holocaust, we are apt to associate the phrase \\"Lest We Forget\\" with that horribly inhuman experience in mankind's history. I am compelled to tell you -- the potential reader -- those same words, \\"Read this book Lest We Forget.\\" Certainly relevant mid-century in 1850, today, it makes no difference whether the subject of Stowe's books were African slaves, European Jews, or Cheyenne Indians.

It is so convincing that it can move even hardened hearts, like mine, to want to believe in Tom's loving God. There cannot be too much said for this story, for which I find absolutely nothing negative to report.Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her first installment of the book in 1851, a year after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed (which is another free Kindle book that I recommend highly.) Not only did she write the truth about slavery, she took action against it by writing this book and by helping fugitive slaves in the Underground Railroad.If you need more evidence that everyone should read this book, remember too that it sparked great debate in the United States and that Abraham Lincoln himself is said to have thought the book started a war.Please do read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Being very interested in the abolitionist movement, and knowing how influential Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel was, I was really looking forward to reading it. However, it turned out to be something of a disappointment.The story is rather engaging, following two sets of slaves: Uncle Tom, and Eliza and her son Harry, all three owned by Arthur Shelby (as well as Eliza's husband George, owned by a neighboring planter). Shelby is a rather benevolent slave-holder, but when he's forced to sell Tom and Harry to cancel his debts, Eliza decides to take Harry and run away rather than be separated from her son. Meanwhile, Eliza's husband George also resolves to escape north to Canada because of the malevolent cruelty of his own master. But Tom decides to allow himself to be sold south down the river rather than betray his beloved master Shelby.Uncle Tom's Cabin is half anti-slavery propaganda and half Christian allegory. As propaganda, it is quite well-done, and in the service of a good cause, but artistically it is somewhat lacking. The author breaks the narrative to address the reader directly, a common practice through the nineteenth century as the novel was still a relatively new art form, but with a frequency I've never encountered in other novels of the period. This has the effect of destroying the continuity of the story. Her method is to write about something horrible that happens to the slave characters in her story, then put it to the reader directly how they'd feel if such a thing were done to them--an effective propaganda technique, but not exactly subtle. This is especially prevalant during the first half of the novel, which focuses on the story of Eliza, George, and Harry.The second half of the novel turns into Christian allegory, as Uncle Tom, our trusty Jesus figure, allows himself to be flogged to death rather than revenge or even defend himself by killing his cruel new master and escaping, for the purpose of redeeming his fellow slaves by covering for two who *are* trying to escape and setting a Christian example of love and forgiveness for the rest.So the message basically seems to be for slaves, if they're to be fully Christian and virtuous, to let themselves be treated as horribly as their master whims, and take it meekly. How is this abolitionist? It was certainly a shock after being used to reading the much more intellectual and more passionate writings of Frederick Douglass, who advised his fellow slaves not only to escape, but to kill their masters in self-defense first if possible.The most interesting character, Eliza's husband George, at first sets out for Canada with a brilliant and daring scheme and the full intention of defending himself if anyone tries to capture him and take him back. Luckily, he's taken in by the Quakers before he has to seriously hurt anyone, but Stowe's emphasis on Christian submission makes for less dramatic material, since she won't allow the conflict to be expressed in terms of physical violence, or rather, she will, but only one-sidedly. But perhaps all this is precisely what one might have expected from a sister of the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher.Buck Schirner, whom I had heard before reading Terry Goodkind's Blood of the Fold, is excellent here, bringing a lot of emotion to the characters through his rendering of their dialogue. If you want to read mid-nineteenth century abolitionist material, read Frederick Douglass, but if you do decide to read this too, this audiobook version narrated by Buck Schirner will help it go down easier."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A sellout . . . A traitor to your people . . . Eager to do the white man's bidding. These are some of the modern connotations of an \\"Uncle Tom.\\" Yet, if you were to read the book from which the term originated, you cannot help but come to an entirely different conclusion.\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" tells the story of a middle-aged slave, Tom, and his exploits in 1850s America. A staunch abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote this novel as an illustration of the inherent evils of the system of slavery, not just in the actual practice of it, but also in the passive condoning of it by Northerners. The book was so effective that it swayed public opinion and helped bring forth the Civil War, as implied by Abraham Lincoln.The book is divided into three parts: The Shelby farm in Kentucky; The St. Clares' home in New Orleans; and wicked Simon Legree's plantation in rural Louisiana. The first two slaveowners are benevolent toward Tom, yet Stowe makes a powerful argument of the evils of slavery even when the slaveowner is upright and kind. Stowe portrays slaves as humans with real feelings and strong family ties - a bold pronouncement for that era. For even if they are in a kind environment, they are just one bad business deal or one untimely death away from being sold \\"down river\\" and being separated from all they love forever.Since the target audience was Christian, Stowe makes illustrious use of religious passages and uses flowery language at times, which may seem a bit too much for the modern reader. Yet, she uses these references effectively in an appeal to Christian love to all people, regardless of race. Furthermore, she condemns the Southern Christians of the time for twisting their belief to rationalize slavery.As for modern criticisms of the book, it is true that Tom is a loyal servant and wants to please his masters. However, he is no \\"Uncle Tom,\\" in that he never sells out his fellow slaves and would rather die than betray his brethren. He is treated as a martyr, a near Christ-like figure who will die if others can become free. I doubt Stowe could have portrayed Tom otherwise and still have been as effective. If Tom was rebellious toward his master rather than loyal and loving, the book would have lost its edge.Overall, this is a great read and provides a window into the thinking of an abolitionist. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who wants to know about the real Uncle Tom."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This novel is notorious in American culture because of its reputation as a stereotypical novel. This novel is much more than that. Her original character of Uncle Tom is much more complex than what is seen in adaptations and subsequent productions of this book. Ms. Stowe portrays him as a young Southern black involved in non-violent activism, not as the downtrodden frightened black as most people think he was. The book is extremely well-written. Ms. Stowe can really tell a story. Her prose and her characterizations are flawless. The book was written in 1852, but the message that it gives is just as relevant today as it was then.

The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"A notorious anecdote about \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" relates that Abraham Lincoln, upon greeting Harriet Beecher Stowe at a White House reception, jokingly referred to her as the lady who wrote the book that started the Civil War. Sardonic as it is, the implication does some basis; appearing in 1852, eleven years before the Emancipation Proclamation, this novel forcefully decrying the institution of slavery and helping to stir the nation towards abolition was probably the most incendiary of the century. That it is often crude and quaintly primitive compared to contemporaneous works by Hawthorne and Melville only seems to increase the sense of its mission, oddly enough.Simply put, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" dramatizes the conditions of American slavery. Stowe bases her characters and their stories on actual accounts of which she had known or heard, but more notably her imagination is fostered by an ethical conscience whose predominant source is the Bible. (It is not surprising to learn that she came from a family of preachers; there are passages in this novel that read like \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\") She tries awkwardly to maintain a balance in the novel between high melodrama, low comedy, tales of adventure and suspense, and noble but obtrusive exhortations about the inhumanity and unchristianity of slavery.The hero is \\"Uncle\\" Tom, a religious patriarch and evangelist among everyone he meets, who is separated from his family and is sold from owner to owner--the kind but dissolute Augustine St. Clare, and the nasty and cruel Simon Legree--in an odyssey that parallels the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt, a sort of journey to redemption. In addition to Tom's travails, the novel tells the story of a married couple of fugitive slaves named George and Eliza who have escaped from their respective owners to save their baby son from being sold to a trader and to flee to freedom in Canada, aided by Quakers and other sympathetic northerners.In his introduction to the Bantam Classics edition, the critic Alfred Kazin defends \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" with hand placed firmly on hilt, equating its artistry to its honorable abolitionist sentiments and its historical importance. I respectfully differ with Kazin in this case. I don't consider moral outrage to be solid ground on which to build a work of fiction. Dickens does it best, though that is the least of what makes him a great writer. Stowe, whose overbearing piety outshines her attention to language and narration, is not so skillful.Stylistically, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is uncannily similar to Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (1906), a book written for a very different reason but with the same magnitude of passionate indignation--both are novels of sloppily overwrought prose intertwining drab narratives of two-dimensional characters and heavy-handed pathos with finger-wagging social commentary. The atrocity of slavery and the problem of unnecessarily unhealthy, dangerous working conditions are too serious to be represented by shabby fictionalizations. Should Stowe and Sinclair be regarded as bad novelists or competent pamphleteers? If the latter, then those who somehow are not already convinced that slavery is blatantly evil should by all means read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I am surpised I didn't read this book years ago. Harriet Beecher Stower demonstrated uncommon courage in writing such a novel challenging the institution of slavery during her day. Sometimes I thought the characters seemed very real but at other times they were a bit too over drawn, (Tom was too good, and the little girl much too angelic to be real). However, overall, I thought it was a good read. Some people might think it too moralistic, however."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This review is only for the Kindle version.

I could understand how publishing this book hardened the battle lines regarding slavery in this country. Stowe carefully outlined the circumstances of slave families torn apart, and how the practice hurt the owners as well as their \\"property.\\" But once the war was over, and the slaves were freed, what happened? Stowe brought a wonderful proposal to the table, in the novel itself and in its epilog: educate the freed blacks, but not in their home South, where the white population had grown so lazy due to the institution of slavery, but in towns of the North, where churches Christian families could sponsor individuals so that they could be educated, learn to read and write, learn how to develop a civilized, free character, and then learn a trade. Yet Stowe was totally ignored, apparently, and the alternate, leaving the freed blacks to their own devices and protected by Northern soldiers, could not last forever. President Grant was the last president that kept Union soldiers in the South. When Rutherford Hayes became president, the Union soldiers were withdrawn and the blacks were \\"kept in their place\\" by new, repressive state legislation.

I had to read it about 3 years ago and I thought it was incredible; I would get so teary-eyed over parts. Looking back, I can admit to its melodrama and that Harriet Beecher Stowe probably never saw a plantation in her life, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this book was revolutionary and its time and changed a lot of views.

You laugh with it, you cry with it... I felt as though I was tight there with Eliza on her frightful journey... I was crying with Tom when Augustine St. Clare's family fell apart. Some people think that old books are boring, and I have to admit that before I started reading this I thought it would drag on and on, boy once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Anyone who appriciates a good book should definintley read this. And believe me, DO NOT judge this book by it's cover or by the southern accent that is hard to understand at first. But after the first chapter, I was totally enthrolled in this book. This book is great and you will not regret spending your money on this. This will be a book that you will remember for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"I have wanted to read this book for several years and I'm glad that I now have. It was the very first book I downloaded to my new kindle. Harriet Beecher was many decades ahead of her time in her thinking. In her book she not only advocates the abolition of slavery, which many others did as well, but actually calls for equal rights for negroes, such as negroes eating at the same table and on equal term with whites, something that did not come to fruition till more than a century later. I expect many whites of the time, even northerners would have considered her ideas blasphemous.While she points out the evils of slavery in the South, she is remarkably restrained in placing blame and maintains that the entire nation is responsible in one way another for allowing the abhorrent institution of slavery to thrive. She repeatedly points out the ways in which Christian teachings were being perverted to legitimize slavery and talks often of what it means to truly be Christian. The book is also replete with several strong and memorable female characters. In shocking detail she describes how desensitized people were to the very real sufferings of the slaves and how they were treated as mere objects with no regard to breaking up families if that were convenient or expedient, even the relatively 'kind' masters. It is hard to grasp that such unimaginable atrocities occurred in this very country and so recently, in this country that has now voted in a black president!Shocking, revealing, moving, heart-breaking. A must read for anyone with the slighest interest in the history of America. I now intend to read 'Gone with the wind' to get another perspective on the American South during that same epoch.I must mention, however, that I was very disappointed to find several typos and spelling errors in the ebook. I did not expect that. The ebook is also hard to navigate because it lacks an active table of contents. These drawbacks are there probably because it is a free book. Hopefully, the paid versions of the classics will be more faithful copies."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriett Beecher Stowe, is the story of several slaves and their life in the south. A Kentucky slave owner, Mr. Shelby, is a reasonable slave owner, fith some financial problems. So he doesn't loose his farm he agrees to sell two slaves, to Mr. Haley. Mr. Shelby decides to sell Tom and young Harry; but Eliza, another slave, catches word of the transaction and can't bear the thought of being separated from her only son, Harry. Eliza and Harry take off north, towards Canada, but Tom stays. Slave hunters go off after Eliza and Harry, and Tom is sent south with the St. Clares. Tom lives comfortably for two years, but Mr. St. Clare dies, and Mrs. St. Clare sells Tom to a malicious slave owner. George Shelby sets off to find Tom and set him free like he had promised before Tom was sold. As George lets the last of his slaves go he says, \\"Witness, eternal God! Oh, witness that, from this hour, I will do what one man can to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a fiction story, but it's biased on non-fiction events. Depending on the version you have, determines the number of pages, but most should average about five hundred pages. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you're interested in the south, and southern history. The only hard part about this read is the southern dialect and references used to describe things, but once you get the hang of reading the book it's no problem at all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel has been unequaled in its vast political influence. However, it contains one major flaw. Although the book treats slavery with a simple and determined resolution, and reduces slavery to what it really was (EVIL), the book ends with a happy and most improbable ending. Stowe might have been attempting to show that ultimately, good reigns over evil, but the message of the extreme urgency of the abolitionist movement is lost in the fairy tale ending."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"It is easy to see how this book influenced public opinion regarding slavery in its day. What comes into play, though, is that we as a culture today are more demanding on investigative truth, documented truth, of situations described, not just the author's say so. So, although I personally believe in the evil of slavery, if I were a person who was not so convinced, the book could be described as just manufacture of the author's imagination and, therefore, not evidence of any mistreatment of slaves. So readers today could see the book as not convincing at all because it does not present investigative fact. The book tends to work on the emotions, not on the facts. It was effective in Stowe's day, but not as effective today. Also American English has evolved and the English of the book is verbose and dated and, consequently, it interferes with the understanding of the message of the book. In addition, the different understanding of Christian theology today compared to the the understanding in Stowe's day can also be a deterrent to the readability of the book. Christian fundamentalism can interfere with tolerance of any other message trying to be conveyed in a piece of literature."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The book is in brand new, perfect condition.

I did have the vague idea that most people do of what it is about, but would of been hard pressed to really give any serious detail of the story before hand. So after a little research i jumped in, and this was my experience.While the novel overall was good, i must admit that I was very glad when it was finally finished. The tale follows several different characters and the different fates that they have according to the choices they have made. The characters are very well drawn out, although today many would be considered somewhat stock. I think it will be a long time before I forget Tom, Eva, or St.Clare for instance. The tale does set up a brillant bit of emotional drama, and brings forth a moral tale in such a way i'm almost shocked that it was so popular. In today's society I can't imagine that a story with such strong overtone's would be successful. The writing today is still clear and fairly easy to read. The quality of the prose and the sentances to have their moments as well. Sometimes the religion and the moralizing does come on very strongly, but along with the sentimentalness one can forgive the author when realizing the massive evil insitution she was facing.This is probably not a book that the average reader will read for kicks. However, from a literary and historical perspective it is quite great. It is slightly scary to imagine where the world would have been without it as well."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"This books is one of my favorites and how anyone can criticize it, I'll never know.

If you need to look up words, do , but don't pass on this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin - Or, Life Among The Lowly","review":"The Book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, when first published, took in an amount of 10,000 dollars to the Author, Harriet Beecher Stowe. This was believed to be the largest sum of money to any author from a sale of a single book produced in such a short period of time.Stowe has the skill in describing her characters. There is no book, in which a Negro's life had been portrayed so life-like such as this way. Uncle Tom and Eliza's fate is the interest in this story, for they are somewhat heroes of slave times.The opening is a deal of slaves, to a slave proprietor with no feeling whatsoever. Haley is making a bargain with a nice caring slaveholder, Shelby, who is in major debt. Haley is a villain and wants these slaves all for himself. Because there is no federal law which can compel the slave states to resign the \\"property\\" which they hold. These states are as free to maintain slavery, as are the states of the North who rid themselves of this scandal.With Stowe describing these characters feelings, it feels like she is going right along with them on their journeys to freedom and deeper into slavery. There is a feeling there, while reading, which no one can describe. It is a shame that Stowe does not know how she excites her reader's passion towards all these characters, and how Uncle Tom's Cabin is now known as a classic."},{"Title":"Teaching Language and Literature in Elementary Classrooms: A Resource Book for Professional Development","review":"I used this text with pre-service teachers as required reading for my course in teaching elementary language arts. It is a book that my students highly recommend and that they feel will be a useful resource to them throughout their future years of teaching. This text gives a solid framework to a well-rounded language and literacy program, based on sound theory and realistic practice. Each of the twelve chapters is divided into recurring sections so that the format becomes predictable. The author shows in a meaningful way how to integrate language and literature across the curriculum, giving concrete examples of each concept and teaching practice at the Kindergarten level, the primary level and the intermediate level. Throughout the text, in the \\"What Do You Think?\\" section, Popp asks reflective questions to her readers. These provide wonderful discussion starters in class and opportunities for the students to reflect privately at home in a focused manner. The recurring section on evaluation was of particular value to my students, connecting specific types of assessment strategies to specific classroom activities - for example, creating a \\"discussion chain\\" or a \\"shared-pair\\" summary to evaluate understanding of a presentation. Popp makes sure to build connections from home to school and community, and is very conscious of including students and teachers with varying needs and in varying situations. There is truly something for everyone in this valuable text. Popp provides for each topic recommended readings of relevant professional literature, descriptions of teaching resources and a variety of theoretical perspectives, in addition to very thorough preparation and step-by-step instructions in carrying out the teaching strategies.Although as a Canadian I had some concerns about the all-American references and cited literature, I would still heartily recommend this text to instructors/students in both Canada and the U.S.A., perhaps encouraging additional Canadian content or a future Canadian edition."},{"Title":"SSOTBME Revised - an essay on magic","review":"I have begun carrying this around in my briefcase, so when people ask what my opinion is of the relationship between science and magic, I can wave it at them. Okay, not really. But I do quote it at them. And I have to say that the revision of this classic essay is thrilling. Other reviewers mention things like using TVs as crystal balls . . . and that's all interesting. But the serious magician will find much of interest in this slim volume beyond mere technique. I've been looking for a \\"magical method\\" that can compete with the scientific method. SSOTBME lays much of the groundwork for that method -- and if you read it back in 1974 I'd humbly recommend rereading this new edition. Now that it's back in print, this baby is on my \\"mandatory reading\\" list."},{"Title":"SSOTBME Revised - an essay on magic","review":"Have you ever considered using the static on a TV screen as a crystal ball, staring until the chaotic noise morphs into sensible and suggestive shapes? Would you be inclined to use tarot cards as inspiration for bedtime stories while tucking a child away at night?If so, or if not, you should definitely read SSOTBME. Ramsey Dukes writing style is consistently thought provoking and hilarious, a combination that makes me eager to keep turning pages and to see what unfolds in each of his books. This book is essentially about occult philosophy, and considers the characteristics of different worldviews (magic, science, religion, and art). As with the other Ramsey Dukes work I have read so far, the book has very clear thesis and subject... yet, it is almost impossible to pin down the one main thing the book is \\"about\\", because the core subject of the book seems to be used as a starting point from which countless interesting anecdotes and ideas spin off.The most amazing thing about this book was the way it sucked me into reading further and further. After the first chapter, I had my doubts. But soon enough I couldn't put it down, and couldn't stop myself from pestering my girlfriend by relaying little bits of the book to her. She found them weird, and probably found me weirder for it, but also seemed to have found me even more endearing as a result. So, this is the type of book that is packed with one interesting thing after another, and will give you loads of thoughts to digest. I am definitely looking forward to rereading it. Occasionally I pick it up and read a random page, and have been guaranteed to find something interesting. After reading it, I could very clearly feel why this book has become an influential classic, particularly in the development of chaos magic.This book was particularly interesting to read after reading another Dukes book, Words Made Flesh, because there is a very consistent thread of ideas that run through his books. The added revised chapters in this book are absolutely welcome, and make it very clear that Dukes' writing style has improved over the last 30 years."},{"Title":"SSOTBME Revised - an essay on magic","review":"As Mr. Dunn says in the review below, there is more to this volume than technique. SSOTBME is primarily a book concerning magickal philosophy, which differentiates it from almost all other works in the genre. Whithin it are no formulas or rituals or fantastic visions from the \\"Other World\\". What you will find is vastly more useful: Dukes' clear, easy-going language that proposes the idea that a Magickal world-view is actually healthy, even useful(!), in modern society.Even though it's not bound in frog skin or covered in ominous sigils, no other book has proven as valuable in my own personal practice.

It's pretty common for books on Magick to either completely ignore scientific/rational thought or they go to great lengths to try to justify Magick scientifically/rationally, even going so far as to impose the scientific method into the practice of Magick. This book, however, has what I think is probably a much more useful approach. Instead of seeing Magick as opposed to science or as something that needs to be fit into the scientific paradigm to be valid, the author discusses how they are two different ways of thinking and of dealing with reality, both completely valid and not at all mutually exclusive. To me it's a revolution of thought to no longer feel I need to be bound to making rational sense of Magick. I can see why this book is popular in Chaos Magick circles too as he encourages not mistaking a useful set of beliefs as being equivalent to absolute truth.Besides Magick and Science, the other two directions of thought, Art and Religion, are also discussed but not at as much length because, as the author explains, we currently live in a culture with a very strong Scientific bent which has had a very strong influence on our thinking.The author also has a great sense of humor (just look at the titles of his books) which keeps the reading enjoyable and is a good reminder not to take this all too seriously. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this author - Thundersqueak and How to See Fairies are next on my list."},{"Title":"Miss Kitty, The New Baby and Me","review":"As a cat loving little girl, this was the perfect book for me. As an adult, I see obvious holes in the plot, but at the time I enjoyed the balance of elementary adoration and angst.A little girl with a wonderful cat (Miss Kitty) finds out she is going to be a big sister, and she is thrilled, until she finds out that Miss Kitty will have to go when the baby arrives (for whatever reason, her parents thought that a cat would be a huge danger). I remember agonizing with the heroine about this huge loss coupled with a huge gain. Of course, it all pretty much works out for Miss Kitty who happily ends up on a farm where her former owner's family can visit her, and the main character does become widely attatched to her baby sibling.Good book choice for that tween who can't read enough kitty stories, or is soon-to-be a big sibling."},{"Title":"Detroit Diesel Series 60 Service Manual # 6SE483 (2 Volume Set (Sections 1-15))","review":"Books helped tremendously was easier to see pictures of what I was working on and how things go together. Made job easier."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Of Space And Astronomy (Science Encyclopedia)","review":"This is a huge, up to date, single volume encyclopedia. It is not a text, but an alphabetical listing of just about everything there is to know about the subject. More than most astronomy books, this one contains a lot more information about the various space oriented NASA projects. I can't say that every mission is documented, but in looking several up I couldn't find any that were missing. Likewise other aspects of space technology aren't left out. You don't find discussions for instance on the de Laval nozzle in most other books.On the astronomical side, his discussions on dark enery and dark matter are as good as any I've seen. This is not to say that he claims to know what they are, but he gives a good description what the leading current theories say. I notice that he has no comment on the speed of gravity (which nobody seems to know), but I guess you have to draw the line somewhere.One problem with this book is putting it down. It is so big, and has so much information that you tend to want to read it from beginning to end. Except that you get distracted and start jumping around as something new grabs your interest."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Of Space And Astronomy (Science Encyclopedia)","review":"So far,I haven't found a single astronomical term that was missing or one for which the encyclopedia gave less than satisfactory explanation."},{"Title":"Gwinnett County Georgia churches: Reprint of 1911 book, Gwinnett churches","review":"J. C. Flanigan did an excellent job when he compiled this book on the churches of Gwinnett County in 1911. He included every church that was in the county at the time. However, the county has changed much since the time this book was written and the number of churches in the county are inumerable. This book needs to be majorly updated in a second edition by another author. I have also, however, caught a few mistakes concerning dates on certain churches that and pastors. This book is still very good and contains some very interesting sketches on the churches. It even includes some pictures of churches and ministers and prominent laymen. It is intersting to see how the First Baptist Church of Lawrenceville or Snellville looked a hundred years ago and see how they have changed SO much today.One major complaint I do have about this book is that it claims to be a history of every church in Gwinnett County as well as biographies of several ministers. This book does not contain histories of any of the African-American churches of the county or any of the black ministers. This may lead some to believe that there there were no black churches in Gwinnett County prior to 1911, which of course is not the case. This aspect of the book makes it a product of its time and sheds some light on the attitude prevalent in the early twentieth century."},{"Title":"Gwinnett County Georgia churches: Reprint of 1911 book, Gwinnett churches","review":"This book is no longer on the list of scarce books on the history of Gwinnett Co GA.

Elvins' wonderful little book is must-reading for fans of English Catholic history and anyone wanting to learn more about the debt English-speaking Christians owe the Catholic Church.Written like a cross between Tom Woods' \\"How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization\\" and John Zmirnak's funny but reverent \\"The Bad Catholic's Guide to Good Living,\\" \\"Catholic Trivia\\" explains how gestures like \\"knocking on wood,\\" a reference to the wood of the cross, and the omnipresent British adjective \\"bloody,\\" a truncation of the oath \\"by Our Lady,\\" were simple ways by which the English reminded themselves of their Catholic identity.To erase this identity and stamp out \\"popish superstition,\\" Protestant reformers, especially the Puritans, changed the meaning of common symbols. For instance, the number 13 once was considered a lucky number as it referred to Christ and His twelve apostles. Similarly, walking under a ladder was a sign of *good* fortune as it brought to mind both Christ's sacrifice on the elevated cross and -- thanks to the triangle formed by wall, floor and ladder -- the Trinity.Yet as often as not, a censured benign and potentially beneficial practice, e.g., carrying a Rosary in one's pocket, was replaced by a silly, truly superstitious one, e.g., carrying a rabbit's foot instead.\\"Catholic Trivia\\" is written as a series of brief, often humorous encyclopedia-style entries accompanied by the illustrations of John Ryan, a famous British cartoonist.I picked up the book on a recent trip to London and found myself frequently reading passages aloud to my wife during the flight home; several were laugh-out-loud funny, and all were entertaining and informative. I suspect you'll agree."},{"Title":"The Navajo and Pueblo silversmiths","review":"The book describes many facets involved in the creation of Pueblo Indian jewelry. This book is quite possibly the best and perhaps only scholarly work that explains jewelry making from the Indian perspective.

This book is a must for serious collectors and those seeking thorough research. However, the book gives very little attention to the Harvey phenomenon, preferring to deal more directly with traditional Native American art (i.e. the jewelry that the creators would wear on themselves)."},{"Title":"The Navajo and Pueblo silversmiths","review":"the book gives in both words and photos the entire history of native silversmithing from its inception to the mid 1940 when the book was frst published.

It is sport-based, with excellent characterizations of the life and people in that time.The author follows the habits of the times in attaching names to people that are meant to describe their character, which can be a little wearing to the modern reader. But in terms of the modern reader understanding the appeal of foxhunting and the methods (and madness) of the original era, this book can't be beat.As to the book itself, Nonsuch has produced a beautiful little volume with the heft to make one feel he is reading something worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Troubled Air","review":"It is amazing that Irwin Shaw decided to write this novel in the era of the red purge, not long after the crazy era ended.

Harold and the Purple Crayon is one such book. So, too, are the Phantom Tollbooth and, of course, Tolkien's works. The Seven Little Postmen does this on a more mundane level, but the journey is enjoyable, nonetheless. Here, Margaret Wise Brown and Tibor Gergely lead us across bustling city streets, fly us through sleet and hail, and send us roaring along shining rails, \\"Through gloom of night / In a mail car filled with electric light\\". Not only do we meet seven postmen along the way, but also a cast of colorful characters, including Mrs. Potter, \\"Who was busy making jam\\". With chickens and tires delivered R.F.D. via a crank-start motor, Mr. Gergely's distinct and detailed illustrations evoke a time now long gone.I also recommend Scuffy the Tugboat and His Adventures Down the River, likewise illustrated by Tibor Gergely."},{"Title":"Seven Little Postmen (A Little Golden Book)","review":"If you're looking for some of the nice older books for your child, be sure to grab this one!

But \\"Seven Little Postmen\\" (and the recently re-issued \\"Mr. Dog,\\" among others) reveals more about Margaret Wise Brown's genius as a writer than \\"a quiet old lady whispering 'hush.'\\"Originally written in the late 1940's, \\"Seven Little Postmen\\" tracks the course of a letter from a little boy in the city to his grandmother in the country through all the stages (way back then) of the mail and all the different types of jolly \\"postmen\\" who process the letter from pick-up to rural free delivery back in the days before automation, before \\"postal employee\\" became synonymous with \\"homicidal gun-nut.\\" Ms. Brown's humorous and poetic descriptions of the various jobs (who can remember when speeding trains used to \\"hook\\" mailbags from stands beside the tracks so they wouldn't have to stop?) are perfectly matched with Tibor Gergely's (who also illustrated \\"Scuffy the Tugboat\\" and \\"The Taxi that Hurried\\") colorful and charming illustrations.Modern-day children will be intrigued by a delightful story with just the right amount of excitement and \\"mystery\\" (what's in the letter?) and enchanted by pictures of a more sedate and innocent time in America -- before e-mail, Fed Ex and text messaging took the anticipation and fun out of letters - both writing and receiving.

My friend and I followed this audio-cassete series together. It took us an entire day, but it was time very well spent. This set is definitely life-altering! Especially worth noting is the meditation which helps you to meet your Guardian Angel. There are no words to describe the incredibly profound, spiritual experience I had during this meditation! I'd strongly recommend this to any seekers along the spiritual path who wish to learn how to recognize and experience two-way communication with their angels and guides! I don't usually buy audio and was initially a little put off by the price, but after having &quot;heard&quot; for myself, this series is truly a bargain. I'll certainly be purchasing additional sets for gift-giving.

By tape 6, I felt like I got more than my money's worth. As usual, Doreen Virtue communicates messages from the Angels with such an unconditional love focus that I feel incredibly nurtured and uplifted. The messages help us know even specifics of what we can ask for, how we can ask for things, how we get answers (and can use any or all of our senses to get or give that information). She/they helps/help us know how to look at things from that positive, unconditionally loving perspective which in itself often solves our &quot;problems&quot;. She/they continually help us give our negative/down perceptions, fears, etc. to the Angels freeing ourselves from fret and worry....And shifting us into a unconditionally loving state. And there are many lovely mediations throughout the series helping us meet/converse with our Angels....Truly Heavenly.

Whitford, which describes this kit with ONE CD, pocket instruction book, 12 angel cards, incense, sea salt, pocket journal & candle, etc.The other reviews, including the editorial review, incorrectly refer to Doreen's 6 CD/Cassette tape sets, which were released several years ago. Oddly, those kits were also called \\"Connecting with your Angels\\", but are comprised of 6 cds/cassettes for a more intense and much longer course.The 6cd/cassette set is still available under \\"other editions\\" and I would definitely recommend for Angel enthusiasts who are interested in a more in-depth/advanced course on angels. I attended several of Doreen's seminars, and the 6 CD set is comparable to taking her 3 hour course, which I paid approximately $150 for several years ago.If you love Angels, try her Messages for the Angels &/or Healing with the Fairies cards. Easy to use with no experience or training. Basic meanings are written on each card & pocket guide is included for more in-depth definitions. Storage box is also included with each deck.You can pull one card each morning & receive guidance for the day.Great companion for the advanced 6 cd course, or on their own.The kit available on this page is also helpful, but more on a beginner/quick fix level.

But once you give them a chance, they can help guide you in life. They've come though for me whenever I've asked them to. When I bought this kit I also purchased the archangel oracle card set.

And 2: while this kit good if you like to do a whole ritual, with a bath, and a listening meditation with an audio CD, etc, I find that the cards are nice to pick up if you only have a minute. Plus the card sets are easier to transport (in a purse or whatever)."},{"Title":"Connecting with Your Angels Kit","review":"...and guidance that really works! I could tell you how wonderful this book is, how many meditations, practical visualizations it contains and even describe the beautiful guided Angel Reading practice that you hear later on the audio book.... but let me instead share just ONE detail.I was in the gym, listening to the audio book and working on my back muscles when the section of guided Angel Prayers began. I forwarded the \\"give me a baby\\" prayer and half-heartedly joined the \\"give me a new job\\" prayer in my mind. I kind of have plans for what to do next, thus I was not wishing for a new job desperately, but decided to remain open to options.That same night I received an email to my job request with an oil and gas company. They wanted me to contact then ASAP and confirm participation in a new job training held a couple of months later.Some six hours later, already in the morning, but still less than 24 hours from the time of prayer, there was an email from an acquaintance: about four (!) month ago I was asking her for business contacts who could have a position for me and she responded just now, asking if I still needed them.It is more than \\"just\\" synchronicity. It is a clear example of how well the step by step guidance work and how quickly Angels rush to help us for the good of all involved if we ask for help passionately -- and even half-heartedly, as in my case!Open the door of your heart and mind and connect to your Angels, Archangels and Spirit Guides.

We need more books on this topic, especially when my favorite one, Please Don't Cry Mom, is out of print. Why Are You So Sad gives straightforward information, but the plot and illustrations seem one dimensional. I did not find myself drawn in by the characters. I had a couple of children look at it. One said that it sounded \\"accurate\\" but they did not find it interesting.Children of a depressed parent need to hear this sort of information, so I will keep the book.

First of all, of the 25 magazine titles featured, only 8 could be called \\"macabre pulps\\" in the generally accepted meaning of the term. (And if you count cover images rather than titles, the macabre pulp representation is even smaller.) And at most only five more titles could be considered pulps at all, even if you stretch the term to include some quasi-pulp publications. As to the rest, though most are fantasy or occult related, very few are in the \\"macabre\\" category, and none of them are pulps by any stretch! These include: seven post-pulp era digests published as recently as 1973, including one that contains no fiction; a fanzine; three standard size (8 by 11) non-macabre magazines published during the pulp era, including two that contain no fiction; and a standard sized post-pulp era non-fiction magazine. The book's text is extremely skimpy, for the most part merely recounting some publishing information gleaned from the indicia of the magazines. If the author is an expert on pulps, you'd never know it from this book. For each title there's a listing of all the articles and stories, by author, which is OK, although for the most part these writers are probably best forgotten. The biggest problem with the book is that the text is artificially bulked up, with the checklists in large type and spread out across the pages. There are only 104 cover reproductions in this 111 page book, but because text and checklists take up so much space, many of the covers are reproduced quite small. (I know--this is like the classic complaint about the restaurant that serves terrible food--and in such small portions!) If the contents checklists had been printed in small type two or three columns per page (preferably in the back of the book), the cover illustrations printed in a larger size, more pulp titles added to the book, and the book's title changed to \\"Some Randomly Selected, Mostly Rare, Short-Run, Macabre, Occult and Fantasy Magazines Published Between 1919 and 1973,\\" the book would still be a ripoff, but might barely be worth the Amazon discount price to the curious. This is the bottom of the barrel from Adventure House! If you want a good book on the pulp era, try their UNCOVERED, THE HIDDEN ART OF THE GIRLIE PULPS, which is chock full of pulp covers and has an extremely informative text by Douglas Ellis, or their reasonably priced Belarski cover collection."},{"Title":"Those Macabre Pulps","review":"I'd have to agree with the first reviewer. this one is not worth your time. i had very high expecations as i love this genre of illustration and graphic design... and there was hardly any content! i'm not even sure how they actually had enough pages to bind this book. the cover was the most exciting part. Look to some great titles like \\"UNCOVERED: the hidden art of the girlie pulps\\" and you'll be much more satisfied."},{"Title":"Those Macabre Pulps","review":"I don't understand the harsh 1-star reviews. This book is designed for the general public new to the subject of \\"macabre pulps,\\" and it is not designed for the specialist collector. It's an over-sized paperback with numerous color photographs and I enjoyed it because the subject matter was well presented! End of story! When I buy a book like this I'm not looking for an encyclopedia!"},{"Title":"Disasters of the Deep: A History of Submarine Tragedies","review":"Tragedy at sea comes in many different forms with almost every account making compelling reading. There are instances of amazing rescues and people being adrift for many days. Then, of course, there are the mysteries and so it goes on. There is, however, something quite sinister about the loss of a submarine where those unfortunate enough to be trapped - even in shallow water, are unable to simply abandon ship.In this book, acknowledged expert, writer and naval historian Edwyn Gray gives the reader a first rate insight into a number of submarine accidents. From the first clumsy attempts at submarine design in 1774 right up to the nuclear-powered age, this is, as the title suggests, a thorough survey into submarines lost by several of the world's navies.In many ways, the book is a collection of short stories - with frequent cross-reference from one story to the next. It is an incredible series of real-life adventures including death and survival. Once started, it is also a book which is hard to put down.NM"},{"Title":"Community Participation Methods in Design and Planning","review":"It is very useful book for students, researchers and instructors who are involved in community design and planning. The methods of participation are very well described."},{"Title":"Blood at the root: A novella","review":"For those who are fans of the British genre, the police procedural, you will not be disappointed. The book begins much like a Peter Turnbull novel with a cast of police characters from coroners, photographers, fingerprint experts etc. But at the center of it all are Detective Inspector Banks, Sergeant Hatchley and Detective Constable Susan Gay. Banks is portrayed as a hands on supervisor who has plenty problems of his own. He takes a promotion only because he is assured that he will be allowed to do what he does best which is be out on the case. However, this arrangement is threatened as the top dogs retire and a new Chief Constable wants to chain him to his desk. Throw in some personal melodrama such as a failing marriage and you have a very sympathetic and well-rounded lead character. His cohorts are equally interesting and well written. The plot centers around the murder of a young man which at the surface appears to be a simple case of a drunken brawl taken a step too far. The layers slowly are peeled back to reveal connections to a Neo-Nazi organization and drug dealing. Thrown in some racial tensions among the English and the Middle Eastern population and the situation has become difficult to control. The plot is interesting and the telling is satisfying. This is my first Inspector Bank's novel and I am so pleased that I will be tracking the others down! This is the definition of a police procedural where others have failed."},{"Title":"Fix-It Man (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"This is a charming early Harlequin Temptation by Vicki Lewis Thompson. Our heroine Diana has been widowed for about a year and her house is in shambles- she needs a live in handyman- a Mr. Fixit for her plumbing and other homer repair needs. In desperation she places an ad in her hometown newspaper and along comes Zach- a hunky California beach boy working on his doctorate in Springfield , IL- he is studying Lincoln in his hometown and the opportunity for low rent and meals for a little home improvement work is great!Until he meets his lovely landlady and her two teenage daughters- and they find out he is great at fixing things- like their loneliness and the empty space that their dad left- and the space in Diana's heart and bed. When it comes to home repairs though---- his skills are definitely not up to par which lead to some sweet humourous scenes. The relationship with this single mom who is entrenched in her midwestern hometown and the free spirited Californian progresses with care and ease. Zach is very respectful of Diana and her girls and their relationship. Was nice to see a man who really understood how circumspect a single mom needs to be with impressionable children under foot ( Allison and Laurie are 12 and 13).Sexuality is on the warm not hot side- but the love and true depth of feeling comes through loud and clear. Definitely one for my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"An excellent book, very complete and very detailed. Mostly well written and clear. It explains MC68K and Power PC archtiectures. It is very indepth when it comes to microprogramming. A good overview of Assembly concepts. You will learn about microprocessors inside out, including Intel Pentium family with superscalar features and the importance of pipelining and compiler optimization. A great reference for profesionals, a superb guide for undergrads."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"This was the assigned text for my junior year computer engineering course on computer organization.

Another beauty of the book is that all loose ends are tied up. As sentences unfold one will realize why a particular phrase was used earlier and so on.

Hence, it will be useful for years to come.Must have for all embedded systems people."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"The authors introduce every concepts in detail, and the hardware circuits are clearly illustrated."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"Helped me in my undergrad (older version). Helped me when I gave subject GRE recently. Covered Pipelining superscalar, out-of-order execution processors, caching and secondary storage, combinational and sequential ckt review etc real well. No computer architecture book covered them all so clearly, and in one book."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"I had a chance to recommend this to a colleague just last week. It is easily twice the price of the \\"competing\\" books on the market, but you get what you pay for. With this book plus (perhaps) a hands-on course in the microprocessor laboratory--interfacing various logic families to output devices, e.g., or whipping up a robot of limited capabilities--the student gains the ultimate understanding of what makes computer systems \\"tick,\\" from the loftiest levels of software, through the details of instruction set implementation (microprogrammed control, prefetching, cycle-stealing DMA transfers) and even the detailed digital logic circuits that underlie the CPU.I dare say the student who aces this course is all but prepared to build a simplistic CPU on his own--\\"simplistic\\" because, though the concepts can be understood quite completely, it's an intricate challenge. Notably, the book has kept pace with the times: while the PDP-11 instruction set is didactically wonderful--clear and easy and even sporting reasonable opcode mnemonics--you don't see lots of PDP or LSI (or, for that matter, VAX) minis floating around nowadays. So, HV&Z; moved on to the 68000, the Power PC, perhaps even the Pentium in the latest (of five or six) editions. (Good move, gentlemen: you've actually done your homework rather than just changing \\"happy\\" to \\"glad\\" and reprinting with a new version number!)I used this book as a junior, but (a) I went to Cooper Union, which operates at an extremely high intellectual level [let's put it this way: I took a number of graduate-level computer science electives--compilers, OS, etc.--taught by Bell Labs MTSs as a junior and senior; and some \\"doctoral\\" courses that I took at Case were--honest Injun--watered-down versions of similar courses I had taken at Cooper], and (b) I graduated more than twenty years ago, and requirements always creep downward: a few credits fewer, a few tangential courses eliminated, perhaps one fewer humanities elective necessary to matriculate, etc. By 2006 standards, I would reluctantly have to reclassify HV&Z; as a postgraduate text.(A little puzzle for the reader: we had to build--from NAND gates--a microcomputer featuring two three-bit registers, and my squad was the only one that implemented an \\"exchange registers\\" function that required only one cycle and used no auxiliary storage registers. How did we do it? Tick ... tick ... tick ... time's up! The circuitry compared corresponding bits from both registers. If they matched, it did nothing; if they differed, it flipped both! So, there was no literal \\"exchange\\" operation: rather, each was simultaneously reset to the value of the other.)"},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"A wide variety of topics have been covered with considerable clarity and depth.Though some of it maybe a bit overboard for undergrads it is better suited to a grads taste."},{"Title":"Computer organization","review":"After reading this book do not believe you'll know everyting about computing , but you'll know more than others do."},{"Title":"A dictionary of musical themes","review":"My husband and I play &quot;what is that piece&quot; when we listen to classical music on the radio. I am a pianist and I transpose a theme to the key of C, look it up, and voila, success!

In fact my original copy has a $5.95 price on the dust jacket!!The themes for many major orchestral pieces are indexed in two different ways: themes are arranged in the book by composer, then by title so it is easy to find a specific work if you know the composer. The second indexing is in the back of the book. If you know a theme but are not sure what it is, simply transpose to the key of c major (or a minor or related mode) and look up by letter names.....For example CDEFGABC yields one entry yields 19 themes that begin with an ascending major scale....each entry includes a theme number and can easily be located in the front part of the book.For any serious classical music listener, classical music disc jockey or music teacher, this book is a tremendous resource and should be a basic part of your library."},{"Title":"A dictionary of musical themes","review":"If my house were burning down around me and I could grab only one item on my way out, it would be a momentary tossup between this book and my wedding album, but (alas) the wedding album would lose. Once you get used to this book (and your friends find out you have it), you'll be consulting it frequently, and can expect to get phone calls from all over the world asking you to identify a musical theme from two or three badly sung or whistled notes. One can access this musical database either by a composer's name, or by the name of a work, or by transposing a theme's sequence of notes into C major or C minor and looking up the theme in an alphabetical index.One word of warning. With the exception of about 2/3 of one page (denoted Page xiv at the front) added almost as an afterthought, the 1975 edition is absolutely identical to the original (1948) edition. No new information of any kind has been added. I made the mistake of buying the 1975 edition (already owning the 1948 edition) and was horrified to discover that I now own two copies of the same material.If you've ever been haunted by a theme running around in your head, or heard in passing on your favorite classical FM station, this book is for you. Once you own it, you won't be able to do without it."},{"Title":"A dictionary of musical themes","review":"If you can transpose a melody you hear into C major (or C minor, as the case may be), and you are any kind of semi-serious classical musician, GET THIS BOOK. My copy is almost 30 years old, and the binding is coming apart from frequent use. When you get a tune in your head, or hear one on the radio, and you can't quite place it (&quot;let's see, that sounds like Mozart, but it could be Haydn...&quot;), just brush off your music dictation skills, write down the theme in C, go to the back of the book, and look it up. &quot;Dictionary&quot; is not quite the right term for this work -- it's more like a Bartlett's.OK, perhaps it's not absolutely indispensable. But it has prevented a few cases of temporary insanity (&quot;Aaaarrggghhhhh -- what was that piece they just played?!?&quot;). Yes, the book needs to be updated with 20th century material. (The tonal stuff, anyway -- Copland, Prokofiev, Vaughan Williams, etc.) And in addition to their companion volume of opera tunes, there would probably be a market for an additional volume for &quot;pop&quot; stuff -- Broadway show tunes, Tin Pan Alley, etc. But this is probably the oldest book I have that I still refer to on a regular basis, and with the large collection of books I have, that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"A dictionary of musical themes","review":"Highly trained, fully employed classical musician whose musical discipline calls for the Big Rep. Refer to this volume constantly. It needs to be reissued, updated, etc. There is a companion volume of 8,000 Opera and Song themes by the authors equally as valuable. This type of reference is desperately needed by the working musical public. There are theme books for certain composers, and there are things like the Schwann and discography books, but nothing like this. Yes, there are certain omissions, but it is probably as comprehensive as it could be without weighing a ton or being completely unmanageable. God bless the authors, they performed a most valuable service."},{"Title":"A dictionary of musical themes","review":"Fabulous, could not get along without it. Unique index. Got my copy when I was 12 and loved every page. This is where I learned what music was worth listening to and searching out the unfamiliar. Ws the basis for my first catalog of my records.

And if you can sing it, you can identify it from the letter-sequences of notes provided. Great.But there's nothing much in this book later than mid 1950s - which is a real pity.

Well this disctionary allows you to find the origin of those lingering notes in your mind and is great when you can find it by the index at the back through the pitches and keys.

I picked this book up at the library a few weeks ago, with moderate expectations. However, I enjoyed it so much, I immediately read the sequel (Butterflies &amp; Late Loves).The two books make up the lifelong journals of Margaret Fountaine, born in England in the 1860s, who spent 60 years of her life traveling the world, collecting butterflies, and becoming recognized as an entomological authority. When she died in 1940, she bequeathed a locked box to the Norfolk Museum, not to be opened until 1978. When opened at that time, the box was found to contain her journals from her teen years until her death. The early years of the journal cover her childish and painful teenage crushes on various unsuitable men, but a fortunate inheritance provides her with the financial means to travel through Europe and discover her strength, independence, and resourcefulness.This woman is fearless, and will travel anywhere, assured of her safety by her sheer audacity and her complete confidence in the protection guaranteed by her British citizenship. Early in her travels she meets up with a young Syrian man, Khalil Neimy, 15 years her junior, who travels with her for almost 30 years, as friend, lover, and fellow butterfly collector, and he shares his name on the great butterfly collection she bequeathed to the Castle Museum in Norwich, England. The development of an immature young woman, who has ridiculous crushes on entirely unsuitable young men with whom she has never exchanged even a minute of conversation, to an energetic middle-aged/elderly woman who travels for months alone through South America, Africa and Asia, relying on her ability to swear a blue streak when required (to scare off the natives) is inspirational &amp; incredible."},{"Title":"Love Among the Butterflies: The Travels and Adventures of a Victorian Lady","review":"This book was the monthly choice of my book club. I have to say that I wasn't really looking forward to reading it, but as I turned the pages it I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was. This lady certainly travelled far and wide to so many countries in a world where no passports were needed and at a time when women didn't travel unaccompanied. There she pursued her vocation to collect butterflies.( and also quite a lot of men along the way). I wondered as I read the book, how different her life would have been if she had not been left an inheritance and therefore been financially independent.I do feel that the book was not sympathetically edited and we were left wondering how her career and life ended. All in all, an enjoyable read and interesting glimpse into the past."},{"Title":"Yes I Can!: Struggles from Childhood to the NFL","review":"Everyone who has serious reading problems needs this book.

We ordered the books, to have him sign them, not really knowing much about the book. After meeting him, I am more than impressed by his story. Once the book was read to my six year old, my thoughts about him and his book have gone up even a higher notch. If you have a child who is struggling with school or life, this is a great book about being able to overcome your weaknesses. Neil struggled with school and family issues, but did not let that stop him from becoming a great player and a good man. I was there for the signing, and Neil gave every child and adult his full attention, and was as nice to the first as he was to the two hundredth person he signed for.

Since people like Max live by their wits and can never afford to relax completely, Wingate quickly becomes aware that \\"the man who wheedles his way into Diana Charnwood's affections wheedles his way into a fortune.\\" And indeed, shortly after having been introduced to Diana Charnwood, Max writes the following promissory note: \\"I hereby undertake to share equally with my good friend Guy Horton all financial proceeds, however and/or actual marriage I contract with Miss Diana Charnwood if and whenever it may occur.\\" Is this note going to be good luck charms or, as Guy soon comes to suspect, the omens of ill fortune?As usual in Mr Goddard's novels, this splendidly old fashioned affair is full of thuggery, cross and double-cross, plot and counter-plot and the reader feels like being on a roller coaster with never ending twists and bends."},{"Title":"Closed Circle","review":"Things are never quite the way they seem in this unpretentious, easy read. Goddard moves the story along quickly. He has a nice way of building suspense without keeping the reader guessing too long. There's always another twist waiting, so no need to dwell on the prior one.If you like Goddard's frequently used device of combining a plot in the present with a mystery from the past, be warned: Closed Circle largely stays in one time period, the 1930's (except for minor references to earlier events)."},{"Title":"Closed Circle","review":"I have been a book addict since little and specailly a mistery novel fan. Recently, I often got so bored with junk publication of mystery novels but When I first encountered his book I knew that he was genius! TAKE NO FAREWELL, PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING, INTO THE BLUE, HAND IN GLOVE, BEYOND RECALL, OUT OF SUN.... I still have more Goddards to read but my personal top 3 so far would be PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING and INTO THE BLUE. CLOSED CIRCLE is a good book although it may lack the twist and mystery compared to other books by Goddard. But I am so attached to this book and keep reading in order just to reach the ending, which is my favorite part and the most beautiful ending by Goddard which envoke visual and emotional sensation as if I were there. The last few sentences, I can even recall as it is so beautiful and so sad. (This novel is not as sad as other Goddard's books, though) I would love to read sequal if any."},{"Title":"Closed Circle","review":"I picked this up because I had read British author Goddard was a master at writing a clever plot and was, in fact, called &quot;the prince of plotting&quot;. I was impressed by how well the story developed and the unexpected turns he takes you through. I can't wait to read the rest of his books!! The official review posted online gives too much away though.....I never read those anymore for fear they might reveal something they shouldn't, but rather skip to the customer comments.Could anyone out there tell me which of his novels are the very best, and in which order? I've tried to order Past Caring, which I hear is fantastic, but haven't gotten a copy yet.

The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"Here is a book that introduces and teaches a fascinating new sport for the hacking hobbyist, which doesn't necessarily involve computers. Steel bolt hacking is the art of competition lock picking that is beginning to make its mark on computer people and other geeks around the world.The beginning of the book discusses the origins of lock-picking sporting groups, crews in the U.S and Europe, competition around the country, and how to become a part of a lock-picking group. The book is fully illustrated with pictures of different types of lock picking instruments, tools to make your own picks as well as padlocks, deadbolt, and combination locks. There are pictures of locks that have been cut open and even how to crack push-button combination locks. (You know, the kind you find on the door to a server room;-) I have to say, for a little book, (114 pages) it is brimming with valuable information for a beginner.I liked that the book didn't exaggerate. It didn't tell me that I was going to be a master lock picker after only a few tries. It took a little time, practice and sore fingers, but after practice and a lot of patience, I could pick every lock in my house. Well, almost every lock.What I didn't like about the book: The most annoying point, I felt, is the considerable redundancy in methods between different types of locks to be picked. Also, the book suggests that there might be a lock-picking group in every city in the U.S., when in fact I am having a difficult time finding one in my are. And I live near D.C. -- You'd think there would be one on every corner around here. I think that the sport is still in its infancy and Mr. Chick is hoping his book will draw more people to it. Also, the author put his e-mail address on the back of the book. He hasn't responded to my e-mail yet, but I suppose that he's probably a busy man."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their \\"secrets\\". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell, regardless of the bad press from Locksmiths. The only lock picking secrets you can learn from locksmiths is; there is more money in drilling out locks than picking them."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"Amazon finally sent me \\"Steel Bolt Hacking\\"... for some reason they really took a long time to get it to me, so I've been using the internet scronging for information. Here is my early review of the book. This review is for people who are thinking of buying the book and are still early in the process of learning how to pick locks (my pov)For reference am a new to this (getting better but still practising on padlocks w/o security pins and crappy Kwikset cylinders).--$/physical--It's a smaller book than you expect for $20. But hey, it's priced to be a bit of a niche book. It's also not a \\"good quality\\" paperback it looks more like a pamphlet quality. HOWEVER - we ought to be after Information not beauty. Maybe future revisions (or the Advanced Steel Bolt Hacking book I'm waiting for -wink-) will be better--writing style--Well look Douglas isn't Proust - and neither are you. But it's a very friendly introduction - from a beginners view it's extremely friendly and approachable. I imagine this is very important for some readers who aren't familiar or don't like technical manuals. The graphics are ok looking, but more importantly I felt they were VERY clear on depicting exactly the concepts which you need to get *as a beginner*. Chick has a habit of being very redundant, it's pretty annoying and a waste of space. Maybe it's filler, maybe it was to help each description be stand-alone. I dunno.--information--This is really the key to why you should buy this book.The basic concepts and lock types are well presented.The tone is easy even for a non-technical person IMHO.The Diagrams are clean and obvious.If you are curious about this hobby or just started then read the book and you will find it very worthwhile.I think it's worth the $20(us). Go get it.DISCLAIMER - if you don't want to spend $20 for some reason.Like I said Amazon kept me waiting on this one. During that time I bought picks, scounged some padlocks a few door cylinders, and *scoured the internet for information*. There is plenty of information out there. The FAQs on this site point to a great deal. Some of the videos are fantastic (others just great entertainment). The MIT guide is very helpful for beginners. You don't need to buy this book. (Personally, I think you ought to support people who try and write valuable guides like this for curious people like myself). But if that $20 means a lot to you, or you're going to resent the purchase if the minor flaws I mentioned bug you, or if you are already well advanced in the craft, use free resources. The internet has a LOT of free information, friendly people with even more information to share, and let's face it, the basic concepts are trivial compared to the practice."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"For those that want to learn about lock picking contest and the basics of locking picking, this book is pretty good. For those of you that want to learn the formula to cracking a combination lock, this is a great book, however if you're bad at math like I am, you might just want to just stick to lock picking. Over all, I'm glad I got this book. I was a little insulted about the line on the cover, \\"The Computermen's Guide to Lock Picking\\" 1. Because I don't think computermen's a word, and 2. Because it excludes women, but there was enough humor inside that I forgive Mr. Chick."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"This was a great book to get me started.

I might be a little excited right now, but Good Job!"},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"I understand why locksmiths are critical of this book, as well as other lock picking books--because it is too easy to learn yourself! This is a great book for beginner lock pickers, and the fact that Mr. Chick had to publish it himself is even more reason to purchase it. My copy had a couple of printing errors, such as, mis-aligned pages, but to me this is what a hackers book is suppose to be, not a book ruffed up in Photoshop to give it \\"hacker\\" credibility.Can't wait for Chick's next one."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"A book written by the real deal instead of a bunch of lit majors, or so called computer experts that work for companies that no one has ever heard of. I saw the author at DefCon this year, and wish I had bought it then. I'd like to see more books by independents.hack on..."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"Why doesn't the author just write a book about shop lifting or being a pickpocket? Being a locksmith is a time-honored profession that passes down professional skills from teacher to student. Lock picking is not a sport and should never be considered as one. If you want to be a locksmith-then go to school-but don't pick locks for fun. Books like these should be burned and the authors jailed."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"The book's intended purpose as stated is to sell lockpicking as a competitive sport, or club. While I agree with the message, several problems made the book very nearly unreadable, and left me wondering why I'd spent money on what is so obviously an amateur web-page in bound form.As mentioned, much of the information is copy/pasted from one chapter to the next, up to and including diagrams and pictures, with no real reason for the repetition. I suppose the author might have wanted to illustrate how similar different types of locks are in function, but this is a poor way at best to do so. Additionally, numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes broke up whatever flow the book had, from the rapidly (and incorrectly) changing tenses in the author's anecdotes, to simpler mistakes such as 6this. [sic]If you find this book used, it might be worth the price. Still, if you have any idea already how a lock works, you're better off searching the web for How-To's and FAQ's. It's obvious the author does know the material, and that's what makes me most upset about the book. If he'd bothered to hire an editor, or even a proofreader, he would have improved the book's quality immeasurably, and perhaps made it more saleable."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"Very amateur printing and binding. Much of the information is repeated several times over verbatim... feels very much like the book was padded out to its length.The \\"for computer people\\" angle is a red herring. The author simply comments - repeatedly - on the similarity between exploiting flaws in locks and exploiting flaws in computer security protocols. This is never explored or elaborated upon, nor is lock picking explored from a particularly computerish angle.The information presented in the book is fairly clear, but there's very little of it. Furthermore, all of the information in the book is freely available - and better written - in several online guides.Overall, I'm quite disappointed. Not worth the money."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"This is not your average lockpicking tutorial and you'll find it to be useless unless you have a particular mindset. Written for the &quot;computer hacker&quot;, Steel Bolt Hacking is a title meant for people with a curious mind who want to learn to pick locks for sport and fun, not nessicarilly for profit or occupation. This title approaches the subject from that of a computer user, drawing conclusions and connections that today's avid computer user can both understand and apply to practice."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"First you have to realize that this is not a serious, in-depth lock picking book. It's a little handbook with about 100 pages. I've seen toaster manuals that were bigger. It will take you about 30 to 60 minutes to read through this book. Not only that, the production quality is horrible. From the formatting of pages to the author's writing style, everything about this book seems amateur. The author explains the subject of lock picking like he's trying to explain it to his friend, not like he's writing a serious text. I've seen FAQs and PDF files floating around on lock picking that were a hell of a lot better than this.You'd think that in a compact 100 page book that has to cover a lot of ground the author will use every page to it's fullest. But the author keeps repeating himself so many times it becomes ridiculous. Sometimes the author writes the exact same paragraph using slightly different words and there are times he copies and pastes the exact same text! There's even a full page picture the author put twice for no apparent reason.You might think that the author just didn't know better and forgot that he can just refer us to previous pages, but it's clear that he just tried to fill the book so it won't be even smaller. For example, there's a chapter on picking padlocks and then there's a chapter on picking deadbolt locks. It's essentially the same technique but sure enough the author repeats the whole chapter saying the same things all over again. Reading this book I got deja-vu feelings all the time. Also, why on earth did the author spend a whole page putting a table with all 100 combinations of HIS OWN SPECIFIC LOCK!To sum it up, if you don't have experience with lock picking you will not learn how to pick locks from this book. If you do have experience, you don't need this book. I've seen better texts on lock picking floating around the Internet and you can surely learn more on the subject from just googling."},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"A dreadful book. Full of mispellings, technical confusion and repetition.

The book sums up what the other books I bought on lock picking did, as well as the MIT lock picking guide, but has the advantage of naming other resources, groups and where to go for more help. If you are beyond the basics, I wouldn't recommend this book, although I am still looking for an advanced lock picking book myself. I've even contacted a few locksmiths, but all were very bitter and completely indifferent to an amateur learning lock picking. Maybe I would too if it were my profession--but who cares.I'll admit that I had a hard time with the math on cracking combination locks, but if you want a fast easy reading book to learn to pick locks, I would recommend getting this one to start with. The MIT guide is too basic and very old. My advice is; go to the authors website, www.thenetworkadministrator.com , because if you don't like his style of writing or are offended by his humor, than you're probably not going to like his book, but I do.My name is Barry Chapman, and I approve of this message!:-)"},{"Title":"Steel Bolt Hacking","review":"I had no previous experience with lockpicking, so in a sence I did actually learn something (=to open my pin-lock). That's what the book gets 1 star for. The same information is however also available for free on the Internet, just google for \\"lockpicking tutorial\\" or something similar.Otherwise the book was a mess to read. It repeats itself over and over again (just to add up more pages to the otherwise thin book on a meager subject). It even shows the same one-page pictures twice. The books is apparently written i MS Word and printed out without checking what it looked like before making the final print. There are pages where the picture is on one page and the figure-text on the next page. There are even pages where the title for some chapter is at the end of one page when the chapter starts on the next page. Using photoshop to fix the b/w pictures would have also been an option, the author has apparently not heard of before.There are so many small and big non-topic-related factors in this book that it disturbs the topic itself.

Some of these other reviews, as well as the Slashdot.org review, make me very suspicious about the author pumping up his own book. No one in their right mind could recommend this book! Whole chapters are repeated almost exactly word for word (and thats only one of the many complaints I have).Even with the repeated chapters, photos, techniques, and a multi-page chart in the back that lists every possible combination for a 5-key lock (no secrets here, its just: 1-1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-1-2, 1-1-1-1-3, ....) The book still comes to only around 100 (very small, with large print) pages and has, in the end, about 3 paragraphs total CONTENT.Anyone interested in lockpicking should look anywhere else than this book.

The US waged a war of attrition against both Japan and Germany and the 300,000 airplanes and 500,000 produced and trained was the key part of it since both enemies did not have an effective countermeasure against it because of the sheer numbers involved.It shows how both oceans protected our productive resources and how we were able to assemble these fantastic airplane factories which usually had around 50,000 on a well know airfield producing up to 60 airplanes a day.As a pilot and airplane enthusiast its really interesting how they assembled these aircraft which were the most complex to date in so little time in numbers never done again and probably never to be repeated in modern warfare. Its also interesting to see how women manned most of these positions on a temporary basis and then returned to become home keepers. There is even a section on how they shipped them overseas and I have seen a video on http://www.zenoswarbirdvideos.com/ which showed how they assembled a P-47 using nothing but the crate, hand tools and 20 men after transport in a liberty ship across the pond.Many of these factories still exist today and can be seen on google maps which adds yet another facet to this era including remnants of old airports next to the plant even if closed today.Overall a great read for enthusiasts like me."},{"Title":"Picture History of World War II American Aircraft Production (Dover Books on Transportation)","review":"This book contains a peek at the factory floors of the major American aircraft manufacturers of the second world war.

First and foremost, it is far more than a picture history. Yes, it is that, but it is far more. I did not expect it to have much text so I certainly did not expect it to have substantial and excellent text! This pictures are great and diverse and the prose, as I have said is excellent. I never tire of seeing the photographs of the huge factories with huge bombers crowed in. Yes, I expected to see many of those photos--and, of course, I was not disappointed. I suppose that I was most pleased to see great photographs of gliders and barrage balloons being manufactured! Those are really nice. The 258 photos are all very nicely captioned with most captions including very interesting and valuable information. Mr. Stoff tops off the great body of the book with five appendixes. true, they are short, but they are good. Appendix B, Aircraft production by year )304,887 overall) and my favorite Appendix E--Surviving aircraft. To my great surprise, he lists 31 PBYs as surviving in flying condition. I am amazed. Now I am looking to find where I can find a ride!

This system has you start your running count at -20, with -4 or higher as the \\"key\\" (The point at which you bet high). Using the KO method, after all of the decks are counted through the count will be +4. Does anyone else see the flaw here? Let's say you have a count of -3. This system tells you to bet high (Even suggesting 10 betting units!). But think about it, if a deck completely counted through will end up at +4, then there's a better chance that you'll be drawing low cards, meaning the dealer actually has the advantage. Put simply, if you use this system YOU WILL BE BETTING HIGH WHEN THE DEALER HAS THE ADVANTAGE. If I'm wrong then correct me, please. But I believe this is a very faulty system. If you win anything using it, count it off as luck. Eventually it will ruin you.This book explains other counting systems as being near impossible for the average person to learn; even explaining how difficult the Hi-Lo system is (Bull). The Hi-Lo system is still the easiest effective counting system (Explained well in Wong's \\"Professional Blackjack\\") with the Omega II being one of the most powerful (Beautifully explained in \\"Blackjack for Blood\\" by Bryce Carlson). I highly recommend either one of those two systems.There is a note in this book about the notion of blackjack books being put out by casinos to sort of sabotage counters with false tips.

The system is quite simple and could be explained clearly in a few pages of charts, but the authors have no idea how to make a clear explanation. It would take a conscious effort to make a simple idea any more confusing than has been done in KO Blackjack.Unfortunately, while the KO count system appears to be a good one -- combining ease of use with a fair amount of power -- the authors make it as difficult to learn as possible. There is a fair amount of information for beginners but, again, this information is better-presented in other volumes.I would strongly recommend that players at all levels go to another book. Advanced players will want a more powerful system, such as Omega II or Revere. Beginning-intermediate players might well want to use the KO system, but it's a lot easier to understand other simple systems such as Red 7.Nothing here against the KO system, which is a good one, or Ken Fuchs, who is reported to be a very nice guy and a learned and helpful blackjack expert.

Patently Vancura has little faith in his own method if he chooses to make money that way rather than at the tables.The KO system is very simple and this has made it very popular with players. The authors make a good case for stating that the % edge for using a professional level system rather than KO is small, say a few tenths of a percentage point. That is true-but what they don't tell you is that the gains from the use of a higher level system tend to increase like compound interest in a bank account, and this can make the difference between winning tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of $'s over time. The claim that K-O is superior to its nearest commercial rival, the hi-lo system, is frankly stupid and supported by data that massages statistics in a way many politicians would be proud of.You might think is just my opinion-and to some extent you'd be right. Then again, if you get a copy of Karel Janeck's SBA simulation software or Norm Wattenbergers CVSim you will see just how poorly KO performs against other count systems.I would recommend Wong's &quot;Professional Blackjack&quot; for those interested in pure counting, also John May's &quot;Get The Edge At Blackjack&quot; and James Grosjean's &quot;Beyond Counting&quot; for professional gambling methods with real money-making power."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"I've read a lot of BJ books and played the game all over the country with varying house rules. This book is a great guide. If you stick to basic strategy, except when the count calls for an adjustment, and remain unemotional about the money, you can make some cash. Have patience and stick to the system. The game can be beaten consistently enough for it to be a profitbale hobby. I recommend the book and these guidelines to anyone who wants to make a serious run at the 21 tables: 1.) Practice counting every chance you get; 2.) Play single or double deck until you master the count (it's easier to start this way because if you lose the count you don't have to wait long for the shuffle); 3.) Read as many books as you can and find your counting niche; 4.) Make sure you have the proper bankroll for your bet spread, above all else. The ultimate goal is to be able to count down a 6 or 8-deck shoe. Big decks make for longer runs with a positive count and better camouflage."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"The system present by Fuchs and Vancura is very easy to learn and also very strong. If you are struggling with the 'true count' conversion than this system could be for you. The book is very easy to read, and contrary to other reviews, the book is not written badly! One of the reviewers remarked that they don't explain where the values come from and warns against 'getting into' a system to quickly. I totally agree that you must do your homework, but if you don't have the ability to run the necessary simulations yourself, just check out Don Schlinger's 'Blackjack Attack' where he analyzes the KO system for you (the proof is in the simulations)! The bottom line is this book is easy to read, the system is easy to learn and can hold it's own when matched up against other systems.

It reduces the error rate to a manageable level and makes the counting so simple that I can drink, flirt with the waitresses, and still leave at 4am with a profit (usually, that is - there will always be the variance to contend with).I wrote a simulation that showed that with a 1 to 10 betting spread over 83 million hands, this system averages a 4.46% return - given a 6 deck shoe and the best common casino rules. Given the simplicity of the system, the rate under \\"real\\" conditions probably comes much closer to the optimum than most systems.The only bone I have to pick is that the explanations of the system were a little unclear, but after careful reading I was able to figure it out without too much trouble.There may be better systems, but this has got to be the best at balancing the human error rate against the efficiency of the system."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"Tired of losing on each trip to the big C?

I know, as many of you already do, that Blackjack does afford the player the best advantage out of any game in the casino. I have never sat down at a Blackjack table because I knew that without knowing the proper counting and basic strategy techniques, the house would always win in the long run. I had read on the Internet of various card-counting methodologies, however they all seemed to complicated and discouraging to ever consider seriously proceeding with (unless of course I had a degree from MIT, which I don't.)Alas, I read a review of Knock-Out in the Chicago Sun-Times, which alluded to my concerns over difficulty. This book is straightforward and interesting to read, and the card-counting technique is regarded as being simple to use comparatively to other popular techniques. Even though, admittedly, this will take some practice, I am confident I can master Knock-Out with enough patience and I am not discouraged to the point of not bothering to try. I did find it somewhat surprising how much money and time is needed to have an satisfactory amount of return with relatively low risk (the fact that you start to max your betting with only a 2% advantage over the house is a testament to this fact.) Nevertheless, the book only took a couple of days to read, and it was truly hard to set down. Even though this is the first Blackjack book I have ever read, from a beginner's prospective, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"This is a good book if you want to become a casual card counter.

My favorite part of Vancura and Fuchs's system is the fact that there is no need to clumsily estimate how many decks are left and divide that number into the running count to obtain the true count.

KO is not quite as powerful as Hi Opt and Omega in FLAWLESS play. For most players though, achieving flawless play will be much easier with KO.

Card counting is becoming difficult (or even impossible with continuous shuffler machines everywhere now), you need every edge you can get.The KO system presented in this book depends on a set of simulation data I'm sure the authors believe is valid, but shows serious evidence of sample bias. Recent work done on optimal betting theory, which allows a fair comparison of blackjack systems, shows that the KO method is extremely weak. The claim that KO can, for example, seriously challenge the dominance of Bryce Carlson's complex and powerful AOII system is just ridiculous.This may be a good system for players who care little about winning, but then not counting may be a good option for these players also. There is no free lunch.

I figure, why waste my time learning one system if I will eventually move on to another, more advanced system? Just start with the High-Low from the beginning!But I have finally made my decision, and I feel this advice might help others trying to make the same decision. Is the K-O good enough to learn, or should you look elsewhere? Well, I'm no expert, but I have come to the conclusion, after reading much about counting systems, that it really makes no difference which system you use. The difference in expectation is very small, not to mention the potential for error in the more complicated systems like Omega II or APC. Even in a simpler level-1 count like High-Low, there remains that god-awful true count conversion (more room for error and delay). Of course, if you really want to play professional blackjack, you might want to eventually (or even right from the beginning) move to a balanced count system. But I have decided that while I want to play blackjack with an advantage, I never want the game to become a chore. I don't want to hate playing it. Therefore, it is not necessary for the recreational/casual player to learn anything more than an unbalanced count. Even if it's not the K-O system, you shouldn't worry about learning an advanced balanced count. The K-O system performs on par with all other similar systems, so the decision between which to learn is up to you (there is the Red 7 count and the Black Ace count, for example).Now, as far as this particular book goes, I think it is fantastically written and presented. I read another review that says the book is poorly organized, but I honestly don't understand where that person is coming from. The book presents the K-O in steps, and by the end you will understand it. (My only complaint is that there are a few incarnations of the K-O count, eventually all coming together to form the K-O Preferred system, and it is not always easy to know what exactly is involved with each incarnation.) It may be necessary to re-read it, but if you plan to seriously learn to count cards, then you should expect to read it several times anyway. Another complaint I saw was that the authors do not explain why they assign the values that they do to particular cards. But this is also simply not true. Vancura and Fuchs give you a chart that shows the player/dealer expectation when certain cards are removed from the pack, and it is on the basis of this information that they assign +1 to 2-7 and -1 to 10, J, Q, K, A.Anyway, if you are interested in learning a simple but powerful count that will perform well for recreational play, you definitely should read this book. It is wonderful. But not only that, the K-O is also considered a \\"professional\\" level count, so it cannot be written-off as a system not to take seriously. There is work to be done to learn it efficiently. And as Stanford Wong said in \\"Blackjack Secrets\\" (I believe it was that book), as long as you know a count that keeps track of low cards compared to high cards, then you are using a good system and do not need to move up to one that is supposedly more \\"powerful\\". (Of course, he wrote this before the K-O count was created, but I would still include it in his assessment). Besides, these systems that are \\"more powerful\\" are only theoretically so, and I think a lot can be said for the fact that because K-O is so simple, it may work more efficiently than even more advanced count systems."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"This book explains the Knock-Out (\\"K-O\\") set of point count values, which you use to determine when to raise your bet and by how much. Traditional card counting methods, such as the Hi-Lo, require you to compute a \\"true\\" count, which is the running count divided by the number of decks remaining to be dealt. But this type of computation can lead to errors since (1) you have to estimate the number of decks in the discard tray in order to be able to calculate the number of decks remaining to be dealt, and (2) you must then mentally divide the running count by the number of decks remaining. And you have to do all of this quickly enough so the casino personnel don't become suspicious that you are an advantage player; otherwise you risk being barred from playing blackjack at that casino.The K-O, like the Hi-Lo, is a one-level counting method in that the point count value for each card is either 0, 1, or -1. High cards (10s and Aces) are counted as -1, neutral cards as zero, and low cards as 1. As the count gets more and more positive, the remaining cards to be dealt contain a greater number of high cards versus low cards. This means your chance of getting a blackjack is higher than right after a shuffle, and thus you should increase your bet to take advantage of this opportunity. But with the K-O, as opposed to the Hi-Lo, you do not have to compute a true count. You simply add the 0, 1, and -1 values as the cards are dealt to calculate the running count. Then you use just the running count alone to determine your bet for the next round. There is no need to track either the number of decks in the discard tray or the number of decks remaining to be dealt, and, almost too wonderful for words, there is no headache-inducing, \\"dividing in your head\\" required!Amazingly, even with the simplicity of just using a running count to determine your bet amounts, the K-O provides about the same win rate as the Hi-Lo! I know this from running simulations on the excellent Blackjack 6-7-8 software written by Hal Marcus. By the way, I thought I died and went to heaven when I discovered the Blackjack 6-7-8 strategy cards. Just like the K-O count makes the betting decisions easier, these strategy cards make the playing decisions unbelievably easier. First of all, they look marvelous, and they feel like butter! But seriously, you just find the table that corresponds to the rules where you'll be playing, and then the large, easy to read, easy to remember, 3-letter, color-coded decision cells (including surrender, if you please) practically make the memorizing fun! If I have some time to practice, the Blackjack 6-7-8 software is the best, but when I keep putting it off until it's time to board the big bird from Chicago bound for Vegas, then I just whip out a strategy card, choose the table I want, and I can know it cold before the pilot says \\"fasten your seat belts, we're getting ready to land\\".Now could you increase your win rate by using more complex counting methods than the K-O? Sure, in theory, but more complex counting methods increase the chance of making errors which can quickly nullify the benefit of using such a counting method. With regard to the betting guidelines in the book, I would amend them to use a bet ratio of 1 to 8 for 2 decks (instead of 1 to 5) and 1 to 16 for 6 and 8 decks (instead of 1 to 10), since in my 30 years of experience I have found that most casinos are usually tolerant of these bet ratios.The authors' advice is valuable, their writing is easy to follow, and I like the humorous sidebars sprinkled throughout the book, such as the gumball analogy in Chapter 3 to explain why card counting works. But the K-O count methodology is simply superior, and that's really why I find it valuable to use the K-O count, along with the superb Blackjack 6-7-8 strategy cards from Stickysoft (search on: blackjack basic strategy), to make it as easy as possible for me to \\"get the edge\\" over the house!"},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"Overall, this is an excellent book for casual or recreational players who want a simple BJ system, based on card counting, that will provide them with a definite edge over the house. The K-O System presented in the book is a level-1, &quot;unbalanced&quot; system that is as easy to use as it gets. The authors, Vancura and Fuchs, cover the basics of card counting and casino comportment in a very clear, concise manner. So, unless your goal is to play at the pro or semi-pro level, this may be all the BJ book you need. My only real criticism of this book is the disingenuous way the authors exaggerate the power of the K-O System. It's a good system, but, Vancura and Fuchs to the contrary, it can not and does not compare to real powerhouse systems such as Carlson's Advanced Omega II System, or Uston's Advanced Point Count. And, actually, there wasn't any real need to overstate the power of the K-O System; considering its ease of use, it's plenty powerful for most players."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"In terms of books that can take you from knowing almost nothing about blackjack to becoming a skilled player, there are two that I have found to be the best: Knock Out Blackjack by Fuchs and Vancura and Best Blackjack by Frank Scoblete. Scoblete's book is the more enjoyable and entertaining. However, the Knock Out book has a counting system that is truly easy to learn. My advice is to get both. Scoblete is a warrior who has been in the casino wars. His diary at the end of the book is priceless and his insights into what it is like to play in casinos is the best I have ever read. Fuchs and Vancura, on the other hand, have created a simple but powerful card counting system in KO that I have been using with great success for over eight months now.

So, let me share with you my experience. Not only have I read this book, I have actually USED the system. Not only have I used this system, I have also used Hi-Low, and Hi-Low OptI. This book specifically tells you why he wrote it from the beginning, and mentioned all the ins and outs of the count. It is well written, and if you have IQ over 50, you'll understand it. Now the real story.Basically unbalanced count was developed for the \\"real\\" world. Why, try Hi-Low OptI count for 8 hours at a packed casino. Try going there 8pm on friday night, and see if you'll find a table with 3 players only. LOL. You won't. Hi-Low OptI is very draining on your mental fatigue, I doubt even 20 year pros can keep doing it for that long. What they have to do is, do it for an hour and move on to another casino, or table after break. Same with Hi-Low, although easier, it is mentally taxing. I actually sat at a same table ($15) and played for 8 hours straight using KO. It's taxing, but not so much as balanced system. That's what it is designed for.The book comes out telling you that it's not good as balanced count system, but by miniscule fraction! BJinsider did a great article (i think it's newsletter 29 - free) that showed how KO, Red7, BlackA did against Hi-Low on a 6-deck. Hi-Low was .68% gain, vs .67% for Red7, .65% for KO and .63% for BlackA. The great thing is you don't have to take his word for it. You can download some of these testing softwares or buy it, and run the test yourself, and you should get a similar results.Now, the final point. All these statistics for counting are using A LARGE # of hands played, to minimize noise and get the actual true \\"worth\\" of the system. Remember, you have to play over million hands to actually see these results. .65% is little over 1% advantage over the house. You ain't going to make thousands consistently playing 500-600 hands a week. That why there was the mit \\"TEAM\\". They main objective is to get as many hands played possible (they also cheated little using team work, but we'll leave that for another day). If you can get 45-60 hands/hour, you can probably play 10-12 hours/day with break in between. that's like 600 hands avg a day. You have to play 7x600 = 4200 hands. 4200x50 = 210K hands. Do that for 5 years, and maybe you'll stiff 6 figure gain. You want a LIFE like that? (exaggerating little bit, but you get the point)So, what I'm trying to say is KO is a GREAT system for casual players, as this book was written for. It's also a good system for pros, since it's similar to Hi-Low in returns. Don't expect to leave the casinos with a whad of cash, if you're lucky it can happen. I once made over $2k playing $15 table in 2.5 hours. So, it's possible with KO. But you gotta be lucky too. Because I've also been busted couple of times too ($400 max each session). It's over the long haul he's talking about. Oh, unbalanced system becomes more accurate as deeper you penetrate the deck, so don't go crazy early on. wait for 3-4 decks to be gone, so each deck you'll only have 2 or 3 chances to bet big. That's still good enough if you get lucky, since odds are with you. I played many shoes that I didn't even get to bet big, it's ok. This is the grind. Big spreads are best, but can get heat, so learn some stealth from this book or other books. Go there to have fun, make some money if you are lucky, just don't expect to be rich unless you plan on 12h x 7d x 50wks x50yrs BJ life. Hope this helps.Edit: I forgot to add this tidbit, since I mostly play AC and they only have shoe games. But for 1 or 2 deck games, I'd recommend learning the Hi-Low as you want more accurate count then. But for shoes games KO and Red7 is just as nice."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"The first time I used K-O, I made $342 in less than 1.5 hours (8 deck shoe game, $15-75 bet spread). Now, you can argue whether or not K-O is as powerful as other card counting systems, but I think there are 2 undisputable facts: K-O is easier to learn than other systems and K-O is definitely easier to use. With the disclaimer that I already know the Hi-Low system, I learned the mechanics of the K-O system in less than a day and I went to a casino and tried K-O without any practice beforehand.Because cards are dealt up in shoe games, the play is faster than in hand held (single and double deck) games which are dealt face down. With card counting systems that require frequent mental calculations there is the propensity for being pressured for time and the possibility of losing the count unless the player is very proficient. A system may be more powerful and have a greater expectation than K-O, but that does no good if the player loses the count and has to flat bet for the rest of the shoe. K-O does away with much of the mental gymnastics required by other systems. There is less time pressure to keep up with the dealer and less concentration needed. Mental fatigue becomes a nonfactor and there is the additional benefit of a player's cover being enhanced since he doesn't have to spend all his time concentrating on the cards.I enjoyed using K-O. For me, it is now the weapon of choice against shoe games."},{"Title":"Knock-Out Blackjack: The Easiest Card-Counting System Ever Devised (Gambling Theories Methods)","review":"In the decades since Edward Thorp discovered card-counting theorists have been trying to create the holy grail of count systems:- a perfect blend of simplicity and power. K-O is that system. Its main strength is that it does not require the player to perform &quot;True Count&quot; conversion, which requires you to divide the player advantage suggested by your count system by the number of decks remaining, for many the most difficult and frustrating aspect of the process. Yet despite its simplicity KO is the most powerful level-1 betting system created.Olaf Vancura and Ken Fuchs are highly respected blackjack experts.

The new blackjack player will have to spend some time (2-3 months) training, but once the Preferred and Betting strategies are ingrained, the results are spectacular. Here is my &quot;study&quot; of real-time KO play in Vegas. I played a 6-deck shoe with insurance, late surrender, using a scaled betting strategy of 6 units per 1% advantage (ramp of 6), and going out to a maximum of 20 betting units. In addition I used the &quot;bad shoe&quot; exit strategy (sit out bad shoes). KO played in this manner had a positive expectancy &gt; 0.73%. In the real world, I have won 6 consecutive outings using strictly the KO system. In addition the avg. profit is about 3-4 times the base bet per hour (using the above criteria) in my experience. Each of my outing for KO was played with a minimum of 200 betting units and 20 hours minimum playing time. Each KO outing consisted of at least 1600 hands. Win accuracy &gt; 70% in # of rounds played (3-hr session = 1 &quot;round&quot;). I never had a drawdown in equity of &gt; 40 betting units at any one point in time (with my initial 200 betting units). My max bet was 14 betting units in one hand, and most never exceeded 10 betting units. Finally, minimal pit boss heat since most plays are consistent with basic strategy.You must play aggressively and follow the precise play &amp; betting strategies correctly! But KO is very easy to learn and master. One can get significantly better results using the same betting scale on more accurate systems like APC or AO-II (avg. of 10-20 times base bet per hour in expected profits due to the much higher playing accuracy and expectancies), but it does take much more effort to track the True Count and multiple level-counts. For recreational CONSISTENT &amp; PROFITABLE playing, KO is tough to beat. If you want to be in the top 0.5% of all players, then learn AO-II, Uston APC, or Revere APC systems.Good luck and train hard!

My interest is in developing financial trading systems, but many of the gurus of finance are reportedly enamoured with blackjack and gaming theory. I picked up this book, suggested by Amazon, to gain insight into how the system was developed and the statistics involved. I have tried to read through card counting books in the past but found them far too complicated for my limited brain. I was extremely impressed with not only the Knock Out Blackjack system but in how the authors take us through an explanation of the game, the traditional strategy, and other card counting methods in a very clear and concise way. The K-O Blackjack system is very simple to learn and implement. There book contains plenty of examples and an extensive Appendix section in the back to ensure that all the points are grasped completely by readers. The K-O system is all about identifying the times when the player does or does not have a statistical advantage; loading up on bets when there is a higher probability of success and lowering betting or exiting a game when the odds are not in the player's favor. I was riveted to this excellent book and immediately saw ways to incorporate its principles of how to identify favorable conditions and its money-management strategies to my own investment models.

I applied the basic concept before really learning the system and walked away with a big win the first time. So I was hooked in and learned the complete system. And moved up to larger bets. Within six months of starting to play just basic strategy, I was kicked out of a casino for \\"having play that was too strong.\\" A pit boss, flanked by two security guards, told me after calling me to step away from the table, \\"You are not permitted to play table games here any longer.

I laughed to myself on my way out of the casino, thinking that I had just been rewarded a priceless conversation piece and a good reason to stay out of that smoky environment and pursue finer things. Here several years later now, I can report that I have amused numerous friends and acquaintances and groups of strangers describing that scene. And answering their subsequent questions. The story value alone was well worth the price of the book!!... Truth is, as you will learn if you dig very deep into advantage play, it is a complete grind.

Endo shows the different reactions which many Japanese felt in response to the experiments. There is a medical viewpoint and a military viewpoint as well as a religious aspect and viewpoint of &quot;normal&quot; citizens. It is scarey that something of such horrendous caliber could ever occur. Endo describes with enough detail to convey the atrocity, but the focus is upon the morality of the issue."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"This dark novel by Endo explores the anguished feelingsof various doctors and nurses in a fictional Japanesehospital during the second World War.

The book culminates with all of the characters takingpart in the horrendous vivisection of an American prisoner ofwar. Although the prose of the novel is as concise and brutal asa scalpel, it never loses its disquieting beauty.This work isa searing tragedy about the death of goodness as a result ofambition, exigency, and human weakness."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"Without once making specific or explicit reference to Catholicism, Shusaku Endo's membership in the Mystical Body of Christ is as clear as mountain water. With superb craftsmanship and artistry, Endo depicts the nightmarish results of living one's life without seeking and obtaining that membership, without obedience to the commandments of the Lord and the teachings of His Church.No, it's not a question of being holier than thou -- after all, we're all sinners. Rather, it's a question of knowing the difference between right and wrong, between good and evil, and not pretending that there is no difference, or that the inverse might be true, or that there is no truth at all.According to Endo, the character Suguro can go no further. But we can. If we don't shake off this diabolical disorientation, we can sink deeper and deeper into the sea of poison; wander further and further through the sinister halls of our own Fukuoka University Medical School.I liked this book much more than what is generally considered Endo's masterpiece, \\"Silence\\", so poorly translated by the Christophobic William Johnston. Michael Gallagher, translator of \\"The Sea and Poison\\", also pays some homage to oh-so trendy Christophobia. His is not as egregious as Johnston's, however, and he's a much more careful translator."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"This was a good book, but not what I had expected from it...maybe I had different expectations.

Still a good book despite missing MY expectations."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"My compliments to the reviewers who have contributed to the further publicity of this harrowing and psychologically complex novel, an exploration of those who have denounced their spirituality in exchange for social acceptance, and the consequences they have to suffer. I would like to just add one side note. There is an excellent film adaptation of SEA AND POISON, directed by Kumai Kei in 1986. Because of the controversial subject matter, no major studio would finance the film and it took Kumai years to finish it. (It would certainly not be made in today's Japan, considering the strength of revisionists and glorifiers of the imperial past) This movie has also been nearly completely neglected in the US, no doubt due to its unflinching realism, thoroughly unexotic visuals and political content, something we do not expect from the country mostly known to us through bubblehead animation, Power Rangers and Godzilla. Please do seek it out, if you have wherewithal to do so, and show it to as many Americans (and Chinese, etc.) as you can. I believe the US distrubtor in 1987 was Gates Films."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"Obedience to authority and power leads people to harm others, and not being able to resist authority of someone higher is human weakenss. It seems that the Intern named Toda is the one Endo wanted to emphasize upon. The charactor of Toda remainds me of Albert Camus's &quot;The Stranger,&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Devils,&quot; and it can also be related to other charactors Endo draws in his other novels. Can people feel guilty without punishment of the society? What is morality? What is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in such an absurd world like today?There is a sequel to The Sea and Poison. I do not believe that it is published in the United States, but it is about Dr. Suguro's later life. People judge him and punish him under the name of &quot;democracy&quot; and its &quot;justice.&quot; Dr. Suguro ends up hanging himself. Can people judge and punish others? If judging and blaming are the meaning of justice, how does it differ from what is unjust?I am Japanese, and I personally think that Endo is the best writer from our country. I strongly recommend all his work to Americans."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"Endo creates a haunting portrait of characters caught up in the vivisection of an American prisoner of war during the latter days of the Pacific War and their reactions to their crime. Through the separate narrations of each character, we see how the nihilism that swept Japan's prewar intelligentsia prepared each character for his or her role in the vivisection. Evocative of the understatement in Camus's &quot;The Stranger,&quot; Endo's characters relate their stories in straight line, cinematic narrations which reveal the desensitivity to life and suffering that Japan's prewar society had conditioned them to, and in doing so Endo offers readers a sober warning of the dangers of living in a moral vacuum."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"Condition of human hearts is so fragile yet too stubbon. This is a fiction losely based on what happened in Unit 731 (Japanese Imperial Army) in Manchuria where live vivisection and human experimentation were performed for development of biological weapon. Doctors were young, innocent and ambitious then and commited henious sins on POWs sometimes willingly but somtimes under pressure. This type of internal human battle does not stop here, it's in every hearts in every countries. Endo is a devoted chatholic and he looks into human hearts from an angle where we don't want God to see."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"Edmund Burke would have agreed with Endo's novel \\"The Sea and Poison\\". Although a short novel, it is one that delves into some very deep issues about morality and the ethics of passively accepting evil in one's presence.Contrary to another review, \\"The Sea and Poison\\" is not based on the activities of Unit 731 in Manchuria at all. The novel is based on the vivisection of 8 B29 crewmen at Fukuoka Imperial University. These experiments involved removal of lung tissue, puncturing hearts and other experiments, while the airmen were alive. None survived the experiments.Returning to the novel, Endo focuses on a medical intern, Suguro, and his friend Toda. Both characters represent very different responses to the proposal to vivisect the airmen. Toda feels no guilt or remorse, and has no issue with taking part. It is not even matter of justifying it to hinmself: he just has little response in his conscience. Suguro, on the other hand, is flooded with doubt, ethical problems, and his own conscience. Shown to be a basically kind man, the novel reinforces Burke's suggestion that all evil needs is for good men to do nothing.A burning look into the morality of the passive, \\"The Sea and Poison\\" will challenge and provoke. Despite its brevity, it packs a punch, and will leave you thinking for long after you have turned the last page. As usual, Endo has written a fantastic novel with real weight."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"When the sanctity of life is not honored, no one is safe, as the characters keep saying -- &quot;Today everybody's on the way out. ... What's the point,then, of pitying ... .&quot; As Endo implies, everybody is ALWAYS on some point of the continuum from birth to death so we are all in jeopardy when the Modernist utilitarian philosophy is applied. It is only a matter of changing the definition of who is no longer &quot;qualified&quot; to live. People steeped in such a system have no defense, no final moral keep or fortress from which to defy a system based on such principles and say &quot;No.&quot; All social interaction and politics becomes mere maneuvering to control the decision-making machinery to avoid being politcally or legally &quot;defined&quot; out of humanity. After reading Gitta Sereny's &quot;Into That Darkness (a biography of Treblinka Commandant Franz Stangl), Endo's fiction rings out as basic human truth."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"SEA AND POISON by Shusaku EndoReading Shusaku Endo's Sea and Poison was such a delightful experience I was reluctant to close the book. Granted, it is sad to read about cruel and heartless experiments on living human beings but that is not what the book is about. From the vantage point of Japanese/Christian culture Endo courageously shines his compassionate light into the dark crevices of our souls and makes us confront our own demons nesting there. In doing so he helps us become better persons. Robert Wright in his often quoted The Moral Animal points out that \\"Human beings are a species splendid in their array of moral equipment, tragic in their propensity to misuse it, and pathetic in their constitutional ignorance of the misuse.\\" Endo does us a service by diminishing our \\"constitutional ignorance of the misuse\\" [of our moral equipment]\\"Endo traces the inner development of his characters with such a deep understanding of the human condition that I was astounded and moved to tears and joy. He placed two aspiring medical doctors, Toda and Sugura in a University hospital in southern Japan now seemingly under the control of the military establishment. The end of the Japanese/American war was quickly approaching. Daily bombing of the nearby city flattened the city and killed thousands of civilians and gave rise to implacable hatred directed towards two enemy airmen the military captured and brought to the hospital for experiments to determine how much could be surgically removed from a person before the person died. Toda and Sugura are assigned to assist the chief medical doctor who controls the future of the two aspiring doctors. Endo explores how Toda and Sugura deal with the conflicting demands of society, the medical establishment the nation and their conscious. Endo gently opens a window into their souls and allows us to witness the mighty clash between the demands of self preservation and the importuning of their conscious.Endo writes so evocatively, with such elegance and grace and without a trace of judgment or preaching it was like reading a book length haiku. I recommend that the readers read Bushido the Soul of Japan by Inazo Nitobe, (it's in the public domain and several sources allow a free download). Reading Inazo gave me a deeper and broader understanding of Endo's perspective and I intend to return to reading his books."},{"Title":"The Sea and Poison: A Novel","review":"This short, dark, psychologically gripping novel is an indictment of militarism and its corrupting effect on the individual and society. The old, the young, the innocent, the pure of heart, caregivers, families, traditions, institutions - all will be degraded if not destroyed by it.

In fewer than 200 pages of lean prose, the book explores the moral dynamics of group of doctors and nurses who perform lethal experiments on POWs at the behest of the Japanese Army. One doctor is corrupted by ambition; another lives only for social approval; one nurse is worn down by a hard life and a bad marriage; almost everyone is numbed by the mass death caused by air raids and diminished by the tendency of medical practitioners to see patients as things rather than people. The upshot: a group of morally lobotomized persons conform to a perverted work environment at the cost of their humanity and professional duties. It's a disturbing story. The setting is believable, the psychology acute, and the message topical: in fact, it's hard to read \\"The Sea and the Poison\\" and not think of CIA agents and private contractors torturing prisoners at Bagram, Guantanamo, and secret sites in Europe. Most of all, the book makes you think. Can there be higher praise for a work of art?

It's lively, wise, practical, and thorough. With a minor exception, BLVPN is an unqualified triumph.One of the book's amazing features is its willingness to not rehash &quot;common knowledge.&quot; In other words, BLVPN assumes people who read books on Linux VPNs know something about two subjects: (1) Linux and (2) networking. Therefore, BLVPN doesn't waste time teaching the reader how to use the command line, and it doesn't include yet another boring description of the OSI model. Instead, BLVPN launches straight into practical, operational instructions for creating virtual private networks. I would like to see other authors adopt this approach!Some of the book's key strengths include troubleshooting hints, clear diagrams, directory listings for key files, complete sample configuration scripts, and discussions of advantages and disadvantages of various VPN solutions. Furthermore, the text is supported by a web site with copies of the scripts available for download.Because each chapter is a self-contained unit for each VPN technology, readers can pick a solution and begin immediate implementation. No other VPN book delivers implementation-grade advice like this.My only regret was a failure to mention interoperability with BSD-based IPSec implementations. I would have loved to see a chapter on matching FreeS/WAN for Linux with KAME/racoon for FreeBSD. The authors should also consider describing how to configure Windows 2000/XP in IPSec tunnel mode to interoperate with IPSec on Linux and/or FreeBSD. Additionally, I believe I found typos in the figures on pages 168-9. I expect the book's web site errata page to publish a correction, if necessary.If you need to build host-host, host-network, or network-network VPNs using Linux (or really any open source platform), &quot;Building Linux VPNs&quot; is your book.

My kindergartener and I checked out a dozen books from our local library and almost all were Halloween-themed. This particular title was a fun read. Tuck the pig is planning a haunted house for Halloween but his sister Bunny keeps annoying him. Tuck eventually gets everything prepared and has a fun time with his friends before they begin hearing strange sounds. When Tuck sees a strange white apparition come towards him, he begins screaming until the apparition's true identity is revealed.Filled with delightful illustrations, the story is a perfect read for Halloween. Bunny and Tuck are reminiscent of typical squabbling siblings and young children will easily relate to them. The author gets creative with the descriptions of grapes for eyeballs, icky gooey decorations, and many more. This is a fun Halloween story!"},{"Title":"Tuck's Haunted House","review":"I stumbled upon this book at our library just before Halloween and my 2 and 3 1/2 year old girls loved it so much I had to buy it for them.

Halloween is a big holiday around our house so I was glad to find a book about it that my girls enjoyed so much. It's scary but not too scary for them and the relationship between the two main characters is realistic and endearing."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of Heroes: Coach Bob Shannon and the East St. Louis Flyers","review":"Two big thumbs up for \\"The Right Kind of Heroes: Coach Bob Shannon and the East St. Louis Flyers.\\" Although Coach Shannon has apparently moved on, this book is still as -- or perhaps more -- relevant to those facing battles against the odds.Expertly penned by St. Louis columnist Kevin Horrigan, the book does a remarkable job of putting the reader right in the middle of the dingy and dangerous town of East St. Louis. It's a real \\"you are there\\" feeling as you get to know the players and coach of this amazing team. Although the story is heartbreaking at times, you won't hear Horrigan break out the violins and wax overdramatic... just a solid real-life story.Even if you're not a sports nut -- or only know a little about football -- you will be inspired as you laugh, cry, struggle and celebrate with this courageous coach and champion football team.

Although tasked by a millionaire to sale his private yacht in the waters about South America, Cambell took it upon himself to, ostensibly, follow the course of H.M.S Beagle on it's historic voyage around the world. Although it accomplished only a very small part of that objective, those already familiar with Darwin's \\"Voyage of the Beagle\\" will nonetheless appreciate this book. It provides modern day photographs and descriptions of several key places, particularly around Tierra del Fuego and the Falklands. It was a modern voyage on a modern yacht with every conceivable luxury such as central air, dishwashers, daily showers - to say nothing of GPS and satellite radio. But still the voyage of the Thallassi in waters that were as dangerous today as they were then, was no \\"cake walk\\". Although Campbell has nothing really brilliant or new to say or add to the Beagle's voyage, he does acknowledge what must have been brilliant navigational skills and inspired seamanship of Captain Fitzroy. Interestingly, at least to me, was what Campbell - he like most men of our time or of any time - didn't say, or even what was said of the scenery and flora and fauna that passed by. It emphasized all the more how special the voyage of the Beagle really was; how special it's commander, it's crew, it's artists, and especially how special Darwin himself really was. That is how history is made."},{"Title":"Good Style: Writing for Science and Technology, Second edition (Routledge Study Guides)","review":"Note first this review is based on 2nd Edition Paperback version which cost me about 18 (UK).

It is not a reference guide but it covers a lot of common problems that one comes across when writing technical documents, such as excessive nominalization, abstraction, excessive use of premodifiers etc. So it is a good background into the reasons why these things are wrong and it gives suggestions as to solutions.

We find that Hornblower struggles with guilt feelings and is ashamed of some of his feelings and actions. He is clearly human.

Can Hornblower somehow with a wounded man it tow somehow escape a squad of French soldiers and their cruel officer and return to the white cliffs of Dover?Since this is not the last book in the series we of course know the answer. A book with style and class, and with Hornblower still not shaking the fears and phobias or his future which seem to forever haunt him.We also see the character of Brown developed more fully as a feature of the series. The playing off of Brown physical abilities and the class differences between him and the officers make for great reading.Not to be missed. Of course you can say that about every book in the series."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Flying colors begins where Ship of the Line left off. Hornblower is in a Spanish prison in Rosas after sacrificing his ship Sutherland by attacking and destroying an enemy fleet. Along with his loyal lieutenant Bush and his servant Brown, Hornblower is soon loaded on a carriage for the trip to Paris where he is to be hanged as a public display by Napoleon. But of course it's hard to hang a man when the author is on his side. The carriage breaks down in a snowstorm and as luck would have it there is a river and a boat nearby. Always a man of action Hornblower makes his escape and stumbles into the home of a left over royal sympathizer who helps his party to hide until spring when they can make their way down river and escape. In the French port, Hornblower assumes the identity of a Dutch officer, commandeers a captured English cutter, Witch of Endor, and a crew of slave laborers to sail out of the harbor under French noses. Despite his constant self doubt he returns triumphantly to England where he finds out that during his absence his wife died, his beloved Barbara's husband died, and instead of losing his rank for losing his ship he is knighted to the order of the bath for heroism (and politics). The detail of ships and sailing in the early 19th century make the Hornblower series must reading for any man who loves the sea."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"I have been reading this series one after the other. I read them in the biographical order of Hornblower's life.This book immediately follows Ship of the Line in which Hornblower has just fought a tremendous battle against overwhelimg odds. As might be expected, he had to &quot;Strike&quot; his colors at the end of the battle.In this book, he is a prisoner of Bonaparte's government. The story takes him from the castle at Rosas, scene of his final engagement, all the way to central France. In Paris, he will face a military trial on his &quot;acts of piracy&quot; and will then be executed along with his first lieutenant, Bush.Along the way, He, Bush and their servant escape. They find refuge in the home of a local French nobleman that has no liking for the Bonapart government. After recovering their strength and waiting out the winter, they make their way down the river to the Bay of Biscay. Once there, Hornblower daringly captures an armed cutter (which was recently captured from the British) and makes his way to sea.He is then picked up by the channel fleet. He now faces a courts martial for his role in the loss of the Sutherland. I won't go into the details of the trial, but since there are further books in the series, you can assume he was not handled too roughly.As an aside, Bush is finally made a post captain. Hornblower's wife Marie took ill during his absence and has gone to another world. His remaining son is now with Lady Barbara. He gets to meet the Prince Regent and is knighted. Admiral Leighton has been killed in a daring raid on the ships that Hornblower had crippled in the previous book.Only one disappointing feature of this book. Nearly the whole book takes place on land. There is a sea battle, but it is seen through the eye of Hornblower while he is a prisoner at the fort at Rosas.Other than that, it is still a good read and fits in well the series so far."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"They didn't teach history like this in school.

Ugh. Thankfully, after a long hiatus, I picked up again with FLYING COLOURS. What a wonderful book! One of my favorite in the series, it chronicles Hornblower's adventures after losing the Sutherland and having to escape from France, where he is slated for execution. (And if you were one of those who enjoyed HH mooning after Lady Barbara and dissing his wife, there's more of that in this book. Whatever. I'm over it.)Love this series. On to the next!"},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"There is a problem reading this book, in chronological order, on a Kindle. There is no Volume 6 or Volume 7. I did not bother to buy the paperbacks of those volumes. Why would I? I have no room for paper books. Besides, the WHOLE saga should be available as e-books. WTF is wrong with publishers! Do they want to alienate all readers? Anyway, to the story..It may be because I didn't read the missing e-volumes, but this book started out slow and ended up being frantic. Right off the bat, Hornblower is a prisoner. The reader doesn't really find out what transpired until the court martial. Right after the court martial, HH is off to London, many stops enroute, a rushed visit to his dead wife's grave, cheering peers and civilians, pompous politicians, being knighted, etc. I do like it that Bush gets his post captaincy. He is the character that puts a balance to HH. I enjoyed the middle of the story best: his trip to be hung, his escape, his affair, his way out of France, his sailing off in a recaptured ship, his squeamishness with Bush's amputation, etc.This book does, however, really delve into Hornblower's mind, much more than earlier books. He has a sense of honor and loyalty and humbleness that are in conflict with dealings with wife and non-wives, distaste for politics, patience. I am no doing this review justice, so I will stop. The above are only brief thoughts and I would have to think too much to do justice to a review of this book and I do not feel like thinking."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"C.S. Forester was the Father of Naval Fiction. Critics of Hornblower portrayed in Flying Colors, have to realize that a \\"Kings Man\\" in the Royal Navy had to be just as well versed in life on the coastal areas and rivers as being in mid Atlantic. It comes with the territory. My first novel True Colors, set during the war of 1812 has five major sea battles; but in my second Shadow on the Water, half the story is set on land in Boston, with only two sea battles. As an author who trys to stay true to their plot, it's all about the story; the story; the story. Forester was a great inspiration to me although I always thought Hornblower was a bit too involved in self analysis. Forgive the pun, but whatever floats your boat.Valerie RoosaAuthor: True ColorsShadow on the WaterA Cross for this LandEditor of Day Star Art & Publishing"},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"The Hornblower books are a great Napoleonic War era British Navy series. I definitely recommend the series if you like this genre.This Hornblower is so far the one I've liked the least. It's not too eventful until the end. I think it was meant to show Hornblower in new situations (not just another battle, he spends most of the book hiding in France) to highlight additional facets of his personality. Kudos for trying to develop the character better but I can't say I learned much new about him. Still, worth reading if you like the series.I have given this book a 4 but it was close to a 3. For me, a 5 is a book that 1) I would recommend to others regardless of whether they read the genre and 2) will most likely reread again in the near future. A 4 is one that 1) I'd recommend if they like the genre and 2) may read again.

If they do escape and make it back to England, he will face court-martial for surrendering his ship to the enemy. Will he find help among the French or will he be on his own? Will Bush, who was crippled in the last bloody battle on the Sutherland, live long enough to see England again?"},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"The premise of the book leaves Hornblower without a ship and defeat in the hands of French forces. He is to be sent to French for trial and execution. This book wasn't as entertaining as previous books in the series. The misery is still a recurring theme in Forester's books and the author also toys with Hornblower's torn feelings between two women in England as well as another he runs into in France. Hornblower worries about Bush, his court martial, his wife, Lady Barbara, his unborn child which served as the tension in the story. This really didn't serve the book in making it exciting yet in series like this you'll get a book that serves as a transition from one book to the other. The story felt like this kind of book. This book was trying to get Hornblower from the battle in the previous book back to London for the next book. This book had no plot really of the ongoing battle between France and Britain where one side was trying to outwit the other nor tension between characters the way \\"Midshipman\\" or \\"Lieutenant\\" did. Considering how Forester wrote the books out of sequence it's probably understandable to have a book like this in order to complete the picture of Hornblower's career. So Forester shouldn't be blamed for the lack of plot. The book on its own isn't that great yet necessary in order to maintain continuity of the series."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Flying Colours is the most introspective of the Hornblower novels. For those who want to understand who Hornblower really is, this book is probably the most revealing in the Hornblower series. Unlike the other stories which contain lots of naval action at sea, this book occurs mostly on the land of Spain and France, and the rivers of France. As a result, those who like the Hornblower novels for their battles and action will find this book to be one of the least satisfying in the series.We all know ourselves best when we face problems. After the many successes in his career, Captain Hornblower ended up in Ship of the Line fighting an impossible battle between his ship, the Sutherland, and four French vessels. Taking horrible casualties, Hornblower struck his colours and surrendered at the end of that book. Flying Colours opens with Hornblower in a Spanish prison, with the expectation that he will be tried and executed for having flown French colours as camouflage to aid an attack. His wife, Maria, is pregnant in England. Hornblower also yearns for Lady Barbara Leighton, the wife of his admiral, whom readers met in Beat to Quarters and saw again in the beginning of Ship of the Line. Hornblower is in despair as he visits the dying and imprisoned sailors who are in the same garrison.Many troubling questions go through Hornblower's mind. How well will he face death before a firing squad? Will his weak body betray him?His first lieutenant, William Bush, is also to be tried. At the end of Ship of the Line, Bush lost the lower part of one leg. Will Bush survive the injury and trial?What will happen to his wife and unborn child after he is dead?Can he resist sweet temptation, when it is offered?Can he escape death by firing squad?Even if he escapes, how can he hope to be exonerated in a court martial for losing the Sutherland? Captains aren't supposed to surrender their vessels, no matter how badly damaged.If he escapes the court martial, how will he handle being in love with Lady Barbara while being an unhappily married man with a new baby?Will he ever have a chance to command a vessel again?Anyone who has ever known self-doubt will find Hornblower's trauma realistic and refreshing. He becomes more like an ordinary person with normal feelings in this book. As a result, I found Hornblower to be much more appealing here than when his brilliant intellect guided him to smooth success in the earlier books.Eventually, Hornblower finds himself wanting in many of these regards . . . but moves on. Ultimately, he faces new satisfactions and disappointments that indicate to him that his idealistic, perfectionist view of the world is a flawed one. Everyone else is merely human as well. Hornblower is deeply disappointed.Forester raises an interesting point in the novel. There are real heroes in the book. These people are true to themselves and have total integrity. Public adulation will never be theirs, however. On the other hand, the world needs heroes . . . and new ones will be created, whether or not they deserve the honor. The possibility of remaining a real hero is improved by not having to deal with the issues that can tempt one away from heroism and integrity. So Bush is shown to be a real hero, while Hornblower is simply a self-doubting actor who is extraordinarily capable of creating great results.The book does a magnificent job of using the title theme throughout. Having struck his colours on the Sutherland, Hornblower now flies his colours again in this book in every sense of that phrase. Watch for the subtleties of how this is done as you read the book.If you know French, you will enjoy the challenge of imagining how Hornblower manufacturers phrases from his limited command of the language to accomplish what needs to be done. As I read the book, I mentally made the necessary translations.The book is also interesting for displaying the consequences for the French of being under Napoleon's rule. Hornblower excoriates the Corsican tyrant in the earlier novels, but here we see that others are being squashed underneath authority's boot as well. Many of the social observations about the French people in 1811 are very nicely done in this book.What is more important: Being fearless or overcoming your weaknesses? What can you do today to overcome your weaknesses and help others to do the same?May you enjoy the peace that comes with living a life of integrity..."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"My favorite of the Hornblower series. Both a good look at the character development of Hornblower and Bush, and a great sea yarn. As with many other reviewers of this series, I have been through it several times. First read Hornblower as the 3-volume single book &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; in high school. It includes Beat to Quarters, Ship of the Line and Flying Colours, and I suggest that new readers start with these 3 and then go back to Midshipman Hornblower and read the rest of the series in chronological order. These are great books for action and sea lore, but also interesting for the introspection into the psychology of warrors and conduct in battle."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"'Flying Colours' is undoubtedly one of the best books in the Hornblower saga.

As he and his trusty first mate liuetenant Bush are transported through France they sieze a chance to escape and a thrilling adventure follows.

A truly satisfying read."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Flying Colours is the final of the three books that chronicle Hornblower's career as a captain. Following immediately after the apocalyptic end to Ship of the Line, it follows Hornblower -- now awaiting trial for piracy by a furious Bonaparte -- as he tries to escape and get back to England.Following as it does after the most exciting book in the series, this is a bit of a letdown. It's slower and the drama is more in Hornblower's mind and heart than anywhere else. He faces not only execution at Napoleon's hands, but -- even if he escapes -- trial and ruin in England for his surrender of the Sutherland. His best friend Lt. Bush is crippled, he's cut off from his pregnant wife and secret love. He's at the lowest point of his life.Of course, you know he's not going to give up. Flying Colours contrasts the vivid action of the novels by showing Hornblower finding his courage in life -- willing to face his own personal problems and demons -- to find the will to go on and try to overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in his way.It is in this book that the drama of the two previous ones finally pays off. Other have spoiled the plot, but I will note that even if Horatio triumphs, it is not without sacrifice and loss. And the ending has suitable irony -- and fits perfectly with Hornblower's democratic character.The book does drag a little at times and I was disappointed that Hornblower seemed to forget about his surviving crew once he'd escaped. That knocks the rating down. But otherwise, this a stirring conclusion to the &quot;Captain&quot; trilogy and leaves enough plot threads open to send the reader off to buy the next volume."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Those who have made C. S. Forester's Captain Hornblower a lifelong companion , would differ on the best way to introduce newcomers to this great naval hero.The orthodox would suggest starting from the very beginning (described in &quot;Mr Midshipman Hornblower&quot;).I would however suggest &quot;Flying Colors&quot; as an introduction to the adventures of Horatio Hornblower.Set at the time of the Napoleonic wars, the book relates the adventures of a british captain who, having fallen captive, faces dishonor and probable death.The tale of his struggle against defeat, though passionate, romantic and heroic, is told with true british understatement,which for me is a hallmark of C. S. Forester's writing.The meticulous historical detail creates the illusion of a true story and will lure the most consumate landlubber.For those who will complete the Hornblower Saga, a tour of the British Maritime Museum at Greenwich is a must.There, surrounded by familiar times, objects and persons, their sole regret would be the absence of the figureof the most loved, though fictional, sea captai"},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"In all of the Hornblower books prior to &quot;Flying Colours&quot; Hornblower is a hard luck Captain. Although he generally succeeds in his missions, he does so despite hard luck and bad breaks, by the sheer virtue of his intelligence and determination. Prize money has eluded him for years, he marries poorly, and he is not of high birth. The first several Hornblower novels are the tale of an officer who succeeds in spite of a long run of bad luck and hard circumstances in a merciless and unforgiving service.In Flying Colors, this all changes, and Hornblower manages to finally capitalize on his achievements and success. This is a satisfying story of a brilliant man overcoming hardship and finally getting the rewards and fame that are justly his. While this novel is not quite in the class of &quot;Beat to Quarters,&quot; &quot;Ship of the Line,&quot; &quot;Hotspur&quot; and several other of the Hornblower novels, it is nevertheless a well-written and satisfying tale. In this novel, Hornblower's life finally comes together, and even in the class-ridden British Navy, competence finally shines through and our hero gets the rewards due him.This is a fine novel that anyone will enjoy, and Hornblower afficianados must not miss."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"You gotta have it.

Most of it chronicles Hornblower's imprisonment by the French and his lengthy attempt to escape. As such, it becomes one of the more character-driven books in the series, which is both its strength and its weakness, since Hornblower is both a strong and a weak character. As a whole, I find Hornblower a delightfully complex character, one who's easy to relate to in his vast imperfection. But, at the same time, I (unlike all the women in the book, apparently) have a hard time feeling any affection for him. He was much more likable in his younger incarnation in earlier books. Here, his constant fussing about his image, his pride, and his often selfish disregard for others (particularly women) ultimately works to his disadvantage. It's hardly fair to compare him to Patrick O'Brian's wholly different but equally flawed Captain Jack Aubrey, but I admit I can't help it - and Jack's comparative lack of preoccupation with self makes him infinitely preferable in my view.Still, all these musings on Hornblower's character shouldn't be taken against the book as a whole, which is yet another rousing and beautifully detailed historical war story."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This adventure was a good read.

It gives you a good idea as to what war was like long ago as a sailor."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"There is a certain elegance and simplicity to Forester's Hornblower books and \\"Flying Colours\\" is no exception. This is certainly the best of the Hornblower books I've read so far and I am impressed by how easy they are to read, and how hard they are to put down. Forester does not waste words but he squeezes the essence from every last sentence. Of course, Hornblower leads a fairy-tale existence and there are more than a few serendipitous plot turns here. For me, it is the complexity of the character and the author's ability to allow us to get inside Hornblower's head that makes his books so good. Popular fiction rarely comes any better than the Hornblower books."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This is one of the best of the Hornblower books, despite the fact (or maybe because?) most of it takes place on land, not at sea. Hornblower is always too neurotic and self-judgmental, but he is a likable hero nevertheless. We usually do not judge him as harshly as he judges himself.This book is the third in what is effectively a trilogy, beginning with \\"Beat to Quarter\\" and continuing with \\"Ship of the Line.\\" All three have been marketed together as \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower,\\" and together form the basis for the magnificent 1951 movie of that name starring Gregory Peck and Virginia Mayo. The movie was absolutely terrific, but most of it was adapted from \\"Beat to Quarters\\"; the last two books comprised only about 30 minutes of the film, and \\"Flying Colours\\" was particularly short-changed, so it was interesting to read the full story as Forester originally conceived it. Entirely missing from the film was Hornblower's 5-month winter stay at the chateau of a sympathetic French nobleman.Were it not for the success of this original trilogy and the Gregory Peck film, I doubt that the Hornblower series would have, in after years, expanded to 10 volumes."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"I enjoyed this book for several reasons. The first is Horatio Hornblower a brave man, who is not sure of himself at all times. Secondly, I enjoy reading about the Napoleonic Wars especially one dealing with the seas and the Spanish Peninsula. Thirdly, the books give a view of not only the British Navy but of British society at the time. The only drawback is that I know in just a few more books Hornblower will be finished for me and he will join the ranks of Sharpe and Aubrey as old comrades-in-arms on my book shelf."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"I'm reading Hornblower books on my Kindle Fire, but the Captain Horatio Hornblower is not yet available. I wanted to fill in the gap of the saga."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This is a typical C.S. Forester story. Well Written, full of action,great description of surroundings,interesting use of psychology when solving problems involving several people simultaneously."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This book continues the adventures of Horatio in to the Tropics. He has this great humility that comes across as hilariously funny, especially during times of crisis.The rlationship with his wife is detailed more in these stories which shows his more warm and human side.I feel like I would like him if I met him."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Flying Colours (1938) is C. S. Forester's eighth Hornblower novel by chronology, third by publication; it completes Forester's original story arc. Having been forced to surrender to a French squadron at the end of Ship of the Line, Horatio Hornblower is imprisoned and sent with Lieutenant Bush and his coxswain to Paris to have an example made of him. Most of the novel deals with their attempts to escape France.Most of Flying Colours takes place on land, making it a refreshing change from the innumerable sea battles that fill every other Hornblower novel. And Forester moves things a long at a fairly good pace. There are a few noticeable conveniences in the plot, but they are not sufficiently egregious as to ruin the story.The problems Forester had in Ship of the Line with Hornblower being overly loathsome have been alleviated for the most part. Hornblower has escalated his philandering ways, however, but since it should be abundantly clear by now that he is a man of no principle beyond his duty to the Royal Navy, this should hardly come as a great shock to the reader. This fundamental lack of integrity most assuredly has quite a bit to do with his complete inability to be contented with his life, even with things wrapping up in a very tidy manner for him as they do here.There is a great deal of drama here with Hornblower and his wife Maria, or there should be; Forester leaves it largely untapped. For those who read the Hornblower novels in the order Forester wrote them, Maria has never appeared \\"on camera,\\" as it were, to this point, and so this is not a big deal. But those who have read them in chronological order are considerably more invested in the character of Maria, and rightly hoped for more. Obviously Forester could not have gone back and changed things in his earlier works, but the end result is that the resolution here is hardly satisfactory. This is the price one pays when one writes out of chronology: the merit of the original works is diminished by later works, which reveal and even create flaws in them.Flying Colours is a step up from Ship of the Line, and is a mostly satisfactory conclusion to the original Hornblower story arc, which is, on the whole, decent, and which would give way to subsequent superior novels."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This is the next Hornblower chronologically, it was not the next one written. Now that the series is completed it makes sense to read it as Hornblower's career progresses in the Royal Navy.The whole series is a pleasure to read full of action and adventure; with enough time for a little romance.Get acquainted with one of the most popular characters in modern literature.After reading this you will be back for more. And that is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"With excitement and sadness I read this book, for it is bittersweet. Mr. Bush makes his farewell at the end of a long journey home to England from France. Hornblower finally comes into his own when he receives prize-money, rank, fame, a new son, and the woman of his dreams - all of which he hoped him to have along with his own longings throughout the previous books. This volume made me excited all over again for this wonderful series. You simply must read it if a fan of Horatio. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Last year, my wife and I were in the Loire valley. We drove along the portion of the river from Orleans to Blois, where we stayed for two nights. HH, Bush and Brown made their escape disguised as anglers on the Loire. 'They passed Blois, Its steeply-humped bridge crowned by the pyramid whose inscription proclaimed the bridge to be the first public work of the infant Louis XV...' During our stay in Blois, we walked across the bridge a few times and I did see people fishing nearby in small boats.Our heroes' escape from France in the Witch of Endor incites the Admiral of the Channel Fleet to promote Bush into the cutter as Commander. Later HH, cleared by a court-martial aboard the Victory, is cheered by sailors manning the yards of the flagship. The midshipman who was seasick in Spitshead, receives the salute of the whole fleet at anchor there. Flying colours indeed. Hookham Frere, a historical personality, takes HH to London, where more fame and fortune await (even Palmerston makes an appearance)! Finally our hero is reunited with Lady Barbara and his son."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"This is generally high up on most HH fans' favorites list. And there's no wonder why. For the first time, our heroic Hornblower has failed and lost his ship---which back then, was worse than death for the captain---it's a personal book with Hornblower worrying about his actions and the consequences to them. In addition, the care and attention he shows to Bush is heartwarming, his concern for his future and promise, \\"I'll make you a captain if it's the last thing I do.\\" This book really put into perspective the fact that while Hornblower may not view Bush as the smartest of men, he IS his best friend. The affair with Marie also can pull a few internal strings, the devotion Marie has for this man and her haunting, \\"You're a man women can fall in love with.\\" (attempting to get the quote right.)A must-read. The pivot of the series."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"Flying Colors (3rd in orig. trilogy) opens with Hornblower in French hands after his valiant action in Ship Of The Line. Thus we see another possible condition in the life of a Navy captain, although Napoleon is not so honourable a captor as he should be. Hornblower's subsequent escapes and victories are excitingly near-run things. In this story sometimes Fortune seems to smile too kindly, and is exasperatingly disparaged by HH. Nevertheless, by the end we are very proud of HH.These are not at all the flashy novels of pure guts and glory I had expected (although this comes closest of the first three books). Despite his silly name, Hornblower is a doubt-ridden, but impassioned and charismatic, leader: we see both inner and outer aspects of the illusion of command. Ultimately he is an heroic figure, not merely the protagonist, as Forester no doubt intended, writing under the shadow of another continental monster, Hitler.Forester's prose is flowing, like the rushing Loire stream at the center of this picaresque story, carefully crafted, without excess description or digressions (which some may find in O'Brian's comparable Aubrey/Maturin series). Curiously, I find O'Brian's characters more interesting than Hornblower--perhaps because they ARE loquacious while HH is self-sworn to silence--but Forester is more likely to draw me into reading into the wee hours."},{"Title":"Flying colours (Bantam Book)","review":"it's just anouther book. i enjoyed it.

Marnie is a young woman, married to a much older man who turns out not to be much like she thought. They move to a new town, down by the river, in a house he owns. After he dies in a freak accident, she does her best to fit into the community, but the people are set in their ways and don't want a new person. She makes friends with the priest, who is in his own way an outsider, and with the village 'lunatic'. Problems ensue when she and the 'lunatic' (who turns out to be deaf, not crazy) become closer and closer . . .The best part about this book was probably the characterization. No one is completely good. No one is completely evil. Everyone has human traits. The priest, while essentially one of the most compassionate people in the story, still lost his patience with the 'lunatic' (Raven) often. Marnie herself does. Raven, the deaf young man, isn't miraculously transformed into the Model Citizen after Marnie and he invent a sign language -- he changes, yes, but not all at once, and not always progressively forward.It's completely recommended for anyone over, maybe, twelve years of age, and that involves all adults. It may be a 'children's' book, but that's not for lack of maturity."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This beautiful book tells the story of Marnie, a young woman who has married a much older man to save her family from homelessness.

She discovers he is not mad, but deaf, and he, like her, is misunderstood and hated by the villagers. As their relationship develops, so does the suspicion and hostility towards them until at last Marnie is subjected to a barbaric witch trial.This book is so brilliant! I couldn't put it down.

Marnie becomes a widow only two days after her unwilling marriage to Isake Isherwood, son of a wealthy landowner. The setting of the story takes place in the New England village of Torcurra during the time of the witch trials. After her husband's accident, Marnie befriends Raver and she renames him Raven. She develops a form of sign language to communicate with her new friend, who is deaf, much to the surprise of Father Brannan, the priest of Torcurra. Father Brannan tries to defend and protect Marnie after the villagers witness her silent communication with Raven and subsequently accuse her of practicing witchcraft. The author weaves a story of servitude, ignorance, tragedy, horror, faith, and love in this book. The Raging Quiet proves to be an 'I could not put it down until I finished' book for students in middle school and higher grades. This story integrates the studies of geography, history, and social relationships that both teachers and parents could use for children."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I picked this book up after reading Secret Sacrament and liking it.

This book is only 264 pages long, but because of the way Sherryl Jordan's writing flows, I sincerely doubt you will be able to put it down. \\"THE RAGING QUIET\\" will capture your attention with the very first words, and keep you completely dedicated to its reading. The story is fraught with difficulties; wonderful, loveable characters -- gentle, compassionate Father Brannan, wonderful imaginative Marnie, and deaf-mute Raven -- balanced by hateful villagers and inlaws who will have you gnashing your teeth.If you are older than school-age, do not think it will be too young or banal for you. It is a story that will captivate. I do hope to find other books by Ms. Jordan, and pray a sequel is in the works.

I thank my goodreads pals for recommending this gem of a book which takes place a very long time ago, when people believed in witchcraft and faeries.Marnie is a young woman of sixteen years who is forced into marriage with an older man to save her family from certain poverty when her father is struck down by illness and can no longer perform his duties as overseer on their lord's estate.Luke Isherwood, Marnie's husband, is one of the lord's sons and his inheritance is an old, rundown cabin by the sea. He is happy with this arrangement because the cabin holds a hidden treasure that will make him richer than a king, and it is to this place that he brings Marnie to start their new life. Marnie, young and inexperienced, soon finds marriage to Luke an ordeal and though, he is not a cruel man, Luke is neither interterested in making his wife happy nor willing to ease her distress, as he is consumed with the search for treasure.When a horrible fall removes Luke from Marnie's life, it seems that all will be well with Marnie, but for the suspicions of the villagers who believe that Marnie is responsible for Luke's death. The fact that she has befriended the town madman, Raver, and has taken him into her home doesn't help Marnie's situation.Sheryl Jordan writes a beautiful story of love and innocence, in the face of hatred, prejudice and ignorance. It is a timeless tale that is still relevant as it describes the consequences that arise from gossip, false witness, and a desire to unwittingly commit evil for the sake of \\"justice\\".This is one little book that you just can't put down. Ms. Jordan is an exceptionally talented writer who effortlessly draws you into her story, making you care instantly for Marnie, Father Brannan and, most of all, for Raver--lovingly renamed Raven by Marnie because she is able to look beyond the obvious into the beauty within--unlike her hateful neighbors."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I wanted to learn sign language after reading this novel.Though I was forced to read it for English, and parts of it were squrim-worthy, I am glad I had the opportunity to study this novel. :)You will see things differently after you read this novel."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book was fun to read. At first I was hesitant to read it because the description in the book sounded extremely boring, but after reading the first page I was hooked!The book is about a girl named Marnie who marries a rich lord to keep her family from poverty. They move away from home and live in a broken down cottage that's \\"supposed\\" to be worth more than Marnie's husband's manor. Marnie thinks, yeah, right, when she sees it.Then, Marnie's husband falls to his death while trying to fix the roof and Marnie feels responsible because she was feeling resentful towards her husband and asked god to do something to make him stop wanting her. The village preist assured her that it wasn't her fault, but three old village women overheard what Marnie said and soon everyone thinks that Marnie killed her husband!Of course, the preist got a man to witness the scene of Marnie's husband lying dead on the floor underneath the broken ceiling, but soon everyone believes that Marnie cast witchcraft on on the poor man to make him fall.Discouraged, Marnie forms a relationship with the village madman (boy), Raver. His names Raver becauses he throws mindless fits and destroys everything in his path. What the real problem is is that he's deaf and he gets frustrated that he can't understand or talk like other people.After a brutal whipping from the village Marnie invites Raver, who's name is changed to Raven, to stay with her to sort of protect him. Raven does.A day later Marnie realizes that Raven his not mad, he's just deaf. So she finds a way to comunicate with him using sign language.

Her new husband is a disappointment, especially to a young girl like Marnie. However, two days after the wedding, her husband dies and Marnie becomes a widower. She befriends a priest and a \\"possessed\\" boy, who later proves to merely be deaf. Yet the villagers, disposed to be wary of newcomers, begin to accuse Marnie of murdering her husband and witchcraft with the boy.The Raging Quiet is a really well written story with a clever plot. I first read it when I was about twelve, and some of the subject matter was a bit shocking. Because the story opens on the wedding day, the wedding night is described, and though not in detail, it might be a bit much for a younger audience. However, the author does a really good job of writing Marnie's world. Furthermore, she accurately describes how Marnie is able to develop a sort of \\"sign language\\" with Raver, or Raven, the deaf boy. It is a challenge to write something so complicated so well, without it seeming implausible or too easily achieved.The story was clever, romantic, well researched, and suspenseful. A good read, and good buy. I recommend it for any girl, or woman, who takes pleasure in historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"It was the cover art that attracted me to this book; Kinuko Craft's beautifully detailed illustrations breathe new life into children's classics like The Twelve Dancing Princesses and King Midas. Like the artwork, this story is rich and complex. The words evoke vivid images of the landscape (an Irish village of thatched cottages by the sea) the era (feudal lords and hard-working peasants) and the tension of strong wills and harsh judgments. This is a very moving story, both enchanting and plausible. There are many themes woven into it: sympathy, love, and especially the myriad difficulties of being \\"different.\\" The characters are portrayed with such reality they feel like old friends, and the personal and societal influences ring true and internal. This is the tale of Marnie, a young newlywed who discovers a kindred spirit in Raven, the \\"village madman,\\" whom only she realizes is profoundly deaf. Marnie's efforts to communicate with Raven by sign language are misunderstood as witchcraft, and their friendship is condemned as immoral. Although the local priest, Father Brannan, tries to explain the situation, and encourage acceptance, he cannot control the conflicting forces of compassion, individualism, and social convention that set Marnie on a dangerous collision course with the local villagers. I have tried, unsuccessfully, many times, to comprehend the power of this book; something in it must touch an essential human sentiment. All I can say is that I sat very still and thoughtful when I finished it, and then read it a second time before I could consider picking up another book. Simply a wonderful and incredible piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book has an interesting plot, but did not live up to my expectations. The main charachter, Marnie is not very likeable. She regards herself as superior to Raven, this does not give off the message that she loves him,but rather that she feels sorry for him and is being kind to him out of pity. I find this kind of unbalanced rlationship to be extremly irritating."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Wonderful book! Love the symbolism, the historical elements (witchcraft), the fairy tale quality with added depth. Marnie does not seem 15, however, and the idea of Marnie creating sign language independent of all others does seem a bit of a stretch. Also, the relationship between Marnie and Raven seems more friendship than love-- I was rooting for Marnie to fall for Father Brannan!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This novel started well, but ended disappointingly. Set in the Middle Ages, \\"The Raging Quiet\\" effectively brings to life much of the atmosphere of that time in its attention to details.Sixteen-year-old Marnie has married the widower second son of the lord of the estate where her large family lives, a man much older than herself, in order to save her family from destitution. Marnie and her husband Isake leave the estate for the coastal town of Torcurra, where they arrive at a crumbling cottage that Isake says is quite valuable. However, the townspeople of Torcurra think Isake's grandmother, who they burned as a witch for being a king's mistress, cursed the cottage. Her husband's drunken advances on her repel Marnie. When he is killed in an accident two days after their marriage, she is more relieved than upset. Some of her words and actions make a few villagers think Marnie murdered Isake.Marnie's only friends are the village priest, Father Brannan, and the village madman, a boy not much older than herself called Raver, who she renames Raven. The townspeople think Raven's rantings are signs he is possessed by the devil. Marnie soon discovers he is deaf, and finds a way to communicate with him with hand signals. However, when the villagers see the transformation in Raven, the puzzling hand signs, and spy on their other unusual behaviors, they accuse Marnie of witchcraft. Isake's younger brother, who now wants the cottage, eggs them on. Marnie is forced to undergo the harrowing trial by hot iron, which is described in historically authentic detail.The novel has much in its favor, particularly the portrayals of tolerance by the main characters (Marnie, Raven, and Father Brannan) and intolerance by most of the townspeople and other minor characters.However, an unnecessary premarital sex scene between Marnie and Raven near the end of the book spoiled it all for me. As the parent of teenagers, I don't think the message needs to be sent that sex is okay as long as you are in love (even Father Brannan jokes about it!), especially to the impressionable twelve-year-olds targeted by the book. The book is more appropriate for more mature fifteen to eighteen year olds. Reader warning: some nudity and sex. (Yes, I know I'll get \\"unhelpful\\" ratings from all you people who just adore this book, but I have to be honest here.)"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is the incredible story of Marnie, a fiery young woman who wants to be herself, and Raven, an intense, compelling young man who is ostracized for his deafness, and the story of their undying love in the cruel face of fear, hatred, and adversity. The newly widowed Marnie is feared as a witch by the neighboring townspeople of Tocurra, and is hated by all except the village priest, Father Brannan and &quot;Raver&quot;, the town's &quot;madman&quot;. She renames him Raven, and under the priest's kindly eye they develop a strong friendship. Marnie finally recognizes Raven's deafness, and begins to make for him a hand language that he can understand. Things go well for them until Pierce Isherwood, Marnie's late husband's brother, comes to claim the tiny cottage in which Marnie and Raven live as his own. His reasons for this are a mystery to Marnie, but in reality, Pierce hopes to retrieve a priceless jeweled ring that had been hidden inside the house for years. Marnie refuses to yield to Pierce's demands for the house, so he stirs the already-suspicious villagers to put Marnie on trial for witchcraft. She is subjected to the ordeal of the Iron Bar, but is proven innocent by the cleanliness of her healing burns. Meanwhile, Raven has found and odd, ugly ring in the rubble of there collapsed chimney. Marnie doesn't think its pretty, but Raven does, so he keeps it. After Marnie's wounds have healed, she and Raven are married, thus unconsciously giving up her rights to the cottage. Pierce takes advantage of this, and seizes the cottage. Now having the upper hand, he explains to Marnie why he coveted the cottage so. Marnie and Raven are forced out immediately. At the same time as all of this is happening, some wicked village children burn the cottage to the ground. As is to be expected, Pierce is hysterical, but Marnie remembers the odd ring that Raven had found, and realizes it is the legendary ring. The have Father Brannan confirm this, and so, Marnie and Raven are secure for the future, and in their love and understanding for one another forevermore. This is an inspiring story of hope and love for all those who are hopeless romantics, scholars of medieval history, and those of us who just love to read. It truly is a literary masterpiece that is worth reading no matter how busy you are."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I enjoyed the book. The biggest reason I enjoyed &quot;The Raging Quiet&quot; is because it made me think about how sometimes one being must give something up that the person enjoys to save another's life. When I was reading it also made me think about how you should not give up on something you are doing and still try to accomplish it even if someone or something is hassling you. In some parts of the book I thought they were boring. For some of the parts I could sympathize and empathize for Marnie Isherwood, the main character. Like for example, when Isake died, I have had someone close to me be sick for a long time and then die. I recommend this book to readers who can appreciate the 1700's and how they had to live and people who can be patient. Erica Fawley"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"When I saw the cover and read the blurb, I thought I'd be in for a great read. But it did not take me long at all to get tired of Marnie being right all the time. She wins every theological argument with Father Brannan, she tames the wild beast that is Raven, and she deftly deals with the hateful townspeople of Torcurra. All this accomplished by a sixteen year old girl was somehow not inspiring, but rather annoying and unbelievable. I truly enjoy independent female characters, but if Marnie had smacked one of the villagers or at least thought about it, I would have found her easier much easier to relate to and like."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Many of the other reviews have raved about Marnie, the main character, and her so-called strength or courage. Marnie was an idiot. She was raised in her society, understood its rules and mores, and when she blithely ignored them time and time again was actually SURPRISED when they tried her as a witch. Societal rules are generally strict, and a WISE and COURAGEOUS heroine would have recognized the rules and found ways around them to achieve her ends instead of flaunting them. (A great example is &quot;A Quest for a Maid.&quot;) Also, every description of Raven made him seem like a 12 year old, or at least younger than Marnie (I realize he was supposed to be somewhere in the 18-20 range). It is hard to swallow a burgeoning romance between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. Besides, almost all descriptions of the characters became redundant quickly because the same words were used, and the same image created. The heavy reliance on sex was trite, offensive for the age group, and detracted from the main plot line."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"To say I was diassapointed with this book is an understatement. It had real potential but instead chose to be a salacious story with no moral value at all. Girl is in an arranged marriage. Sex is a awful. Meets deaf boy. Sex is wonderful. The end."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Well crafted with highly developed characters. The author does not shrink from creating a realistic world, cruel though it may seem.Raver is the first Deaf character I came across in literature. I would recommend this book to any member of the hearing or Deaf Community because it gives a rich historical background to the injustuces faced by those who are different."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I'm not finished with this book yet but I can't put it down so far. It is so good and I keep waiting for Raven to really kiss Marnis. I hate how Marnie's life goes down the drain and is accused of things that are so stupid! I fear for her and Raven and hope they end up on top. Oh and Isake is stupid and Raven sounds hot!!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"\\"The Raging Quiet\\" is set in the medieval times. It centres around the two main characters - Marnie, a beautiful 16 year old who has been forced by herself into a marriage of convenience. Her father, an overseer, has suffered a sevre stroke that left him paralysed, and a new overseer was appointed to replace him. The new overseer was denied Marnie's home (which is atually supposed to be an overseer's house but because Marnie had a large family, the Lord's son, Issake, made an exception)and, angry, made rumors about her that were quite serious. Faced with the fact that she would lose her home unless she accepted Issake's proposal, she accepted. And the next thing she knows, she's in a new town, living in a barely-even-that cottage! Raver, is the local \\"mad man\\", abandonned by his mother when he was a baby and cared for by the town priest, and gained his name due to the fact that instead of speaking, he rants and raves which leads the villagers to believe that he is possessed by devils. Everytime they see Raver, who mainly lives in the fields, they whip him. That is exactly what was happening when Marnie first came to the foreign town - Raver was being savagely whipped. And that is the start of the story! The priest releases Raver who runs away, but comes back upon Marnie, sitting in the rain outside the pub her alchololic husband was in. She gives him food, feeling an empathy toward him, and the next day Raver goes to her cottage, giving her a basket of eggs from the priest to thank her. Marnie, already upset as she'd just been raped by her drunk husband, tears up at the kind gesture and Raver understands her, a new friendship blooming between them. Two days later, while fixing the cottage roof, Issake falls from the roof and dies immediately - Marnie runs to the priest and cries, blaming herself as she felt so relieved. Unfortunately, two old ladies overheard her and jumped to conclusion; Marnie Isherwood is a Witch! And she killed her husband! The villagers, who were already reserved about getting to know the beautiful newcomer now treated her with open hostility and ostracised her. One night, during a storm, Marnie invites Raver to sleep in her home as he'd been settling on her doorstep. Marnie then discovered that Raver was not mad at all, but deaf as he reacted not at all to a loud crash that shook the cottage. The only reason he had ranted and raged was because he felt left out due to his incapability to communicate with others. With the support of the priest, a surrogate father to both Marnie and Raven (renamed after the ravens of the fields, where he lives) Marnie began to use signs to communicate with Raven. After a few hitches, their path of communication was smoothed. As they learned to communicate with each other, their relationship grew also. But, there was a big hitch - Issake's brother, Pierce was back in town and wanting the cottage for some strange reason, was determined to get Marnie out of the way. Seeing Marnie's \\"strange flutterings\\", he began dropping hints concerning witchcraft. The villagers were only too pleased to listen to him, him being a Lord's son. Taking advantage of this, Pierce spewed that both the Priest and Raven were under her spell, just as Issake had been and look where that had gotten him. Follow her! Encouraged, the villager followed Marnie as Raven showed her a private place he goes when he wants to think and dance, worshipping the moon. Raven, unaware of the taboo of nudism, encouraged Marnie to dance with him half naked, and the villagers seized this moment to snatch Marnie and try her. What will happen next?!Sorry, I can't say more - I'll ruin it!I absolutely love this story - it compels me because I am deaf as well, so I feel a connection to Raven and Marnie. I'm also a romantic, and I just love seeing Marnie and Raven grow in confidence and change, and I just love seeing how their feelings develop with each other.I would recommend this book for teenagers because it does contain mild nudism and sexual innuedoes but it's not so strong so it isn't very important.You need to get this book! It's fab!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I discovered the Raging quiet in the little corner of my much used Library. I have honestly sucked that poor library dry, and as my list of books I haven't read dwindles down, it becomes hard to find a compelling read. Well, I have found one.This book is much like classic Salem Witch stories, a different girl who comes to a small village, where the villagers are a group of savage, poorly educates who crave gossip and lies. She is traveling to a small village with her new husband, a lord of the land her family has worked on for years. She married him so that her family can stay on their land after her father becomes un-able to work due to an accident. Beauitful compelling girl, strong-wille, father paralyzed, family starving, Forced marriage...yadda yadda yadda, right?At some parts. I'm not going to lie. I did find myself wondering, especially in the beginning. It was sounding like the same old tune, and Marine (main character) didn't really seem as strong-willed as the author was trying to depict her. But, fortunetly it god better.Marine and her new husband stop and live in a tiny hovel of a cottage, with moldly walls, leaking roof. Her husband claims that this little shack is worth more than all their lands combined, and that if she finds anything, she much give it to him. Weird...how can this tiny hut be worth more than miles and miles of land? Oh, the suspense!So, husband dies, little old ladies in the village suspect her, drooling for accusations. I was compelled more than once to smash in their skulls. She befriends the preist of the town, the only one who has any sense, along with a \\"possessed boy\\" the villagers call Raver. He doesn't respond when called too, and is often in a far-out gaze. He cannot speak, but mumbels and makes strange sounds. Everyone thinks he's possessed by the devil, until Marine discovers the truth; he can't hear. All his life he was been neglected and never has been able to communicate. Marine makes a hand language with him and bestows upon him the greatest gift: Communication. He now can talk (with his hands of course), and is utterly happy. Marine and Raven (his new adopted name) slowly fall in love in their tiny cottage. Their love story is so compelling, and different then any I have ever ready. It's much more emotional, and Marine must come to grasp with her awful relationship she had with her lord husband (yes, still deceased) before she can learn that loving a man does not always hurt.And then those stupid villagers have to get all hoity toity and gossip starving and accuse her of being a witch, casting a spell over Raven with her magic hand signs. The preist tries to intervein, but they suspect him of being under her spell too. And then their is the witch trail, which is in lovely detail!So, I can't give away much more, but I will say this. I was leaning towards a 4 with this book due to characterization of Marine (Raven's characterization was marvelous by the way) but have placed a tidy five on it due to the plot. Very well written, very well constructed. I recommend it to 13 and up age group due to sexual contact (gasp!) and some other jazzy stuff.Yea!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Taking place in probably the medieval times this is the story of Marnie, a 16 year old peasant girl who has just been married to a lord who's twice the age of herself and is a drunk. Marnie is unhappy with her marriage because she didn't marry for love but for the land her father lives on. Her father was an overseer for the lord of the land and when he had a stroke the nice land and home they lived in was going to be given away unless Marnie married the lord. So she did. After two days of living hell (Marnie's marriage) Marnie's husband dies and she cant help feeling a twinge of relief for she does not have to spend the rest of her life unhappily married to a retch of a man. After her husband's death Marnie soon befriends a \`possessed' young man whom she later finds out isn't possessed but a warm hearted deaf boy that has no way of communication. So she learns to talk to him with a sceries of hand words. The village called this wild boy Raver for he raved but Marnie calls him Raven because it suits him better. Marnie and Raven become the best of friends. But the villagers become suspicious about this friendship and Ravens new found gentleness and they suspect witchcraft. And I'll leave the rest for you to read about because it is such an awesome book. This book shows how in the end the power of friendship prevails above all."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I read 'The Raging Quiet' like..a year ago when I first got it, and recently went back and reread it in about a day. I must say, it was better the second time around and will most likely be even better the third time around.'The Raging Quiet' is about a girl named Marnie Isherwood who moves to the coastal town of Torccura with her husband, Isake. She ends up meeting and befriending a deaf person whom everyone calls Raver because he raves. Marnie renames him Raven instead and ends up taking him in, coming up with a sort of sign language between the two. She is eventually accused of being a witch, and stands trial.I won't spoil the book, but all I can say is this is a must read if you are interested in historical fiction at it's finest. Truely a well written work."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book is about a sixteen year old named Marnee, who is forced to marry Isake the lord where her father works after her father fell ill and no longer could work, in return her parents would be looked after. Her and Isake move to a local town by the ocean, where she gets more then what she bargained for. Isake dies in a roofing accident and she is blamed for his death. She is accused of witchcraft when she meets revan the local madman and teaches his sign language, the towns people think she is teaching him spells, she is lead through a trial and only time will tell what the judgement is.this book is good and i definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Civil Rights Movement, and the American Disability Act are results of a historical trend of discrimination. However, with the civil rights movement and others like it, there was a triumph and an overcoming of strife. Just like in The Raging Quiet written by Sherryl Jordan. This book accurately explores the power of young love, the determination and tolerance of a young woman, while also describing the perseverance of a young man. At the same time you laugh with the characters and weep with them as if you were a close friend. This book can make you question yourself and how you treat people of different backgrounds. Raven, who is deaf, shows Marnie how to love, and Marnie in return gives him words with which to express himself.Jordan makes sure to address the fragility of Marnie compared with the roughness of a late husband. She makes the character of Marnie feel so strongly about her actions and herself that there is no reason why no young woman cannot relate to her. Seeing how many young girls and teenagers feel strongly about many things. In the end Marnie's faith in herself and her love for Raven are rewarded. While Raven is constantly rewarded with the gift of silent speech. Looking at the trials and tribulations of the two in this love story there is something horrifying about not being able to express oneself and at the same time being beaten for that disability. Which is why I feel for Raven.Another detail that enjoyed about this book is that Raven and Marnie didn't develop their relationship that would be considered clich&eacute;, as in boy meets girl, boy likes girl, so boy and girl go far away to happy land. It all started with one helping the other out of their own good will, rather than two characters forced together, a reader can see a delicate merging of the two. All in all this is a good book and the reason why I can hear clearly now."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Okay, this book is one of the best books I have ever read. It's in my top-five list of favorite books. I won't tell you every detail because you've probably read every other review already. But this book is splendid. Though, like other people, I would reccommend it for uh...older teens because of the rape. But don't take like 'Oh it has rape in it so I can't read it!' I think that this book is for anyone who is mature enough to take it. I think that Marnie is a very smart, stubburn girl, but she is nice too and reminds me of myself. I think that this book is a great romance and also teaches you that, it doesn't matter who you love, that love comes in different unexpected ways."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book is brilliant. I reccomend it to anyone who really enjoys a great story. It is about a young girl living in medevil times who meets a strange boy named raver by the village he lives in.It's different but still classical."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I think Sherryal Jordan is a wonderful author. I know you probably hear that a book is good from a lot from people. So, you end up reading the book and find out it's as good as they made it out to be. Just trust me on this one. This is a fantasy book, thought I didn't think it was much of what I thaught a fantasy would be like. If you like stories with women who arn't afread to be diffrent, or you like romances, this is your book. This is NOT a mushey book. I stayed up till three o'clock one night to finish reading this book.This book is about a sixteen year girl named Marnie who marries a lord so that her family can keep their house. Marnie's husband likes to drink, so on their marriage night, Marnie is hurt. After two days of beeing married, her husband dies. Marnie becomes friends with the village priest, who helps her throught hard times later in the book and gives her cherity. One night she gives the village madman, Raver, a place by her herth during a storm. She descovers that Raver is deaf, not mad. She makes up a language so that they can talk to one another using their hands. Raver, who Marnie now calls Raven, dosen't act mad anymore. What starts out as a strong friendship between them later turns to love, but Marnie is still hurt from her dead husband and is scared and hurt to love Raven back and to show him her love. But the village people are suspicieous. They say Marnie killd her husband by putting a curse on him and that she is using witch craft to controll Raven. Marnie is forced into a witch trial. I can't tell you anything else or I would be telling you the whole book...Just to let you know, I think that the editoral reviews gave you too much information about the book. Oh well, that's just my opinion.I hope you enjou reading The Raging Quiet!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"_The Raging Quiet_ is the story of a young woman named Marnie, who becomes a widow in a close-minded town that believes her to be a witch after the sudden death of her husband and her communication with a deaf young man she calls Raven. A thoroughly satisfying love story and tale of a courageous young heroine who fights the prejudice of a community."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I loved it! Jordan intrigued me with her words, and made everything seem so perfectly real to me. I loved the romance in it- Raven was so gentle and serene-- I only wished that they would've waited one more day to make love. Otherwise it was one of the mostest bestest greatest book I've ever read!!!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"THE RAGING QUIET is one those wonderful books that makes you feel as though you could slip between the pages. The story is both endearing and magical. A young girl, Marnie, is forced into marriage to assist her family. They have fallen on hard times. The wedding night is nothing as she anticipated. Her husband passes away after only two days and the suspicious townsfolk believe witchcraft is involved.She now lives all alone by the sea in a tiny cottage but she is content. She has managed to befriend both a priest and a young man, Raven. She thinks Raven and her are about the same age but there is something wrong with him. He has difficulty with communication and only the priest seems to be able to make out what Raven wants. Sometimes. This is during the medieval ages when anyone that has either a physical or emotional problem is deemed bad.Her friendship with these two strengthen over a short time. In the meantime, her husband's brother wants the cottage she lives in but where is she to go? Secrets abound, if only Marnie can figure them out.Raven comes and goes but, slowly, Marnie starts to communicate with him using their own form of sign language. You see, Raven is a deaf-mute. The beauty of the story is what they have to go through to survive during these harsh times. And still there are those secrets that Marnie needs an answer.This is a young adult fiction with some spice. There is some mild sex written in a muted way so some parents may not wish younger teens or preteens to read it. But I would encourage everyone else to try this romance. Ms. Jordan has a gift with words. Even though I have read some of her other books, and enjoyed them, this piece of fiction is my favorite of hers."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I'm astonished to see this book classified as \\"fantasy\\"--I read quite a bit of fantasy and historical fiction, and this belongs solidly in the second category. There's no magic here--well, the story is about two young people who create a sign language and fall in love, which is magical in its own way, but nothing that couldn't happen in our world. And although Jordan claims in the afterward that there's something mythological about this tale because she didn't specify the historical setting, it's obvious from the characters' names, the social structure and customs, and the landscape that the book is set in medieval Ireland (more or less; the \\"mythological\\" comment may be intended to cover a few minor deviations, and to give the author free rein with geography). I wonder if people are confused because some of the author's other books are actual fantasy?At any rate, The Raging Quiet is a beautiful story set in a realistic medieval world. The good-hearted but naive Marnie moves to an unwelcoming coastal village with her new husband, only for him to die shortly thereafter. The only people who will have anything to do with her are the kindly, liberal priest, Father Brannan, and the village madman, Raven, who turns out to be not crazy but deaf. Marnie decides to learn to communicate with Raven, and things go from there; the plot is interesting throughout, although a couple of Marnie's choices seem a bit senseless. The characters are three-dimensional if a bit advanced for their medieval setting, which is beautifully depicted. There is a fair bit of nastiness in this book--and a plot twist or two I didn't expect in a young adult novel--but Jordan resists the temptation to create lots of one-dimensional nasty characters, portraying them instead in shades of gray. It's obvious from the writing that she has some familiarity with both deaf people and the Middle Ages, and the romance will appeal to anyone who likes a good love story. I do agree with the reviewers who have commented that the book sets Marnie on too much of a pedestal, though; she's a sympathetic character, and given what she goes through it makes sense for Father Brannan to encourage her, but his praise and indulgence are a little much.This book may be labeled \\"young adult,\\" but there is plenty for older readers to enjoy as well. Still, the label seems to have upset a few people when they found that sex is present (although anything but graphic--and while trying to avoid spoilers, I would argue that the sex that occurs is entirely appropriate and necessary in context), so keep that in mind if looking for a book for a small child. For the rest of us, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I have read and reread this book and will most likely read it again. It is sad at some points but the story is amazing and there are many happy parts too. The characters are very well developed and you will laugh and cry right with them. You fall right in the story of this girl who has to try to be accepted by people far away from home and helps another be understood. You must read this book."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet was such a great book. I myself am enthralled with Historical Fiction books, espically ones of the Witch Trials. It kept me holding on until the very end. This book is the perfect example of the quote \\"Dont judge a book by its cover\\" because the cover gave it an appearance of a book that was rather boring and oldfashoned. Though if you take the time to open it up and read it it will be hard to put it down. I myself was up until one in the morning reading the book and would have been up longer if my father hadnt made me turn off the light and go to bed."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I started reading this book at eleven o'clock at night. i finished it at three am. this is one of those books that have you hooked so that you can't put it dowm.(literaly)I recomended it to my mom and i don't know if she is going to read it because as i write this it is quarter to five in the morning and my mom is asleep in her bed, snoring. trust me if you decide to read this book you won't be sorry! :)"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I really found myself caring about what happened to the characters in this beautifully written book. It should win the Newberry Medal for a children's book published this year. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I have never really understood what separates a young adult book from a plain old adult book. Oh I know there's a certain difference in style of writing, words chosen based on the expected vocabulary of the target audience, but beyond that it's just plots. And who can guess what plot will appeal to who? Some of the books I treasured as a young adult remain favorites today because they're simply good books. But this novel, though marketed and sold for young adults, perhaps even written for them, is one I think can safely be said to appeal to older readers as well.\\"The Raging Quiet\\" is a novel about outsiders. Marnie is a newlywed when her much older husband dies, leaving her alone and without resources in a hostile and enclosed village. The friends she manages to make are the local priest and the village madman-who Marnie discovers quickly, is not mad at all-only deaf and re-names Raven. But soon her \\"magical\\" abilities to communicate with Raven make the locals suspense, and have Marnie on trial for her life.I must say that when I first read this book when I was eleven, I was disturbed by some of the content. So the official warning to parents: this book includes not descriptions of but illusions to rape, sex and a rather descriptive scene of what would now be construed as torture. It's probably not fit for every kid to read. Another reason why I see it as a line crosser.I enjoyed this the first time I read it but liked it even better the second time. Adult or child this is a good book that's well written.Four stars."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I ordered this book off amazon.com over the summer, and I am so glad I did. It is now one of my favorite books EVER. The Raging Quiet is about a girl named Marnie who is forced to marry Lord Isake in order to save her family from being kicked out of their house. After only several days of living with her new husband in a small cottage in Torcurra, where they are strangers, Isake is killed when he falls off the roof of the cottage when he tries to thatch it. This is when Marnie befriends the town's preacher and the deaf young man who the townsfolk call Raver. They think he is possessed, but Marnie realizes that he is deaf and developes a sign language the two of them can use to communicate with each other. Marnie and Raven, as she renames him, form a close bond, and Raven slowly transforms into a well-mannered young man, but there are also consequences for Marnie's actions: the townspeople begin to turn against her, which is where this book gets especially interesting and suspenseful. At some points, I could hardly sit still while reading this book. The Raging Quiet is filled with very vivid detail and touching moments. It has romance, suspense, and sadness, making it a very good read that is hard to put down. I strongly recommend buying this book, because once you read this book, you will want to read it over and over again, as I have."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Marnie is a realistic heroine, and Raven her well-written \\"project.\\" I have absolutely no complaints about this book. Most of all, I found the descriptions of Marnie learnng to \\"speak\\" to Raven VERY entertaining, and Raven is such a captivating character. There's just SOMETHING about the things Raven says when he learns to communicate... something about being able to hear the thoughts of someone considered a madman, someone unable to speak for so long... This book is worth reading. I don't regret accidentally missing a doctor's appointment for it, either, nor relinquishing the nap I could have been taking in the library. ;) Trust a college sophomore who says this book is better than sleep!!!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book is WONDERFUL. I've read several books about the salem witch trials, and this far surpasses them all. Marnie is a fully believable, warm-hearted and strong character, which is a hard thing to find. In so many books it seems the protagonist is too perfect, too stupid, or too unbelievable, Marnie is none of these. Another character I feel I must mention is father Brannan. In all other which-trial books I have read, the priests have been the villains. In this book, the father is a kind, spirited, and often funny man. Some of the descriptions of him, and his dialogue actually made me laugh aloud. Raven is an extremely one-of-a-kind character. He cant hear, cant talk, doesn't always understand things, and has an awful temper, but one can fully understand Marnie's love for him. The story line is well-planned, and captivating. From tragedy to comedy to romance, this is a book I would recommend to anyone 12+."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet is an uplifting tale that has strong characterizations and a interesting plot. The book follows the tale of a young teenage girl named Marnie who has been brought to the town of Tocurra against her will through a marriage that she isn't all to happy about either. She is then put through many hardships with only the priest and fellow outcast Raver/Raven. This book is very well written and enjoyable. The characters seem real and have their flaws as well as their strengths. The villan is completly dispicable and the townspeople are simply infuriating.Even though this book is wonderful, it does have it's week points. Sometimes, things just get so bad for Marnie it seems exaggerated. That or she just seems to have incredibally bad luck.Overall though, this book in incredibly entertaining and a good book to pick up when you are looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I loved this book. The characters were great and the story line was fantastic, I found Nadia Batcha's review very unhelpful. I found the book was the complete opposite of what she said. Marnie was different so the towns people disliked her and Marnie couldn't understand that, she was bold, brave and she stood up for her beliefs, she befriended a boy who was deaf when the townspeople thought he was mad, thats why they disliked her, and they thought she was a witch because of how her husband died so suddenly. Her family didnt take the small house because as the book says there wasn't enough room for the whole family and there wasn't enough land. She didn't go back to her old home because she loved the house she had and it was rightfully hers so why should she give it up? Also the new overseer back at the Isherwood estate would just keep spreading lies and rumours and would just give her the hardest jobs like he used to do. This book made me cry, laugh, feel happy and feel angry and thats what I think a good book should do. I couldn't put this book down and i have read it a number of times and I would read it again and again. I thought the love story between Marnie and Ravan was tantalising, it was so romantic sometimes that it bought tears to my eyes and made me want to be her, and when she had to go through the pain, torture and torment of the witch trial I put myself in her position and i felt angry, upset and it made me cry a lot. When Isake abused her it made me feel angry and want to do something. This book seemed so real to me, that is probably why it was such an excellent read. Once again I will say that I loved it, and I will say that it is one of the best books I have ever read. This is one of my favourite books and I urge others who havn't read it to read it because if you don't you are missing out on a very good read."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Amazing!

If I had to list my top 10 favorite books this would be one of them (and I have read more then my share of books for a 14 year old), it is so good.

PLEASE read this book you have no idea what you are missing!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Sherryl Jordan has written a great book here about Marnie and Raver; two totally different people but yet they are similar. Marnie is a new comer to the town and Raven is deaf. Marnie and Raven make friends and soon they are communicating with a sign language. The villagers suspect her for witchcraft and for this they label them 'the village witch and the village madman'When Marnie gets put to a trial for witch craft will she prove innocent ? Or will they simply hang her?Read this story of friendship and love, hate and betrayal.This is an awesome book! Make sure you read it!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I liked The Raging Quiet a lot because it dealt with spunky and courageous characaters who were different. It was really exciting and I couldn't wait to read the next chapter. I also liked it because it penetrates the heart of human nature and makes us ask ourselves if we could ever be as brave or kind as Marnie, or Raven, or Father Brannan. The villagers make us wonder if we are like them, if we could harm someone for being different and trying to make someone else's life happier. Even though it wouldn't be good for a young child because of hard words and hard concepts, anyone who likes a bitter but heartwarming novel should read this. This was a great story and should be compared to the best books. It was a lot like Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness, Immortals, and Protector of the Small serieses in the way of time period, spunky heroines, and important lessons and qualities."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"this is one the most moving stories i have ever read.the relationship between Marnie and Raven is timeless.the are some parts where you cringe at some of the stupid and unknowing stuff Raven does but it just adds to the sure enjoyment of the book.at some points you are in tears when you read about the harsh ways the village people treat marnie and Raven.But you know the priest will always be there for them.A surpurb book and i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was touching and inspiring and just wonderful. It's the story of a young girl marrying a man twice her age to save her family. She is widowed and accused by the village people of murdering her husband and being a witch. She is befriended by the village priest and a deaf boy who everyone thinks is mad. It's a love story, if anyone wants to know. It's hard for me to read abook without one. But, though there is romance in it, there's compassionate love and understanding love. The witch trial and the low-tolerance level of the villagers is appalling and sadly all too true of that time period and this one if you think about it. But, it's a truly moon-good (from the book) piece of art."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is a very good book. The beginning was kind of slow, but after that i couldn't put the book down!! The part where Marnie is tried for being a witch is very intense. The author did an awesome job of describing how Marnie was feeling, I could feel it to. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is truely a wonderful book. Set in or around England in (I am guessing) the early 1700s it tells a story of a strong girl and how people of that time did not deal with differneces well. Marnie, the main character, is forced to marry a lord so her family can keep their house. The man was once married with grown children and is about 40 years to her 16. They go to live in another town in a house the people of the village think is haunted. Her husband dies from falling off their roof and the villagers think that Marnie put a curse on him. She is an outcast and her only friends are a kind priest and the madman of the town. Marnie finds out that the madman is not crazy, just deaf and unable to communicate. Marnie creates a type of sign language and the two become closer friends and can communicate. Then the brother of Marnie's former husband comes and wants to take the house. He also convinces the people of the village that Marnie is a witch. She is tried and while reading that part you get very into it. Like you know what it was like for Marnie. The end of her trial is settled very abruptly for you think it would go on longer for all the trouble she endured. Its a great ending though and a fantasic book to read. I really enjoyed Marnie making the sign language."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet is a novel set in the 1800's, a time when women were given little respect and differences were considered witchery. Marnie is a strong young woman who has to give her hand in marriage to a much older Duke in order to save her family from starvation. This man is a drinker and makes Marnie feel uneasy. He brings her to an ancestor's rundown cottage instead of the lavish surroundings she expected. He says they will not stay, and he is there only to get something. He dies from a fatal fall two days after the marriage. The town's people suspect Marnie murdered him, they believe she is a witch. Only the town priest stands up for and helps Marnie. The other oucast of the town, a boy they call Raver, is claimed to have devils in him because he doesn't listen and can't speak. Marnie finds he's not possessed at all and they create an intricate form of communication and form an everlasting bond. Despite the gossip and hate of the towspeople for Marnie and Raven , as she now calls him, their love grows. Tremendous obsticles stand in Marnie's way she must confront and concur them. This is a wonderful story of overcoming hatred and ignorance and being strong enough to find your own way."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book is an inspiring tale of love and prejudice. Very well writen. Great word choice."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I liked this book a lot. I found it facsinating how Marnie came up with a whole bunch of hand signals to communacate with a deaf boy, Raven. Her determination and frustration with him make the book seem even more real. Even though it's fiction, the witchcraft trial and other basic things from life in this time era keep the reader interested while teaching them some new things at the same time. I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in deafness, witchcraft, and tales of determination and the struggle some people went through in life during this very strict time."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I loved the plot, it kept me on the edge, so I didn't want to put it down. Marnie and Raven were falsely accused of things that they weren't, because the towns people had closed their minds to new people and ideas. I liked how the priest was kind and how he helped the main characters to endure their hardships. I loved it. It had alot of feeling, and made me cry, mad and happy all at once."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet is a beautifully crafted book about love,compassion, and the fullfilment of being a friend to another. This book teaches that these things (friendship,compassion, and love) are beautiful things which should be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book changed my thoughts on other people who are different. Marnie and Raven's thoughts became my own. I saw the unkindful town of Torcurra through their eyes, a town so filled with sameness and bitterness."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This was one of the most haunting and beautifully written books I have read in a long time. Miss Jordan captured the medaeval setting wonderfully and she conveyed the attitude of the towns people perfectly. I finished it in one sitting! Sherryl Jordan comes across with a very important lesson. Love knows no bounds."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I disagree strongly with what Nadia Batcha had to say about this book. I think that the book was very well written and had an excellent storyline, it made me cry, laugh and was very addictive, i have probably read it about 10 times already! I cant put it down!To answer your questions Nadia:1. She could not return home because there had been rumours about her; and the new overseer would keep on giving her hard jobs and try to blacken her name even more.2. Marnie's family couldnt take the smaller house because their family was too big and if they did that then Marnie would hav had to stay on the Isherwood Estate and as i have already said:there had been rumours about her; and the new overseer would keep on giving her hard jobs and try to blacken her name even more.3. She did not turn on any of the 'rules' and 'openly flaunt them' because all she did was help a poor deaf lad who was troubled and confused. This shows she is a strong character for doing what she believes in and not being a sheep because she has to do what the village people find 'acceptable'.4. The preist did not hate all the people in the village and I see no reason for him to move parish (which would be a very hard thing to do in them days) and he was happy there anyway - it wasnt as though everybody in Tocurra hated him he was happy and he never hated them.5. You said about how she goes and 'flaunts all the rules' or whatever then you have a go at her for marrying Raven - well IF she is flaunting the rules what is wrong wth her marryin raven? Is there something wrong with him just because he is death? There is nothing wrong with her doing that.I think that this book is an excellent book and have recommened it to many of my friends who all loved it, i think that anyone who hasnt read this book is missing out and that anyone who thinks this book is trash - i suggest that if they think THIS book is trash then they can like no other book because this is exactly how a book should be - perfect."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is a really really good book. Sixteen-year-old Marnie moves with her new and older husband to a small fishing village. When he dies suddenly, the villagers suspect her of killing him. Lonely, she befriends the village madman and discovers he is deaf, not insane. She invents a way of talking through her hands and the villagers try her for witchcraft. The words are really powerful and I really loved it."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I thought this book was written so well. But the story of the love and misfourtune is so suductive!I loved this book. It was the best on ei have ever read!! I would recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"&quot;The Raging Quiet&quot; is about Marnie, a sixteen year old who marries Isake, a man twice her age in order to save her family and ailing father. On their wedding night, Isake gets drunk and rapes her. The harrowing act leaves Marnie utterly shattered. Two days afterward, Isake falls off the roof (in a fairly unexplained accident) and dies. The villagers are immediately suspicious of Marnie.Soon afterwards, Marnie makes friends with Father Brannan, a local priest, and Raver, the &quot;mad&quot; boy in town. She soon finds out that Raver isn't mad, he's just deaf, and struggles to teach him her version of sign language. However, even her friend the priest finds it hard to accept her unconventional ways, and after a while, Isake's greedy older brother and the suspicious townspeople catch up with her and accuse her of witchcraft.Many parts of &quot;The Raging Quiet&quot; are good, especially the tumultuous relationship Marnie has with Raver, who gets frustrated and acts strangely. I appreciated that none of the relationships Marnie had with other people were perfect, even with the priest, with whom she argues constantly. However, Marnie herself wasn't a likable character as the story progressed. Her pigheaded arrogance and blind determination were often irritating, especially during the unexplainable times when she could have defended herself, but instead turned a blind eye to insults. Perhaps it was a character trait, but sometimes I would find myself dreading who she was going to alienate next. None of the characters showed very much growth. Except for the priest, Marnie and Raver, everyone seemed to be one-sidedly evil and out to get her.There is also a totally unnecessary subplot, about a woman who lived in Marnie's house before she did, and how something about the property must be valuable, which gave an odd &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; treasure hunt touch to a book about prejudice and tolerance. In the beginning, the author runs back to the events before Marnie's marriage, which confuses things a lot, because you're not quite sure where the present events end and the past ones begin.The writing was not very good, either. The accusations against Marnie don't really anger you, they just make you kind of sick. Occasionally, there was a strident tone attacking the sexual double standard and how women were treated in the old days (both of which I find repugnant) as people accused Marnie of promiscuity. However, since for some inexplicable reason the book is set in a nonexistent country, you can't really tell when or where it is, so it lessens the accuracy. And even the witch hunting seemed a little drawn out- it is only a brief part near the end.For a better, much more harrowing and historically accurate account of witch hunting in Renaissance Europe, read &quot;The Burning Time.&quot; All in all, &quot;The Raging Quiet&quot; tries to do too many things, and only goes halfway with all of them."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This book may be fine writing and may have great characters, but I was disappointed to find that in the first few pages, we see a young girl basically experiencing rape at the hands of her new \\"husband\\". My daughter is 12 years old, and perhaps the author thinks that 12 year olds are ready for this type of writing. The writing was explicit enough that it made my daughter uncomfortable. Parents, please pre-read this book to make sure that it is appropriate for your teen daughter."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet is one of the best books EVER written! It follows the story of Marty a working girl who marries Issac her boss in order to keep her family on his land and in a home.

And why does he want it so badly?"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I absolutely loved this book. LOVED it. Marnie and Raven are wonderful. Raven is exactly the kind of man I hope to marry! Historically correct and unbelievably dreamy. I felt like I was at a loss when I finished it. I liked all of the infromation on which trials and the beautiful friendship and love that all of the characters shared. It's a a sort of drama, but mostly about a young adult romance. ... Although Sherryl Jordan's \\"The Juniper Game\\" was a huge disappointment to me , this one made up for everything. The kindest girl, a wonderfully friendly priest, and a warm hearted young man. Just make sure not to read the last page (as I frequently do before finishing it) so it can have the greatest impact on you."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"An excellent book for teens who enjoy romance and history. Set in a time when strange behavior could only be attributed to witchcraft and the devil's work, young Marnie is uprooted from the only home she ever knew to live with her new husband in Fernleigh, a seaside village. Their marriage abruptly ends when Marnie's husband falls from the roof of his cottage to his death. She remains in town and befriends the village \\"mad boy\\" and local priest, Father Brannan. The suspicious folks in town brand Marnie a witch for her husband's death and for being able to communicate with the mad boy, Raven. It turns out that Raven is deaf, but the villagers' inability to diagnose this disability causes them to fear and whip him in public.Marnie and Raven speak with hand signs, a form of sign language Marnie invented. The villagers treat both of them like outcasts, which subsequently strengthens their bond that eventually blossoms into a relationship, and ultimately marriage.Marnie endures one \\"test\\" after another and remains standing at the end. Her tenacity, strong will, and adoring protector, Raven, aided her to overcome the rough times in her life. A must read for those who root for the underdog, the downtrodden, but strong female protagonist."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I love reading, and this is on my top twenty list. A kind of love beyond love, more important than life is described in this book. I loved Marnie's way of thinking, her independence, and her hope. This book is much like another of my favorites, The China Garden. Delicious and Satifying!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I love Sherryl Jordan's books, so when this one came out, I bought it. Once into the book, I couldn't stop. The book touched me, and since I bought it (about a month ago), I've read it four more times! I understood how Marnie felt when she had to marry for her family (not that I've had to do that!), and I loved when Raven nursed the injured rabbit back to health. All the characters- Marnie, Raven (Raver), and Father Brannan, made up a great story!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The compelling and spellbinding story of a young woman and a young man who is deaf, set in the times when many women were suspected of witchcraft and killed. You love the charactors and can't wait to find out what will happen to them. An amazing love story and with a great plot and a terrific ending! Beautifully written! You can't stop reading it once you pick it up! Highly reccomended for anyone (especially girls) thirteen and up."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I love this book. I think everyone who loves romance and midieval times should read this novel. It is a true work of literature. I was sad, but still quite satisfied, when I turned the last page. Everyone of all ages will love this book as much as I have! A must if you like Jane Austen. Truly spectacular."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"As a Children's Department Supervisor for a bookstore, I was lucky enough to get an advance reader's copy of this wonderful book. I found myself genuinely caring about what happened to the characters and was nearly as excited as Marnie to see Raven communicate with the hand gestures she taught him. Pick this book up, it will be hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet's beautiful cover (by the excellent artist Kinuko Craft) and synopsis interested me. A romance between a young widow and a deaf boy? It sounded promising, as did a quote on the back describing the book as a fairy tale romance with spice (or something to that effect).Unfortunately, the book failed me on a few levels. My biggest qualm with it is the main character, Marnie. I just didn't like her at all. She's described as being \\"bold,\\" but she's also terribly naive, to the point of outright stupidity. She expects people to understand her sometimes confusing actions without providing any explanation, then acts like she's a martyr when they don't. Certainly, she goes through a lot of stuff in the book that no one deserves to experience, but some of her problems were only the result of her own pigheaded actions. Now, my real problem here is not that she messed up, but that she (and the other \\"good\\" characters) act as if she's perfect. Father Brannan, a priest, calls her a \\"saint\\" over and over again, in fact, for no real reason I can see. (Befriending an outcast is a good thing, but if that's all it takes to be a saint ...)I had trouble with some of the other characters too. Though it's really nice to see a positive church figure, Father Brannan was a little bit too enthusiastic in his worship of Marnie, as mentioned above. Marnie's first husband, Isake, changed so fast from being generally pleasant and respectable to being a drunken rapist that it almost gave me whiplash. I know alcohol can do strange things to people, but I really wish there was some explanation for why he randomly decided to get so drunk on his wedding night.... Which brings to a minor point of discontent: the sex. No, it wasn't terribly graphic or anything like that; what bothered me on this account was the view of sex. (spoilers) Even though things went horribly between Marnie and Isake, things are magically perfect between Marnie and Raven the first time, and the way events happened in the story, it seemed like Marnie could not marry Raven until she knew he would be good in bed. Since this was the sole thing that changed between her not being willing to marry one day and her getting married the next day, it seems the most important part of marriage is sex. And what's more, Father Brannan (the priest, remember?) gave them a *wink wink nudge nudge* approval of the premarital encounter. Um, what? I realize that this view of sex and marriage probably won't bug most people, but it really bothered me.On the positive side, the part of the premise that I was really interested in (a woman learning to communicate with a deaf man) seemed well done. I have no idea whether or not it's realistic since I don't know how deaf people have been treated over the course of history (and Jordan doesn't provide a specific period for the story anyway), but yeah, it was interesting, and it makes me want to do my own research on the topic."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is a beautifully sweet love story with a twist: the boy is deaf. Everything seems to go wrong for Marnie, then she's blessed with the love of Raven. This is definitely a page-turner. I've read it several times."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This is a great book and one of the few I've read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"The Raging Quiet was absolutely \\"moon good beautiful\\" -definitely worth the read. It reminds me a bit of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and works by Thomas Hardy, but of course, an easier read. If you're a fan of The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare and Beauty by Robin McKinely, I highly recommend you to give this a try. As a cautionary note though, there are adult themes in this book, such as implied sex; therefore, I suggest that the reading age of The Raging Quiet to be 16+.I won't summarize the story since there's a lovely one by Amazon already, but I would like to address the setting of the novel. There have been debates on whether this is historical or fantasy. To clear this up, allow me to quote from the Author's Note in the back of the book: \\"[Sherryl Jordan] left their tale in the freer atmosphere of myth, and simply wrote a fantasy set in an ancient time.\\""},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This must be one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. A story about outcasts, people who are different, and how you should never judge a person before you get to know them.The tale starts with Marnie Isherwood, who has just married Isake Isherwood (who is old enough to be her dad) to save her family, and escpae from the lies the boys at her old home used to tell about her. But married life isn't the bliss she had once dreamed of, and Marnie finds it so unbearable she prays to God to do something to make it stop, and when her husband dies in an accident the next day, she is distraught and runs to teh priest, saying she killed him. Of course, the preist makes her see sense and how it wasn't an accident, but the towns people, hearing her confess, will not forget about her husbands death and belive she was the one to cause it and not to be trusted. So Marnie becomes an outcast, met with hatred wherever she goes, but for the kind priest and the local madboy, Raven, whom she forms a specail bond with. It is only after a noisy night that would have awoken the heavens that Marnie finally realises why it is that Raven seems to mad to understand human communication and thought to be possessed by devils, because he can't hear!The rest of the story tells of Marnie's attempt to communicate with Raven, their rudemantory sign launguage, and the townfolks widening distrust, now weaved with ideas that she is a witch, and in a time when witches were still killed if found guilty, Marnie falls into alot of danger.It is not only teh story though that makes this such an unforgettable book. The author's writing style is perfect, giving a fluent, entertaining read, with so much descrcription and beauty, you could truly feel Marnie's pain, frustration, anger, worry, sadness and love, and fall in love with each of teh different charactors, whether it be the priest, Raven, or Marnie herself. The gpood charactors are so likeable, the evil ones easy to hate, and the story itself is faultless, and gives a depth rarely available in teenge books today.The only things I was dissapointed about where not finding out what had happened to Marnie's dad to make him paralysed in the first place, and never knowing what Father Brannin had written to Marnie and Raven in teh book he gave them.Beautiful story, must read."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I was captivated by this book during a time when I needed to be transported to another world. My husband David and daughter Angela got into it just as much when I shared it with them. The tough chapters at the beginning, covering Marnie's first marriage, and the painful ordeal near the end, are \\"fair comment\\" on the bad times life can dish out without dripping crass vulgarity. They make the positive energy between Marnie and Raven all the more precious as it grows. Marnie's relationship with Raven and with Father Brannan delighted my 60+ husband and my 15-year-old daughter, alike. I don't think it matters whether one views Marnie's experience as an approximation of \\"real life\\" in a mythical time appoximating the middle ages, or as metaphorical fantasy for bad love and good love and the challenge of getting by when you are different, in our own times. It works. That's all."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"I read this book years ago, and even as a thirteen year old (back then) I loved it. It's a wonderful tale of a misunderstood young man, and a down-trodden girl who find each other and together they become one!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"After finishing this wonderful book, I actually had to take a day to ponder over the story and its richly described characters. Marnie, recently married to a man twice her age, travels to their new home together. Marnie, only 16 years old, does not have any romantic feelings towards Isake. She merely married the man to save her family from losing their home.Upon moving to the village that would become their home, Marnie witnesses a young man being whipped. His name is Raver (because it sounds like he raves like a lunatic when he communicates); however, Marnie later realizes that his problem isn't madness, it is that he cannot hear. During the time that she discovers this kindred soul in the village (Raver, whom she calls Raven), her husband dies. The villagers accuse her of witchcraft that caused her husband's death, and they shun her. As a result, she and Raven end up sharing her cottage, in order to keep themselves away from the violent and angry villagers.Their only friend is Father Brannan, the kindly village priest, who brings them food and consoles them during their time of frustration with the villagers. Despite Father Brannan's attempts at getting the villagers to welcome both Marnie and Raven, Marnie and Raven discover a life separate from the hatred and segregation of the village, and end up falling in love.This is a magical, warm story! The characters come to life, so much so, they actually seem like real people. Their energies just come off the page. While I was reading the book, I was so happy that Marnie and Raven found each other -- Raven, having spent 17 years of his life abused, harshly treated, and misunderstood; and Marnie, never knowing the true feelings of romantic love until she came across someone who needed her just as badly as she needed him.A highly recommended book. Don't let the Young Adult label sway you away from reading this book. This is a book that can be read by anyone at any age.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READING AND WELL WORTH YOUR WHILE!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"&quot;The Raging Quiet&quot; by Sheryll Jordan, was one of the most excellent books I've ever read. Strong characters, a great story line, a good setting - they all add up to a wonderful story that can be read again and again.Marnie is forced to marry a lord, in order to help her peasant family, and she leaves her home for the fishing village of Torcurra. She is not happy living with her drunken husband, who claims that the &quot;cursed&quot;, broken down cottage where they live is very valuable. But then, suddenly, he dies in an accident, and Marnie is left to fend for herself.Seeking friendship in a kind priest, she meets a &quot;mad&quot; boy, who cries and raves, thus called Raver. Soon she learns that &quot;Raven&quot; is not mad, only deaf! Marnie begins teaching him hand signs, and forms a bond with him, but then the villagers brand her a witch, and test her with the iron bar.This book was wonderful, and I'd recommend it for ages 12 and up. I'd also recommend &quot;Breaking Rank&quot;, by Randall, which is another story of prejudice."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! It's such a tender and compelling story and the love story in it is wonderful as well. I can relate to all the charactors and I adore Raven! It's my favorite book of all time (and I have read a LOT of books!) the best part is, anyone over 12 or 13 years old (because it does contain a fair amount of romance) can read it! Teenagers will love it and I know a 50 year old who loves it! If you don't read this book you don't know what you're missing! This book makes you feel pride in yourself and makes you want to be who you truly are. It shows the true beauty of diversity. This book will leave you in awe; the amazing, adventerous and passionate story of a young man and a young woman; Marnie and Raven; who are not afraid of being different."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Some truly amazing things come out of New Zealand: the Haka, the Lord of the Rings movies, and this book.I won't rehash the storyline of this book, as the other reviewers here have already described it very well. I won't give you any spoilers, either, because I hate it when reviewers do that! (Why buy the book when someone has already told you the ending in their review?) What I will say, though, is that writer Sherryl Jordan has gone above and beyond to write this impressive novel. All of the characters in it are good, and the heroine, Marnie, is awesome, but Raven is especially endearing--it is obvious from the way the author has written this touchingly beautiful deaf character that she herself has worked extensively with the deaf. (I find it rather poignant, too, that Raven, a so called 'madman', ultimately turns out to be the sanest person in the whole village!)Sometimes I am overly generous with my ratings, but this is not one of those times. This really is a five star novel! I notice that it is described as a book for young adults, but seriously, I would thoroughly recommend it to readers of any age who want a mature, intelligent, well written, well thought out novel that will totally grip them and not let them go again! Trust me, this book is better than a whole pack of chocolate biscuits, and will satisfy you for much longer.Obviously, I totally agree with the other glowing reviews this book has been given on this website. However, I've noticed that it got a few bad reviews, which were all so silly they made me laugh out loud. The reviews written by 'evilgrrlfriday' and 'Nadia Batcha' were particularly laughable--either they were reading a copy of the book with half the pages missing, or they read it the same way my boyfriend sometimes likes to watch videos, by simply 'fast-forwarding' through most of the dialogue. Seriously, this is an easy-to-read, well written book, so how did they manage to misunderstand it so completely? *sigh* My advice is to take those bad reviews with a grain of salt, or even better, to ignore them entirely, because the people who wrote them obviously didn't read or understand this book properly--if they had, then they wouldn't have raised the points or questions they did. The fault is with their comprehension skills, not with the book itself. Read it, and then read the reviews, and you'll know exactly what I mean!P.S. I actually do have one criticism of this book, and that is that its American cover design is not as nice as the British one. The Brits version is absolutely gorgeous. Even the inside layout on the 'B format' is way better. Check it out on Amazon.uk, where you will at least see the front cover art."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"Two words. Powerfully Awesome. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. The characters are wondefully portrayed, they really seem like real people. All the way through the book I can just picture Marnie, Raven and Father Brannan. I started reading this book last night, at around 10pm.. I finished at 2:58am. I just couldn't stop. By the time I was half way through, I started crying, and didn't stop until the very last page. I have never cried so much over a book, and the emotions this one brought up were amazing. I totally recommend it, I love Sherryl Jordan's books! And this one was just sooo awesome :)"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This was a very well written book with an excellent premise and a quick, exciting plot. The all the characters were very well developed. The main character posessed a depth that is all too rare, and very appreciated. The plot was very good, good enough for me to stay up till one in the morning to finish it. As an avid reader of both childrens literature and adult novels in all genres, I recommend this to anyone who wishes to read a good story."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"read it originally when I was in high school and recently bought myself a copy and re reading it. it is so easy to read and the story is great. i wish there were more books like this/by this author."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"i have never read a book which stays with me for so long as this one. the raging quiet is a love story, and one which is better for its simplicity, its subtle power without being overwhelmingly epic. it is also a story of injustice, and when the story finally turns and comes against the main character, it happens in such a horrible and unthinkably grotesque way, made all the worse for knowing that these things really did happen, that the pain is not softened by it being told in words.for someone who adores writing that flows, and stories that are beautiful, there can be no better book than this"},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"An amazing novel-it shimmers. I picked it up not expecting much, but this is a really well-written and unusual historical romance with a touch of fairytale and fantasy about it. Marnie, a girl fighting the bonds of her life and the cruelty of the world, is a character who's very easy to empathize with as she denies her slowly growing attraction to Raver, the magnetic, wild deaf boy whom she teaches to speak in sign language. Solid plot and really wonderful ending, vivid and tender descriptions and love story, this simple book about a man and woman persecuted by a village's superstition is one in a hundred. Not everyone will absolutely love it-it is very simplistically written and probably for younger readers-but enjoyable for everyone."},{"Title":"The Raging Quiet","review":"This definatly the most brilliant book I've ever read. To sum it up, it's about a lovely, kind, sixteen-year-old girl named Marnie who comes to a tiny seaside town called Torcurra with her (considerably older) new husband. As they arrive, they witness the beating of a mad boy. Marnie gives him some food while her husband is in the Alehouse. That night, her husband, drunk and with a \\"thirst for lust\\" rapes Marnie. Two days later, he falls from a ladder, and dies. She has befriended the priest, who is the only one who believes that Marnie didn't put a curse on her husband. She has also befriended Raver, the very same village madboy whom the villagers were beating when she came. She renames him Raven of the fields, and, after spending more and more time with him, discovers Raven is not crazy, or mad, he is deaf. Over time, they invent a sign-language of sorts. The villagers notice a change in Raven, who has become civil and no longer has noticable \\"fits of madness.\\" Well, one thing leads to another, and the villagers get a notion that Marnie murdered her husband, and bewitched Raven and Father Brannan (the priest). She is tried for witchcraft... and you'll have to read the book to find out.I won't go saying that Marnie, doesn't have her flaws, because she does. But what do you want, a perfect main charachter?? I've read books that have the same perfect, unflawed main character, and you know what it is?? BORING! No one is perfect (although we hate to admit it), and we all have charachter flaws that get us into trouble...Marnie is very outspoken for a woman of her time, but whose wrong, here. The townspeople and Marnie's family who are unwilling to accept Raven? (and everyone else who is different)Or a young woman who is willing to give everyone a chance, even if they \\"aren't normal.\\" Early in the book, in answer to Isake's remark about the townspeope beating Raven which was something like \\"oh, look, a group of sages beating the devils out of a fool,\\" Marnie says \\"or maybe its a group of fools trying to beat the devils out of a sage.\\" That is one of the best things I've ever heard, thats all I want to say.I just read a review that said that there was too much sexual content for the age group. First of all, what age group would that be? Sure, a bit advanced for a ten-year-old, maybe, but it says on the back of the book ages 12 and up. Second of all, WHAT SEXUAL CONTENT?? If one beautifully written (pretty tame) love scene between two exuisite characters is that bad...Well this is neither the time or the place.As an aspiring writer, I was entranced by the beautiful imagery, and amazing character development. You hate the evil charachters, and you love the nice ones. Just the right amout of romance (I have to say that I am one giant hopeless romantic) the right amount of exitetment and agitation, and fantasy. A picture perfect read!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I love all of Julie Garwood's books,but &quot;Castles&quot; is the best.It had a good beginning,middle,and end,unlike some of her other books.The best part about her books are the characters have morals. &quot;Castles&quot; is a wonderful book about finding love and a family to belong to."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I must admit all romance novels resemble each other, but even though this is true I cannot seem to tear myself away from reading them. Garwood is a very good and I have enjoyed most of her books. I definitely recommend Castles, it is one of my favorite Garwood books, and my least favorites are Prince Charming and Come the Spring and they were still good. I have read an enormous amount of novels and would say Garwood is one of the best. If you would like to read the best, check out Judith McNaughts novels. She is the mecca of romance novelists. All of her novels are exceptional. My favorites: Paradise, Whitney my Love, and Once and Always."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"If you read romance novels you're undoubtedly already a fan of Julie Garwood. She's one of the very best, and she consistently delivers great books. &quot;Castles&quot; is my personal favorite. The heroine, Alesandra, is particularly well suited to Garwood's blend of humor and naivete. She's lead a plausibly sheltered life and is quite charming as she bungles her way through all the new experiences that come her way once she meets Colin. Best of all, you feel like she's got a brain in her head and some common sense despite her general innocence about the world. I also really liked Colin. Yes, he is stuborn and frequently blind to what is staring him in the face, but in a believable way. A very likable alpha male.A special treat for Garwood fans will be catching up on characters from previous novels - &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;. If you haven't read the other novels, don't worry - they can be read in any particular order."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have read quite a few Julie Garwood books, and have liked most of them. The others bothered me for some reason that I could not put my finger on. After reading this book, I finally figured it out. The heros spend the novel telling the heroines what to do and what not to do. They are not cruel, but they treat the heroines like children and make it clear that they are the masters and decision-makers in the relationship.Castles is a prime example of this. He dictated what Alesandra could wear, who she talked to and where she could go. I realize that this is a historical romance, but I still think that a marriage needs a certain degree of trust and mutual respect even in the 1800's. Without these elements, I do not see how there can be any love. Colin treated Alesandra like a toddler. He even kept her prisoner in the house when they were first married.Alesandra was equally annoying. She insisted she would do what she pleased while following Colins orders, and she did not come off very bright. I think Ms. Garwood tossed in the detail that she was so brilliant with numbers to make her appear smart, but I never saw her use this ability.All in all, a very annoying novel that had a very similiar storyline with The Gift, Guardian Angel, and Lions Lady. No insult to Julie Garwood. She has written some wonderful stories like Ransom, Saving Grace and The Secret. I am not through reading Julie Garwood but i've had it with her regency romance books."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Colin and Alesandra were great together from the beginning. I enjoyed Colin's disregard for propriety and Alesandra's little schemes that were always meant to help someone whether they wanted it or not. Again I thought the mystery portion of this story was a little predictable, but not overly so. Other than a brief mention of Lyon, he and his wife Christina were absent from this book, but all of the other couples from this series were included in this story. I appreciated the chance for an update on all of them. This is a wonderful series and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This kept me reading all day. I loved the plot. I thought it was original. I was intrigued with the characters, and therefore I give it 5 stars. I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Castles written by Julie Garwood is my second favorite. I have read it three times and I have found things I missed the first time around. I highly recommend his book."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of my favorite books by her. I've read everything she's written, and now wait anxiously for the next release. The heroine in his story is witty and fun and makes me laugh constantly. If you love historical romance, you can't help but love Julie Garwood. If it has her name on it, I know I will love it."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is a beautiful story that I didn't want to end! I found myself laughing out loud in parts! I really love historical romance and Julie Garwood excels in this genre."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"After reading the three previous books in this series (Lion's Lady, Guardian Angel, The Gift) Castles was probably the slowest in the beginning. It wasn't as fast paced as Guardian Angel and it wasn't as hilarious as The Gift but I rated it with 5 stars because of Colin! I believe he was the best man out of all the men(Lyon, Caine, and Nathan) in this series! Nathan, from The Gift, does a huge turn around in Castles!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"If you love silly (in a good way), saccharine sweet, Mary Sue romances this a book you would enjoy. There's very little plot to the story and very little character development of minor characters. Our heroine disposition is very similar to Maria, (Julie Andrew's character from the Sound of Music). While our hero is the typical alpha male mold. Although not \\"a keeper\\". I did enjoy the story for what it was. I just wish that a better plot had been developed for it. A serial killer that struck no fear in my heart, deaths of characters I could barely remember and a demented general intent on forcing the Princess to marry him in order to secure the crown did nothing to enrich the story at all. I think people that love this book simply fell in love with the simple nature of Hero and Heroine."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is a very good book with humor, romance and mystery. One of the reasons I love Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"After reading The Gift by Julie I have been clamoring to find the other three books of series and for some reason I bought this one first. I guess Colin had a lot to do with it. He really made an impression on me and I had to find out about him. This book was really enchanting and Alesander was maybe a little naive but being raised in a convent she would have been very sheltered and loved. I will go into detail of this book because so many people have,but I will say that it was a wonderful follow-up to The Gift. I'm so happy that Colin and Alesander found a deep and unbounding love for each other. Really enjoyed the humor and slight mystery tones as well. Read this book I highly recommen it. Now I'll have to go look for Guardian Angel,and Lyon's Lady."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I liked this book alot, it's one of my favorites. But it was just way too predictable, the serial killer's identity should be easy enough to uncover.."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I read this story two years ago and I can still remember snatches of dialouges between characters. Colin has to be my favourite hero and Alessandra and heroine. I loved their bulter Flannaghan too as he was so very funny when he first saw Alessandra at the door. To those who haven't read this book yet, do read it. I'll wager you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I really liked this book and can say it is one of my Garwood favorites. It seemed to have a lot more plot to it than some of her other novels and it was refreshing to have a female heroine who was a bit different from Garwood's other females. Alessandra was so intelligent, very detailed and organized, and wasn't quite as naive as the usual Garwood female (who goes tumbling about not thinking about what she's doing). I liked how Alessandra was the one with the money and she was very good with finances. She and Colin made a perfect match. It was so cute how she kept all those lists!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"The witty, playful dialogue was a joy to read and I found myself laughing out loud several times. The characters were a joy also, the two leads were sweet and adorably flawed and the secondary characters were also surprisingly well rounded. The family members as well as Colin's servant enriched the story with thier little nuances. The plot didn't get tired or boring as some often do. I really recomend this book!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This book was really easy to read and I finished it in one night. I really liked the princess, and I found Colin to be very charming, if stubborn. However, the mystery part of it seemed forced, especially at the end. And the relationship between Colin and Alessandra could have been developed further. I just really didn't like how Alessandra never really stands up to Colin, despite the ways that he treats her at times. She would be thinking to herself that she's completely angry at him, but whenever she opened her mouth, it seemed like nothing had happened and everything was fine, even after a life-threatening experience. One part I thought could have been dealt with more was before their wedding, with Colin's hair. I thought for sure that she was going to give him a piece of her mind...but of course not. I kept waiting for something completely dramatic to happen, but the story remained flat throughout. There was so many instances where issues could have been addressed with more: Colin's hair, Catherine &amp; Alessandra's necklace switch, Alessandra's house arrest that just ended with no mention...etc, etc. My point is, this book had tons of potential to become a great story rather than just being so-so."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have been reading Julie Garwood for several years and she is my favorite author. I am hooked on historical romance especially set in England or Scotland. This as well as all of her books was so much fun, The characters of the story make you happy, sad and mad all throughout the story. I fall into a different world with her stories and wishing I could be everyone of her leading ladies. I recommend any of her books and can't wait until the next one comes out."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"The very first book I read was &quot;The Bride&quot; and I was &quot;hooked!&quot; A friend gave me her complete set and I couldn't set them down, I was done in a matter of days reading ALL her books. I can't tell you when I enjoyed an author so completely as I have Ms. Garwood. I look forward to each date of her new book's release! Now I own &quot;my&quot; own set!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I read this book first out of the quintet, and I wasn't all that encoraged by it. But I heard tons of good things about Lion's Lady Guardin Angel and The Gift, so I decided to give it a go. I love the other ones, and now looking back on it, I might enjoy Castles more. I thought Colin was just too stubborn in refusing to marry Alessandra, and she seemed very aloof and not all that spunky at first. of course, as the book progresses, her mettle starts to show, but i kind of thought of her as a flake at the begining, and that thought stayed (unfortunatly) with me through out the book. But I am not sorry I read it, and Julie Garwood is the best."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"For a novel presumably set in 1820, Garwood sure uses a lot of phrases that weren't used until 1920 - like \\"yeah\\" and \\"sexy.\\" Regency gentlemen don't think someone is \\"sexy.\\" Reading that just jars me entirely out of the story. Also, how about how he has her sit on his lap in front of visitors? Please, they would barely touch in company. Garwood obviously knows nothing about the period - and it shows. This is just terribly written. Skip and read something by Joanna Bourne or Loretta Chase!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have read a lot of Julie Garwood's work, and for the longest time she was on my list of favorite authors. Im sorry to say that that is no longer the case. Lately every book that I have read by Ms. Garwood has been mediocre at best. \\"Castles\\" was just awful..I actually liked Colin , but Alesandra was just a whiny, childish wimp. I normally force myself to never let a book go unfinished, but this one just wasnt worth the effort. I'm sorry to say that I think my days of Garwood are over."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Maybe it's that I didn't read the two (or is it three?) books that came before this one in the series, but I just didn't enjoy Castles. I love Julie Garwood, so not liking this book won't stop me from reading more of her work, but it's hard to imagine how someone who can be write so well can sometimes just write so badly. Maybe this is one of the earlier novels. That might explain the fact that every action is meticulously detailed from start to finish. Princess flees convent for England. Princess's guardian falls ill. Princess must stay with guardian's son. Princess must get married. It was like reading one of those See Jane Run books, and I'm a bit too old for those now. The characters themselves were well developed and likeable despite the fact that the story was predictable and boring. Oh well. I still love Garwood, but I'm recommending The Bride and Honor's Splendour way before this one..."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Okay, I won't get into the plot, because it's been done. I just read the Gift, and was just about through with Miss Garwood. Castles was a major improvement. Colin was stubborn enough to be interesting, but likeable and charming enough to make me root for him. He was sexy and powerful, yet his injury made him more human. All other Garwood heroes that I've read (except for Royce in The Prize) seem to be a little too close to perfect physically. Alesandra, our heroine, was a generic heroine who was too perfect to be real. The woman had no flaws, and that irritated me.The period was glamorized but nothing blatantly inaccurate jumped out at me (it was has to be pretty bad for me to care) so I was fine with it. The mystery was weak, and she should have just skipped it.Overall, nothing special, but it's worth your time, and you'll walk away entertained."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Princess Alesandra is exactly the gal to domesticate the work driven, suave confirmed bachelor, Colin. The suspenseful anticipation of their sensual saga is just why romance novels are loved.Be sure to read the entire series: 1. The Lion's Lady 2. The Guardian 3. The Gift 4. Castles"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I gave this book 3 stars in deference to the author, who's usually great, and because the hero, Colin, is linked with other great characters from JG's books. I couldn't wait to read this, but it ended up being a little boring. There was nothing outstanding about it. The princess was a very good character, though. She had a lot of personality.If anyone who reads this book doesn't enjoy it, and hasn't read THE LION'S LADY, GUARDIAN ANGEL, and THE GIFT, don't despair. Those are fantastic!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I love this book and all I can say is read it and find out for yourself how fab this book is. Both characters are great and funny and romanitc...."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is one of my favorite Garwood books. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I loved this book! I read the whole thing from page to page without one minute of boredom. Some books i find myself skipping paragraphs but not this one! The love that grew between Colin and Alesandra was well written and I loved how she molded her characters...this is my first book that i have read from Garwood - I plan on reading alot more! :)"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have read all of Garwood's books, and like the others this one is also magnificent. The story, the characters, and how she flows the story of this book from Guardian Angel and The Gift was terrific. Everything just comes together(From all 3 novels). Nothing is confusing. I recommend this book to all readers. All of Garwood's books deserve 10 stars and more."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I did like this book, but I've read better. The story was great, but I guess the writing wasn't her greatest. I do plan to read it again because sometimes I might like the book more if I read it agian."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"The story is very funny and sad too. You can really feel how Princess Alesandra feels. I think it's a splendid book!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"The characters were charming. Julie Garwood is at her best. The 3 books in the series are great a must read. The women are all so different and seem to fit within that time period, when a woman had to keep her brains a secret. Julie please write more books about the ton."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Everyone just mentions two other books with this one, &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; and &quot;The Prize&quot; but even before those two, &quot;Lyons Lady&quot; is a MUST read. It all ties in more beautifully then."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"THE CULPRIT IN THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY EVIL AND THAT GAVE THIS BOOK AN UNUSUAL TWIST. I LOVED HOW PRINCESS ALESANDRA MADE A LIST FOR EVERYTHING EVEN THE THINGS SHE DID NOT LIKE ABOUT HER HUSBAND. I RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE READ IT. I HAVE ALL HER OTHER BOOKS AND THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD. ANOTHER OF MY FAVORITES IS THE BRIDE. END"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Definitely one of her best! Castles captures that special emotion deep inside you and leaves no hearts untouched, no eyes dry and no lives unattached. The characterization is great, the conversation - funny and witty. Garwood can really grab our attention if she wants to. I can attest to Castles. I love that book!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I, as other readers, was also persuaded to read Ms. Garwood by other reviewers. This is my second Julie Garwood, and I'm determined it will be my last for the following reasons:(1)The plot is sketchy and contrived, and the regency period is not portrayed in a realistic manner, even by romance novel standards.(2)While I appreciate wealthy and titled characters that treat their servants kindly and have enjoyed many novels in which the serving class characters have made major contributions to the story, I had a hard time getting into the story because I felt that the way Ms. Garwood portrayed the relationships between the butler and the main characters was simply ridiculous (the hero asked the butler to call him by his first name, the butler was extremely nosy and treated visitors as if they came to see him, etc. etc.) Instead of finding this funny or endearing, I found it irritating and disruptive.(3) The relationship between the hero and the heroine lacked sensual tension and depth. It was very easy for them to suddenly discover that they loved each other, which made finishing the novel and unexciting chore. I had to FORCE myself to finish it and it took me forever.(4) The suspense/mystery subplot seems to be there as a way to lengthen the book, but I knew from the beginning who the evil villain was, so this didn't help to dispell the boredom.(5) How realistic is it, even by 21st century standards, for a husband to take his wife into his lap in front of visitors? I found that the public displays of affection, in the Regency period no less, took me out of the action. While I extremely enjoy characters who demonstrate their passion and love to each other, I felt that this was not the way to do it.In summary, if you like romance novels with a pinch of historical realism, character development, plot depth, and really intelligent characters who communicate in a sensical manner, Castles is not the book for you. On the other hand, if you like fluffy, juvenile novels that could have been written by a teenager for a tenager, enjoy."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This book is an excellent romance. It will captivate you the moment you read the first page. It has a wonderful plot with truly terrific characters. The minute you start to read you will not want to stop. It is a superb romance with a little mystery. This book has left me in awe. I think Julie Garwood is a fantastic author and really out did herself this time. I can not wait to read more of her books. If you want to read a funny romance/mystery this is definetly the book for you."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have been a huge fan of Julie Garwood since I first read Saving Grace (also a fabulous book). I really like the connections between the characters of this book and her others (Guardian Angel, The Gift). But I would like to add that there is another book to this series that takes place before Caine and Jade in GA. It's &quot;The Lion's Lady&quot;, which I highly recommend. But in Castles, like her others, she brings the characters to life, and you feel all their emotions with them. And every time you read them, you discover something new."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was the frist book by Julie Garwood that I have read. After I've finished reading it I started looking for other books that were written by her. Castles is so well written that it keeps you turning the pages to see what would happen next.

This really spiced-up the story. Julie Garwood's writing is inspirational."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"CASTLES is one of my all time favorite books. I don't think that anyone could ever write a book as good or better than Ms. Garwood did with this book. Exceptional!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I loved the book. This was the first book I read by her and I immediately feel in love with her work."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Once again I was not dissapointed by the efforts of Julie Garwood. This tale bring together again all of the characters I have come to love in Lion's Lady, The Gift and Guardian Angel. The characters are so real I feel like I know them. I applaud her talent and hope to see more of these characters in the future. I am not a big book buyer but I will own all four of these stories in the near future so I can escape to them again and again."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I always enjoy reading Julie Garwood. This book is appealing because Alexandra is intelligent, clever, and down to earth even though she's a princess. She holds her own with the men in this book but also endears herself to the women she meets. The plot line is obvious but doesn't keep you from enjoying the book. Her relationship with Colin and his family is the important thing. I love Julie Garwood's style of writing."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was the first romance novel that I ever read, and I must say that it got me hooked. I loved all the characters (except Morgan). This book made me laugh, made me cry, and kept me entertained right up till the very end. I can not praise this book, and Julie Garwood, high enough. You have GOT to read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Alright, this is a wonderful story. For two reasons, Colin and Alesandra. I could really see where the herione was coming from, she is strong and smart two redeeming qualities for a female character to have. Colin is every woman's dream. A gentelman, handsome and just a tad bit arrogant. I loved his character and I believe that a man should love and protect his wife. Read this book you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Before reading Castles, I suggest to start with the Lion's Lady, then The Guardian Angel, The Gift and lastly, read Castles. The characters in all 4 books are friends/related to each other. It is more fitting if you know each character before reading the next book. If you read it in this order, I think it will bring more excitement as some questions are answered on the later book. Some secrets are also revealed beforehence.Castle is a story of Colin, who is the younger brother of Caine (in The Guardian Angel) and a troubled Princess Alesandra, who is the ward of the Duke of Williamshire, Colin and Caine's father. Alesandra was searching for a good husband in three weeks time, to save her from marrying a ruthless General, who wanted to marry her only for the throne. I find the search very enjoyable. The list of every noble and available earls and Dukes names... and of course, the dipping of ink to cross each one off, as Colin finds each name in the list horrobly inappropriate. This is my favorite part. I find the herione funny yet unselfsih, charming and regal. Even in her frustrations and anger, mostly of Colin, she manage to remind herself &quot;Dignity &amp; Decorum&quot;. She is afterall a princess. Her obsession of LISTING everything in a notecard is also quite amusing. Colin is a proud yet somewhat a sensitive man. The best way to describe him is to compare him to a wild horse that needed to be tamed. Alesandra did just that with love and patience. Flannagan, the butler, is also one of my favorite character in this book. The Romance between the two is perfectly match. There are just so many interesting and funny scenes. I don't want to give it all away so you have to pick up the book to find out yourself. It is worth your time. The whole family helping each other to solve a mystery crime is also thrilling and heart warming. Although, i wished Nathan and Jade (in the Gift), Lyon and Christina (in The Lion's Lady) are mentioned more in this book, I still love it and will keep it in my collection. I have reread it more than once and still have the same reactions."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Julie Garwood's Castles is my favorite romance novel. It's also the first Garwood romance I ever read (several years ago). What makes it shine so bright? Incredible humor, fabulous love scenes, and characters so very easy to love. All that, and a princess too!Some readers find Garwood's heroines too stupid to live, but I never have. I do, however, find each's quirks to be lovable, and when I interviewed the author back in 1997 and she revealed their flaws are based on her own, I marveled at how she could turn personal weaknesses into delightful quirks of character.The heroine is not only wonderful in this book, though - the hero is to-die-for. As I wrote in my Desert Isle Keeper Review at All About Romance, &quot;While he doesn't want to marry her himself, he finds something wrong with every single bachelor he, his father, his brother, and Alesandra discuss. One has bow-legs, another gambles, and still another has a case of 'bad humours'.&quot;This is truly a delightful and charming romance and I encourage one and all to read it. If you are like me, you'll end up with two copies - one to keep and one to lend out to friends.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I found this book in the trash and it looked somewhat intriguing so I decided to see what it was all about. I started reading it and could not put it down until I finished it. The character were cleverly written and Julie's incredible gift for writing shined throughout the entire novel. I fell in love with her from that moment on and did not rest until I owned every single Julie Garwood title that was available! Sure enough I also loved every single other book that shes written and I can never seem to wait until she writes another. I reread everyone of her books at least once a month and her books have enriched my life ten-fold. Julie you are surely a treasure that needs to be better appreciated!Thank you for everything that you have inadverantly done for me!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Rarely have I ever met a book so god-awful I wanted to shoot myself in the face before I could finish. This one takes the proverbial cake. After page 190 (halfway?) when the hero and heroine talk through their first sexual encounter (and I finally stopped deluding myself that the story would pick up)-- I just had to go online to see what other people thought of it. I was fully prepare to relish the cutthroat reviews I was sure this book deserved, so you can imagine my suprise at finding pages and pages of \\"this book is great!\\"....I don't understand this phenomenon. Can someone please explain? Because I certainly have a \\"list\\" of grievances.For starters, Julie Garwood's prose is terrible. Her ENTIRE book is comprised of \\"she did this,\\" \\"then he did that,\\" \\"and she said this.\\" \\"then he said that.\\" The result is a dialogue that is so painfully dull, it makes me wince everytime someone calls her characters \\"witty.\\"Not to mention the slew of the words \\"certainly,\\" \\"terribly,\\" \\"at all,\\" slathered liberally across every other page. And while the word 'too' is great for including an extra thought, the author should probably be introduced to the words 'also,' 'moreover,' 'thus' etc.-- which might have saved the reader the complusion to slam their head on the table everytime the sentence structure \\"She was angry-- and furious too,\\" came up. Either that, or Garwood should stop adding extra thoughts. In fact, it would probably refine her writing.While most books can skate by poor writing with a decent plot. The book lacks even that. Besides for the confusion of genres incurred by opening the novel from a psycopath's narrative-- this psycopath pops up randomly throughout the continuing chapters as if to remind the reader \\"oh hey! i'm still here! Be terrified~! I just killed someone.\\" then leave again after his pointless update. I have yet to find out how he matters to the story in anyway-shape or form. Other than the fact he obviously has to due with the \\"dissapearances\\" throughout the story of minor characters. And by minor I mean-- undeveloped, sometimes nameless people. But that's ok, because the family of these victims are perfectly content to write off their loved one's \\"dissapearance\\" as an elopement they've obviously developed. They are so ashamed of it, that they never want to bring it up again. (as opposed to finding out what really happened to them, elopement or otherwise.)Alesandra and Colin may have been remotely interesting if Garwood had done a better job developing their characters. She introduces Alesandra as a rebellious, troublesome imp-- only to continue the story with Alesandra being a perfect angel of a woman. One has to wonder how the words \\"dignity and decorum\\" could render such a deep change in a character's personality. And Colin? He was an ogre.I do not find ogre's attractive.If you're interesting in something witty, with loveable and believable characters-- Julia Quinn is, hands down, the most witty author I've ever had the pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I read Guardian Angel and The Gift before I read this one and I really liked Colin more than the lead heroes in those books. I was really glad that he has his own story.Colin's a real charmer (and I mean that in a good way) but underneath that is his vulnerable side, the man who thinks he's not worthy of the princess because he doesn't have much to offer her.. not land, title, inheritance or a good and sound body. But he has ambition, determination, and pride to accomplish what he wants. He's far from perfect (unlike some other invincible heroes that has perfect everything) but his imperfections make him more lovable and endearing to me.Alessandra's very intelligent. I think she's the only heroine who knows anything about business. Other heroines show intelligence by knowing philosophy, literature, poetry, sports, marksmanship, etc. but she's the only I have read that knows anything about investment, book keeping and finance. Her knowledge makes her very useful to Colin and I think this is the closest thing to a job that a titled Regency lady ever had.The plot for me is OK, the mystery's something I can do without, but I really like the characters and their interaction with one another and that makes Castles a very good romance novel for me."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is probably my favorite Julie Garwood book. It is the 3rd book of a series. The first book, Guardian Angel, is about Colin's brother Caine. The second book, The Gift, about Colin's partner Nathan. But this book surpasses both of them. Colin is afraid to love Alessandra because he feels he is not good enough for her because she is a princess. He marries her out of family obligation and because there is a cruel man after Alessandra's title and fortune. Only after he almost loses her, does he realize how much he loves her and how deserving he is of her love. You will read this book over and over. It is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was the book that I've been waiting for ever since I read Lion's Lady, Guardian's Angel and The Gift. Without a doubt, Julie Garwood has outdone herself once again. Alesandra and Colin are such adorable characters. The scenes spun from Garwood's words leaped out from the book and surrounded me as I quickly turned the pages. If you enjoy passion, fire, and tender moments, this book, along with all Julie Garwood books, is definitely a wonderful, unregretable investment!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"\\"Let me get understand this, a princess just decided to take up residence with us?\\"The hero is a hardworking second son determined to build an empire for himself without the aid of his loving father (a duke) and protective brother (a marquess). He's a kind sort, decent fellow who's been betrayed before yet isn't bitter... just determined to prove himself even if it means living his days as a solitary workhorse.But one night he comes home, finds guards in his home and his young butler telling him his father has sent a beautiful princess to his home, sleep in his bed, and become his temporary ward.Allesandra is all alone in the world since her mother died and left her to be raised by nuns in a convent bordering her home. She aspired to be dignified and what a princess should be, but despite being a dutiful ward and sweet soul she has a head for business and a heap of political intrigue.This is a marriage of convenience story but one driven by a sweet desire, a bond of family honor, and two people who are so goodhearted they deserve a fairytale ending.Now the mystery elements are lacking. It pretty much exists as the villain's thoughts sprinkled throughout in obtrusive ways to the main story. The political intrigue is allowed to just dry up midway through the story. At the very least there could have been a followup on that insurance policy.Yet it's pleasant to see the other sequel characters in this story. I just wish Garwood hadn't made so many niggly mistakes with her own story facts. (First it is the Frenchman and his daughter who are killed and then it is the Frenchman and his sister.)"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I am unabashedly a Julie Garwood fan. I have read this little gem before and loved it ~~ and when I found it at the local book exchange, I had to read it again. And while it's sweetly predictable ~~ I still enjoyed it.This one focuses on Colin, the Duke's younger son, partner with Nathan in a shipping business and younger brother of Caine (of the famous Jade romance)and on Alessandra, a princess of an unnamed country. Alessandra was told to leave the convent where she had lived since her mother died to England to be with her guardian since the general of her country will try to kidnap her. The Duke, Colin's father, was sick and sent her to live with Colin and appointed him to be the guardian. And of course, sparks fly and soon, the princess and Colin were falling in love.There is mystery & intrigue as well as gentle romance (which I really like!) and witty repartee between the two lovers. It's a gentle read ~~ perfect for any time especially when you just want to relax. I have always loved Garwood's books since college years ~~ and this one is no exception.7-17-06"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have been reading Julie Garwood's novels for the past six years, and I love escaping with her books. They are always fun, unique, and they never let me down. Castles remains my number-one favorite of all her books. It's clever and funny, and the relationship between Colin and Alesandra is so romantic and endearing. And I love that Julie Garwood puts such strong emphasis in all her books on having morals, values, honor and loyalty. Her characters are always &quot;flawed to perfection&quot;, as Colin describes his princess in Castles. I especially love the fact, that unlike so many other romance novels I have unfortuneatly read, the relationship between Colin and Alesandra isn't soley based on lust. They have a real connection that the reader can actually feel, which is Amazing!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is not the same old Regencies with so much of the story being... The ton... Duke... Earl... Duchess... Marquess... It's something a bit different and I LOVED it. While I do love those stories, here is one that takes an average guy and makes him a Hero. Okay, Maybe Colin's not average, but very likeable. Alessandra is just as likeable. I especially like that she was so intelligent. I laughed outloud and loved this little tale."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"In the dead of the night, the sole surviving heiress to a great kingdom was escorted into England, into the care of the Duke of Williamshire, her guardian and a great friend of her beloved father. And with a greedy general intent on marrying her in hope of getting his hands on her vast fortune, Princess Alesandra knows that she must marry soon. For her guardian, what better way to repay his old friend than to offer his own son to the princess? The only trouble is - his son has a five-year-plan that doesn't include a wife.Colin was surprised to find the unexpected visitor in his townhouse. But his head reeled upon hearing the purpose of Alesandra's stay. Having vowed never to marry regardless of his father's constant nagging, he knows that he must get Alesandra out of his life before he succumbs to the intense attraction he feels for her. But when her life was threatened, the protector in him wins over and he finally agrees to marry her.From their first meeting, sparks fly between Colin and Alesandra. The undeniable attraction heats up the pages, and even their verbal spats show their intense attraction to each other. Alesandra is just wonderful - strong-willed, compassionate and very astute. You won't doubt her intelligence right from the start, and I loved how she was brought up very un-princess like. Colin is arrogantly sexy, but I loved how protective he is of those people he cared for. Sure, he started off stubborn, but we know that it wouldn't take long for him to come around.CASTLES, with its blend of mystery, romance and laughs, is a great way to finish off the series. I am so glad that Colin has found his princess and glad that Alesandra has broken the wall that he has built around himself ever since that tragic accident. Although the murder plot seemed rather pointless at times, the romance more than makes up for it that I truly didn't care about anything else.The other books in the series (in order) are: THE LION'S LADY, GUARDIAN ANGEL, and THE GIFT."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I loved this book. I mean I loved, loved, LOVED this book! It was so great to get the update on Nathan and Sara and Jade and Caine and Colin, well all I can say is--WHAT A MAN! I loved him and Alesandra and the chemistry between them fizzled up the pages! The only thing missing from this series is possibly a love interest for Catherine!!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Before reading this book first read &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; and then &quot;The Gift&quot; then read this book -- you will understand the characters better. This is a fine example of Julie Garwoods unique talent at writing an extremely enjoyable book. julie garwood makes the most of her heroins -- they make you laugh."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is a nice little book. Princess Alesandra goes to England to escape an almost insane general who wants to marry her. She goes to England to find her own husband so General Ivan would not be able to force her to marry him. In a roundabout fashion she marries Colin. Seperately these are two wonderful people and I liked how they worried about each other, but I hated Colin's high- handed methods. He was always ordering Alesandra what to do and what not to do. What I really hated though was that Alesandra always gave in. I like JUlie Garwood, but this is definitly not her best work. I like independent women who aren't submissive. Okay if you are really bored and not in the mood to yell at the characters stupidity."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Although most of Julie Garwoods books are are relatively the same, I still enjoy reading them, but I wish they changed a bit. Even the dialogue is the same. But nonetheless I enjoyed Castles very much it is one of my favorites. I especially loved Colin."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is the first Julie Garwood book I have ever read and I must say that I was quite appalled. The writing itself was not very good at all. Often the words were clumsily thrown together as though with no thought at all. There was extreme word overuse. The story was even worse. It is so unrealistic and unconvincing that the whole plot, or what could possibly be called a plot, is dull in the extreme. Alesandra is made out to be a rich, bumbling dullard while Colin is the suave and intelligent one who laughs at her mistakes. It makes me sick, because this is basically all the book is about. I do not recommend this as any sort of reading material, serious or just for fun."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was one of the first books that I read of hers and i have to say that it was one of the greatest!!! This book comes in a close second to my favorite Julie Garwood book. SAVING GRACE being the first."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Being a big fan of Julie Garwood and having read Lyon's Lady and Guardian Angel I looked forward to reading about Colin. I was extremely disappointed. Whereas the female characters in the previous two novels, Jade and Christina were very strong and interesting - challenging the respective heros in the novels, Alesandra was rather weak and suffered from a rather nondescript personality. After the promising beginning showing her as a problem to the convent, I expected a bit of non conformity from her, but instead was given a non descript not fully realized, rather weak individual. I'm still a Garwood fan, but couldn't even finish Castles."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This book captivated me. It was beautifully written and the characters couldn't be any better. It has great mystery and adventure. When Princess Alesandra was looking for a husband so it would help save her from the turmoil in her own land. Colin rejected at first, but inside he's been denying that he doesn't like her. Of course, everyone has gone through denial, but for Colin it's stubborn. He didn't even let her chose her own clothes. When Princess Alesandra was almost kidnapped by her own fellow countrymen, Colin came to save her. A murder has aroused in city and he worries that if he wouldn't solve it soon he might lose his angel. I think that this book is a must read and you will enjoy it very much. The suspense is very exciting, I hope you'll have fun reading it as I did..."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I am a longtime Garwood fan. I have every book she has ever published. This is one of the best. It is a MUST READ! Make sure to read the other two books in this trilogy, Guardian Angel(1) and The Gift(2)."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This story greatly disappointed me. The character of Princess Alesander has great similarity with Christina from the book titled &quot;Lion's Lady&quot;. Both make the hero confuse and make you laugh to read their act in trying to understanding the lady. It's fun for the first time fan. But not worth the time of a long time fan like me"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Absolutely hated this novel! I have read many good novels from Johanna Lindsley, Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux. They all write with such grace that reading this made me feel like it was a novel I should have been reading as a teen. The whole book lacked description and feeling. Julie didn't quite bring you into the story because of the lack of these things. I can only hope for her sack that her other books are written better than this one."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I couldn't stop laughing! Julie Garwood is one of my very favorite writers, I read all of her historical romance novels so far...actually, I read again and again!The plot is predictable, no great mystery there. However, the interaction of the characters, even the secondary ones like Colin's young butler, was always live and witty. One of my favorite scenes is when they try to make a list of candidates to wed Alesandra and Colin gets so work-up!The only thing I didn't understand is this whole story about HOW Colin and Nathan were betrayed. I have read the previous books in the series, Guardian Angel and The Gift. It was never really said how and who betrayed them...who shot Nathan and tortured him? And who was the woman involved? ((This doesn't really affect the story but for someone who read the books, you'd like to know))"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Wowza! This is one of my very favorite romances EVER! If you read Guardian Angel and The Gift before reading Castles, you will get an even bigger picture of Colin. And if you didn't already love in him the other stories, you will most definitely fall head over heels in love with him as I did. *fanning myself*Princess Alesandra is an adorable heroine, and I got such a kick out of her \\"doctoring\\" the books at the cloister, as well as the other mishaps. She is really an unintentional crack up, you will love her! And I also loved that she went to such great lengths to help Colin's leg feel better, most women would just leave him alone and she stood up to the plate.K, but back to Colin. I have a weakness for the whole pirate thing in the first place, but a pirate with a heart of gold...well, that's just too much! And their sexual encounters were so absolutely sizzling, I swear I held my breath the entire time. O-M-G! Julie Garwood is a master at creating great stories with hot lovin'! And I laughed so many times at the way Colin has to explain everything to Alesandra, that was hilarious. He is seriously everything a hot-blooded woman could ask for (and a cold blooded woman wouldn't be that way for long around him either!).Devinitely 10 stars out of 5! This is one to read over and over again, and DON'T LEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS!!! YOU WILL NOT GET IT BACK!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This is the sequel to the book The Gift (one of my favorite books). Princess Alesandra, fresh from the covent school, is transported to England in order to find a husband in attempt to keep herself safe from the advances of a power hungry dictator General bent on over-running her home country by capitializing on the love the citizens had for her and her old ruling family. She arrives to find her guardian, her father's best friend, is suffering an ailment and in order to prevent her becoming ill as well, he sends her to live at his son's house. Colin is a confirmed bachelor who is suprised to find a beautiful woman living in his house. He smells his father's matchmaking efforts from the beginning and immediately takes exception. Nevertheless he gets into the spirit of things and agrees to help her find a husband. However every fellow suggested is suddenly not good enough for her, and he finds himself fighting a powerful attraction...and burgeoning jealousy. I thought this was a lovely book. Good story."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Ok, so this story was not as good as The Gift but still good.Princess Alesandra had lived with nuns since she was 12. General Ivan, an insurgent from Alesandra's homeland, wants to marry her so he can take over the kingdom. So her guardian, her father's friend, The Duke of Williamshire, has requested her to come to London. After she arrives and is preparing to go the London for the season the family gets sick she has made important plans so she goes to Colin's house so that he can take over for the time being as her guardian. She feels that she must marry ASAP so that the threat of the general will end. She asks Colin to marry her and he says no because he has a 5 year plan and he can not get married before then. He is trying to make his shipping company successful and doesn't have time for a wife or anything else that doesn't involve work. Alesandra, a compulsive list-maker, makes a list of other men she could marry, but Colin doesn't like any of them and finds something wrong with each and every one of them. So he ends up marrying her and it turns out to be the best decision he has ever made.Alesandra is a very intelligent lady. She has got to be the smartest women in any of the books I have read so far. She really does not like the word obey and the way she reacts to certain things Colin has her do is funny.Colin is very strong and not really all that worried about loving someone, he just doesn't want to because it could ruin his plan. He is the second son and therefore doesn't have a title so all his efforts are on making a name for himself. The thing I like about him best was that he did not want his wife to obey him all of the time. He thought it was ridiculous that a wife had to vow to obey her husband, he thought it would get old and was very pleased Alesandra would not obey all the time. When her safety was in question, though, that was a different story.There was one thing that bothered me about this book. Alesandra would lose every thought whenever Colin kissed her but he was still in control. I do not mind it normally in other books because it shows the men having a hard time with their control also. It seemed that there weren't enough of his thoughts until the end. That bugged me because I was so looking forward to getting to know him, but was left disappointed. Maybe Julie Garwood did it on purpose but I did not like it. At the end when he opens up it is very sweet though and kinda made up for the lack of his thought.So even with that said it was still a good story and I would recommend reading it.Chrissy"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Castles is the very first Julie Garwood book that I read and I must say it is the reason why I got hooked with this author! It amazes me how well she describes the details on what's happening, where the characters are. It makes you feel transported to the date and time when the story happened. Her writing is simply amazing -- vivid descriptions, one can feel the emotions of the characters.Although the story's genre is historical romance, it is still very unique in its own way. The twists and highlights of the story are something that I have never encountered in any book that I have read. Definitely a good buy and a keeper!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I thought this books was a pleasure to read. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Alesandra and Colin before they got married. I wished Mrs. Garwood would have created a few more exciting incidents before the wedding. I laughed my head off over the part when Colin found something wrong with every one of the men mentioned to marry the princess. Too cute!! I think there were, however a few things that could have been explored to make this book better. The relationship between the General and Princess as well as her position as the only living heir to her country's thrown. I guess that dynasty goes by the wayside then? Maybe it will be resurrected through one of her children in a future book (I hope, that would present all sorts of possiblities for Mrs. Garwood).As always, I enjoyed this Garwood book. I just wish she would have made it a bit more exciting and suspenseful. She has yet to disappoint me, but this wasn't my top pick of her books. I would suggest Honor's Splendor (my all time favorite), the Wedding, the Gift, or the Prize."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"heres the thing, the book was really enchanting and everything! the main character needed some backbone...every other word to colin was \\"do i displease u?\\" and then garwood made colin into this arrogant one, i mean, really.....u should really seriously not read this book if u cant stand a woman not holding her own, i mean, it was really really frustrating! but im a romantic at heart, and this book did really capture romance so i guess it was worth [price], but, it definitely would not be my favorite... all in all, this was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"While Colin made me melt as I read this at 3:30 am ( I couldn't put it down) I found him to be a little irritating. While men are classically known for their stubbornness, Colin took it to a new degree. He seemed almost two faced... he didn't trust Alesandra with anything. However, they were an adorable couple. I wish Alesandra would have asserted more of that bed room behavior, she was a good dominator! I can't wait to read &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, because face it, Caine was sexy too :-) A good read, definately worth picking up!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was the first book I read by this author and it cemented her in my collection as one of the greatest authors I've ever read. The story line is one that I cherished for a long time and have read over and over and over. The main characters, Colin and Alexandria are endearingly written so that you love them to bits and are thoroughly exasperating at the same time. They are almost like family. Also included in the novel are the characters from her past books, Lions Lady, and Jade. This was one of my favorite parts of her writing. You get a feeling of congruity like with a soap opera. The story is written in a style that is innocent and funny. It gives you the feeling that you are in on a secret. You are part of their clan. This is one of those books that makes you feel good when you read it and makes you want to read more when you've finished."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This was the first romance novel I ever read and I LOVED IT! I totally fell in love with the characters and I went on to buy all of Garwood's books and have loved them all but this is definitely my favorite. I've read it a million times! You can't put it down."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"As usual, Julie Garwood delivers. The romance, intrigue and humor usually found in her books is just as prevalent in this book, too. One can never go wrong purchasing a book by Julie Garwood if you're a fan of historical romance. The only drawback to this book, like all the others, is I can't put it down, and finish it much to quickly!!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Love the mixture of romance and mystery. Always a surprising ending. Julie garwood is one of my favorite authors. I will definitely continue this series and many more...."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Love Julie Garwood her books always have well developed characters, good plot lines and happy endings. What else can ask of a love story. The sex is usually not graphic."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"We all know why we read these...and don't get me wrong, I do like novels where the woman is a little ahead of her time, and this one does have a story line as such, however, the romance just goes along with little to no anticipation and build. Became boring very quickly."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I discovered Julie Garwood not too long ago. I started with The Bride and got hooked after that. Castles doesn't disappoint. The pace is good and that is very important to me. The h/h are great and keeps the book interesting. This is a series but can be a stand alone. Although I have not read the book before this, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Julie Garwood knows how to give her characters enough spunk and keep it lighthearted.Needless to say, I will continue to be a Garwood fan."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"It was a bit mysterious at first but then it became a love story and also a who done it! Liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Updated characters, sex and plot. Very enjoyable. Good plot with excitement within the story. A fun read. I was so pleased with the author I'm checking out her other books on my Kindle. It seems that the Kindle price rises each time I really enjoy an author. I'm looking forward to reading a contemporary book of Julie Garwood now."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I had to smile as I read this book, because Colin (our hero) was a little \\"too\\" perfect. However, the plot made me forget this, and I realized his pigheadedness was indeed his flaw. I loved Alesandra, and the way she managed to organize her life, despite the men in it. The author kept one engaged and although I guessed who the bad guy was, I still wanted to read the story and see how it unfolded. It's a good read, and I'd like to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This book was so WONDERFUL! You will NOT regret getting it at the least. BEst book of all times a must have for sure"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Julie Garwood has been my favorite author for about 15 years she has never disappointed me. Castles is my all time favotite book .This book is very well written. and historically accurate . A heart warming tale ."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Typical Julie Garwood, Castles' heroine Alesandra exhibits the ultimate in feminity, intelligence, exceptional loyalty and protective instincts. No matter what Garwood novel you read, you can always find the character is depicted as what we all would like to be.Isn't it nice to emerge ourselves in the situations where we root for the heroine and understand her reasoning and motives? The supporting characters play strong and important parts in the story and you secretly hope many of them will inspire a separate story of their own.The brothers Caine and Colin, the shipping partner Nathan and the sisters-in-law all reach out for you to know them better ... The Guardian Angel, The Gift.Have bought all the Julie Garwood titles available and secretly hope for a follow-up to Saving Grace.If you want to come away with a feeling of contentment and satisfaction, a smile on your face, when you finish reading, Julie Garwood will always fit the bill.I started reading historical romance novels with Saving Grace in 1990 and haven't stopped since. Please, Julie, keep the novels coming, especially those with a Scottish theme."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have read thousands of romances and I can tell you that this one has it all: great comedy, an incredible romance, and a little mystery to boot. I cannot remember having laughed so much since reading Judith McNaught's \\"Until You,\\" which I consider one of the most enjoyable romances ever. The scene where Colin could not agree on any of the suitors that were being considered as a husband for Alessandra was hilarious and very reminiscent of a similar scene in \\"Until You.\\" Colin had a great sense of humor and Alessandra was so naive when it came to certain issues such as sex that it kept me in stitches. As usual with Garwood, the bedroom scenes were hot, hot, and hotter! It's definitely an all nighter. If you loved \\"Until You\\", you will surely enjoy this incredible book that is full of my favorite things!"},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I have read many of Julie Garwood's books, and this is one of my favorites (the Bride is my other). I thought the character's were well developed. I liked that Alesandra wasn't a wimp and was intelligent to boot. Colin's sense of humor was just perfect even though he wasn't. The book was a fast read, I couldn't put it down and read it in one night. There was not a lull at all in the story. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"I've read the other 2 books in this series, Guardian Angel and The gift, and i thought they were great, but this one, though good, isn't as captivating. Half way through i found myself thinking that the characters didn't interest me much, which was a shame cause i loved the glimpses we got of colin in the other books. i didn't like the additions at the ends of the chapters where we got the thoughts of the murderer, it was all so contrived and right from the time you met him you knew who it was. Keep it simple, please. But it was still pretty good, i don't think she can write a bad book."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"This book is the 4th in a series, but can also be read as a stand alone. It does visit characters from the previous books, but not to a point where a reader would be lost.Princess Alesandra's father and mother married for love.

Alesandra and her mother go to live at a convent where her mother is taken ill and soon dies as well.Alesandra grows up in the convent where she is looked at as a trouble maker. She means well.

There is a General after her to make her his wife so that he can gain power over her country.A long ago friend of her fathers steps in to take guardianship of Alesandra and to help her find a husband.Her guardian soon falls ill, along with the rest of the family so she is sent to stay with his son, Colin until everyone is well.Alesandra is a fun character who is dying to marry for love, but is being forced to marry for necessity. Colin is a man who doesn't want to marry until his 5 year plan of success is complete.Soon, they are married... :)Colin is a man with some issues physically as well as mentally.Alesandra is someone who craves love.I liked the characters very much. Thought they were well suited to eachother and enjoyed Colin and the way he finds humor in his wifes antics. He is the typical 1800's male, he has definate ideas as to a womans place. But he is also very caring and tender with his wife.The Butler in this book is great. He practically worships the Princess.One of my issues with this book was that the 'mystery' was a little boring. The other one was I didn't understand why the guardian left her in the convent for so many years. Ms. Garwood never really explains that.All in all this was a very enjoyable read. I've read it twice and will probably read it again."},{"Title":"Castles","review":"Aaah but don't'cha just love these handsome, arrogant, big Alpha men that JG gives us to slobber over? &lt;sigh> And WHERE does JG retreat to..to dream up these wonderful stories? She usually doesn't fail to deliver...however this story isn't par for the course. Even though it was a fantastic plot full of romance (but of course m'dear!)..mystery, intrigue, adventure and murder...we're left with two sub-plots...One concerning the mysterious and, (we're told) evil General Ivan from some unknown Country (can anyone give us a frikkin' clue?)...and a serial killer run amok.I loved Princess Alesandras' character...but found it odd that this woman of high intelligence acted..at times, like the perfect ditz. hmmmm...Just didn't make a whole lotta sense. ok, movin'on...Colin was always true to his character and never lets us down, all the while dealin' with a painful injury and comin' to grips with so many life altering changes suddenly tossed in his lap...tryin' to trip up his plans to build a Shipping empire...and even though this story had me sayin' \\"huh\\"? to myself a couple'a times and was...at times...somewhat predictable...I gotta admit I still found it quite enjoyable and definitely worth the time/effort. I dunno...maybe I just need a life!?!All the secondary characters; Caine/Jade, Nathan/Sara, butlers, parents & siblings are all brought back for a thoroughly delightful dialogue with humorous situations regardless of a serial killer lurking in the shadows."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},U={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},O={key:1};function H(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",U,[(e(!0),t(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",O,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const E=d(L,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-802f1c97"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/49.md","filePath":"library/49.md"}'),M={name:"library/49.md"},q=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(E)]))}});export{R as __pageData,q as default};
